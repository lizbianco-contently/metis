Mr. President, there have been a lot of issues brought up \non the floor of the Senate recently, and two that seem to be front and \ncenter\n\n[[Page S1322]]\n\nare the health care reform bill and questions related to our national \ndebt and the annual deficits we run into.\n  I have listened as many on the other side of the aisle have come to \nthe floor and argued to do two things: first, kill the health care \nreform bill, and second, reduce our Nation's debt. Unfortunately, that \nis a mixed message, an inconsistent message, and it is one that really \ndefies logic. We know the increasing cost of health care is adding to \nthe expenses of the Federal Government, State governments, and local \ngovernments. If we do not do something to suppress, if not reduce, the \ncost of health care, we are going to see a dramatic increase in our \ndeficits.\n  The bill before us attempts to create mechanisms to start bringing \ndown the increase in the cost of health care. Anyone who would stand \nbefore you and say, well, if you pass health care reform, next year's \nhealth care premiums are going to go down, I do not think is telling \nthe truth. I think it is likely they would go up. But what we are tying \nto do is slow the rate of increase. If the rate of health care \ninflation were the same as inflation in general, it would be a major \nstep forward to come to grips with a real problem facing America.\n  I have told the story on the floor about a local town in Illinois \nthat spends 10 percent of its small budget--a $20 million annual \nbudget--on health care premiums, and they have just been notified that \nnext year the premiums on about 200 employers will go up 83 percent for \nhealth care. That is one small town, Kankakee, IL. The same thing is \ntrue in the State of Illinois with our State budget, where we face a \nfiscal crisis and the costs of health care, in the Medicaid Program in \nparticular, continue to go up because of high unemployment. People who \nlose their health insurance at work turn to Medicaid, and it creates a \ngreater burden for the State and Federal Government. So as the economy \nstruggles and people lose their jobs, we have to view health care \nreform as part of the answer not only to family challenges and business \nchallenges but challenges that face us at the Federal level as well.\n  Health care costs take up a growing share of Federal and State \nbudgets. In the year 2009, we spent an estimated $2.5 trillion on \nhealth care, consuming 17.3 percent of our gross domestic product. That \nis the sum total of all goods and services produced in America. It \nrepresents the largest 1-year increase in the health share of gross \ndomestic product since we first started tracking it in 1960. If we do \nnot pass health care reform to try to slow this rate of growth, the \ndeficits each year will get worse. So those who come to the floor and \nsay, kill health care reform, balance the budget, are really preaching \nan inconsistent message. It does not work. If we can reduce just \nslightly the annual increase in Federal spending on Medicare and \nMedicaid, we can see positive changes when it comes to our annual \ndeficits.\n  Economists agree. Twenty-three leading economists, including Nobel \nlaureates and those who have served both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations, identified four key measures that will lower cost and \nreduce long-term deficits. Health insurance reform includes all four of \nthose measures--deficit neutrality, an excise tax on highest cost \nhealth insurance plans, an independent Medicare advisory board, and \ndelivery system reforms.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has scored the health care reform \nbill and says it will actually--at least the Senate version--reduce the \nbudget deficit by $130 billion or more over the first 10 years and by \n$1.3 trillion over the next 10 years. We are waiting for the latest \nscore of the bill, which could be forthcoming in the next day or two, \nbut we hope it indicates the same thing.\n  To fail to pass health care reform is to invite higher deficits in \nthe future. We cannot have it both ways. You cannot stop the effort to \nbring down health care costs--at least the rate of increase in health \ncare costs--and then preach fiscal conservatism. It just does not work. \nThose two messages are inconsistent.\n  In terms of the use of the reconciliation procedure in the Senate to \npass parts of health care reform, it is not a process that is unknown \nto us. Over 20 times we have used reconciliation to deal with major \nissues facing America. In fact, the Republican side of the aisle has \nused the process much more frequently than the Democratic side of the \naisle. The programs that have been affected by reconciliation have \noften included Medicare and COBRA and the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. In fact, when President Bush wanted to pass his tax cuts for \nwealthy people, he used the reconciliation program and the Republicans \nsupported it.\n\n  Reconciliation has been used three times by the Republicans to \nactually increase the deficit. Out of 22 times reconciliation has been \nused since 1981, Republicans used it to increase our national deficit \nat least three times, all of those instances during President Bush's \nadministration. In 2001, reconciliation was used to pass extensive and \ncostly tax breaks, many of them benefiting the very wealthy. Those tax \nbreaks increased the deficit by $552 billion over 5 years--Republicans \nusing reconciliation to give tax cuts to the wealthy and increase the \ndeficit. Reconciliation was used again in 2003 for tax breaks. Those \nbreaks resulted in adding to the deficit $342.9 billion in red ink over \n5 years. Finally, reconciliation was used in the year 2005 to extend \nthe tax breaks. That extension--that Republican reconciliation bill--\nincreased the deficit by $70 billion over 5 years.\n  The health care reform bill we are considering will give middle-\nincome families the largest tax cut in history. What the Republicans \nfail to mention is that the money we are raising in health care \nreform--almost $500 billion--will flow back to middle and lower income \nfamilies and small businesses to help them pay health care premiums. \nKilling health care reform, which is the agenda on the other side of \nthe aisle, will deny these tax breaks and assistance to businesses and \nfamilies struggling to pay health care premiums that are going up.\n  We know America's business community will save under this approach \nand more Americans will be insured. The health care reform bill we are \npromoting will bring into coverage 30 million Americans currently \nuninsured. When the Republicans were asked: How many will you bring \ninto coverage, they said 3 million. Well, let me tell my colleagues, 30 \nmillion paying Americans, people who show up for care at hospitals and \ndoctors' offices and actually have insurance is not only peace of mind \nfor them but also stops the transfer of their expenses to other people. \nWe currently provide charitable care for those who have no insurance \nand pass the costs on to everyone else. It is estimated that each of us \nhas a hidden, indirect tax of $1,000 a year in health care premium \ncosts to make certain we provide for the uninsured. The approach we are \npromoting in health care reform will provide coverage for these 30 \nmillion and will stop this cost shifting and this hidden tax on \nfamilies across America.\n  Let me also say the provisions in this bill that are the most \nobjectionable to the Republican side of the aisle mirror the health \ninsurance available to Senators and Congressmen today. We have a plan, \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, administered by the \nFederal Government--I guess we could call it a government-run plan, \neven though they are private insurance companies--and it requires \nminimum coverage in every plan so we know we will get protection. I \nhaven't found any Republican Senator willing to step up and say, That \nis socialism; we shouldn't do it; I am going to cancel my Federal \nEmployees Health insurance. Not one. They live with it. I live with it \nevery day in protecting myself and my family. I believe it is fair. I \nbelieve every American and every business should be given this \nopportunity. The insurance exchanges offer to America what we as \nMembers of Congress have enjoyed as an institution for over 40 years. \nIf it is socialism to put it in this bill, then I hope my friends on \nthe other side will stand up and personally condemn this socialism by \ndropping their Federal Employees Health coverage. That will be proof \npositive of their genuineness on this issue.\n  Let me say as well in closing that many of the people who have come \nto the floor and suggested that reconciliation is some renegade \nprocedure that is seldom used in the Senate have ignored the obvious. \nThe fact that it has\n\n[[Page S1323]]\n\nbeen used 22 times more often by Republicans than Democrats tells the \nstory.\n  I see on the floor the minority leader, the Republican leader Senator \nMcConnell. He has voted for 13 of 17 reconciliation bills during his \ntime in the Senate. He did not consider this procedure objectionable on \n13 different occasions when he voted for it. Senator Kyl, who is my \ncounterpart on the Republican side, the Republican whip, has voted for \n11 out of 11 reconciliation bills during the time he has been in the \nSenate. In fact, every time reconciliation was used, the Republican \nwhip voted for it. Senator McCain has voted for reconciliation 9 out of \n13 times since he has served in the Senate. It is a process that has \nbeen used repeatedly by both parties for major decisions: Health care \ncuts, COBRA insurance for the unemployed, children's health insurance, \nto name a few. It is something we acknowledge under our rules, and if \nit is part of the solution of bringing health care reform to an up-or-\ndown vote--at least this aspect of it to an up-or-down vote--it should \nbe a process that most Republicans are familiar with because most of \nthem have voted for it repeatedly.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1323-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the American people are looking at what \nis going on in Washington right now and they are wondering what the \nWhite House and Democratic leaders in Congress could possibly be \nthinking. The fact that we are still even talking about a health care \nbill that raises costs, increases premiums, and increases government \nspending is a complete mystery to most people. Americans have issued \ntheir verdict on this bill. They don't want it. It is that simple.\n  That is to say nothing of the process. The process that Democratic \nleaders have used to try to pass this bill is viewed even less \nfavorably than the bill itself. So even if Americans supported the \nbill--which they clearly don't--they would still want the process \ncleaned up. Americans expect lawmakers to be completely up front and \ntransparent about any changes they are thinking about making to the \nhealth care system.\n  Americans also expect a level playing field. That means union leaders \ndon't get special deals that nonunion members don't. It means the \npeople of Nebraska don't get a free ride bought and paid for by the \nrest of the country. Even Nebraskans are telling us they don't want \nthat kind of special treatment. It means if you are a senior citizen, \nyou don't have to move to Florida to keep your health care plan. It \nmeans that Louisianans don't get a windfall of Federal money because \none of their Senators was willing to vote for a bill most Americans \noverwhelmingly oppose.\n  These are just some of the things Americans don't like about the way \nDemocratic leaders are trying to push their bill through Congress and \npast the public. But they didn't much like the way the bill was put \ntogether either. They didn't like the fact that members of both parties \nspent endless hours negotiating and in committee meetings, only to see \nDemocratic leaders write their own bill behind closed doors. These are \nthe kinds of things Americans have been complaining about at townhall \nmeetings and in statewide elections for months and months. These are \nthe kinds of things the people of Massachusetts were saying in January. \nAmericans can't believe that after all this--after a year of protests \nand all of the statewide elections--Democratic leaders are still \nstubbornly pushing the same bill and the same process.\n  Democratic leaders knew the public didn't support their bill, so they \ntried to jam it through on a party-line vote. When they had trouble \nwith that strategy, they went for the kickbacks and special deals. As a \nresult, they lost their 60-vote majority. So they came up with another \nstrategy. They tried to get around the normal routes. They decided they \nwould try to jam it through with a bare partisan majority, something \nthat has never been done before on legislation of this magnitude.\n  Some in the media are blaming the resistance the administration and \nDemocratic leaders have faced on the White House messaging machine. \nThat is absolutely absurd. Americans aren't rejecting this bill because \nthey don't understand it. They are rejecting it because they know \nexactly what is in it.\n  Democratic leaders continue to deceive themselves. I saw the Speaker \nsaid yesterday Congress needs to pass this bill so Americans can see \nwhat is in it. Let me say that again. The Speaker said Congress needs \nto pass this bill so Americans can find out what is in it. That is like \ntelling somebody they have to buy a house so they can walk through it.\n\n  The White House seems to be throwing out every idea it has, hoping \nsomething will stick. The President is expected to highlight fraud and \nabuse in a speech today. I am glad the administration wants to use the \nenforcement power of the government to find and prosecute fraud, but \nthat is something we can and should be doing already--right now. Do we \nneed to pass a $2.5 trillion spending bill, raise taxes, and slash \nMedicare to go after fraud and abuse? I think not.\n  Finding waste, fraud, and abuse is one of the areas where we have \nagreement. Senators Grassley, Coburn, Cornyn, LeMieux, and others have \nbeen leading this effort for quite some time. Tackling fraud and abuse \nis one of the issues that can and should form the basis of a \nbipartisan, step-by-step approach to health care reform, not as a \nhook--not as a hook--to drag this monstrous bill over the finish line.\n  On the contrary, Democratic leaders should leave this bill on the \nfield. Then we can talk about passing commonsense ideas such as \ntackling fraud and abuse on their own, one by one.\n  The fact is, this whole debate has devolved into a little bit of a \nfarce, and it might actually be funny if the stakes were not so high. \nAmericans don't know how else to say it. They don't want this bill. The \nAmerican people do not want this bill. They want the process cleaned up \nas well.\n  How much longer do Americans have to wait before Democratic leaders \nwill give up this partisan quest and agree to start over, to work \ntogether, out in the open, on the kind of commonsense reforms Americans \nwant? That is the question Americans are asking, and we owe them an \nanswer.\n  The American people aren't an obstacle to be circumvented. This is \ntheir health care system, not ours. It is time to end this partisan \neffort, listen to the people, and start over.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Owens from Fort Smith, AR. \nHis life of service to our Nation is a shining example of a true \nAmerican patriot.\n  Sergeant Owens lost his life while serving in eastern Afghanistan \nafter his transport vehicle came under fire by enemy forces. He was a \npart of the 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regimen, 101st Airborne \nDivision in Fort Campbell, KY. Previously, Sergeant Owens spent 14 \nmonths in Iraq serving with the A Battery, 1st Battalion, 56th Air \nDefense Artillery from Fort Bliss, TX. Sergeant Owens served both tours \nwith honor and distinction, earning numerous medals and awards, \nincluding two Army Commendation Medals, two Army Achievement Medals, a \nValorous Unit Award, the National Defense Service Medal, the Iraq \nCampaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army \nService Ribbon, and the Combat Action Badge.\n  An ardent athlete, talented student, and motorcycle aficionado, \nSergeant Owens lived his life of only 21 years with passion and \ndedication. Those who knew him describe him as a kind and easygoing man \nwho always had high standards for himself. He was the oldest of five \nchildren. He had been married to his wife Kaitlyn for just 6 weeks. \nDespite being a newlywed, Sergeant Owens did not hesitate to answer the \ncall of duty.\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\n  Sergeant Owens' family and friends said he joined the Army out of a \nsense of patriotism and took pride in serving his Nation. He devoted \nhis life to defending America and gave the ultimate sacrifice for the \ncountry he so deeply loved.\n\n  After this tremendous loss, Fort Smith, AK, is in the process of \nwaving off 200 airmen from the Air National Guard's 188th Fighter Wing \nas they head to Afghanistan, joining about 75 members of the 188th \nalready serving there. This will be the unit's first deployment with \nthe A-10 Thunderbolt II--also known as ``The Warthog''--since the 188th \nreceived the aircraft in April of 2007. Also, many of these guardsmen \nare part of the agribusiness development team. This unit will teach \nAfghans better farming, crop storage, and marketing practices in an \neffort to draw them away from poppy production and build a strong \neconomy. These Arkansans are picking up Sergeant Owens' mantle in the \nfight to create a more secure and stable Afghanistan and together their \nefforts will endure.\n  Today, I join all Arkansans in lifting up Sergeant Owens' wife \nKaitlyn, his parents Sheila and Keith and his siblings and friends and \nextended family and community of Fort Smith during this very difficult \ntime. Sergeant Owens may be gone, but his courage, valor, and \npatriotism will never be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1324-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1324-S1327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Senate health care \nbill and to talk a little bit about some of the issues related to that \nbill, in terms of financing and scoring and, to be very candid, about \nsome of the accounting gimmicks that try to hold this bill together. I \nwill be joined by Senator Wicker and Senator Barrasso in this colloquy. \nLet me get started.\n  If you start to study the bill, and for many of us who have served in \nother capacities--myself as Governor and as a mayor--the first thing \nyou want to do is ask yourself: Does it work? Is the financing of this \nbill such that it makes sense? Is it an honest portrayal of the income \nyou expect and the expenses you expect? Certainly, that is where I \nstart and, I suggest, many of my colleagues start.\n  The one thing about this health care bill that struck me immediately \nand struck others is, first of all, there are 10 years of tax \nincreases. They total over $\\1/2\\ trillion--a massive amount of tax \nincreases.\n  The second thing you see is, there are 10 years of Medicare cuts, \nagain about $\\1/2\\ trillion total. You do those things and some other \nthings and it pays for 6 years of spending because even though some of \nthe issues relative to this health care bill kick in initially, the \nvast majority of it does not kick in for 3 or 4 years.\n  When you put that all back together, you begin to realize what you \nhave is a health care bill that costs about $2.5 trillion over a 10-\nyear score.\n  Then you start working through a whole bunch of other issues. You \nhave a Senate bill that takes $52 billion in higher Social Security \ntaxes and revenues and counts them as offsets. That would be money \nnormally reserved for the Social Security trust fund. You look at the \nCLASS Act. One Member of this body--a Member who is very respected for \nwhat he has done relative to budgeting--called this a Ponzi scheme.\n  The CLASS Act was initially opposed by our friends on the other side \nor by leading Democrats. But it is back alive. It is included in the \nSenate bill. It is another Federal entitlement that is going to create \nan insolvency problem very quickly. It takes money from premiums that \nare supposed to go for benefits and uses them as offsets and pay-fors.\n  CMS experts have looked at this, and they reached a conclusion that \nis reliable. They said the CLASS Act faces ``a significant risk of \nfailure,'' and then said, and may lead to ``an insurance death \nspiral.''\n  Our friends on the other side claim the bill will simultaneously \nextend the solvency of Medicare and then magically decrease the \ndeficit. But the reality of that, again, comes from CMS actuaries who \nsay: Well, wait a second here, that is double-counting. You can't use \nthe same dollar twice. You can't count it twice. CMS concludes that the \nMedicare cuts in the legislation cannot be simultaneously used to \nfinance other Federal outlays, such as coverage expansions under this \nbill or to extend the trust fund.\n\n  So when you cut all the way through this and see what is happening \nhere, it doesn't hold together. This is a financial plan that is built \nupon sand, and you can almost guarantee it is going to collapse.\n  So let me, if I might, ask my colleague, Senator Wicker, what he \nthinks of all of this. Can he offer some thoughts as to where this bill \nis headed and the financial mechanisms of this bill?\n  Mr. WICKER. I appreciate my colleague from Nebraska getting into the \nweeds because it is important that we know the details of the numbers \nhere. I think there is also a sort of big-picture aspect to this. There \nare a lot of Americans out there who may not have read the details the \nSenator from Nebraska just outlined, but they instinctively know you \ncan't do all this to one-sixth of our economy and save money for the \nFederal Government at the same time. They instinctively know this is \ngoing to turn out, as big entitlement programs always do, to be more \nexpensive than has been estimated and it is going to cost the American \ntaxpayer and future generations in terms of the national debt.\n  I would like to pivot and talk about what this is going to do to \nState governments because that is an additional aspect over and above \nthe gigantic numbers the Senator from Nebraska mentioned.\n  Really, almost half of the additional coverage in this Senate bill, \nwhich the House is being asked to adopt lock, stock, and barrel without \neven changing so much as a semicolon, half of the coverage is going to \nbe under Medicaid. We all know Medicaid requires a huge Federal \ninvestment, but Medicaid also always requires a State match. Under the \nprovisions of this bill, if it is enacted, States will be told that the \nmagnificent Federal Government has increased coverage, and now, Mr. \nState Legislator, Mr. State Governor, you figure out a way to pay your \npart of it.\n  I know this much: In my State of Mississippi, our legislators and our \nGovernor have had to stay up late 2 years in a row figuring out a way \nto pay for the Medicaid match they are already being asked to pay, much \nless this new mandate of additional persons who would be covered under \nthis Senate language. There is no way the State of Mississippi can \nstand this new Medicaid coverage without an increase in our taxes at \nthe State level. I don't think we can cut teachers enough, although \nteachers might have to be cut to pay this Federal mandate. I don't \nthink we can cut local law enforcement enough, although that might have \nto be cut too. It is just a huge, unfunded burden on the States. Quite \nfrankly, even if all of the promises that are being made on the Senate \nside come true--that we will clean this up in reconciliation, which I \nfrankly doubt can possibly happen--the States are going to be faced \nwith this huge unfunded mandate.\n  You don't have to take our word for it on this side of the aisle. \nDemocratic Governor after Democratic Governor has had press \nconferences, they have sent letters, they have sent messages, they have \nmade themselves available to the press. Governor Bredesen of the State \nof Tennessee said this bill is the ``mother of all unfunded mandates'' \nand has urged, even at this late date, that we not go down this road.\n  So I appreciate my friend from Nebraska pointing out what this is \ngoing to do to the Federal budget, and I would simply commend the \nbipartisan State officials who have been talking to anyone within the \nsound of their voices saying that State governments cannot afford this \nmandate at the State level, and it will inevitably result in an \nincrease in taxes at the State level--something we certainly don't need \nat this time of economic hardship.\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\n  Perhaps Senator Brownback has some thoughts he would like to add, and \nI know others may be joining us, too, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate my colleagues allowing me to join in this \ncolloquy because it is incredibly important and I believe the American \npublic believes it is incredibly important because, if for no other \nreason, they are looking at it and saying: We don't want this bill. We \ndon't think this bill is the right way to go. We don't think this \nprocedure is the right way. So they oppose it on process and they \noppose it on product. And you don't have to believe me. Listen to these \npoll numbers: 68 percent say the President and the congressional \nDemocrats should keep trying to work with Republicans to craft \nlegislation.\n  By the way, that big, all-day-long meeting at Blair House to talk \nabout this, where we put forward a series of ideas, virtually all of \nthem were rejected--a bipartisan incremental compromise, which is much \nmore the way the American public wants to go.\n  A Rasmussen poll says that 57 percent of the voters say the health \ncare reform plans we are discussing in Congress will hurt the U.S. \neconomy. Only 25 percent think it will actually help. And 66 percent \nbelieve the health care plan proposed by President Obama and \ncongressional Democrats is likely to increase the Federal deficit. Do \nyou know the reason they think that? Because it will. This is going to \nincrease the Federal deficit.\n  On top of all that, there is a big intangible here. If this bill \npasses, the rest of the world is watching to see if the United States \npasses this big increase--an entitlement program--when we are running \n$1.5 trillion in deficit and have a $12 trillion debt that is 90 \npercent of the size of our total economy. They are watching and they \nare saying: If the United States does this now, they are not serious \nabout getting their budget under control. They are going to start \npulling dollars out of the U.S. economy and putting them in other \nplaces. It will make it harder for us to raise capital, it will \nincrease interest rates, and it is going to hurt the U.S. economy. And \nthat is a near-term thing that is going to happen because people are \nwatching this.\n  I might note the ``Saturday Night Live'' routine where China's \nPresident, Hu Jintao, is lecturing President Obama about how he is \ngoing to get the budget under control by passing a big new entitlement \nprogram. I don't usually cite ``Saturday Night Live,'' but in this case \nit lands a little too close to home. And people are saying: Yes, this \ndoesn't make any sense to me either. This is going to hurt.\n  The front page of the Wall Street Journal has an article about what \nIreland is having to do to get its budget under control, Greece is a \nmess, and our deficit and debt is skyrocketing.\n  If we pass this, this is going to hurt us in the near term as far as \nthe cost of raising the capital we need in this economy. It will hurt \nStates that are really struggling as well. It is a bad idea at a bad \ntime.\n  I am glad my colleagues let me join them, and I note that the doctor \nis in--the Senator from Wyoming--to help us dissect this bill as well.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, Mr. President, that is exactly what I am hearing \nat home from Wyoming's voters and from my patients. I was in Wyoming \nthis past weekend. I have had the privilege of practicing medicine \nthere for 25 years, taking care of families in Wyoming. When I talk to \npeople, their concerns are the national concerns the Senator from \nKansas has just mentioned--the debt and what our Nation is facing long \nterm. But they are also very focused on their own personal care. If you \nhave a town meeting or just talk to people at the coffee shop, the \npeople of America believe that if this bill passes, the quality of \ntheir own personal health care will go down; that their opportunity to \ngo to the doctor they have enjoyed a relationship with for years, where \nthey know them and they know their family, may be gone.\n  We are also seeing that health care providers all across the \ncountry--even the Mayo Clinic--are saying this bill is a huge lost \nopportunity. It was supposed to be designed to help get the cost of \ncare down, and it is not doing that. It is going to raise the cost of \ncare. It was designed to improve the quality of care, but it is going \nto cost people the quality of their own health care. That is why \nAmericans don't like this bill. They do not like anything about it.\n  The Mayo Clinic was used early on by the President in this debate as \nthe model for how we should have health care in this country. The Mayo \nClinic has said ``no thank you'' to patients on Medicare in Arizona, \n``no thank you'' to patients on Medicaid. Yet the President plans to \npush this program through. He says he is going to provide coverage for \nmore Americans, and he is going to do it by putting 15 million more \npeople on Medicaid--a program that many doctors won't see because the \nreimbursement is so low. If all a provider saw were Medicare patients, \nthey couldn't afford to keep their doors open--not at the hospital or \nthe clinic. And we are hearing that from hospitals and doctors across \nthe country. That is why the Mayo Clinic said: No thank you, Mr. \nPresident. We can't take those patients, whether it is Medicare or \nMedicaid.\n  This bill will cut Medicare--the program our seniors depend upon--by \n$500 billion for patients who depend on Medicare. It cuts Medicare \nAdvantage, and that program is an advantage, and the reason people \nsigned up for it is because it provides preventive care and coordinated \ncare. But it is not just that; there will be $135 billion in cuts to \nhospitals in all our States and communities, $42 billion to home health \nagencies. These are the folks who help provide a lifeline for people \nwho are at home, and it saves money by keeping them out of the \nhospital. There are cuts to nursing homes, to hospice providers--\nproviding services to people in the final days of their lives. That is \nwhy the American people are offended that this bill is being crammed \nthrough.\n  I see we have the former Governor of Nebraska here on the floor, who \nhas experienced these issues with Medicaid, with Medicare, and with \nnursing homes. So I would ask my friend and colleague whether this the \nsame thing he is hearing at home in Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. This is exactly what I am hearing at home in Nebraska, \nMr. President.\n  As a former Governor, as the Senator from Wyoming points out, you \ndeal with these programs every day. You are trying to figure out how to \nfashion a State budget that deals with Medicaid. I said a few weeks ago \nthat I don't know whom the folks who wrote this bill were talking to \nbecause if you look at the expansion of health care to people in this \nbill, really what they are doing is expanding Medicaid by about 15 to \n18 million individuals.\n  The Senator from Wyoming hit the nail on the head. You already have \nserious access problems with Medicaid. What do I mean by that? As the \ndoctor, Senator Barrasso, said, doctors cannot practice on the Medicaid \nreimbursement. They would literally go broke. Our little hospitals in \nall of our States, our critical access hospitals, would say: We cannot \nkeep our doors open on Medicaid reimbursement. They can't do it on \nMedicaid or Medicare reimbursement. So what is the solution? Well, the \nsolution certainly isn't adding 15 to 18 million more people who will \nwalk into a hospital or a doctor's office and who will hear: Sorry, we \ndon't take Medicaid patients because we can't afford to do that.\n  The other thing I want to mention, if I might--and then I am going to \nask Senator Wicker to comment on some of these questions also--because \nthis is a very important point, is that all of a sudden we are starting \nto hear a lot of discussion from the White House on down about how we \nhave to get a handle on cost. And I think they have communicated that \nwell because, quite honestly, the American people get it. They \nunderstand that if you don't have an impact on cost, you are not going \nto get anywhere with health care reform.\n  My colleagues will remember that we sent a letter to the CMS \nActuary--this is an actuary employed by the Federal Government--and we \nsaid: Take a look at this bill and tell us what you think in these \nrespects, and one of the respects was health care costs. Let me quote \nfrom that report:\n\n       Overall health expenditures under this bill would increase \n     by an estimated total of $222 billion.\n\n  Compared to what? Compared to doing nothing. If we did nothing, we\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\nwould have a better impact on health care costs than this bill is going \nto have.\n  After spending $2.5 trillion, after cutting $\\1/2\\ trillion out of \nMedicare, after raising taxes over $\\1/2\\ trillion, the CMS Actuary \nsays to us: After you have done all those things, the overall health \nexpenditures under this bill would increase by an estimated total of \n$222 billion versus doing nothing.\n  I ask Senator Wicker, is that the kind of health care reform he is \nhearing the people back home want?\n  Mr. WICKER. The people back home want health care reform, but they \ncertainly want the kind that is going to lower health care costs and \nlower health care premiums. The Senator mentioned CMS. It may be that \nsome people within the sound of our voices do not realize this is a \npart of the administration. This is not some outside business group \nthat has an ax to grind. The actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services are called on to tell us the numbers as they see \nthem. They had no choice but to answer the question accurately and the \nquestion is not one that lends itself to getting public support for \nthis plan. I think that is why the poll numbers Senator Brownback \nmentioned are there. There is only about 25 percent of the American \npublic that believes at this point we should pass this huge Senate bill \nlock, stock, and barrel and send it to the President for his signature.\n  Senator Barrasso mentioned the $\\1/2\\ trillion cut in Medicare. We \nspent a little time in December debating whether actually there was a \ncut in Medicare. Some of our friends on the other side of the aisle \nsuggested this--the programs that were cut should not be considered \npart of the Medicare Program.\n  Obviously, there is one Democratic Senator who thought so much of \nthese cuts in Medicare that he got an exemption for his State. That is \nwhat the minority leader has been calling the ``Gator aid.'' Florida, \nunder the Senate bill--the bill the House is being asked to pass in its \nentirety without changes--the Senate bill says we are not going to cut \nMedicare Advantage for the State of Florida.\n  Why the people of the State of Florida are more deserving of Medicare \nAdvantage and Medicare benefits than the people of Wyoming or \nMississippi or Kansas or Nebraska, I do not know. But somehow the \nmajority, 60 Members of this Senate, in their wisdom, believed Medicare \nwas a good program and Medicare Advantage was a very good program for \nthe people of Florida.\n  By the same token, I guess the Democratic Senator from Nebraska has \nnow repudiated what was known as the ``Cornhusker kickback,'' which was \nbasically saying Nebraska would not have to pay for their share of this \nhuge Medicaid mandate; all the other States would. Somehow that State \nwas singled out. Apparently, the people of Nebraska rose in horror at \nbeing singled out for some sort of favor the other people in America \nwere not getting, so that is being proposed to be changed.\n  I ask Senator Johanns, if the House votes on this next week, they \nwill not have a chance, will they, to take that out? The only choice \nthe House is going to have is to vote for the ``Cornhusker kickback,'' \nthe ``Gator aid,'' the ``Louisiana purchase,'' these special deals for \nlabor unions, and all that will be sent to the President to be signed \ninto law and will be part of the statute.\n  That is the way I understand the Democratic procedure. I ask Senator \nJohanns, am I correct?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I believe the Senator is correct. Let me offer a \nthought, if I might. I think others--maybe I will turn to Senator \nBrownback next. If this were a great bill, if this were the kind of \nlegislation you wanted to take home and go out there and champion and \nmaybe, if you are up for election, campaign on, then you would not have \nto go through all these gyrations and gimmicks and somersaults and \ncartwheels to try to get this darn thing passed. But that is exactly \nwhat is happening.\n  I cannot wait to get up in the morning and run down and turn on the \ncomputer and see what the latest is, because they are, over there at \nthe House, but they finally figured out that the only way to get this \nterrible policy enacted is to pass the Senate bill with all its warts \nand moles and ugliness and special deals and whatever. They have to \npass it without pulling a dotted ``i'' out or a crossed ``t.'' They may \nbe able to say back home: Folks, I didn't support that. What I wanted \nwas the reconciliation package that would fix all these things. All I \ncan say is reconciliation was never designed for this. This is not what \nreconciliation was designed for. Reconciliation was designed to bring \ndown the budget deficit. What is happening over in the Senate are more \nsomersaults, more gyrations, more cartwheels to figure out how to \nshoehorn this terrible piece of policy into a rule for which it was \nnever designed.\n  Now you are going to end up this day, I guess, where we all show up \nand literally you have rulings on what you can do with reconciliation \nand what you cannot do. So no House Member can go home and say I voted \nfor this awful piece of legislation, but we are going to be saved by \nreconciliation. Do you know what. Maybe you will, maybe you won't. The \nreason why that question cannot be answered today is because \nreconciliation was never designed to take control of one-sixth of the \neconomy; it was never designed to do what folks are trying to do.\n  Let me wrap up with this, and then I would like to hear Senator \nBrownback's thoughts. Enough of the somersaults, enough of the \ncartwheels, enough of trying to figure out how many angels fit on a pin \nand what size razorblade is going to divide the hair. This is \ncraziness. This is terrible policy. Please stop now. The country is \nbegging us to stop and start over with a thoughtful process.\n  If there were a great bill, we would not be going through this. There \nwould be bipartisan support such as there has been on many tough issues \nthrough the decades of our history. But, you see, this is not a good \nbill. This is a terrible bill. The bottom line is, they are going to \ntry to fix it with a process that was never designed for this purpose.\n  I would like to hear the thoughts of Senator Brownback.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. We were on the floor in December, the longest \ncontinuous session in the history of the Senate, 25 continuous days, \nand we were talking about this and my colleague from Nebraska and I \nwere joined by our colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, who has been \naround a long time and part of a lot of health care reform legislation. \nHis point is, if you follow the normal order and work it through a \ncommittee and bipartisan process, almost every health care bill he has \nbeen a part of--and there have been a number of substantial ones--gets \n75 votes in this body. People want to support health care reform on a \ngood bill. They will support it. It will be bipartisan. We are all for \nhealth care. But now you have a bill that is going to be completely \npartisan, on one side, not supported by the American public, and then \nyou are having to jimmy rig a process to try to figure out how we set \nthis up to do it.\n  Even Kent Conrad, the chairman of the Budget Committee, who is a \nDemocrat, says:\n\n       Reconciliation cannot be used to pass comprehensive health \n     care reform. It won't work. It won't work because it was \n     never designed for that kind of significant legislation.\n\n  My experience is, if you try to do something that is not designed to \ndo this, you are going to get a flawed product and flawed process that \npeople are going to be mad about. It will hurt this body. I think it \nwill be very harmful to this country to do this and it should not be \ndone.\n  After all the time we spent in December, 25 continuous days in \nsession, I think the American people spoke when they had a \nMassachusetts election and elected Scott Brown. It was clearly about \nhealth care reform.\n  I know my colleague from Wyoming has been all over speaking about \nthis on television, getting a lot of feedback from people. He probably \nis getting the same sort of feedback that I have, about don't do this. \nIt wasn't designed to be done, this sort of health care reform, in a \nreconciliation process.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I heard that just this morning. We had a number of \ncounty commissioners from Wyoming here in Washington. They were at a \nspeech yesterday given by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and she \ntold these county commissioners, this group from all around the \ncountry, we\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\nneed to first pass the bill so then later the American people will know \nwhat is in it. She said this to them and they laughed. They laughed at \nthe Speaker of the House at this meeting yesterday because these are \ncounty commissioners. They know they are not going to vote on something \nthe people in the community don't know about. The people in the \ncommunity come, they want to know what is going to be discussed and \nthen voted on.\n  The people of America do not know what is in this bill. They know \nthis bill is going to raise taxes by $500 billion. They know this bill \nis going to cut Medicare for our seniors who depend upon Medicare by \nanother $500 billion. They know they are going to be paying for this \nthing for 10 years, but there are only 6 years of services. It is \namazing how much the people of America know about the gimmicks of this \nbill that, in fact, those who are pushing the bill wish they didn't \nknow.\n  That is why three out of four Americans say stop. A quarter of them \nsay stop, a quarter of them say stop and start over, and only a quarter \nof them support what is happening here.\n  Mr. WICKER. If I can interject, I think that was a very telling \nremark from the Speaker of the House yesterday, and if someone didn't \ncatch that, she said we need to pass the bill so we can then find out \nwhat is in it. The comments are out there on the Internet for the \nAmerican people to see. I would like to quote Senator Lamar Alexander \nabout this entire process. He said:\n\n       What the President is doing is asking House Democrats to \n     hold hands, jump off a cliff, and hope Harry Reid catches \n     them.\n\n  I don't know that Harry Reid will be able to catch them. I will say \nthis. If there are budget points of order that need to be waived in \nthis scheme the majority leader has about cleaning up this statute in \nconference, I am not going to be a part of 60 votes to waive that point \nof order. It will all be on Mr. Reid and his teammates over there to \nget this done because I will not be a part of waiving points of order, \nhelping them get to a supermajority to clean up something, even if it \nneeds to be done.\n  This process needs to be stopped, and I would say the next 10 to 14 \ndays are going to tell the tale. The American people do not want this \nbill, and it is up to the House of Representatives and to us, saying \nwhat we can on the Senate side, to see if we are going to listen to the \npeople and stop this bill, go back to the drawing board and try \nsomething that works.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I join my colleague from Mississippi. I would note \nthat is the case, and why is it the Speaker is saying we have to pass \nthe bill to see what is in it? They are going to hold it back until \nthey break enough arms to get a majority vote and then pop it out and \nthen there will be an hour's debate on one-sixth of the economy being \nchanged. We saw that same procedure when Majority Leader Reid was \ncrafting this bill behind closed doors and nobody knew what was in the \nbill and then popped it out when you have the deal, when you made \nenough deals, broken enough arms, then we can pass this. That is no way \nto have a process like this. That is no way to effect this big a piece \nof the economy that touches every American's life in the process.\n  I urge the Speaker not to do something like this. Listen to the \nAmerican public and follow normal order. They could send this back to \ncommittee, to the Finance and the HELP Committees, work a bipartisan \nagreement on this, say we have to hit this number or that, let's do an \nincremental approach and come out with a bill that would have 75 votes. \nThat is doable.\n  We put forward a whole bunch of ideas at the Blair House. Here are \ndifferent things we would support. Put out a long day of discussion. \nThat is the normal order that produces good legislation that will stand \nthe test of time. This will not stand the test of time, and it is going \nto bankrupt the country.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. If my colleagues will permit, let me offer a few closing \nthoughts. I so appreciate the opportunity to be on the floor with them. \nIt was not that long ago that our President of the United States \nactually was a Member of this body. He was a Member of the Senate. It \njust seems, from time to time, we are asked to comment on the 60-vote \nrule. He was asked to comment on that. Here is what he said. ``Removing \nthe 60-vote threshold would change the character of the Senate \nforever.''\n  He went on to say having majoritarian absolute power on either side \nwas ``not what the Founders intended.''\n  The thing about reconciliation is this: It limits debate, it is a \nvery abbreviated process, and it just comes in and says you are only \ngoing to get 20 hours of debate. Very limited. The second thing is it \nonly takes a majority vote.\n  From time to time this issue pops up. But you do not have to study \nthe history of this great Nation very long to understand what our \nFounders were doing. The House is a majority body. Now, States such as \nKansas and Nebraska do not fare very well in that. We do not have a lot \nof Members. We are never going to have as many Members as California, \nNew York, or New Jersey. So literally on every vote you could find \nyourself losing.\n  Our Founders understood that. They came up with an idea for a very \nunique body, a body that would be an equalizer. Every State got two. \nEvery State got two Members. But the important thing about this body \nwas this: that as issues were passed on the House side by majority \nvote, over on this side it was anticipated that something more would be \nrequired to cause the Members to come together and try to work through \nthe Nation's difficult problems.\n  Initially there was no way to stop debate. Then about 1915 it was \ndecided that a two-thirds vote would stop debate. Then, in the mid-\n1970s that was changed to 60 votes. That 60 votes is an important \nlimitation on the power of the Federal Government to impose its will \nupon the people.\n  I will wrap up my comments today by saying this: The will of the \npeople here is very clear. They do not want this bill. They see this as \na massive government takeover of their lives. They have spoken very \nclearly and eloquently in our townhall meetings, in elections that have \noccurred, and they have said: We want you to go back and work through \nyour differences and come up with a bipartisan approach.\n  Yet if reconciliation is used, you will not only change the character \nof this body, you will change how our government operates. If you can \npass this bill through a reconciliation process, you can do anything, \nand you end up with literally a system that is vastly different than \nwas ever intended and a system, in my judgment, that is not good for \nthe future of our great Nation.\n  With that, let me wrap up and say again to my colleagues, I \nappreciate the opportunity to be on the Senate floor with you today.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1327-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1327-S1329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FISCAL RECKLESSNESS\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the tax extenders \nlegislation and the consequences of our fiscal recklessness. I cannot \nstress enough that our spending is completely out of control. It seems \nevery week this body passes more legislation and spends more money and \nadds more debt onto the backs of our children. Unfortunately, the \nDemocratic majority continues to sing from the same old sheet of \nmusic--more debt, more spending, and more fiscal recklessness. Last \nweek the nonpartisan CBO provided their analysis of President Obama's \nbudget, and it is nothing short of a fiscal train wreck and a roadmap \nto banana republic status. It pains me to stand on the floor of the \nSenate and tell the American people that President Obama is leading us \ndown a path of bankruptcy.\n  I believe this budget is simply reckless, with enormous budget \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. This year, the government has \noverspent by more than trillion dollars; the same amount last year. We \nare passing trillions of dollars in debt onto our children and \ngrandchildren. Nevadans and people across the country are facing very \nhard\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\neconomic times. For the Federal Government to be spending this much \nmoney is an insult to American families everywhere.\n  In 2020, the last year of the President's budget, our Nation's credit \ncard bill will account for 90 percent of the economy. What does this \nmean in terms real people can understand? Because these numbers are so \nlarge and enormous, it is difficult to put them in perspective. Let me \ntalk in terms of the consequences of this fiscal recklessness. At a \ncertain point, foreign countries will not buy our IOUs, our bonds, or \nthey will demand higher interest rates because they are riskier. Our \nstandard of living will decrease. Actually for the first time in \nAmerican history, future generations will be worse off than prior \ngenerations. As to the American dream of owning a home as a young \nadult, one will have to wait until their 40s or 50s to buy a home. \nFamilies, in order to maintain a similar standard of living, will have \nto become smaller. With a less dynamic economy, we will enjoy less of \nthe fruits of innovation and technological progress.\n  I know this is hard to hear, but one day, if we continue down the \ncurrent path, this scenario will become a reality. We cannot keep \nspending and spending and spending without consequences. Democrats \nclaim we need to spend money because our economy is sluggish. We need \nstimulus after stimulus to put us back on the right track.\n  We are not on the right track. Unemployment in my State is still 13 \npercent. There isn't much light on the horizon. We have lost our way \nand have wandered down a path of fiscal crisis. More spending doesn't \nfix the economic crisis.\n  I wish to talk about the depression of 1920 to 1921. Shortly after \nthe end of World War I, we went into economic crisis. The Department of \nCommerce estimates the economy declined by nearly 7 percent during that \nperiod. Unemployment rose sharply during the recession. Estimates are \nthe rate of unemployment went from around 5 to almost 12 percent. From \nMay of 1920 to July of 1921, automobile production declined by 60 \npercent, and total industrial production across the country decreased \nby 30 percent. Stocks also fell dramatically. The Dow Jones Industrials \nwas cut by almost half. Business failures tripled between 1919 and \n1922.\n  But instead of ``fiscal stimulus,'' here is what President Harding \ndid. He cut the government's budget nearly in half between 1920 and \n1922. Marginal tax rates were slashed across all income groups. So he \ncut taxes and cut government spending at the same time. This encouraged \nbusinesses to grow and to add jobs in the private sector. The national \ndebt was reduced by one-third.\n  In the 1920 acceptance speech for the Republican nomination, Harding \nsaid:\n\n       We will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and \n     strike a government borrowing which enlarges the evil, and we \n     will attack the high cost of government with every energy and \n     facility which attend Republican capacity.\n       We promise that relief which will attend the halting of \n     waste and extravagance, and the renewal of the practice of \n     public economy, not alone because it will relieve tax burdens \n     but because it will be an example to stimulate thrift and \n     economy in private life.\n\n  You see, Harding's laissez-faire economic policies, rapid government \ndownsizing, and low tax rates spurred a private market recovery and led \nto a readjustment in investment and consumption for a peacetime \neconomy.\n  The unemployment rate went from almost 12 percent in a little over a \nyear to less than 2 percent. Let me repeat that. The unemployment rate \nwent from almost 12 percent to under 2 percent. I do not think that is \nwhat is happening today.\n  This episode in history provides a counterexample to the argument \nthat we need massive government spending to stimulate our Nation's \neconomy. You see, we do not hear about the Great Depression of 1920. \nInstead, we hear about the Roaring Twenties because sound fiscal \npolicy, cutting tax rates, cutting spending led to economic resurgence.\n  This is an example that shows when the burden of government is \nlessened through less spending, less taxes, and less debt, the private \nsector will respond with investment and job creation, which lead to \neconomic growth.\n  So why is the legislation on the floor today not the answer? If \ncreating jobs is priority No. 1--and it should be for this body--why is \nthe majority party letting tax incentives for job-creating businesses \nexpire? These noncontroversial provisions expired 3 months ago. Why is \nhelping businesses an afterthought for the majority?\n  The tax extender portion of this bill could have passed by unanimous \nconsent months ago. But the majority did not want to bother with that. \nIt will have to be extended again later this year because the \nprovisions will again expire on December 31.\n  This is not the right policy for creating a stable and certain \nenvironment for employers who are wanting to hire more employees. The \ntax extender provisions of the bill amount to only $25 billion of this \nmassive $144 billion bill.\n  The tax extenders are good. They include energy production credits, \nresearch credits, accelerated depreciation for certain businesses, \nState and local sales tax deductions, and low-income housing tax \ncredits.\n  I have said these are good provisions. But we should have done much \nmore. Foremost, we should be cutting individual and corporate income \ntax rates so people and businesses could use their money to get the \neconomy moving again and could invest in job creation and wealth-\ncreating enterprises. But, at the same time, we need to cut government \nspending so we are not massively increasing the debt. You see, I hate \nto break it to you, but America is falling behind other countries in \nthat regard. Tax relief is wrongly criticized by those across the \naisle. They have been arguing for job creation, but their policies are \nmaking it tougher on private businesses.\n  In order to help these businesses find a stable footing once again, \nwe need to make tax relief permanent and not wait for these extensions \nto expire again and again.\n  Let me conclude. To get this economy moving, we do not need to pass a \nbill that is going to add over $100 billion to our deficit and our \ndebt. That is what the bill before us today does. It adds over $100 \nbillion to our deficit and our debt.\n  A few years ago, $100 billion was a lot of money around this place. \nWe throw that amount around here like it is nothing anymore. That is \ndebt that is adding to the coming fiscal crisis this country is going \nto be facing.\n  I believe the prescription to get this economy going is to cut taxes, \ncut government spending. I believe in the spirit of the American people \nand the American entrepreneurs instead of creating jobs here in \nWashington, DC. I do not know if the American people know that over \n100,000 jobs were created in this city last year--over 100,000 jobs in \nWashington, DC. That is about as many jobs as my State lost. That is \nnot the prescription for economic prosperity.\n  Government jobs have to be sustained with tax dollars year after \nyear. When the private sector creates those jobs, the whole economy \ngrows and feeds off itself, and you do not need taxpayer dollars to \ncontinue to subsidize those jobs. As a matter of fact, they feed in \nmoney to the Federal Treasury.\n  The bill before us today, I think, is fiscally irresponsible. It is \nthe exact opposite direction we should be going. What we should be \ndoing is acting in accord as Americans--not as Republicans, not as \nDemocrats--but let's look at history and learn from it and get this \neconomy going by focusing on actually what has worked in the past and \nwhat will work in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a bipartisan, \ncommonsense amendment that Members of this body endorsed yesterday by \nunanimous consent. I wish to thank Chairman Baucus for his work and the \nwork of his staff in managing this important job creation package on \nwhich we took a step yesterday. I wish to thank Senator Crapo for \ncosponsoring this bipartisan amendment and Senator Coburn for his ideas \nand support.\n  My amendment is simple. It amends the Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nof 2009--what I think most folks refer to commonly as the stimulus--to \ncorrect gaps in oversight and transparency. It provides much needed \nadditional accountability for these public investments, again, that \nhave come about through the stimulus package.\n  I voted for the stimulus package. It was one of the first and \ntoughest votes I cast as a Member of this body. I have worked hard to \nmake sure my State, the Commonwealth of Virginia, has had opportunities \nto compete for its fair share of this funding.\n  The Recovery Act was not perfect, and reasonable people can debate \nwhether it was necessary or whether it was ambitious enough. But I do \nthink it is fair to say that the majority of the economists of all \npolitical stripes across most of the ideological spectrum now agree a \nyear later that while imperfect, the stimulus package prevented our \nbattered economy from sliding over a cliff last spring into what I \nthink could have been a full-scale economic depression.\n  Almost a year ago, I remember coming to this floor for one of my \nfirst presentations, and I stood on the Senate floor and spoke of my \nconcerns about the potential challenges of implementing a piece of \nlegislation as big as the Recovery Act.\n  At that time, I said we needed to come up with a common set of \ndefinitions, performance metrics, that would allow us to honestly \nmeasure our progress as these stimulus dollars were pumped into our \neconomy. I know that metrics, performance indicators, and other \nthings--many Members' eyes start to glaze over when you go into these \nkinds of discussions, but if we are going to be truly responsible to \nthe people of this country, it is our job to make sure we put in place, \nparticularly when we start new programs, those kinds of performance \nmetrics.\n  As the Chair knows, prior to being Senator, I had the opportunity to \nbe Governor. The hallmark of my administration was, that which gets \nmeasured gets done. My sense was that as we started down the ambitious \npath around the Recovery Act, we needed to have those same kinds of \nmetrics in place.\n  I suggested a year ago requiring specific timelines and checkpoints \nso we could better track the outcome of programs funded by stimulus \ndollars. I discussed at that time steps we could take to hold Recovery \nAct recipients more accountable. I actually recommended delaying or \ndeferring stimulus payments if progress was not adequately demonstrated \nor appropriately reported. Here we are a year later, and while I do \nbelieve the macro level of a lot of the stimulus activities has \naccomplished its goals, it appears that requirements for program \nreporting and disclosure of spending plans have gone missing or just \nhave not been reported and that the notion of putting in place, in \neffect, a business plan for some of the new programs of this \nlegislation has never fully been vetted. In the amendment this body \nadopted yesterday--this bipartisan amendment--we have successfully \nincluded fixes to make sure that on a going-forward basis, we will not \nhave this problem.\n  When we passed the Recovery Act 1 year ago, we required recipients to \nreport quarterly, we required agencies to post reports, and we \nestablished an oversight board to tackle issues of waste, fraud, and \nabuse--the Recovery Accountability Board. We required the Congressional \nBudget Office, various inspectors general, and the Government \nAccountability Office to provide oversight. One would think, with all \nthis reporting and oversight, that we would have it totally covered, \nthat we would have thought through all of the ramifications. \nUnfortunately, a year later we have found that is not the case.\n  Not that anyone here needs a recap, but I think it is fair to once \nagain explain--and I do not think particularly those of us who are \nsupporting the Recovery Act and the administration ever did a very good \njob of actually explaining to the American people what was in the \nRecovery Act. It is not a long recap, but I do think it is important \nfor viewers and my colleagues to recall what it was.\n  Literally more than one-third of the stimulus act was tax cuts, $288 \nbillion of tax cuts. I believe it was, in effect, the third largest tax \ncut in American history. As I travel Virginia--and the Presiding \nOfficer, I know, travels the great State of Illinois--I very rarely \nfind a constituent who realizes the stimulus had a huge amount of tax \ncuts. We have only paid out less than half of those dollars, but a \nthird of the stimulus was tax cuts.\n  A second third was direct assistance to State and local governments.\n  I can tell you, in the Commonwealth of Virginia, I sometimes run into \nthe legislators there, some folks from the other side, who oftentimes \nwill say to me: Senator, we are going to keep kicking you in the tail \nabout the stimulus, but keep sending those checks because otherwise we \nwould be right down the tubes at the State level.\n  Oftentimes, these dollars have gone to prevent what would have been \notherwise catastrophic layoffs in our schools, in our highway \ndepartments, providing health care. Many State governments that are \nworking on biennial budgets are finding, in the second year of the \nbudget when the stimulus dollars run out, the enormous budget \nshortfalls they are going to face.\n  Again, for many of our constituents, because these dollars did not \nnecessarily create new jobs but prevented massive additional layoffs, I \nam not sure we conveyed that to folks adequately.\n  The third part of the stimulus package and the category I am \nprimarily concerned with today and the focus of my amendment included \nsignificant new investments in our Nation's economic infrastructure. \nThese are areas this body and policymakers have talked about for years, \nbut we never really put our moneys where our mouth was until the \nstimulus. These areas include such policy goals as smart grid; \ninvesting in high-speed rail; making sure we have the power of \ninformation technology to transform our health care industry to make it \nmore productive and cost-effective, so we have significant dollars in \nhealth care IT; and an area I am particularly interested in: deployment \nof broadband across our rural communities.\n  As you can see in this third category, as of mid-February we have \nonly paid out about $80 billion of a total of $275 billion. And it has \nnow become clear that many of the programs in this third category are \nwhat I would term ``high risk.'' That means they include Federal \nprograms that sought enormous increases in funding and new \nresponsibilities. Some of these programs barely existed a year and a \nhalf ago. They had relatively modest priorities before. But now with \nbroadband, we have seen a 100-fold increase, and dramatic increases in \nhealth care IT. These programs have had a year to gear up, but we have \nto make sure they actually have business plans that can be vetted. In \nsome cases, these stimulus funds were actually designated for brand-new \npriorities and new programs. Now many of these programs are just now a \nyear later getting their stimulus funds out the door.\n  Here is the challenge my amendment will address: We simply do not \nknow a year in and with $80 billion being spent out very much about how \nthese high-risk programs are actually doing in terms of delivering \nbroadband, health care IT, and smart grid.\n  For example--let me turn to the next chart--on the Web site \nrecovery.gov, you learn that the Energy Department has paid out about \n$2.5 billion in stimulus money so far. Close to another $24 billion \nremains to be spent out.\n  If we look even further, we find that the Energy Department complied \nwith OMB requirements last year to come up with an implementation plan \nfor its Weatherization Assistance Program. The Energy Department plan \nset a clear and reasonable goal. It said it would use stimulus dollars \nto weatherize 50,000 homes across the country in 2009. Weatherization \nprograms are geared to low-income homes. They help\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\nthe homeowners. They decrease energy costs and decrease our commitment \non foreign oil. There is a lot of good in this program. But a report \nfrom the Energy Department just 3 weeks ago showed that these funds \nactually paid to weatherize only 30,000 or so homes in 2009. That means \nthe programs missed the goal by 20,000 homes. That is a score of 60 \npercent. When I was in school, 60 percent was not a passing grade.\n  We should be concerned that almost every dollar of the $5 billion \nprogram for weatherization has already been awarded. We have to make \nsure we are getting the results we were promised. How can we have \nconfidence these grants already in the pipeline for this year are going \nto be properly managed? We must have more transparency and \naccountability from the Energy Department about how they are managing \nthis program and overseeing the spending of these funds.\n  There are the same kinds of challenges around the smart grid program. \nI am not just picking on the Department of Energy. If we look at the \nother areas--health care IT and rail--we find similar challenges.\n  There is no information, beyond once these funds are distributed, how \nthis fund distribution fits into the overall management of these new \nprograms. That information should be easily accessible and available to \ntaxpayers, and it should be reported on a regular basis to those of us \nin Congress who have this oversight responsibility. If these agencies \nare not meeting their milestones or deadlines and if stimulus programs \nare not producing measurable results, we need to know about them. If \nthere are problems of potential barriers to distributing these stimulus \nfunds, we in the Congress and the administration could do more to \nsupport reasonable solutions. We should be able to work together to fix \nthe management barriers that have slowed down this work.\n  It is not too late. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \ngovernment spent only about 18 percent of the stimulus funds in fiscal \nyear 2009. By the end of this fiscal year--that means October of this \nyear, 2010--that number grows to about 54 percent. But that still means \nover half of the dollars will be spent out after October of this year. \nThat means much of the stimulus funding remains in the pipeline, and \nthat means we have an opportunity now to correct any management and \ntransparency gaps.\n  Our amendment this body adopted will do that in three important ways:\n  First, it requires agencies to update and refine their implementation \nplans they developed last year for these high-risk programs. We define \n``high risk'' as any program that received more than $2 billion or any \nprogram that saw a funding increase of 150 percent or more from the \nprevious year's funding. These are the programs that went from quite \nsmall to ramping up to huge amounts. It also includes brand-new \nprograms. Under our amendment, these programs will be required to \nupdate their stimulus implementation and oversight plans by July 1. As \na former business guy, what that means in legislative speak is they \nhave to show us their business plan in a way that is intelligible and \nunderstandable to the taxpayers and to Congress by July 1.\n  Second, our amendment would require these high-risk programs to \nreport their outcomes to Congress and taxpayers every quarter beginning \nSeptember 30. We cannot wait for a year to go by to see if these \nprograms that are spending billions of dollars are actually achieving \ntheir goals. These reports must include relevant information on \nspending and outcomes that clearly measures whether these programs are \nworking and meeting the goals defined basically in the business plans \nthey would have submitted by July 1.\n\n  Finally, our amendment adds an enforcement mechanism to make sure \nthat Federal agencies, Members of Congress, and the public have access \nto the information they deserve to evaluate whether these stimulus \ninvestments are actually working. One of the things we found is that \nclose to 1,000 recipients of stimulus funding in this last quarter \nnever even filed the required reports so that we know and the taxpayers \nknow how these dollars are being spent.\n  The amendment will impose civil and financial penalties on stimulus \ngrant recipients who deliberately or consistently fail to comply with \nquarterly reporting requirements. The amendment provides sufficient \ndiscretion for the Attorney General and the courts to set these \npenalties and to make sure there is consideration of whether the \nrecipient is a nonprofit organization or State and local government or \na small business. Again, we are not trying to unduly penalize, but we \nwant to put some teeth in the fact that these organizations that are \nrecipients of Federal funds document what they are doing with those \nfunds. This is basic accountability.\n  Once again, I applaud my colleagues for stepping up in a responsible \nand bipartisan way to correct obvious gaps in management, \naccountability, and transparency of the Recovery Act programs. With so \nmuch of the stimulus funding still in the pipeline, this amendment will \nallow us to dramatically improve the way we measure and report outcomes \nand demonstrate accurate, verifiable results for the taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Virginia. I \nam a cosponsor of his amendment. I think it is a very noble attempt to \ntry to put better hands on the stimulus.\n  It is interesting to note that when we had the first hearing with the \nIG who is overseeing the stimulus, he said, regrettably, $50 billion \nwould be wasted; that is, $50 billion out of $867 billion--actually, \nsome $940 billion--was going to be wasted. We started with the \nassumption that about 6 or 7 percent of this money was going to be \ndefrauded. I congratulate my colleague because some of the steps he is \ntalking about in his amendment will actually lessen that, hopefully. I \nagree with him.\n  It is exciting for me to see a bipartisan attempt to start bringing \nteeth into the laws we pass, not toward the American public but toward \nthe agencies that administer the funds.\n  I congratulate him. I think he has a good amendment. I think we will \nhave a great vote on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1330-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1330-S1332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend time talking about the \nbill we are considering.\n  Yesterday afternoon, I had the great fortune--my daughter was \nperforming in Florida and was driving back to New York. I got to see my \n7-month-old granddaughter. Anybody who is a grandparent knows what it \nis like to see your grandchildren. There is nothing wrong with it and \neverything right with it. You get a picture and see in your \ngrandchildren aspects of your children. It draws back memories.\n  But I was struck by that encounter with my daughter and granddaughter \nand, by the way, her dog. What are our hopes and dreams about? What are \nthe hopes and dreams we have for our children and our grandchildren? \nOur hopes and dreams are that they will have great opportunity to \nflower and blossom in a way that they can take advantage of their God-\ngiven talents and their hard work and become a success in their life's \nendeavors. And then you contrast that with the heritage of our Nation--\na heritage which is about sacrifice--where one generation makes hard \nchoices, makes difficult decisions, where they sacrifice their own \nbenefits from their own endeavors to create opportunity so that the \nnext generation of Americans can have that opportunity to fulfill and \nexpand their heart's desires.\n\n  We heard the Senator from Utah today talk about where the problems \nwere with our Nation, and he talked about where all the gold was in \nterms of fixing what is wrong. I would have to say I disagree with him. \nWhen I look at the U.S. Constitution, and then I look at all the \ngovernment programs the Federal Government has fostered, passed, and \nfunds, I see a black-and-white slate. I see on the one hand the very \nlimited intent of our Founders, which was spelled out very clearly in\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\nArticle I, Section 8 of the enumerated powers--here are the powers you \nare to have. We are designing this to be a limited Federal Government \nand we are going to reserve everything else to the people and the \nStates through the tenth amendment. Those words are actually in there. \nWhat is not spelled out for the U.S. Federal Government is explicitly \nreserved for the people and their States.\n  So when we consider the mess we are in--the fact we had a $1.56 \ntrillion deficit last year, that 43 cents of every dollar we spent we \nborrowed from our grandchildren, that this year it will be $1.8 \ntrillion, that over the next 9 years we will spend $10 trillion we \ndon't have--and I would put forward most of it on things we don't \nneed--look at it in the light of what our constitutional charge is.\n  I have made this statement from the floor several times. The oath we \ntake--when I was sworn in, in January of 2005--is to uphold the \nConstitution. The Constitution is our guideline, our direction for what \nour responsibility is and what should be left to the States. So I agree \nwith my colleague that unless we reform entitlements, we are going to \nhave a difficult time solving our problems, but there is another \nanswer. Actually, there are two other answers.\n  One of the other answers is to go through with a fine-tooth comb and \nlook at every Federal Government program and ask: Is it a legitimate \nresponsibility of the Federal Government? And if it is, is it a program \nwe need?\n  You know, in 2 weeks time, my staff found 640 duplicative programs in \nthe Federal Government, across all agencies, that all do the same \nthing--105 programs to encourage students to go into technology, math, \nengineering, and science. There are 105 different programs. So as we \nlook at comparing what is our obligation and what is our charge under \nthe Constitution with what is happening, all of a sudden a wide world \nopens up of monies we don't have to spend, that aren't absolutely \nnecessary, that aren't absolutely a priority, that we shouldn't be \nspending money on in a time when we are borrowing and stealing the \nfuture of my little granddaughter Katie Rose, and everybody else's \ngranddaughter.\n  Why would we not demand that we do the hard work of going through \nwhat is truly our obligation and eliminating what is not, and \neliminating the multitude of duplications that the Federal Government \nhas? Why shouldn't we put ourselves to the same test every other family \nin America is put to. Once you have maxed out your credit card, once \nyou have passed your limits, they do not continue to extend you money. \nUnfortunately, what they do is jack up your interest rate. Well, guess \nwhat is getting ready to happen to us. We do not have an unlimited \ncredit card. What is going to happen to us over the next few years? We \nare seeing 30-year bond obligations today going for a higher percentage \nthan what they have ever gone for in the last 4 or 5 years, and we are \ngoing to see that trend continue. Out of the $10 trillion we are going \nto spend--money we don't have--in the next 9 years, $5.6 trillion of \nthat is to pay interest on the national debt. So we are going to find \nourselves in the same predicament as that person who has maxed out \ntheir credit card who is now paying interest on the interest instead of \npaying off the debt.\n  I said there were two ways of looking at this. The second is to go \nthrough the Federal Government and eliminate the waste, fraud, abuse, \nand duplication. One is to eliminate where we don't truly have a \nresponsibility or authority for what we are doing under the \nConstitution, but the second is we have identified $350 billion a year \nof waste, fraud, and duplication in the Federal Government. We have \ndone that over a period of hearings over the past 4 years. One \namendment out of about 800 I have offered over the last 5 years has \nbeen accepted to eliminate something--just one. They have all otherwise \nbeen voted down. And they have been voted down because Members of this \nbody refuse to make the hard choices about priorities, because they \nthink we don't have to.\n  Well, the gig is up. There is a real rumble among the American \npeople. There is a rumble in America about holding us accountable for \nthe future of this country, which means no longer ignoring the hard \nchoices, no longer adding to the credit card. I say all that to talk \nabout the bill that is before us. We have a bill before us that is \ncalled the tax extenders bill. But that is not what it is. It is the \ndebt extender bill. Because this bill, in light of all the speeches we \nwill hear in this body, and all of the excuses and all the press \nreleases that are going to be released, is going to add $104 billion to \nour children's credit card.\n  Yesterday this body voted to go forward with that. They voted to not \nmake the hard choices, not offset the spending. If these are priority \nitems that we should be doing in this bill, then why aren't we going \nafter some of the waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government and \ngetting rid of it? There is $104 billion over the next 10 years, with \nthis one bill alone, that we are going to add to the debt, and that \ncomes down to $10.4 billion a year. We have $350 billion worth of \nwaste. Yet we refuse to go into that $350 billion worth of waste, \nfraud, and duplication, and eliminate anything to pay for this. \nInstead, we are going to steal that opportunity, we are going to steal \nthat future, we are going to put a blight on the blossom of opportunity \nfor our children and grandchildren. I beg America to hold us \naccountable; to not accept business as usual anymore.\n  When you get down to it and start talking about what this means--when \nyou take the $104 billion and divide it by the 300 million people in \nthis country and then multiply it by the average family size--what you \nget is $1,282 per family that this bill will add. So if in fact you go \nto sleep the day after tomorrow, when this bill has passed the Senate, \nwhen 60 Senators vote for it and we go on and do this--35 or 36 will \nvote against it, but 64 or 65 will vote for it--when you put your head \non your pillow at night, you can thank them for jeopardizing the future \nof your children. And not because what they want to do in the bill is \nnecessarily wrong, but because they lacked the courage to stand up and \nmake the hard choices that are required in times of distress in our \ncountry.\n  If you study our history, our greatest leaders exhibited courage in \nthe face of adversity. They pulled us through by making hard choices, \nnot running away from the hard choices. We had a lot of people who were \ncritical of Senator Bunning because he raised the issue on a $12 \nbillion jobs bill--that isn't going to do anything--and said we ought \nto pay for it. We voted him down. We said no. But you know what, as I \nread the American public, about 80 percent of them said we should have \npaid for it. We should have done that. And those people who were most \ncritical of Senator Bunning on the floor are the people who have hardly \never voted against any spending bill in their entire career in the \nSenate. They honestly believe it is okay to mortgage the future of our \nchildren to benefit their own political careers.\n  So what we have developing in the Senate isn't partisanship, it is \npolicy differences that will make the difference for this country. And \nif the ne'er-do-wells of doing it the same old way win, our children \nwon't have a future. What they will have is a debt burden they will \nnever get out of.\n  We hear speeches, as we did from the Senator from Utah, that tend to \npush us, and we think, well, we have to figure out how we can fix \nMedicare and Social Security. Well, how do we fix Medicare and Social \nSecurity? We have to delay retirement, lessen benefits, eliminate fraud \nin Medicare, and delay eligibility. Those are the only answers. Or we \nhave to raise taxes.\n  But how do you raise taxes on the American people when you know you \nare spending $350 billion a year that is wasted? How do you, in good \nconscience, even consider that? I am not against having a tax increase \nwhen and if we have done everything we can do to get this government \nefficient and eliminated what is not our role and gotten rid of the \nfraud, waste, and duplication. And most of America wouldn't be against \nthat either. But right now they do not trust us. And for good reason \nthey don't trust this body. Because we are not shooting straight with \nthem. We are not telling them that we are going to add $1,282 to their \nkids' debt.\n  When you take this number--this 347 figure, and you look at kids 25 \nyears and younger, and you take that out 20 years, here is what you \nfind: Not only\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\nare they going to be responsible for the debt we have today, but the \n$78 trillion worth of unfunded liabilities for Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, and all the other trust funds, including Federal \nemployees' retirement, which adds up to $1.3 million for every person \nin this country under 25, ask yourself: How in the world will they ever \nown a home or send their kids to college if in fact they are having to \nsupport $60,000 a year in interest on a debt they didn't create?\n  The promise of America was freedom. Debt is a hard taskmaster. But it \nis doubly hard when it wasn't your debt but that of your parents and \nyour grandparents, yet you are tasked with changing your lifestyle, \nyour opportunities, your hope and vision for your children because this \ngeneration didn't have the courage to stand up and say: Enough is \nenough.\n  When will it ever be enough--when we can't sell our bonds? When will \nit ever be okay to offend those who are on the dole and who don't \ndeserve to be on the dole? When will it be okay to eliminate the waste \nin the Federal Government, if not at a time we are going to have a $1.8 \ntrillion deficit; if not at a time when $50 billion is going to be \ndefrauded out of the stimulus program? When will we ever do it?\n  We have never been in the financial situation our country is in \ntoday--never before in our history.\n  Our whole foreign policy is now being affected and impacted because \nof our debt. We have to keep an ear toward China as we conduct our \nforeign policy, in the fear that they may dump our bonds. Why would we \nput ourselves in that position when we do not have to? Because there is \nno spine in the Senate. There is no spine in the Congress. There is no \nspine to go out and say: Yes, I made the hard choices. You may not like \nit, but your children deserve that we make hard choices and difficult \ndecisions. If I am not here, it is OK, I did the right thing. I secured \nour future. I will be able to sleep at night, knowing I was not a part \nof taking and stealing that blossom of potential from our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I will finish by asking a question of the American people. Is it \nright that you have to make choices within a finite budget, yet your \nelected leadership in Washington does not? Is it fair for you to have \nto sacrifice to create a future for your children, when we are \ndestroying that future in Washington?\n  It is a time for Americans who have never been involved in the \npolitical arena, in our Nation, to get involved because the future of \nyour children and your children's children depends on it. We have a \nvery short window within which to recapture the economic renaissance in \nour country, and it is less than 4 years. If you look at what we are \ncoming to in terms of debt-to-GDP ratio and in terms of the size of the \ngovernment to the size of the GDP, we will be on an irreversible course \nthat will eliminate American exceptionalism forever because the thing \nthat made us free and kept us free was a fairly limited Federal \nGovernment. What we have in front of us is an attempt not to get it \nback down to a size that is manageable and within the intent of our \nFounders' vision and the American people's expectation; we have an \nintent to grow. The discretionary budget of the Federal Government, on \nthe rate that has been passed by this body the last 2 years alone, not \ncounting the stimulus, will cause the Federal Government to double in \nsize in 5 years. We are 40 percent bigger than we were 2 years ago; \nactually, it is 38.6 percent bigger. We hear the average Federal \nemployee now makes $72,000 and the average private employee now makes \n$40,000. We have added 170,000 new jobs in the government in the last 7 \nmonths, while we have lost three times that in the private sector. \nThings are out of whack. The only way they are going to change is if \nthe American public demands it to be changed.\n  I will go back. This is not a tax extenders bill. This is a debt \nextension bill. We are going to extend another $104 billion of debt \nacross the threshold of opportunity for our children and grandchildren. \nI am not going to be a part of that. I am not going to be complicit in \nit. If that is not satisfactory to the people of Oklahoma, I am fine \nwith that. I am ready to make the hard choices to make us a lean mean \nfighting machine again as an economy, a lean mean fighting machine as \nfar as opportunity. The way to do that is to downsize the Federal \nGovernment, put it back within the role of its intended purposes, and \nreturn to the States both the money and the authority to handle what is \nrightfully theirs in the first place.\n  The second thing that is important is to get rid of the $350 billion \nworth of waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication that occurs every year \nthat we do nothing about. We do nothing about it. We send out press \nreleases, but when it comes time to vote to make a hard choice, we do \nnot do it. We refuse to do it. We refuse to offend those who are well \nconnected and well heeled, while we send our country into the trash \nheap of history through financial collapse.\n  My hope is, my colleagues will stand and say we are not going to pass \nthis debt extender bill until you pay for it, until you make the hard \nchoices about what is waste, what is duplication, what is fraud, and \nget rid of some of that to pay, if these are truly priority items.\n  You see, if they are truly priority, if America truly needs them, \nthen there has to be something that is a lower priority that we can \ntake away. But we do not have that kind of thought in the Senate \nbecause we just keep putting the credit card into the machine. Thank \nyou, China. It is not going to be too long before we are saying: May we \nplease, China. May we please. May we.\n  Watch what is happening to Greece. Look at the articles on Ireland \ntoday, the hard choices they had to make to get themselves out of \ntrouble. But they are doing it. We are ignoring it in this body, and we \nare going to pass another $104 billion along to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we just had a beautiful, really \nincredible Congressional Gold Medal ceremony honoring the Women \nAirforce Service Pilots known as the WASP. It was the largest audience \nto have ever attended a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony or any \nceremony in the Capitol because we have now the wonderful new Capitol \nVisitors Center that allows us to accommodate very large ceremonies.\n  This one had over 2,000 family members of the Women Airforce Service \nPilots who were honored by Congress. I thought it was worth also \nincluding comments in the Congressional Record to be sure the American \npeople know that today was, in fact, a wonderful day in which we \nhonored women who did so much in World War II. They did not get the \nrecognition they deserved at the time but they received those accolades \ntoday when they were recognized with the highest honor that Congress \ncan give.\n  I would like to read the speech I gave at the ceremony, and also just \nembellish a little bit about the WASP.\n  I wrote a book called ``American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who \nShaped Our Country.'' In that book each chapter focused on specific \nareas in which women trailblazers had done so much to open doors for \nthe future women leaders in our country. One of those chapters focused \non those who blazed new trails in aviation.\n  The pioneers I profiled were Amelia Earhart and also Jackie Cochran. \nJacqueline Cochran was a true pioneer, as was Amelia Earhart. They were \n\ncontemporaries--actually, Amelia achieved her fame just a little bit \nbefore Jacqueline Cochran. But Jacqueline Cochran went on to become the \nfirst woman to break the sound barrier in an aircraft. She was a \nprotege of Chuck Yeager who, of course, we know was the first to break \nthe sound barrier in a jet aircraft. He was a test pilot and a fabulous \naviator who I saw recently in Dallas and understand he still enjoys \nflying.\n  For everyone who knows anything about aviation, Chuck Yeager is an\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\nicon. He took Jacqueline Cochran under his wing and helped her, and she \nwent on to become the first woman to break the sound barrier. She also \nwas the woman who conceived of the Women Airforce Service Pilots and \nwas the leader during World War II of this incredible group of women.\n  I wish to read the remarks I made because they tell much of the story \nof the WASP and Jacqueline Cochran's leadership.\n\n       As we celebrate Women's History Month, this is the perfect \n     time for us to gather to honor the Women Air Force Service \n     Pilots. They were not in the Air Force at the time, but they \n     were called the WASP. We are presenting them the \n     Congressional Gold Medal during Women's History Month because \n     these women truly made history. America's first women to fly \n     military aircraft, they blazed a trail in the sky that opened \n     the door for today's women military pilots. By the time the \n     war ended, 1,074 women had earned their wings at Avenger \n     Field in Sweetwater, Texas. Thirty-eight of those women were \n     killed in the line of duty. Throughout the war, these \n     courageous women flew over 60 million miles around the world, \n     in every type of aircraft flown by male pilots. They were \n     never commissioned, were never afforded Active-Duty military \n     status, and were not granted veterans status until 1977, 30 \n     years after they had served.\n       All these women volunteered to serve their country in \n     wartime. The reason the organization was formed was the every \n     available male pilot was needed to fly combat missions. So, \n     for the first time, women were recruited to fly non-combat \n     missions. They ferried new aircraft from the factory to the \n     coast and delivered the aircraft for shipment overseas. Some \n     flew airplanes that towed targets so that male gunners could \n     practice shooting with live ammunition and others even \n     trained male pilots. They did all the things someone in the \n     Air Force would do today except fly combat missions. That is \n     why Jacqueline Cochran convinced the Army Air Corps of that \n     their recruitment was a necessity. Women were eager to serve \n     the war effort. That was why the Women's Army Corps, the WAC, \n     was created. They too contributed to the war effort. The WAC \n     was headed by Oveta Culp Hobby, a wonderful woman who later \n     became a member of President Eisenhower's Cabinet.\n       Women volunteered by the thousands during World War II. The \n     WASP volunteers paid their own way to Texas for training. \n     Just before the war ended, the program ended, and the WASP \n     paid their own way back home. The 38 courageous women who \n     died as a result of their service in the WASP received no \n     military honors and the expense of their burials was borne by \n     their families or through contributions from their fellow \n     WASP. Their families even had to pay to have their bodies \n     transported home for burial. They were not even accorded the \n     honor of having a flag on their caskets because they were not \n     considered to be in the military.\n       I wrote about the WASP in my book, ``American Heroines: The \n     Spirited Women who Shaped our Country.'' These women surely \n     did. Despite their patriotic and historic impact, the WASP \n     were never formally recognized by Congress for their wartime \n     military service--until today. Both Houses of Congress, the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives, passed a resolution \n     to present the Congressional Gold Medal. It was unanimous on \n     both sides of the aisle. It is the highest award given by \n     Congress. We honor their service, the history they made, and \n     the history they made possible for other women to make as a \n     result of their courageous service.\n       Today, we right a wrong and acknowledge our debt to these \n     great patriots, women who are so worthy of this award and \n     this recognition.\n\n  I recognized Tom Brokaw during the ceremony. Tom was on the stage \nwith us at the ceremony. Of course, Tom wrote the book ``The Greatest \nGeneration'' that raised the awareness in America about the incredible \ncontribution of the veterans who served in World War II--primarily of \ncourse, the combat veterans who served in World War II. He chronicled \nthose because they served so valiantly in horrendous circumstances. \nThey came home, never talked about it, didn't talk about their \nexperiences to their wives or their friends or their children. Most \nwent back to life as normal and considered that they had done their \nduty and now it was time to go back to work. Tom Brokaw did a wonderful \nservice for all of us. He raised the awareness of the ``greatest \ngeneration'' and made us appreciate so much what they had done.\n  I said at the ceremony that Tom Brokaw, who came to the ceremony \ntoday because he had gotten to know about the WASP through his own \nresearch, was really here helping us close the circle for so many of \nthose who served in World War II and were never recognized. We \nrecognized the combat veterans. We recognized their incredible service \nin combat and in battle. But there were some who contributed that we \nhave only recently received the Congressional Gold Medal. The WASP was \nthe third of the three. The first was the Tuskegee Airmen. They were an \nincredible group African American pilots who flew combat missions but \nwhose service was never fully recognized until later, when they were \npresented the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Then there were the Navajo code talkers who did an incredible service \nfor our country but operated in secret. They promised they would not \never tell what they did, and they didn't until years later when they \nwere given leave to do so after a movie was made that chronicled their \ncritical wartime role. They too were recognized with the Congressional \nGold Medal. And now today we honor the WASP, the women who were the \nfirst women to fly military missions but never made a part of the \nmilitary\n  This effort to recognize the WASP started in the Senate where I was \nproud to introduce the legislation with my colleague from Maryland, \nBarbara Mikulski, that culminated in the celebration today. Senator \nMikulski and I shepherded that bill through the Senate, and in the \nmeantime legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentatives Susan Davis and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who passed it on \nthe House side. It passed in record time for a Gold Medal resolution. \nFor this, I thank my colleagues in the Senate and House. It took less \nthan a year from the day we introduced this legislation in the Senate \nto arrive at this day in which we award this medal to the WASP. There \nhave not been too many Gold Medal resolutions signed into law, usually \none per year, two at the most. But these resolutions usually take much \nlonger. But because these women are older and have waited so long, we \nwanted to pass this quickly so as many of them as possible could come \nto Washington to celebrate. In fact, over 2,000 WASP veterans and their \nfamily members did come. Of the 1,074 women who earned their wings, \nover 200 were here today. I thank them.\n  I ended my remarks today by saying:\n\n       I thank the WASP and their families who have waited so long \n     and traveled so far to be here today to finally hear these \n     words: on behalf of a grateful nation, thank you for your \n     service.\n\n  Speaker Pelosi was eloquent. The distinguished Minority Leader in the \nHouse, our leaders, Senator Harry Reid and Senator Mitch McConnell, all \nparticipated with the Secretary of the Air Force in this special day. \nAnd of course, the four of us from the Senate and House who sponsored \nthe resolution spoke as well. It was a beautiful ceremony. I wished to \nput that in the Congressional Record as a record of this day and as an \nadditional record of the recognition the WASP so richly deserve and for \nwhich they have waited far too long.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday, the President was in St. \nCharles, MO. He talked about a new effort the Federal Government would \nundertake to go after waste, fraud, and abuse in the health care \nsystem. He focused on the use of payment recapture audits and the teams \nof auditors who will now go through the process of looking at the \npayments being made in Medicare, for example, health care for seniors, \nto make sure the money is actually going for health care to seniors and \nnot going to criminals who are stealing money from the system. I \ncommend the President for doing this. It is the right thing to do. \nRepublicans and Democrats can work together. This is a good initiative.\n  But I would like to request of the President, as I have requested of \nthis Congress, to take further steps and more bold steps to stop fraud \nin the system.\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\n  I thank Leader McConnell who, in his opening remarks this morning as \nthe Senate opened its session, commented on a piece of legislation I \nhave offered that will not only go after the fraud after it happens, \nwhich is what the President's proposal does--and I commend him for it; \nit is estimated by folks looking at his proposal that it might save $2 \nbillion a year by going through and auditing and trying to find out \nwhere the bad guys have taken the money. I have some experience in \nthat. When I was deputy attorney general in Florida, working under \nthen-attorney general Charlie Crist, we had a Medicaid fraud control \nunit.\n  On the Medicaid side--health care for the poor--we did just what \nthese teams the President is putting together now are going to try to \ndo for Medicare. We had teams that looked at the data. We would break \ndown the list of the top 50 folks who were receiving reimbursements \nfrom the Federal Government, and if the number and the amount of money \nthey were receiving was abnormally high, we would look at it and make \nsure it was legitimate. You could go where money is. Right? They say: \nLook where the money is going. And if you can find out where the money \nis going, you can find out what the problems are.\n  We looked at the top 50 or top 100 folks who were receiving \nreimbursements from Medicaid, and we found problems. So the President's \nidea is effective. But let's not just do pay and chase. That is what we \nhave been doing in health care for years and years and years.\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from North Carolina, agrees with \nme on this issue. She has been a leader in advocating that we stop the \nhealth care fraud before it starts. We were trying to change the health \ncare bill last year at the end of the year to put in something more \nrobust.\n  We do not have to start from scratch. There is an idea out there that \nalready exists that is already working in another sector of the economy \nthat is very similar to what could be done in health care.\n  Health care is about a $2 trillion a year business. We know that in \nMedicare, there is at least $60 billion if not $100 billion a year of \nhealth care fraud. That is worth repeating: $60 billion to $100 billion \na year of waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare alone.\n  My colleague, Senator and Dr. Coburn, has been a leading advocate \nabout trying to go after this waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  So what could we do with that money? We could put that money back \ninto Medicare to make sure we are actually helping patients and make \nMedicare solvent for years to come, instead of where we are looking at \nit right now: that in the next 7 years Medicare is going to have a real \nfinancial crisis.\n  So how do we get at that $60 billion to $100 billion a year of waste, \nfraud, and abuse? Well, the health care industry is about a $2 trillion \nindustry. Another industry that does a fantastic job of fighting fraud \nthat is also an industry of about $2 trillion is the credit card \nindustry.\n  In health care--at least in government health care--we believe $1 out \nof every $7 is fraud. In the credit card industry, they lose 7 cents on \nevery $100. Madam President, $1 out of every $7 versus 7 cents on every \n$100.\n  How do they do it? They do not do just pay and chase; they do not \njust set up auditors and prosecutors to go after the bad guys after \nthey have stolen the money. They stop the stealing before it starts. \nTechnology is a wonderful thing, and it has created tremendous \nabilities for us to prevent fraud before it begins.\n  You all have had this experience. You have gone somewhere and used \nyour credit card, and your credit card company has e-mailed you or \ncalled you and said: Was that really you making that purchase? And why \nis that? Well, a mechanism was triggered by their computers, where you \nwere doing something you normally do not do. You were outside your \nnormal spending habits. You were in Washington, DC, visiting, not at \nhome in Orlando, FL. That is not something you usually do. A red flag \ngoes off because they built a computer model that tracks your normal \npurchasing, and if something is out of normal--if you are traveling or \nyou are purchasing more than you usually do, or you are buying things \nthat are the target of people who steal credit cards--the model goes \noff, the phone call happens, and if you do not verify, they do not pay.\n  This is called predictive modeling, and it makes all the sense in the \nworld that we put this into our health care system. And we can. I have \na bill, S. 2128. It has bipartisan support in the Senate with about a \ndozen cosponsors.\n  It is a bill to do three things. One, create the predictive modeling \nsystem, set up a computer program where if we have health care fraud, \nwe can try to detect it before it starts.\n  Let me give you an example. My home State of Florida is rampant with \nhealth care fraud--rampant. In fact, I think south Florida is the \ncapital, unfortunately, of health care fraud. Here is one example to \ngive you: We have in south Florida 8 percent of the Medicare \nbeneficiaries with HIV or AIDS nationwide, but 72 percent of the \nreimbursements to these patients are sent there.\n  Is that because they are getting the best health care in the world? \nNo. It is fraud. There are people in organized crime who are running \nthese health care codes, stealing medical records from hospitals, \nfinding out your patient information, saying that you have AIDS, \nrunning a $2,400 vaccine, and running those vaccines all day long, \nsending the bill to the Federal Government. The Federal Government is \npaying. It is a lot better deal for the crooks. It is a lot better than \nillicit drugs. We hear from these criminals they would much rather be \nstealing from the Federal Government. No one is shooting at them, and \nit is a lot easier to rip off Uncle Sam.\n  We have to stop this. So if you put this predictive modeling system \nin place, you could actually have a trend that occurred, and the \ncomputer would say: Wait a minute, this ``health care provider'' has \nsold this wheelchair 100 times in an hour, or they sold this other \nmedicine, this very expensive AIDS medication. They have prescribed \nthat more than anybody else. The model goes off and the payment stops \nuntil they are verified. We stop the fraud before it starts.\n  My bill does two other things. One is, it requires a background check \nfor every health care provider in America that is going to try to bill \nMedicare or Medicaid. Can you imagine that we do not do that right now? \nWe do not do background checks of people who are allegedly providing \nhealth care to our seniors and to the poor. Can you imagine, we have a \nconvicted murderer in Florida who was an alleged health care provider \nwho was scamming the system? There are bad guys scamming the system for \n$10 million, $20 million, $50 million, $60 million. So we have to do a \nbetter job.\n  The third thing this bill does is it creates some accountability. We \nare going to create an Assistant Secretary of Health at the Department \nof Health and Human Services whose only function will be to fight fraud \nso we have some person accountable who we can call in front of our \ncommittees and say: How are you doing in the battle to fight fraud?\n  As much as I appreciate what the President did today--and that could \nsave $2 billion--a group here in town has evaluated this bill that has \nbipartisan support and they say it could save $20 billion a year. So \nwhy aren't we doing this today? I know this health care bill is very \nimportant. We have differing views on whether we should pass the big \nbill. But why can't we pass my bill now? Why can't we start preventing \nthis health care fraud now and save $20 billion a year?\n  Imagine what we could do with that money. Imagine what we could do to \nput that money back in Medicare and make it more resilient so our \nseniors know their health care is going to be paid for.\n  I applaud the efforts of the President of the United States today. It \nis a good step. But it is on the pay-and-chase side. It is not on the \nprevention of fraud side. I keep coming to the floor and talking about \nthis because I feel so passionately about it. It is a commonsense thing \nto do. It is problem solving. It is not partisan. No one is for fraud. \nEverybody should believe that we should try to spend the government's \nmoney more effectively and more efficiently.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this afternoon I will preside over a \nForeign Relations Committee hearing on the future of U.S. public \ndiplomacy. Never has public diplomacy been more important for promoting \nU.S. national security interests, especially in volatile regions and \nareas where we are engaged in counterinsurgency. In order to evaluate \npast achievements, successes, and challenges in public diplomacy, the \ncommittee invited three former Under Secretaries of State for Public \nDiplomacy to testify on the matter earlier today. Given their wide \nbreadth of experience, they will share their views about lessons \nlearned from their tenure and their recommendations on tools and future \nstrategy.\n\n  The three former Under Secretaries who are participating--Evelyn \nLieberman, Karen Hughes, and James Glassman--promise to provide \nincredibly useful insight, and I am grateful they are able to be here \nfor the hearing today. Not only are they important voices on public \ndiplomacy, they have also been dedicated public servants in both the \nClinton and Bush administrations.\n  I wish to make a point here. They don't stay, as do the vast majority \nof the people we have talked about who have spent 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, \n35 years in the government. These people come from a different group. \nThey are the group who come for a short period of time and bring \nincredible expertise and intelligence to the issues we face--expertise \nand intelligence, by the way, that we in the Federal Government could \nnever afford to pay for. These three are perfect examples of that, and \nthat is one of the reasons I wish to recognize them today.\n  During their years of service as Under Secretaries of State for \nPublic Diplomacy, they oversaw our State Department's efforts to \npromote American foreign policies abroad using tools such as \neducational exchanges, public affairs and embassy outreach, \ninternational broadcasting, and the establishment of American corners \nor centers. They did this through communication with international \naudiences, cultural programming, academic grants, and international \nvisitors programs. Public diplomacy programs such as the Fulbright \nFellowship and Sports Envoy exchanges bring emerging leaders from \nforeign countries to visit the United States, promoting a cross-\ncultural exchange and contributing to sharing an American perspective \nwith the world.\n  Although these three officials come from different sides of the \naisle, they each hold unique perspectives on American public policy, \nand all share--and I can say from firsthand experience they all share a \nlove of country and dedication to service that called them to \ngovernment service. I was honored to work with each of them in various \ncapacities over the years, especially during my tenure on the \nBroadcasting Board of Governors.\n  Evelyn Lieberman is a native of New York and a graduate of State \nUniversity of New York in Buffalo. She first entered government service \nin 1988 as press secretary to my predecessor, now Vice President Joe \nBiden. In those days I was serving as chief of staff, and I had the \nprivilege to work with Evelyn early in her career. In 1993 Evelyn moved \nover to the White House where she served as Assistant to the First \nLady, now Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Three years later, \nafter serving also as Deputy White House Press Secretary, she was \nappointed Deputy Chief of Staff under Leon Panetta.\n  In 1997, President Clinton appointed her as director of Voice of \nAmerica, and she served there for 2 years. During that time, I was a \nmember of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees Voice of \nAmerica programming, and I was fortunate to work closely with Evelyn \nonce more.\n  In 1999, President Clinton nominated Evelyn to serve as the State \nDepartment's first Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy, and she was \nconfirmed by the Senate. He could not have picked a better person. What \nhappened back then was, we took the Information Agency and split it \ninto two pieces. The Broadcasting Board of Governors created an \nindependent entity for that, and then we brought the rest into the \nState Department, and Evelyn was the one who got that started and got \nit started on the right foot. She stayed there until the Bush \nadministration.\n  Since then, since 2002, Evelyn has continued a career in the Federal \nGovernment serving as the Director of Communications and Public Affairs \nfor the Smithsonian Institution.\n  The second witness today is Karen Hughes, who was appointed by \nPresident Bush to this position after serving as Counselor in the White \nHouse from 2000 to 2002. A Texas native, she holds a bachelor's degree \nfrom Southern Methodist University. Before embarking on a career in \npolitics, Karen worked in broadcast journalism for 7 years.\n  When she was appointed as Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy in \n2005, Karen was given the rank of Ambassador to underscore the \nimportance of public diplomacy as a central component of U.S. foreign \npolicy. While she was there, Karen implemented important changes \nincluding the creation of a rapid response unit in her bureau at the \nDepartment of State and many others.\n  Upon leaving State in 2007 to pursue work in the private sector, \nKaren told the BBC that her greatest achievement was ``transforming \npublic diplomacy and making it a national security priority, central to \neverything we do in government,'' which is the goal I believe continues \nto this day.\n  During her tenure as Under Secretary, she represented former \nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice in meetings with the Broadcasting \nBoard of Governors, and I had the opportunity to work with her on \npromoting a free press overseas.\n  I have worked with all three of these people. These are extraordinary \npublic servants, Republicans and Democrats; people who have \ndisagreements on many things but came to the government, took \nincredible financial sacrifice, and worked together to solve bipartisan \nproblems that have put the public diplomacy effort in a positive light.\n  When Karen Hughes left the State Department, President Bush nominated \nJames Glassman to take her place. James is a Harvard graduate and a \nprominent writer and journalist, to say the least. He was confirmed by \nthe Senate in June 2008 as Under Secretary of Public Diplomacy. Jim has \ndone a whole lot of things. He has held senior roles at a number of \nleading news organizations, including the New Republic, the Atlantic \nMonthly, and U.S. News and World Report. He is also a former owner and \neditor of Roll Call.\n  Before joining the Bush administration, Jim served as a fellow at the \nnonprofit American Enterprise Institute for 12 years. In 2007, Bush \nnominated him to be chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, \nand he served in that role until moving to the State Department several \nmonths later. As I said, I worked with Jim during my service on the \nboard, and I saw firsthand his dedication to promoting American values \nand policies overseas.\n  Since the Bush administration left office, Jim has been working in \nthe nonprofit sector, and he was recently selected to lead a new public \npolicy institute at the George W. Bush Presidential Library.\n  Think about this: Here I am, a Democrat, and I can tell my colleagues \nthere aren't three better people with whom I have worked in the whole \nworld than Evelyn Lieberman, Karen Hughes, and Jim Glassman. They care. \nWe have a lot of fights about a lot of things, but when it came to \npublic service, these three individuals all did incredible work.\n  Political appointees make up an important constituency in our Federal \nGovernment. When a President requests their service, they often make \nreal sacrifices to respond to that call, and I can tell you without a \nshadow of a doubt, these three made incredible\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\nsacrifices, financial and personal, to answer the call of this country.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Evelyn Lieberman, Karen \nHughes, and James Glassman for answering the call to serve and for \ntheir work on behalf of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1336-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1336-S1338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESPONDING TO THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, thank you very much. I appreciate the \nmany times Senator Kaufman comes to the floor to celebrate what is \nworking in Washington and the good work that is done by so many public \nofficials, but also public employees in our Federal Government.\n  I rise this afternoon to talk about the recession, unemployment, job \nloss--all of those related topics--and in a very particular way to \nfocus on the trauma, the suffering that a lot of Pennsylvanians and a \nlot of Americans are living through right now.\n  This has been and continues to be a horrific recession for the \nAmerican people. When we are confronted with that kind of economic \ndifficulty, we need to respond to it in very bold ways. I think we have \nover the last couple of years and even the last couple of weeks. I will \ntalk about that today. But we do need bold action to put people back to \nwork and to keep our economy moving in the right direction, as I think \nit is now, more than a year after the recovery bill was enacted.\n  In Pennsylvania, the unemployment situation is as follows: Our rate \nis at about 8.8 percent as of January. That is lower than a number of \nStates of comparable size. But, unfortunately, the rate doesn't tell us \nmuch. It doesn't often reflect the true meaning or the true impact of \nunemployment. We have 560,000 people in Pennsylvania out of work \nthrough no fault of their own. I think it is also important to put this \nin the context of where we have been and where we are now, not only in \nPennsylvania but across the country.\n  In late December of 2008, Congress took action to stave off the \nimpending collapse of our Nation's financial system. Months later, the \ndownturn required Congress to pass, as I mentioned before, the recovery \nbill known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, known by the \nacronym ARRA. I tend to refer to it as the recovery bill.\n  These actions were at the time--meaning the legislative actions--\nunpopular but absolutely necessary. I said we have worked on job \ncreation strategies and legislation more recently within the last \ncouple of weeks. Our majority leader Senator Reid has led us in that, \nand we are making progress. We have more to do.\n  First, let me go back in time a little bit to the fall of 2008. At \nthat time I happened to be a member of the Banking Committee. We were \ngiven briefings at that time on how perilous our financial system was; \nthat we were on the edge of a cliff in terms of the collapse of our \nfinancial system and, therefore, the collapse of our economy. We passed \nlegislation which included the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known by \nthe acronym TARP.\n  I know as soon as I say it, it doesn't bring back positive \nrecollections for people. It was not popular. Even the bill itself was \nnot that popular--the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act--and part of \nthat was the so called Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP. But I \nthink it is important to put the facts on the table about what has \nhappened since that time.\n  The Troubled Asset Relief Program was, indeed, unpopular, but we \nshould note that to date the Treasury Department has spent, invested, \nor loaned $500 billion through TARP. To date, almost $190 billion of \nthe $500 billion has been returned or paid to the Treasury Department. \nThese actions helped steer the economy back from the brink and, by the \nprogram's conclusion, we expect all but $100 billion of that $500 \nbillion to be repaid, which makes the Troubled Asset Relief Program \nsignificantly less expensive to taxpayers than earlier estimates. It \nmet some of the predictions at the time by some of us that the money \nwould be paid back. So that is good news. It is not enough, though, to \nreport on good news.\n  We had to take other action. We took action when we passed the \nrecovery bill in the early part of 2009. Just by way of example, \nPennsylvania is on track to receive more than $26 billion through the \nrecovery bill, including billions in direct tax relief. We had 4.9 \nmillion Pennsylvanians who got tax relief as part of the recovery bill. \nAmong, or part of, I should say, that more than $26 billion, $13.15 \nbillion was in so-called formula-driven funding for health, education, \ninfrastructure, job training, and other aid. It was a tremendous boost \nto the economy in Pennsylvania, not only creating jobs but preventing \nthe erosion of our job creation strategies and preventing people from \nbeing laid off, including teachers in school districts, law enforcement \nofficials, as well as in jump-starting the economy of Pennsylvania. We \nstill have a ways to go. We still have basically another year of a \njump-starting effect for the recovery bill.\n  Across the country, when we measure the impact of the recovery bill, \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which is known by the \nacronym CBO--we hear about it all the time, but they are a referee in a \nsense in Washington, an arbiter of what the numbers mean. The CBO \nreported a few weeks ago that the Recovery Act added between 1 million \nand 2.1 million jobs by the fourth quarter of 2009. Again, impressive, \nhalfway basically--or almost, I should say, halfway through the \nrecovery bill's implementation at the end of 2009, 1 million to 2 \nmillion jobs. The CBO also said the Recovery Act raised economic growth \nby 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent over that same period. So it has \ncontributed to growth.\n  The CBO Director, Doug Elmendorf, said during a recent Joint Economic \nhearing:\n\n       [T]he policies that were enacted in the bill are increasing \n     GDP and employment relative to what it otherwise would be.\n\n  So that is the CBO talking about the recovery bill as another way to \nmeasure. There are lots of ways to measure the impact and, I would \nargue, the success of it.\n  In January of 2009 the country lost 1.2 million jobs. Job loss, as of \nthe most recent report for February, was a little more than 60,000 \njobs, just about 62,000 jobs. So that reduction or diminution in the \nnumber of jobs lost from 1.5 million jobs to 62,000 jobs is, indeed, \nsubstantial progress but, again, it is not enough. We have to keep \ngoing. We have to keep putting in place strategies to create many more \njobs.\n  The facts speak for themselves. More people are currently employed \nand more goods and services are being produced as a result of the \nRecovery Act. Put another way, if the Recovery Act had not been \nenacted, the economic situation would be much worse than it is today. \nThat is an understatement, if we did not pass that legislation.\n  But we need to do more and move forward. We need to pass legislation \nto continue to create jobs. That is why I am standing today in support \nof passage of the American Workers, State, and Business Relief Act, the \nlegislation we are now considering. This legislation contains vital \npolicies that will support our workers and our businesses as we recover \nfrom the recent economic recession. The most important part of the \nlegislation is the extension of unemployment insurance and COBRA health \ninsurance through December 31 of this year.\n  The national unemployment rate is 9.7 percent. It is expected to \nremain at this level, unfortunately, through most of 2010. I mentioned \nearlier that in Pennsylvania it is about a point lower, 8.8 percent. \nThere are 560,000 Pennsylvanians who are out of work. These numbers are \nfar too high for us to in any way be satisfied with the positive impact \nthe recovery bill has had and other measures we have taken.\n  We are about to pass and enact into law the HIRE Act--four provisions \nagreed to in a bipartisan way. We have to do more than that as well. \nCongress must continue to provide for comprehensive unemployment \nbenefits and a subsidy to pay for COBRA health insurance for those who \nhave lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The eligibility for \nemergency unemployment compensation and COBRA premium assistance will \nexpire at the end of March. According to our State's department of \nlabor and industry, hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvania workers could \nlose unemployment benefits over the next several months without an \nextension.\n  An extension of federally funded unemployment compensation and the\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\nCOBRA health insurance subsidy through the end of this year, December \n31, is necessary for several reasons. First, State labor departments--\nand this is true across the board--will now be under pressure to \nconstantly update their systems and inform constituents of the changes \nin Federal law. Why should we keep passing an extension of a month or \ntwo or three when we could pass legislation to give certainty, most \nimportantly to that unemployed worker and his or her family--they are \nthe most important part of this story--but also to State labor \ndepartments and other officials in departments so they do not have to \ncontinue to make changes to their system. People who were recently laid \noff will constantly be reminded that their unemployment benefits may \nrun out sooner than expected, especially at a time when there are six \napplicants for every one job.\n  Second, our State labor department makes a point that at a time when \nmillions of people do not have health care coverage, failure to provide \nan adequate safety net to ensure people maintain adequate and \naffordable health coverage will only add to the rolls of the uninsured \nin the country.\n  During my travels throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I have \nmet and I will continue to meet or hear from numerous people who are in \ndesperate need of help.\n  Recently, the Hanlon family of Pleasantville, PA, contacted my office \nto share their story. Here is but one story, but it is very telling \nabout what families are up against.\n  Lisa and Jeff Hanlon have four young children. Until recently, Jeff \nand Lisa were both employed by the same company and, in their words, \n``the family lived a solid middle-class experience.'' Jeff worked at \nthe company for nearly 8 years. Over time, he began to experience \nsevere health problems, including suffering three heart attacks. When \nthe economic downturn hit, Jeff was downsized by the company and the \nfamily lost their health insurance. The blow of losing health insurance \ncould not have come at a worse time. Just one of Jeff's hospital bills \nwas $398,000.\n  Due to his medical condition, Jeff was unable to work. Too sick to \nwork, it took a long time for Jeff to apply for and receive Social \nSecurity. During this time, the family experienced severe hardship and \nsold everything of value to keep their home and stay afloat. Mrs. \nHanlon told our office that their children went without medical help \nfor a year--young children going without medical help for a year \nbecause their father or mother loses a job. That is unacceptable. We \nshould act on the statement ``that is unacceptable in America today.'' \nWhat the Hanlons had to do was choose what bills to pay to feed their \nchildren. Without means, the children were not able to participate in \nsports or any school activities. Even now, the family's current income \nis a fraction of what it was.\n  Another example, in addition to the Hanlons, is Janet Lee Smith, a \nsingle mother of two girls. Her difficulties began back in 2003 when \nshe was laid off from a 26-year career. As Janet tells the story, the \ncompany began outsourcing to Mexico, which made her position obsolete.\n  Faced with the tremendous responsibility of raising two young girls, \nshe decided to go back to school while still working. In 2005, she \ngraduated from a Penn State extension campus with an associate's degree \nin human development and family studies. Unfortunately, additional \neducation was not enough to get her a job in this tough economic \nclimate. So once again, Janet turned to odd jobs and part-time jobs \nuntil 2008, when she was finally blessed with a full-time job as an \nadministrative assistant. Nine months later, once again she was told \nthat business was slow and she would, in her words, ``once again become \na statistic as a `dislocated worker.'''\n  Today, unable to find full-time work, Janet is back in school and \nworking part time. She says she feels she has to do whatever she can \n``to get her girls through school healthy and strong.'' In Janet's \nwords:\n\n       It is not a good feeling at all being told that you are \n     going to be laid off, especially when you are the only income \n     that your family depends on. It has been a struggle keeping \n     up my spirits and trying not to let my girls see that I am \n     stressed.\n\n  That is what Janet tells us, and that is what the Hanlon family tells \nus. Despite these challenges--and I have seen this across our State--\ndespite these challenges, Janet is still optimistic. She says:\n\n       I am confident that this time I will be able to find that \n     one job. I know that they are out there. I had a good job \n     before and I will have a good job again.\n\n  I heard this in many instances across our State. I was at a job \ncenter in south central Pennsylvania, just outside Gettysburg. I met \nwith 8 of those 560,000 people who are out of work. I heard the same \nthing there. Eight Pennsylvanians--at least six were over the age of 50 \nand the others were over the age of 60--had never been out of work in \ntheir lives, never had to rely on food stamps, and almost in every case \nnever had to rely on unemployment insurance. And they find themselves \nin this predicament. Despite that, there is a burning flame of optimism \ninside them. Despite their setbacks, they are willing to keep filling \nout forms, keep applying, keeping their heads up, and keep moving \nforward.\n  Debbie, a woman, who was one of those eight I spoke to that day, \nprobably said it best--simply: All I want to do is get back to work. We \nsee that across the board.\n  What are we going to do in Congress? Are we going to preach? We will \nonly have unemployment for another couple weeks or a few months. We are \nonly going to have COBRA insurance for a couple of weeks, a couple of \nmonths. It is easy for us to say when we have health care, Federal \nemployees that we are, and we have job security.\n  For those who say we should not do it, we should not extend these \nsafety net programs, before they make a speech about it, they should \ntell their constituents about why they do not want to support it. Tell \nJanet Smith and tell the Hanlon family why it is not a good idea to \nsupport unemployment insurance and COBRA health insurance. The security \nof Washington allows a lot of people to avoid that conversation. The \nsecurity of being a Federal employee, of being a Senator or a House \nMember and having health coverage and job security allows us the luxury \nof not having to look those families in the eye and tell them. I think \nif people were more honest about it around here, they would.\n  In addition to aiding families who are desperately in need of putting \nfood on the table and a roof over their heads, an extension of the \nunemployment insurance has a direct impact on our Nation's economy. We \nknow, for example, that again the Congressional Budget Office says that \nfor every $1 spent in unemployment insurance benefits, upwards of $1.90 \nis contributed to the gross domestic product.\n  Mark Zandi, an economist I have quoted often, a Pennsylvanian--a \nlittle bias there, but he also worked on Senator McCain's Presidential \ncampaign, so he is not someone coming from a purely Democratic point of \nview--Mark Zandi has stated that for every $1 spent in unemployment \ninsurance benefits, upwards of $1.63 is contributed to the gross \ndomestic product. If you spend a buck on unemployment insurance, the \ntaxpayers get $1.63 back in return.\n  In addition to unemployment insurance and COBRA health insurance, the \nAmerican Workers, State, and Business Relief Act provides a range of \ntax credits that will help businesses and State governments to create \nand retain jobs. For example, the bill contains an extension of the \nbiodiesel fuel credit, which will put a number of Pennsylvanians back \nto work across the country.\n  The bill contains a research and development tax credit that will \nprovide businesses with financial resources to compete in a global \nmarketplace.\n  Finally, the bill will assist our teachers by providing a tax \ndeduction for those teachers who spend their own money to buy supplies \nfor their classrooms and students--something I have seen in \nPennsylvania for many years, teachers constantly reaching into their \nown pockets to buy supplies and equipment they need for them to teach \nour children.\n  I say in conclusion, I and I know many others strongly support \npassage of the American Workers, State, and Business Relief Act. This \nlegislation is necessary to continue to spur economic growth and create \njobs in Pennsylvania and across our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendments fall; that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate can take an important step today \nin alleviating the incredible strains this continuing economic crisis \nis having on thousands of families in my State, and millions of \nfamilies across America. In approving the American Workers, State, and \nBusiness Relief Act of 2010, we can end what has been an agonizing \nprocession of will-we-or-won't-we votes on extending unemployment \nbenefits and COBRA insurance subsidies for those who have lost their \njobs. And we can ensure that, by extending enhanced Federal payments to \nState Medicaid programs, crucial health coverage and other vital State \nservices are not cut.\n  Those who doubt the wisdom of extending unemployment and COBRA \nbenefits until the end of this year should hear the phone calls and \nread the letters that have come into my office over the past few weeks. \nAs the Congress has debated, and delayed, on the question of whether to \npass another short-term extension, these Americans, left jobless by a \ncrisis not of their own making, wondered if the economic lifeline that \nkeeps food on their tables and shelter over their heads would be \nsevered. By approving this legislation, we will ensure that these \nfamilies are not left in limbo by delays in Congress. Giving them some \nmeasure of certainty, at a time when the economic crisis has turned so \nmuch upside-down, is the right thing to do. What's more, continuing \nthese benefits is one of the most important steps we can take to \nnurture the fragile recovery of our economy. These payments benefit not \njust families coping with unemployment, but provide an immediate \nstimulus to local economies that have been devastated by the recession.\n  Likewise, the decision to extend enhanced Federal Medicaid assistance \npercentages, or FMAP, funding to States, boosts the entire economy \nwhile helping those in the greatest need. Michigan and other States \nhave made clear that without this extension, we would leave giant holes \nin their budget. In the absence of enhanced funding, the steps the \nStates would have to take balance their budgets could mean devastating \ncuts to vital programs that serve the victims of this crisis. Such cuts \nwould also dampen the recovery, removing a pillar that has kept \neconomic activity from collapsing during the crisis. Extending these \npayments gives States, and the citizens they serve, much-needed \ncertainty.\n  This legislation also would continue tax provisions that can provide \nadditional support to economic recovery and job creation. In extending \nthe research and development tax credit and other measures, we give our \nbusinesses another tool they can use as they seek to regain ground, \nbegin growing again and start putting people back to work. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in voting for this important legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is passing the Satellite \nTelevision Extension and Localism Act, STELA. This legislation \nmodernizes and extends important provisions of the Satellite Home \nViewer Act, which contains statutory copyright licenses and \nCommunications Act authorizations that allow for the retransmission of \nbroadcast television signals by satellite and cable providers.\n  Ensuring that Americans have access to broadcast television content \nis important, and it is particularly relevant for consumers in rural \nareas who might not otherwise be able to receive these signals over the \nair. The legislation that the Senate is passing today will ensure that \nnobody will be left in the dark for the foreseeable future.\n  The Satellite Home Viewer Act provides cable and satellite companies \nwith statutory licenses to allow them to retransmit the content of \nbroadcast television stations. It also contains important \nauthorizations in the Communications Act that facilitate these \nretransmissions. Broadcast television plays a critical role in cities \nand towns across the country, and remains the primary way in which \nconsumers are able to access local content such as news, weather, and \nsports.\n  Cable and satellite providers help to expand the footprint of \nbroadcast stations by allowing them to reach viewers who are unable to \nreceive signals over the air. Vermont is an example of how cable and \nsatellite companies can provide service to consumers in rural areas who \nmight not otherwise receive these signals.\n  Vermonters will see improved service when this legislation is \nenacted. As the act has been reauthorized over the years, I have worked \nto improve the service that Vermonters receive from cable and satellite \ncompanies. Residents in southern Vermont have seen improvements. \nWindham and Bennington Counties are not considered part of the \nBurlington television market that encompasses the rest of the State, \nand for many years those residents were unable to receive Vermont \nbroadcast stations by satellite. Congress changed this in 2004, and \nDirecTV has been providing these Vermonters with access to Vermont \nstations ever since.\n  I am also pleased that under this legislation, DISH Network will be \nable to provide their subscribers in southern Vermont with the same \nservice. As soon as the DISH Network uses this authority, virtually \neveryone in the State will be able to access the news and information \nthat is truly important to Vermonters, whether it is the debate over \nrelicensing the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon or the UVM \nbasketball team's quest to make the NCAA Tournament.\n  One other important way that STELA will preserve and improve existing \nservice for consumers is by correcting a flaw in the statutory \ncopyright license for the cable industry. An unintended result of \ncurrent law is that the cable license requires the cable industry to \npay copyright holders for signals that many of their subscribers do not \nactually receive. This is often referred to as the phantom signal \nproblem. The effect of this anomaly in the law is that Comcast is \nrequired to pay copyright royalties based on their subscriber base \nacross the northeast for the Canadian television content\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\nthat is only provided to subscribers in Burlington, VT.\n  The bill that the Senate is passing today corrects this flaw by \ngiving the cable industry the flexibility to continue to provide \nsignals that are tailored to local interests--signals that might \notherwise have been pulled from cable lineups. This will benefit \nindustry and consumers. For instance, subscribers in Burlington will \nstill be able to receive programming such as ``Hockey Night in \nCanada,'' which has been a tradition, without fear that Comcast will \nhave to remove the channel or raise prices because it is being charged \nroyalties based on subscribers in Boston.\n  In addition, the legislation will expand consumer access to their \nStates' public television programming and low-power, community-oriented \nstations that will promote media diversity.\n  This bill is the product of many hours of hard work and compromise \namong four committees in both Houses of Congress. No single Member or \ncommittee chairman would have written it in this exact way, but the \nfinal language represents a fair compromise on important issues. I \nwould have preferred that the language approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee last year with respect to multicast signals be included in \nthis legislation. However, under the bill the Senate passed today, \nmulticast signals will be treated differently than primary broadcast \nsignals for a short period of time, even if they are broadcasting an \nadditional network. In Vermont, WFFF is the local Fox affiliate, but it \ncarries the CW Network on a multicast signal. This is programming that \nis otherwise unavailable to Vermonters. There should be no distinction \nin this case between a primary signal and a multicast signal. I \nappreciate the difficult nature of the issue, however, and believe that \nthe compromise that was struck in STELA is a fair one.\n  The final bill language also provides a pathway to lift a court-\nordered injunction that currently prevents DISH Network from using the \ndistant signal license, in exchange for DISH launching service in all \n210 television markets across the country. Providing service to all 210 \nmarkets is a goal that I have long believed ought to be achieved. I \nbelieve the language included in the Senate Judiciary Committee-passed \nbill provided better incentives for launching additional markets \nwithout lifting a court-ordered injunction. As a matter of policy, \nlifting a court-ordered injunction based on copyright infringement is \nsomething I generally do not support, but others insisted upon it and \nit is part of the compromise embodied in STELA.\n  This is a good bill that will preserve and improve the service that \nconsumers across the country are accustomed to receiving. I am pleased \nthat the Senate has adopted this legislation. I look forward to its \nprompt consideration and adoption by the House and the President \nsigning it into law.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge the immediate \nconfirmation of Michael Punke to be the U.S. Ambassador to the World \nTrade Organization.\n  The United States has been without an ambassador for more than 6 \nmonths because one Republican Senator has been holding up his \nnomination for no good reason. This is another example of standing in \nthe way of doing what is right for our country.\n  Michael Punke is well qualified. He is ready to serve. He happens to \nbe from Montana. Michael's qualifications are as follows: Michael \nreceived his undergraduate degree in international affairs from George \nWashington University. He then attended Cornell Law School where he \nearned his juris doctorate with a specialization in international legal \naffairs. He also served as editor in chief of the Cornell International \nLaw Journal.\n  For 14 years Michael served in government and private practice in \nWashington, DC. From 1991 to 1992 he acted as international trade \ncounsel to Senator Max Baucus, then-chairman of the Finance Committee's \nInternational Trade Subcommittee.\n  Michael has been fully vetted. He received strong bipartisan support \nin his Senate Finance Committee hearings, and the Finance Committee \nunanimously approved his appointment. Let me repeat that. Michael Punke \npassed out of the Finance Committee with the support of all the \nSenators on that committee. That means all the Democrats and all the \nRepublicans supported his nomination, including the junior Senator from \nKentucky, who continues to hold up his nomination. The reason Senator \nBunning is giving for his hold? He wants Canada to repeal parts of the \nantismoking law that they passed in the Canadian Parliament. I don't \nthink that holds water.\n\n  This job is too important to remain open because one Senator has a \nflimsy policy beef with a foreign country. Common sense has to prevail.\n  Expanding U.S. exports will help rebuild our economy by creating \njobs. Michael Punke is an important part of that goal. Michael will be \nresponsible for promoting and securing U.S. trade interests abroad to \ncreate jobs for America's farmers, workers, and businesses right here \nat home. Our trading partners use his absence as an excuse to stall \nprogress on serious negotiations. Standing in the way is hurting \nAmerica's businesses and workers who are affected by these very \nimportant negotiations.\n  Michael could be working right now to create jobs for American \nfarmers, workers, and businesses. But, instead, some issue about \ntobacco in another country is keeping us from moving forward. That is \nnot right.\n  That is why a broad coalition of America's farmers and businesses \nhave been calling for quick approval of Michael Punke by the Senate. A \ncoalition of 42 food and agriculture groups wrote Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell last January to call for Michael's quick confirmation \nsaying:\n\n       U.S. food and agriculture exports are under assault in many \n     markets with trading partners erecting even more barriers in \n     recent months . . . The longer the delay in confirming Mr. \n     Punke, the more likely that the U.S. loses exports and jobs.\n\n  So if we act today to confirm Michael Punke, the Senate will have \ndone something right now to help create jobs in America. Holding up \nMichael Punke does just the opposite. For all these reasons--oh, and \nmay I add this guy is one quality individual--I would request we \nconfirm Michael Punke in the Senate, we do it as soon as possible, and \nconfirm him to the position of U.S. ambassador to the World Trade \nOrganization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1340-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BIG SANDY PIONEERS\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to share some news from my hometown \nof Big Sandy, MT. It is a town of just over 700 folks. That means in \nMontana, it is a Class C town. In Montana, Class C basketball isn't \njust a tradition, it is a way of life. For a lot of Montanans, the \nentire year revolves around that basketball season.\n  Last week, Coach Roy Lackner led his boys--the Big Sandy Pioneers--to \nthe Class C basketball tournament. They fought their way to the \nchampionship game on Saturday night and they played another outstanding \nClass C team in the Power Pirates.\n  It was one of those games folks will be talking about for years. \nAfter a last-second foul, with less than a second on the clock, senior \nforward Corbin Pearson broke the 49-to-49 tie by sinking both free \nthrows. I was 6 years old the last time Big Sandy boys won a State \nchampionship. That was 47 years ago.\n  So I rise in honor of Coach Lackner, assistant coach Gregg King, and \nthe Big Sandy boys basketball team, including Corbin Pearson, Zac \nLeader, Blake Brumwell, Taylor Ophus, Colter Darlington, Trevor \nLackner, Jeff Zeiger, Scott Drga, Dallas Briese, Kaden Beck, Matt \nGullickson, and C.J. Hansen.\n  I am sharing this good news not just because these young men are from \nmy hometown--although I am very proud of that--I am sharing this news \nbecause we can all use a reminder that hard work, working together, and \nteamwork pays off. Coach Lackner says winning a State championship was \na matter of perseverance. It is. The Big Sandy Pioneers persevered. \nThey worked hard as a team. They won their championship, and I \ncongratulate them on that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very happy to be here this \nafternoon with the most excellent ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, to lay down our \nTransportation bill, and in so doing we say that our transportation \nsystem is at a crossroads, and not a comfortable one.\n  For decades, the Federal Aviation Administration has done an \nexcellent job of operating the world's most complex airline system. \nNobody else comes close. The system has served us very well. Not only \nis it the safest airspace system in the world, it is a critical \ncomponent of the national economy. I cannot overstate the importance of \na\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\nvibrant and strong aviation system. It is fundamental to our Nation's \nlong-term growth--from the largest cities to the very smallest of \ntowns--because it connects our citizens and it connects our businesses \nwith the global economy.\n  Increasingly, however, our air transportation system and the FAA--the \nFederal Aviation Administration--are strained beyond capacity. Our \nskies and airports have become plagued with congestion and delay, and \nwhat is more, on a pretty regular basis. Over the past decade, we have \nseen passengers delayed for hours on runways, and we hear about it. \nDuring peak times, such as the holidays, the system is often \nparalyzed--stopped. Disruptions at just one key airport--maybe JFK, \nmaybe O'Hare, maybe Los Angeles, should they be in trouble at any one \nof those places--can quickly cascade throughout the entire system.\n  With airline capacity cut, these delays can easily extend to days for \npassengers who cannot find flights with empty seats because the \ncapacity has been reduced. Our constituents are frustrated about flying \nand, frankly, rightly so.\n  When our economy recovers, and I believe that growth has slowly \nbegun--we shall see--congestion and delay will only get worse. The FAA \npredicts that commercial air traffic will increase by nearly 50 percent \nover the next decade. Putting that in other terms, from our current \nlevel of 700 million passengers a year, it will be well over a billion \npassengers per year. In a complex system as ours, everything has to \nwork so the possibility of a meltdown of the air traffic control system \nmay in fact become a reality and this will put passenger safety at \nextreme risk.\n  These are not the only troubling signs; there are more. While \naviation has an excellent safety record, as I have indicated, the \nFederal Aviation Administration and the industry's focus on safety and \nvigilance in maintaining it as the highest priority, has come into \nquestion--the question of safety. The grounding of thousands of \naircraft throughout the system in 2008 raised questions about the \nquality of airline maintenance practices and the FAA's ability to \nprovide sufficient oversight of air carriers.\n  The tragic accident of flight 3407 has exposed problems with pilot \ntraining, crew fatigue, and the ability of the industry to assure the \ntraveling public that there is one level of safety throughout the \nentire system, and that does not exist.\n  For all these reasons I stand here, along with my distinguished \ncolleague, and encourage my colleagues in as strong a fashion as I can \npossibly muster to move forward and pass S. 1451, the FAA Air \nTransportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act. I will only \nsay that once.\n  I want to spend a few minutes discussing how and why we have made so \nlittle progress in addressing the issues facing our Nation's aviation \nsystem. In 1999 and 2000, the aviation system was experiencing the \nworst congestion and delays in its history. There was, indeed, a \ngrowing recognition that fundamental change was needed. Nonetheless, I \nworked with Senator Lott to author Vision 100, in effect the 2003 FAA \nreauthorization bill. This bill laid the foundation to build a modern \ndigital satellite-based air traffic control system. We created the \njoint planning and development office and authorized a significant \nincrease in FAA's capital budget to meet the specific air traffic \ncontrol modernization needs--a lot of what I say will be based on \nthat--an increase based upon the administration's own budget requests.\n  But instead of investing in the system in 2004, 2005, and 2006, the \nprevious administration proposed dramatic cuts in the FAA's facilities \nand equipment, the F account, the account that funds air traffic \ncontrol modernization.\n  The urgency of 2000 understandably but regrettably waned as air \ntraffic fell after 9/11. Today we find ourselves in a similar \nsituation. The recession has prevented widespread delay--temporarily. \nWe must not let this temporary reprieve keep us from taking action to \naddress these concerns once again. Our economy has begun, as I \nindicated, to slowly turn around and I am confident that demand for air \ntravel will soon begin to grow. If we do not act quickly, our system \nwill simply not have the capacity to cope with the growth in demand.\n  That is where you get in trouble. I believe everyone in aviation \nrecognizes the need to modernize our national air transportation system \nin order to meet the growth in passenger traffic. In addition to \ncreating much more capacity, a new satellite-based air traffic control \nsystem, an ATC system, will allow airplanes to move more efficiently by \ntaking more direct routes, being able to be closer to each other but \nwithout danger. These improvements will save our economy millions of \ndollars annually.\n  Most importantly, the next generation air transportation system, \nwhich we refer to as ``NextGen,'' will dramatically improve the safety \nof air transportation by providing pilots and air traffic controllers \nwith better situational awareness. They will be able to see other air \ntraffic and detailed weather maps in real time. President Obama clearly \nrecognized the value of investing in our air transportation system and \nthis is, in fact, reflected in his fiscal year 2011 budget request. The \nadministration has proposed spending a total of $1.1 billion in fiscal \n2011 on the NextGen program, which is more than a 30-percent increase. \nThat is not in line with the so-called freeze. So it is a 30-percent \nincrease over 2010.\n  We oversee all of transportation--trains, cars, airplanes, trucks, \nwhatever you have. I will say at this point for the record that the \nsame financial requests or needs for the Surface Transportation Board, \nwhich interacts with railroads and shippers, has not been increased \nsufficiently. It is $31 million and it needs to be closer to $44 \nmillion. These efforts, however, are only the first steps in a long \njourney. Modernizing the ATC system will require sustained focus and \nsubstantial resources. S. 1451 takes concrete steps to make sure that \nthe FAA accelerates the NextGen--that is the modern system--programs, \nand that the agency implements modernization efforts in an effective \nand efficient manner over the long run. The FAA estimates that NextGen \nwill cost the agency $20 billion through 2025, and the airlines another \n$20 billion in aircraft equipage--how they, as individual airplanes, \nrespond and react to that system so it can work.\n  I have worked with Senators Inouye and Baucus to reach a deal that I \nbelieve moves us in the right direction. S. 1451, the bill under \ndiscussion, will create a new subaccount with the aviation trust fund \nto fund FAA's modernization efforts. This modernization subaccount will \ndedicate $500 million annually to NextGen efforts. I appreciate the \nhard work of my colleagues on this provision, to develop it, to make it \nbecome possible.\n  I wish to spend some time talking about the highest priority in \naviation and that is called safety. Statistically, the United States \nhas the safest air transportation system in the world. I indicated \nthat. But statistics do not tell you the whole story. It has been a \nlittle more than a year since the tragic crash of flight 3407 in \nBuffalo, NY, that took the lives of 50 people. It is clear from the \nNational Transportation Safety Board investigation that we need to take \nserious steps to improve pilot training, address flight crew fatigue, \nto make the cockpit isolated from extraneous conversation, and reform \nair carrier employment practices. I commend Senator Dorgan in \nparticular for the work he has done to promote the safety in the \naftermath of this accident. He has attached himself to this cause \nferociously.\n  The committee's work has prompted the FAA to initiate a number of \nactivities to improve aviation safety. The agency has been able to get \nmany air carriers to make voluntary commitments to implement important \nsafety measures and the agency has committed to initiate new \nregulations on flight and duty time regulations in coming months.\n  Despite this progress, our work remains far from complete. We must \nalso make certain that the FAA remains as vigilant on other safety \npriorities--the oversight of airline operations and the maintenance, \nreducing runway incursions, and air traffic controller staffing issues. \nJust as with modernization, we must make sure the FAA has the tools and \nthe resources to accomplish these safety objectives.\n  I am especially proud of the safety title we have developed and \nincluded in this bill, S. 1451. This title will do the\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\nfollowing, in part: address pilot fatigue by mandating the FAA revise \nflight and duty time limitations based on the latest in scientific \nresearch; ensure one level of safety exists throughout commercial \naircraft operations by requiring that all carriers adopt aviation \nsafety standards. The bill also requires stronger safety oversight of \nforeign repair stations, which is a very controversial subject. They \nare a relatively small percentage of air maintenance. Most of it is \ndone in this country. But there is some argument as to how well it is \ndone overseas.\n  These are critical measures that will help us identify safety issues \nand prevent problems before they occur and this is the best way to \naddress safety.\n  A word on small community air service. The State I come from is not \nlarge. In fact, it is small and it is rural. But it is important and it \nis a good place. We need to keep America's small communities connected \nto the rest of the world. If one lives in a rural State or in a rural \npart of a rural State, one is no less important than if one lives on \nFifth Avenue in New York City. The nature of the individuals may be the \nsame, the entrepreneurship may be the same, but access to international \naviation or transcontinental aviation is not the same. The continuing \neconomic crisis has hit the United States airline industry very hard. \nThey are in and out of bankruptcy. We have all read about that. They \nare cutting back on things they offer that they used to offer in flight \nand do not now. We grump about it but there is a reason they do that so \nI don't grump about it, and this affects the future of hundreds of \nrural communities across our country.\n  In their effort to cut costs, air carriers have drastically reduced \nservice to small or isolated communities. From a business point of \nview, I guess that makes sense. From my policy point of view, that does \nnot make sense and it is not fair. They are the first routes to go, the \nrural ones. They go in tough economic times, and that is where we are \nright now. The reduction or elimination of air service has a \ndevastating effect on the economy of a community. Having adequate air \nservice is not just a matter of convenience but also a matter of \neconomic survival. Without access to reliable air service, no business \nis willing to locate their operations in these areas of the country, no \nmatter how attractive the quality of life. Airports are economic \nengines that attract critical new development opportunities and jobs.\n  The Federal Government needs to provide additional resources and \ntools for small communities to help them attract adequate air service. \nOur legislation does this by building on existing programs and \nstrengthening them. Authorizing funding for the Essential Air Service \nProgram is increased to $175 million annually. The bill also extends \nthe Small Community Air Service Development Program--incredibly \nimportant for small airports. This program has provided dozens of \ncommunities with the resources necessary to attract and retain air \nservice.\n  In conclusion, when I began work on this bill, I had four simple \ngoals: No. 1, take steps to address the critical safety concerns--that \nwas always No. 1 and always will be; No. 2, to establish a roadmap for \nthe implementation of NextGen and accelerate the FAA's key \nmodernization programs; No. 3, make certain we adequately invest in \nairport infrastructure; and, No. 4, continue to improve small \ncommunities' access to the Nation's aviation system.\n  I believe we have worked hard in a truly bipartisan fashion with \nSenator Dorgan, obviously Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, \nSenator DeMint from South Carolina, to develop a bill that I think \nadvances these goals and which all of my colleagues can support.\n  This bill is not being held up. There is a reason for that. We worked \nout our problems early. This bill takes the steps needed to advance the \nsystem. The FAA must be provided with the tools, the resources, and the \nclear direction and deadlines to make sure the agency provides \neffective oversight of the aviation industry itself.\n  I think we all recognize the United States must significantly expand \nthe capacity of our Nation's transportation system. There are no quick \nor easy solutions to the problem, and I believe our situation is going \nto get worse before it gets better. But we do have to take the actions \nwe can right now. We cannot ignore the aviation system anymore.\n  We cannot float on nice memories of a glorious past. The United \nStates is losing its position as a global leader on aviation. The \nAmerican public is not happy with the aviation system or with us. We \nmust move boldly, just as we have with our investments in high-speed \nrail, or risk losing our leadership in the world.\n  Given the challenges our Nation's aviation system faces, we must act \nnow to pass S. 1451, the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and \nSafety Improvement Act.\n  Is it the order that the Senator from Texas will have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) There is no order to that \neffect.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Business as usual.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield proudly to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nand I wanted to say, as the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, I \nbelieve this FAA reauthorization bill is a very good, solid bill. It is \nvery bipartisan, and we have worked through many of the sticky issues \nthat have held up the long-term extension of FAA reauthorization.\n  I think this is a bill that most everyone on this floor will support \nif the bill stays as it has come out of the committee. I want to say \nalso that I believe the Aviation Subcommittee chair and ranking \nmembers, Senators Dorgan and DeMint, deserve a lot of credit for this \nbipartisan bill as well because it does provide a solid roadmap for the \ndirection and future of our aviation system, and its enactment is long \noverdue.\n  So I very much appreciate--as a matter of fact, Senator Rockefeller \nand I had been the chairman and ranking member of the Aviation \nSubcommittee when this bill was written. Then we both went to the full \ncommittee, chairman and ranking member slots, and so we have now two \nnew Aviation Subcommittee chair and ranking members who have also done \nan excellent job.\n  So I feel strongly about this bill and how much it is going to do for \nthe stability of our system. When you are looking at the reason for an \nFAA reauthorization bill, you have to have stability. We need to \nimprove aviation safety. We need to modernize our air traffic control \nsystem, which is known as NextGen. We have to do that.\n  We are behind the rest of the Nations in the world that have major \nair traffic control systems in this modern age. If we are going to keep \nup with the added traffic in our airspace, we are going to have to have \nNextGen. This bill does provide the way forward on that.\n  We need to make the investments in infrastructure where there is a \nknowledge that this infrastructure support will be ongoing.\n  I am the former Chairman, Vice Chairman--actually Acting Chairman as \nwell--of the National Transportation Safety Board. So I know the \ncrucial mission the FAA has in overseeing our Nation's airlines and the \naviation system.\n  Aviation safety and the public trust that go along with it is the \nbedrock of our national aviation policy. We cannot allow for any \ndegradation of safety to the flying public. I believe this bill goes a \nlong way toward achieving that goal. While I continue to have great \nconfidence in the safety of our aviation system, it was made obvious \nthat there is still room for improvement after the tragic crash of \nColgan flight 3407 in Buffalo, NY, last year.\n  Despite the remarkable safety record of the U.S. aviation industry, \nthat accident reminds us that we must remain vigilant and always look \nfor ways to improve our safety system.\n  While tremendous strides have been made in aircraft technology and \nmaintenance practices in recent decades, little has been done to \naddress the human factors side of the safety equation in areas such as \npilot fatigue, quality of pilot training, quality of pilot experience, \ncommuting and pilot professional responsibility.\n  Over the course of a year, and through six Commerce Committee \nhearings regarding the aftermath of\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\nthe Colgan accident, we worked in a bipartisan manner to craft \nproposals to address these human factors issues.\n  During these hearings, the family members of those lost in flight \n3407 were there every step of the way. I applaud their continued \nactivism for improving aviation safety.\n  A few of the safety improvements that we call for in this legislation \ninclude mandating the FAA complete a rulemaking on flight time limits \nand rest requirements for pilots; improving safety for helicopter \nemergency medical service operations; addressing inconsistent \napplication of FAA air worthiness directives by improving the voluntary \ndisclosure reporting processes to ensure adequate actions are taken in \nresponse to reports; and limiting the ability of FAA inspectors to work \nfor air carriers over which they have oversight; also conducting \nindependent reviews of safety issues identified by employees; requiring \nenhanced safety oversight of foreign repair stations; taking steps to \nensure ``one level of safety'' exists in commercial aircraft \noperations, including a mandate that all carriers adopt the Aviation \nSafety Action Programs and Flight Operational Quality Assurance \nPrograms.\n  This legislation would also require air carriers to examine a pilot's \nhistory for the past 10 years when considering hiring an individual, \nand annual reporting on the implementation of NTSB recommendations and \nreevaluating flight crew training, testing, and certification \nrequirements.\n  Another priority and centerpiece of this bill is focusing on and \nexpediting the FAA's air traffic control modernization program, known \nas NextGen. The FAA operates the largest and safest air traffic control \nsystem in the world. In fact, the FAA air traffic control system \nhandles almost half the world's air traffic activity. The United States \nis a leader in developing and implementing new technologies to create a \nsafer, more efficient airspace system.\n  However, today's air traffic control system is not much different \nfrom that used in the 1960s. This system is still fundamentally based \non radar tracking and ground-based infrastructure. NextGen will move \nmuch of the air traffic control infrastructure from ground-based to \nsatellite-based by replacing antiquated, costly ground infrastructure \nwith orbiting satellites and onboard automation. By doing so, the FAA \nwill be able to make our aviation system more safe and efficient while \nalso increasing capacity.\n  Some of the modernization provisions in the bill include establishing \nclear deadlines for the adoption of existing global positioning system \nnavigation technology.\n  Airports: Finally, the bill would also increase our Nation's \ninvestment in airports. As we all know, you can have the best planes \nand the best air traffic system, but they mean nothing without the \nproper airport infrastructure in place. Our Senate legislation is \ndifferent from the House-passed bill in several areas.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the bill this week. \nIf we are able, and I hope we are, to pass a bipartisan, commonsense \nFAA reauthorization bill, we will still have a long way to go. But it \nwill be an important step toward improving our aviation system and \nimproving aviation safety for the millions of air passengers who should \nexpect no less from this Congress.\n  I do hope we are able to keep the bill pretty much intact. I know \nthere are amendments that some Members will have. I urge Members who do \nhave amendments to come to the floor and begin to let us see their \namendments so they can offer them and we can begin to address the \namendments and try to expedite the bill as much as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I am pleased with the work \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Commerce Committee have done. I \nam chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee and have worked closely with \nthem to produce a piece of legislation that I think is bipartisan, is a \nvery important and urgent piece of legislation that will strengthen \nthis country's system of air travel. I want to talk some about that \ntoday.\n  A couple of things this legislation will do. I am not going to repeat \neverything my colleagues have said, but it will advance aviation \nsafety, which I think is very important. It will accelerate the \nmodernization of the air traffic control system. It is going to support \njobs by investing in aviation infrastructure; that is, airports and \nrunways and the kinds of functions that accommodate our air travel \nsystem. It will ensure that our rural communities in States such as \nNorth Dakota, my home State, have continued access to the Nation's \naviation system.\n  So I am very pleased with this bill. Since the last FAA \nreauthorization bill expired in 2007, the Congress has passed 11 \nseparate extensions of this law. There was a suggestion that we pass \nanother 1-year extension, which I opposed. We do not need to extend \nthis; what we need to do is pass new authorizing legislation that \naddresses the fundamental issues that we need to address with respect \nto air travel in this country.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration is charged with operating what I \nthink is the world's most complex airspace system in the world. By and \nlarge, they do an outstanding job. The United States has the safest \nskies in the world. There is no question about that. But we have seen \nchanges in the aviation industry, in the airline industry, that have \nimpacted safety, and we need to take action to deal with and address \nit.\n  The FAA predicts that air travel in this country will increase by 50 \npercent in the coming decade. That brings it to probably 1 billion \npassengers a year. That is a big system, a system that is very strained \nat this point. As the economy recovers, we will see substantial \nincreases in demand.\n  As we do that, we desperately need to modernize this system. Let me \ndescribe the circumstances of commercial air travel, and then I am also \ngoing to talk about general aviation.\n  I learned how to fly many years ago. I was not much of a pilot, so I \ndid not keep it up. But I learned how to take off in an airplane and go \nfly up someplace and land. It is an extraordinary feeling. It is one of \nthose moments in life that you never forget, when your instructor gets \nout of the plane and says: All right, now you go fly the airplane by \nyourself. When you take off wearing this metal suit with an engine, you \nthink: Oh, my gosh, it is pretty unbelievable to be able to fly an \nairplane.\n  General aviation, people flying their own planes around for \nrecreation, for business, is a very important part of our air travel \nsystem. I wish to talk about that at another time during this \ndiscussion.\n\n  Commercial aviation is the companies that put together the structure, \nthe capital and the airplanes and then haul people around the country \nand the world at scheduled times and places. That is very important. It \nis significant that in many areas of our country now, such as in my \nhome State, Bismarck, ND, when you go out and see that strip of runway, \nmaybe 6,000, maybe 8,000, maybe 10,000 feet of runway, you are one stop \naway from anyplace in the world. Because you take off on that runway \nand one stop later change a plane and go to South America, go to \nEurope, go to Asia, you are one stop away from the world. That is what \nair travel has done for us. It is extraordinary.\n  Go back to the origins of commercial air travel. Airplanes were used \noriginally to haul the mail. Go all the way back to December 17, 1903, \nwhen Orville and Wilbur Wright left the ground for the first time. It \nwas only 59 seconds, but what an extraordinary achievement. They \nlearned to fly. They didn't just learn to fly that day. They had tried \n700 times, again and again and again and again, continually failing \nuntil one day at Kitty Hawk the engine took hold. The pilot was lying \non the fuselage of this rickety-looking structure, and they flew above \nthe ground in powered human flight for 59 seconds. It was quite an \nextraordinary achievement.\n  It was not too long after that, having decided we can shape a wing \nthat can allow us, with power, to escape gravity and fly, we were \nflying in combat. American pilots were in Europe flying in combat. We \nbegan flying mail with commercial airplanes. Then you could only fly \nduring the daytime because you couldn't see at night. So you couldn't \nfly an airplane at night because where would you land. As they\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\nbegan to haul the mail, what they began to do was to build bonfires \nevery 50 miles or 100 miles, big old fires. Then a pilot could fly in \nthe dark of night toward a fire and land. So you hauled the mail at \nnight. Then when they decided they could do something better, they put \nup light stanchions and shined lights into the sky. So the pilot would \nfly to the lights flashing into the sky.\n  Then they invented radar. Then you have ground-based radar so we can \ndetermine here is an airplane in the sky. We can direct that airplane \nand put a light on the runway. All that changed air travel 24 hours a \nday, during the daylight hours but also at night. Ground-based radar \nwas extraordinary. So if you get up in an airplane today, there is \ngoing to be a control tower someplace. In your cockpit, you will have \nperhaps a transponder. Your cockpit from that airplane is going to send \na signal. You have 125 people who are riding in the back, and you are \nsending a signal that goes to a control tower and is on a screen. It is \na little dot on the screen that blinks, and that is your airplane, \nexcept all that does is say: Here is where that airplane is right this \nnanosecond. But in the next nanosecond, that airplane is somewhere \nelse, especially if it is a jet. All we know is, at this moment, the \nairplane is here, and for the next 7 or 8 seconds, as the sweep goes \naround on the monitor, that airplane is somewhere else, perhaps 1 mile, \nperhaps 8 miles away, but the airplane is somewhere else. We know about \nwhere an airplane is based on ground-based radar. Because we don't know \nexactly where it is, we space those airplanes for safety and have them \nfly certain routes for safety.\n  Contrast that ground-based radar with your child. Your child has a \ncell phone. If your child has the right cell phone at this moment--and \nthere are cell phones with this technology--your child can ask 10 of \ntheir best friends, do you want to track each other of our whereabouts \nwith GPS. If the friends say yes, 10 of them could decide to link up \nwith cell phones and figure out where their friend Mary is or where \nLester is, and the GPS will tell them exactly where Mary and Lester are \nbecause they have their phones with them, so we know exactly where they \nare. Our kids can do that with GPS with cell phones. We don't do it yet \nwith commercial airliners. Isn't that unbelievable? That is what this \nis about, modernization, next-generation air traffic control, ground-\nbased radar to GPS. It is complicated. It is difficult. But it is where \nwe are going. We are not going there in the next 20, 30, 40 years. We \nwant to go there soon. I have met with the Europeans and others. They \nare moving in exactly the same direction.\n  Here is what it will allow us to do. If we know exactly where an \nairplane is, as we know where a car is with GPS--a lot of people have \nGPS in their vehicles and get directions from it, so you know exactly \nwhere that vehicle is at every moment--if we do that for airplanes, we \ncan have more direct routing from one city to another and less spacing \nbetween planes because we know exactly where they are. We save energy. \nWe have less pollution in the air. We get there faster. It does all the \nthings that are advantageous for everybody.\n  It is called NextGen, next-generation air traffic control \nmodernization. We could have extended this bill for another year, as \nsome wanted to do, but instead what I wanted to do, and what my \ncolleagues, Senators Rockefeller and Hutchison and others want to do, \nis to get about the business of getting this done, modernizing our air \ntraffic control system, bringing it into the modern age. That is what \nthis is about.\n  I will describe briefly what we do with that. We set up timelines on \nsuch things as Required Navigation Performance, and the Area Navigation \nor RNAV system at 35 airports must be completed by 2014. We will create \ncircumstances where the entire national airspace system is to be \ncovered by 2018. We ask FAA to study providing best-served status for \nthose providing the right equipage for their planes and come in with \nGPS, best equipped, best served. We create a NextGen officer at the \nFAA. It is a new position to help guide and create these programs for \nmodernization. We are doing all these things. It is so important we \ncomplete them and truncate the time with which to complete them.\n  The other issue that is important is the issue of aviation safety. We \nhave worked a lot on that. I have done now eight hearings on aviation \nsafety, especially focusing on issues we have now discovered from the \nColgan Air crash, which tragically killed 50 people in Buffalo, NY. The \nColgan crash raised a lot of questions. Let me describe the \ncircumstances.\n  As I do, I think I speak for all my colleagues on the committee that \nthe relatives, the families of those who were killed in the Colgan \ncrash have made it their mission to be at every hearing, to be involved \nin every decision about this issue of air safety. God bless them. The \nfact is, their diligence and work is making a difference. It made a \ndifference in this bill. There are provisions in this bill as a result \nof their diligence and concern.\n  Let me describe the circumstances of that particular crash. It was an \nevening flight in weather that was not so good, with icing conditions \nfor an airplane. They were flying a propeller airplane called a Dash 8. \nColgan flight 3407, 2 pilots, 2 flight attendants, and 45 passengers \nlost their lives, and one person on the ground. It was a Bombardier \nQ400 airplane, operated by a captain and copilot.\n  What we discovered in reviewing the circumstances of that crash was \nquite extraordinary. The pilot had not slept in a bed the two previous \nnights. The copilot had not slept in a bed the night before. The pilot \ncommuted from his home in Florida to his duty station at Newark in \norder to begin flying. The copilot flew from Seattle, WA, deadheaded on \na FedEx plane that stopped in Memphis, TN, and then continued on to New \nYork in order to reach her duty station at Newark, an all-night flight. \nThere is no evidence, the night before the flight, that either the \npilot or the copilot did anything other than stay in the crew lounge, \nand there is no bed there. For the pilot, it was two nights, no record \nof him sleeping in a bed. So you have two pilots who commuted long \ndistances just to get to work without any evidence that they had a \nnight's sleep in a bed prior to the flight and were on the airplane.\n  If you read the transcript of the voice recorder, a series of \nproblems existed in that cockpit. There was not a sterile cockpit below \n10,000 feet, which is supposed to be the case. There was visiting about \ncareers and a range of things as they were flying through icy \nconditions, violative of the regulations. The copilot, it is said, was \na young woman who worked two jobs in order to make ends meet.\n  The copilot was paid something in the neighborhood of between $20,000 \nand $23,000 a year, commuting all across the country just to get to \nwork. When they ran into icing conditions, there was a stick pusher \nthat engaged, a stick shaker as well. It turns out there had not been \nadequate training with respect to that. A whole series of things \noccurred with respect to that flight that raise lots of questions about \ntraining, about fatigue, a whole series of things.\n  As a result of that, just that case to try to understand what does \nthis mean for others, what does it mean for regulations that are \nnecessary. Randy Babbitt, new head of the FAA, someone for whom I have \ngreat respect, has just finished a rulemaking on fatigue. I believe \nthat now exists at the Office of Management and Budget, awaiting action \nby OMB--a step in the right direction, in my judgment.\n  This bill has another piece that needed to be done that we discovered \nas a result of this crash. The pilot, over the years, had failed a \nnumber of competency tests and then subsequently succeeded or passed \nthose tests. But nonetheless, he had a number of failures. The airline \nthat hired that pilot didn't know that because the records were not \ntransparent. The airline has since said, had we known that record of \nfailures, that pilot would not have been hired by us. But they didn't \nknow. This legislation will correct that. When you are hiring a pilot, \nyou will know the entire range of experience that pilot has had, \nincluding the tests and the passage or failure of certain competencies \nalong the way. That is a very important provision in this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Pilot training and experience is another issue we are talking about \nand working with. It is not an irrelevant issue. There is supposed to \nbe one\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\nstandard and one level of safety with respect to airlines.\n  Regional carriers are now carrying 50 percent of the passengers in \nour country. They get on the airplane, and they see the airplane, and \nit is painted Continental or US Airways or United or Delta, but that \nmay not be the company that is flying that airplane. It may be \nPinnacle. It may be Mesaba. It may be any number of other regional \ncarriers. The passenger doesn't know. All the passenger sees is what is \nmarked on the side of that fuselage. This legislation will also require \ninformation on the tickets of who is transporting that passenger.\n  There are a number of things this legislation does in the area of \nsafety that are very important. We prohibit the personal use of \nwireless communication devices and laptop computers in the cockpit. We \nall remember the pilots who were flying to Minneapolis and flew well \ninto Wisconsin, well past the city of destination, and didn't know \nwhere they were, apparently. They indicated they were busy visiting or \nthey were busy on their laptop computers. But whatever the \ncircumstances, while it is, in many cases, an airline requirement that \nthey not do that, there is no FAA requirement that personal use of \nwireless communication and laptops in the cockpit is prohibited. We do \nthat.\n\n  We also require enhanced safety oversight at foreign repair stations. \nThat also is very important. The outsourcing of maintenance, repair, \nand overhaul work is now a routine practice. Much of it is outsourced \nin this country by the major carriers, and our legislation will require \nenhanced safety oversight and inspections with respect to that \noutsourcing.\n  So those are a few of the items that are included in the bill.\n  I should also point out this bill includes the passenger bill of \nrights, which I think is important. I have just mentioned a couple of \nthe provisions, but one of them that has gotten the most attention is \nto say: You have a requirement as an airline and you have a right as a \npassenger not to be stuck on an airplane for 6 hours, sitting out on a \nrunway somewhere. This is a 3-hour requirement, as part of the \npassenger bill of rights. They are not going to be able to keep you on \nan airplane 5 or 6 hours, sitting on a runway, waiting in the middle of \na big storm. Three hours: back to the gate and allow the passengers to \ndeplane.\n  We also have substantial amounts of airport improvement funding here. \nThis authorizes the AIP. It streamlines what is called the passenger \nfacility charge, the PFC. We provide greater flexibility of the use of \nthe PFC.\n  We improve the airline service in small community service provisions. \nSome communities in this country rely on essential airline services \ncalled EAS, which is the way for them to get the services they were \nguaranteed when we deregulated in this country, which is, by the way, \nanother subject for perhaps another day. Although I again say, as I \nhave said on the floor previously, deregulation might have been a \nwonderful boon for those who live in very large cities and travel to \nother large cities. If you do, you are given a lot of opportunity. You \nare given many opportunities for different carriers and different \npricing. I would bet if we left the floor at this moment and decided to \ngo to one of these search engines and buy a ticket from Washington, DC \nto Los Angeles, in order to visit Mickey Mouse at Disneyland or we \ndecided we will have two alternative tickets: We will purchase one from \nWashington, DC to Los Angeles to visit Mickey Mouse or we will go to \nBismarck, ND, which is only half as far, to see the World's Largest \nHolstein Cow sitting on a hill over New Salem, ND, called Salem Sue. So \nthe choice: to go twice as far to see Mickey Mouse or go half as far to \nsee the World's Largest Holstein Cow--I will bet the search engine on \nthe computer will tell us we get to pay half as much to go twice as \nfar, and twice as much to go half as far.\n  So think of that. You get to pay half price to go double the miles or \nyou get to pay twice the price to go half the miles. Yet that is the \nkind of circumstance we have in our country today. The higher yield \ntickets are on the end of a spoke in a hub-and-spoke system, where \nthere is little or no competition. So we are not addressing that. It \nwas just therapeutic for me to talk about that again. We are not \naddressing that on the floor of the Senate today. But it is something I \nthink is of great concern. Because if you are flying from Chicago to \nLos Angeles, you have plenty of competition, plenty of price \ncompetition and opportunities to get better prices. That is not the \ncase for a number of small States on the back end of a hub-and-spoke \nsystem.\n  Well, there are many other provisions. As I indicated earlier, I am \ngoing to speak some at another point on the subject of general aviation \nbecause while we focus a lot on the issue of commercial aviation, \ngeneral aviation is a very important part of this country's air travel \nsystem. The folks who live out on a farm some place and have a small \nairplane in a shed--from those folks, to people who fly corporate \nplanes and move people around so they can leave in the morning from \nWashington, DC, and fly to Los Angeles, down to Dallas, and get back--\nthat is general aviation and a very important part of our air travel \nsystem. I am going to talk about that at some point later.\n  Let me again say I think we have at last, at long, long last, put a \npiece of legislation together that avoids some of the controversy of \npast attempts, that will substantially improve infrastructure, \nsubstantially address the safety issues. I will talk a little later \nabout pilot hours and some related issues we have been talking about \nthat we hope would be in a managers' package.\n  But all of these things I think finally bring to the floor in this \nbill a victory for those who want to modernize the system. I know there \nwill be some amendments. We have not addressed some issues that are in \nthe House bill. But our concern is to try to get a bill through the \nSenate, into conference with the House, and get something signed by the \nPresident to get something done. We will be dramatically advantaged as \na country if we can enhance the efforts in a shorter period of time to \nmodernize the system and go to a completely different air traffic \ncontrol system called NextGen, which works off of the GPS system. It \nwill save energy, create safety in the skies, and allow people to be \ntransported more directly with less time. I think it will be very \npositive for our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I withhold that suggestion.\n  I did want to make one additional point. I did not do this when I \ntalked about the issue of the Colgan tragedy. The larger question is \nnot addressed directly in this legislation. We address many of these \nissues, but we do not address the larger question of commuting.\n  I want to show, if I might, something Senator Rockefeller and I and \nothers have used in the Commerce Committee. This map describes where \nthe Colgan pilots commute from. But do you know what. This chart could \nprobably have been describing almost any regional airline or any trunk \nairline or major airline, for that matter.\n  Pilots live in one part of the country and work out of another part \nof the country. The fact is, with respect to this tragedy, the Colgan \ncrash, I am convinced that mattered. I am convinced that flying through \ndifficult nighttime icy conditions--with two pilots, neither of whom \nhad slept in a bed the night previous--I am convinced this kind of \ncommuting has caused significant difficulties.\n  There was a Wall Street Journal piece that pretty much says it all. \nThis was an veteran pilot describing the routine of commuter flights \nwith short layovers in the middle of the night, which is pretty \ntypical. He said:\n\n       Take a shower, brush your teeth, pretend you slept.\n\n  That is something we have to pay some attention to. I am not \nsuggesting today that you cannot commute. We do not in this legislation \nprohibit commutes. But I think these are instructive pieces.\n  As shown in this picture, this is what is called a crash pad. I was \ncompletely unaware of a crash pad until we began to hold these \nhearings. But this is a pilot watching a movie on his computer at a \ncrash house in Sterling Park, VA. They can have up to 20 to 24 \noccupants at a time. They are designed to give flight crews from \nregional airlines a quiet place to sleep near their\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nbase airports. Many cannot afford hotels so they use crash houses where \nthe rent is $200 a month for a bed.\n  When I described the copilot of the Colgan tragedy--a copilot who is \nmaking $20,000 or $23,000 a year, traveling across the country, all \nnight long, if that copilot had traveled the day before, are they in a \nsituation to be able to purchase a hotel room at an airport when they \nare making $20,000 or $23,000 a year?\n  In fact, I believe there is a substantial cargo operator that pays \nfor hotel rooms for their pilots who come in the night before. I do not \nbelieve there is an airliner that does that. But I did not make the \npoint during the Colgan discussion. I wanted to make the point that I \nthink fatigue, commuting, and other issues, are serious and \nsignificant.\n  I know Administrator Babbitt believes as well that we need to \ncontinue to look at these issues. We need to visit with pilot \norganizations and others to understand how we might see if we can \nreduce some of the risks here. We have a safe system of air travel, to \nbe sure. But the Colgan crash and all of the details and circumstances \nof it should remind us not everything is as it seems, and we need to \ntake action from time to time to address some of those important \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3453 To Amendment No. 3452\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the deficit by establishing discretionary spending \n                                 caps)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have an amendment, No. 3453, at the \ndesk, and ask that it be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself and \n     Mrs. McCaskill, proposes an amendment numbered 3453 to \n     amendment No. 3452.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, briefly, I will call my colleagues' \nattention to this serious bipartisan effort with Senator McCaskill of \nMissouri to contain our penchant in this body to violate or manipulate \nthe budget and spend more money than we intend to spend. Sometimes we \nare our own worst enemies, and Members of both parties have been guilty \nof that.\n  I originally offered a very similar amendment that adopted the budget \namounts passed by this Congress, our Democratic leadership, and would \nhave made those amounts that we said would be our top spending \namounts--the budget maximum. It would have set a statutory cap at those \nlevels and say if we were going to violate those limit, it would take a \ntwo-thirds vote to do so.\n  A number of senators were concerned about it, but it received broad \nbipartisan support. When we voted, 56 people voted for it--4 short of \nthe 60 necessary to be adopted. But I thought it was a positive step, \nand I know Senator McCaskill felt it was, too.\n  I believe we can dispute how much we ought to spend, but one of the \nbiggest dangers and problems the Senate confronts--and often fails to \nmeet--is breaking our own budget. This amendment would have made it \nharder to break the budget, and 56 Senators voted for it.\n  Then we listened to our colleagues because people were saying: This \nyear, Jeff, I believe we have to do some things that we may not have to \ndo in the future--and that we do not want to do in the future--but this \nyear our economy is in such a state that we can't be so limited.\n  So Senator McCaskill and I proposed another amendment that we voted \non, which would have exempted this year and made it a shorter bill. We \nwould remain under the normal budget rules for this year and would \ntherefore not be creating the power to block additional stimulus \nlegislation a number of Senators were concerned about. Frankly, I felt \nthat was a compromise we could make. I would have preferred to have had \nit apply to this year, but I understand that concern and we made that \nchange. So 59 Senators voted for it--1 short of the necessary vote to \nmake it a part of the legislation.\n  So now, we listened again to some of the concerns we have heard from \nour colleagues. Senator McCaskill and I believe this bill, with the \nadditional changes we made, will be the kind of legislation that could \ngarner perhaps very broad bipartisan support and could actually make it \ninto law. It would significantly help us honor the budget process. It \nwould send a positive message to the world markets and our financial \nworld because some rightly think we have lost our spending bearings and \nwe are spending crazily here. We could send them a message that we have \na budget out there that you may or may not like, but at least we are \nnot going to bust it wide open and we will be more faithful to those \nlimits. It would suggest less of a danger of massive deficits than we \nhave had over the last 2 years.\n  What were the changes we made? Well, we exempted emergencies. In \nother words, some people felt we may need to pass emergency legislation \nand that a two-thirds vote--67 votes--is too much, and they would \nprefer to be able to pass emergencies by 60 votes. So we have \nacquiesced and put that in there. If a Senator is proposing \nextraordinary spending, they would have to openly state that it was an \nemergency, advocate for that, and the current law would still be in \neffect then. It would only take 60 votes to declare an emergency.\n  We made another change, one that I kind of hate to do but I am not \nunwilling to do. We would exempt year 2014, so it would only be a 3-\nyear statutory cap on spending. Some people said: Well, we don't know \nwhat will happen in 2014. We may be in better financial condition. We \nwon't have to contain our spending to the budget levels we passed last \nyear, and we could do it in that fashion. I think that is all right. I \nreally accept that if it helps us get the votes necessary.\n  So now we have 3-year legislation that does not change the law with \nregard to what is an emergency. We could violate the budget if it is an \nemergency, and we would have the votes to do it, but I still think it \nwould be a good deal harder to take basic spending levels and break the \nbudget on those. Technically, you could declare it an emergency. Most \nanything with 60 votes could be an emergency, but I think most Senators \nhave some conviction that we shouldn't abuse the emergency spending \nlevel.\n  We will leave the emergency spending definition with the same number \nof votes, but the basic spending of our country needs to be within the \nbudget caps. Remember, this is the level of spending a Democratic \nmajority voted to pass last year. I voted against it. I thought it had \ntoo much spending in it, particularly last year. This year's spending \nwas also too much, but the outyears had pretty tight budgets with 1 or \n2 percent spending increases. The Congress and the Senate voted for it, \nand I think if we live with that, we might surprise ourselves to see \nthat it would create a positive impact on the size of our deficit.\n  I am confident we are moving in the right direction. Again, it is a \nstatement to ourselves if we pass this legislation. It is also a \nstatement to the world markets that we are going to be less likely to \nviolate our budgets in the future and more likely to contain our \nspending increases to levels that are acceptable.\n  I would note one more thing. President Obama, in his State of the \nUnion, announced a freeze over the next 3 years, and he believes that \nin our discretionary spending accounts--which is what this essentially \ncovers--we should actually have a freeze. I intend to support him on \nthat. But this bill does not call for a freeze. It allows for a modest \nincrease of 1 to 2 percent consistent with last year's budget.\n  I will just say that we should and hopefully we will pass a budget \nthis year that has a freeze in the discretionary accounts. But if we \ndon't or if people attempt to break it and go above it, at least we \nwould have a stronger high ground from which to defend budget-busting \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\n  This is a bill that deserves bipartisan consideration, and I think it \nhas gotten bipartisan consideration. I know 18 Democrats and every \nRepublican voted for it last time. We have listened to the concerns of \nsome of our Members, and we amended the legislation to be more amenable \nto those concerns. I hope we can pass it.\n  Let me say one thing that is an obvious matter of law. If 60 of my \ncolleagues feel as though this is too restrictive, then they can pass a \npiece of legislation with 60 votes that wipes this out entirely from \nthe books. It is mostly a self-imposed discipline. But it would be \nharder to pass legislation to wipe out the two-thirds vote level just \nbecause somebody has hard feelings that they didn't get enough spending \nin this or that bill as part of the normal governmental process. So I \nthink it would be an effective tool. But as a matter of power in the \nSenate, make no mistake, this is not a two-thirds rule that would keep \nthe Senate from doing anything. The Senate can pass legislation \npromptly to eliminate this statute any time we want to.\n  I believe it will work. It worked before. In the early 1990s, such \nlegislation was passed, and it was extended periodically, up through \n2002. From sizable deficits in the early 1990s, the spending was \ncontained to much lower levels than we have adopted in recent years and \nit resulted in a budget surplus at the end of the 1990s. I am \nabsolutely convinced a significant tool in the effective effort to \ncontain spending and put our budget back in balance was the statutory \nlimit on spending, consistent with what we voted for in a budget. That \nis what we are doing today. This is not new legislation, really, but we \nare fundamentally reestablishing the kind of legislation we previously \nhad.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just make a point. This is an \nauthorization bill that is on the floor, the FAA reauthorization. We \nhave waited a long time to get it here. We have had 11 extensions to \nget this bill to the floor.\n  The Senator who offers the amendment certainly is allowed to offer it \non this bill. Of course, his amendment really doesn't relate to passing \nan FAA reauthorization bill, so I hope he will withhold at some point \nand do this at another moment on another piece of legislation because I \nfear that--at long last, trying to get an FAA reauthorization bill 3 \nyears after it previously expired, with 11 different extensions, my \nhope is we can stay on the FAA reauthorization, have amendments that \nrelate to this bill, debate them, and then vote on those amendments. \nThat would be my hope.\n  I understand the Senator has a right to do that. Somebody could bring \nan amendment on abortion or whatever somebody wants to the floor of the \nSenate on an open authorization bill. The Senator has had two other \nopportunities to offer this. I hope he will find a third at some point.\n  The budget deficit is a very serious problem. We are on an \nunsustainable path. Let me give just a slightly different observation \non the subject as long as I am on my feet.\n  It is true that 10 years ago our country was running a budget \nsurplus. It is true that 10 years ago we had a budget surplus. It is \nalso the case that when President George W. Bush came to town, he said: \nYou know what, we have a budget surplus. Alan Greenspan is not going to \nsleep at night, he said, because he worried that the surplus was going \nto pay down the Federal debt too fast. He literally said that. He \nworried about paying down the Federal debt too fast, so we need to be a \nlittle careful about accruing these surpluses. So President Bush said: \nWhat we need to do is have a very large tax cut.\n  I stood here on this floor of the Senate and said: You know what, \nthese surpluses exist this year only and the next 10 years of projected \nsurpluses don't yet exist. They are simply projections. Let's be a bit \nconservative. What if something happens?\n  They said: ``Katy, bar the door,'' we are going to do this anyway, \nand did it--very large tax cuts, very substantial reductions in Federal \nrevenue. About 50 percent of the structural budget deficit at the \nmoment is as a result of reducing the revenue base 10 years ago--9 \nyears ago.\n  I said on the floor of the Senate: You know, let's be a little \nconservative. What if something happens?\n  Well, guess what happened almost immediately. We passed the tax \ncuts--not with my vote--the majority of which, the bulk of which went \nto the wealthiest Americans. Very quickly, we discovered we were in a \nrecession. Very quickly, there was an attack on our country on 9/11. \nThen we were in a war in Afghanistan and then a war in Iraq. We sent \nyoung men and women off to war and did not pay for one penny of it--not \na penny. So we cut the revenue base very substantially. We experienced \na recession, an attack against our country, engaged in two wars, sent \nmen and women to other parts of the world to fight, and did not pay for \na penny of it. We added it all to the debt and increased deficits.\n  I happen to think the Senator's presentation about the danger of the \ndeficits is very real. I agree with that. But in order to reduce these \ndeficits--this is not rocket science--if we are going to send young men \nand women to Afghanistan to risk their lives, if they are going to get \nup this morning and put on body armor because they are going to face \nreal live bullets, pay for every bit of it. Pay for it. Let's ask the \nAmerican people to sacrifice, not just the soldiers. We are going to \ncut spending? Then let's really cut spending.\n  I offered an amendment on the floor and lost it. I said: Let's cut TV \nMarti. I couldn't get it passed. TV Marti broadcasts signals into Cuba, \nspends $\\1/4\\ billion broadcasting television signals into Cuba that \nthe Cuban people can't see. From 3 in the morning until 7 in the \nmorning, we spend taxpayers' dollars broadcasting television signals \ninto Cuba that Cuba blocks and the Cuban people can't see. We spent \n$\\1/4\\ billion, and we can't cut the spending? I don't understand that \nat all.\n  The prescription drug amendment I offered on the floor of the Senate \nwould have saved the Federal Government $20 billion in spending, and I \nlost it.\n  If we are going to cut the deficit, we have to cut real things. When \nthose things come to the floor and we have an opportunity to really cut \nspending, let's do that.\n  By the way, it is not just spending. We need to work on spending, and \nI have offered amendments to cut spending, but it is also the revenues. \nI hope the Senator would agree with me that when the richest--well, let \nme rephrase that. When the person in America in 2008 who made the \nhighest income--$3.6 billion running a hedge fund--when that person \npays the lowest income tax rate, would the Senator agree with me that \nperhaps we ought to increase that rate?\n  This person comes home, and his spouse says: Honey, how are we doing?\n  He says: Well, pretty good--$3.6 billion.\n  That is $300 million a month; that is $10 million a day. Honey, how \nwe are doing?\n  Well, pretty good. I made $10 million. But guess what. I get to pay \nthe lowest income tax rate in the country because I declare it as \ncarried interest.\n  Do we want to plug that loophole and ask that person to pay the same \nincome tax rate that the people who get up and go to work and then have \nto shower after work because they have dirt under their fingernails \nhave to pay?\n  How about making those changes? I am for all of those things. I want \nto work with the Senator from Alabama and every other Senator who wants \nto do all of these things.\n  What happened at the start of this past decade is, somebody put sand \nin the gas tank and the car will not run and we are up in the engine \ndepartment trying to figure out how the carburetor works.\n  This is not difficult. You are going to go to war, pay for it. You \nare going to cut spending, then take a look at the most egregious \nabuses and pay for those by cutting the spending.\n  Take a look at the history on this floor. We have been through a \nlong, tortured decade of what I consider irresponsible fiscal policy.\n  I understand it is not the case where one side is all to blame and \nthe other side not. I understand all that. But I also understand this: \nI was on this floor saying: Let's pay for the cost of war. I did 20 \nhearings on the most egregious waste, fraud, and abuse in this country \nby contractors doing work in Iraq and Afghanistan. I spoke dozens of \ntimes on\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\nthis floor on those issues and could not get much support: cutting \nspending for contractors who were abusing the American people by \nsending contaminated water--more contaminated than raw water from the \nEuphrates River--to the military bases in Iraq for the soldiers to use \nand getting paid for it; getting paid bonuses to do electrical work at \nthe military camps in Iraq and Afghanistan that was so shoddy--done by \nthird country nationals hired by our contractors--such shoddy \nelectrical work that Mr. Maseth, a Green Beret, goes in to take a \nshower and he is electrocuted, killed in a shower. We paid bonuses to \nthat contractor for that work. It is unbelievable to me.\n  We have a lot to answer for--all of us do. Every single Member on the \nfloor of this Senate has a lot to answer for. But we can work together \non spending and asking those who are not paying their fair share of \ntaxes--by the way, the President, when he gave his State of the Union \nAddress in the House Chamber, said something I have had a vote on four \ntimes on the floor of the Senate and lost all four times. The President \nsaid: Let's shut down the tax break that gives tax breaks to companies \nthat shut down their American manufacturing plants, fire their workers, \nand move to China or some other foreign country. Do you know we do \nthat?\n  We have tried to shut that down. We give a tax break. If you lock up \nyour manufacturing plant, shut the plant, fire every single worker, and \nmove your manufacturing to China, we give you a big, fat tax break for \ndoing it.\n  That is unbelievably ignorant. The President said in his State of the \nUnion Address: Shut that down. I have been trying to shut that down for \nmany years and have been unable to do it. It is not as if there are not \ncandidates for some common sense and some sanity in fiscal policy to \nbring us back into some balance.\n  We need a revenue base that is a reasonable revenue base. We took a \nlot of that away about 9 years ago with a vote that I did not cast. \nThen we need to tighten our belt on spending and get rid of the things \nthat do not work.\n  I know I have gone far afield, and the Senator from Alabama--I have \nnot heard him gritting his teeth, but he probably is.\n  My point is this: He raises an important subject--an unsustainable \nfiscal policy. This President inherited an economic wreck; there is no \nquestion about that. We are trying to get out of this. But you cannot \nlook out 5 and 10 years and see what we see without understanding this \nis unsustainable and all of us have to work together to fix it--all of \nus. I am committed to doing that.\n  I say to the Senator from Alabama, I hope he will find another \nvehicle in the next few days on which to offer this amendment because \nSenator Rockefeller and I have put together this FAA reauthorization \nbill along with Senator Hutchison. We have worked very hard after so \nmany years to finally get it to the floor of the Senate. We want to get \nthis bill passed. Air safety, modernization--all of it--depends on us \ngetting this legislation through the Senate soon.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for staying and listening. I expect \nhe will retort or respond. Again, these are all important issues, but \nwe must get this FAA reauthorization bill done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dorgan for his comments \nand the frustrations we all share. He comes at it from one party's \nperspective, and I have my party's perspective. We can argue these \nissues for a lot of time.\n  I have gotten to the point--and I think Senator McCaskill and a lot \nof Members of the body have as well--that we need to do something that \nmight actually work. I say to Senator Dorgan, the reason I believe we \nshould go forward on this amendment is because the first time we had an \namendment with 56 votes and bipartisan support. Then the last time it \nwas 59. We made some more changes to primarily assuage concerns of my \nDemocratic colleagues that Senator McCaskill still believes could put \nus in a position to pass this legislation. It will make some \ndifference.\n  I was at a townhall meeting. The questioner criticized me for \nsomething. I said: I wrote a letter about that to the Cabinet person \nand complained. He sat there and looked at me.\n  He said: You wrote a letter. Thank you a lot.\n  I didn't have much to say.\n  At some point we have to do something. I have made speeches. Senator \nDorgan, one of the most eloquent--Members of this body, has made \nspeeches. But we are not doing anything. Deficits are surging beyond \nlimits. We have a possibility of passage here and that is why I think \nwe should go forward. We have the possibility of reaching this \nagreement that for 3 years will place in statutory form the budget my \nDemocratic colleagues passed, which is higher than what President Obama \nis saying we should spend. We could at least have that as a firewall. \nIt would be difficult to go above those amounts, but it would not \neliminate or make it even any harder to pass an emergency bill because \nwe amended our amendment to change that part we previously had in there \nthat would have made it harder to declare something an emergency.\n  One thing I would like to share with my colleagues--I see Senator \nDorgan is gone--about the allegations, which are not all wrong, that \nPresident Bush and Mr. Greenspan were insignificantly concerned about \ndeficit spending after we had a series of surpluses.\n  But first, let me go back. One of the great political efforts in this \nCongress--and it has had some success and partisan success--is to give \nPresident Clinton credit for the balanced budget. Not a dime can be \nspent by any President that is not appropriated by the U.S. Congress.\n  Republicans took over the Congress in 1994 and shut down the \ngovernment in a dispute with the President over how much money he ought \nto be spending. It caused a big controversy. But they fought and fought \nagainst spending. People were sleeping in their offices. But the budget \ngot balanced for several years.\n  After 9/11, we slipped into a recession. We were in a war. As a \nmatter of fact I heard Mr. Greenspan, in effect, say he believed the \ncountry could take on more debt. Senator Rockefeller probably remembers \nessentially that. He serves on many of these committees.\n  He said: I think we can take on more debt.\n  What Mr. Greenspan and, I think, Mr. Bush did not realize was that \nonce you start taking on more debt, it gets harder and harder to stop. \nWe started a trend of taking on more debt as if it did not matter. Some \npeople even said deficits don't matter. Some Republicans said deficits \ndon't matter; we can handle it.\n  We got into a bad habit. Both parties got into that habit, and it is \nroaring away today with spending levels the likes of which we have \nnever seen.\n  We passed a budget that I think has reality in it. I think if we hold \nto that budget, we might surprise ourselves how much progress we can \nmake. These kinds of statutory caps were part of the success in the \nnineties.\n  I ask forgiveness of my colleagues for trying to pursue a vote on \nthis amendment. I say to my colleagues, if we get the 60 votes I think \nit will be an indication that it would not in any way burden the FAA \nbill. In fact, it might be attractive to some Members of this Senate to \nvote for the bill if this cap was in it--Members who might not \notherwise vote for it. I don't think it would damage the prospects of \nthe bill's passage. This amendment is building up with increased votes \neach time. We are near to success. I think it would be a great \nbipartisan statement of commitment to financial responsibility, and I \nthink it is important to go forward.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the FAA \nreauthorization bill that has been put forward by Senator Rockefeller \nand Senator Hutchison. Both have worked hard on this legislation. I \nhave worked on this legislation for a number of years as well.\n  My general aviation industry is centered in Wichita KS. It has had a \nlot of difficulty lately with markets and the recession and problems \noverall, and it needs a bit of good news. This would be a bit of good \nnews, having FAA reauthorization. This is an industry that is roughly \n$150 billion in size. It is located\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\nprimarily in the United States. It has created over 1.3 million jobs. \nIt is key. It goes across a broad array of disciplines. It is a high-\ntech manufacturing business that we are very good at. This is something \nwe need to have.\n  Implementation of the NextGen technology for navigation and travel \nacross the United States is in the bill. Also in the bill is \nmaintaining inspection procedures that are important for the safety of \naircraft, increased funding for essential air service for a State such \nas mine that has a need for essential air service in places where it is \ntough to get in and out of and the population pool is not large. It \nneeds that to move forward. It expands passenger rights and provides \nincreased Federal support for small airports.\n  I think it also important that this legislation does not include \nlanguage imposing disproportionate and onerous user fees on the general \naviation industry. This is something Senator Roberts and I have been \nconcerned about for some period of time, that the general aviation \nindustry would get stuck with a disproportionate share of the funding \nfor the overall FAA infrastructure. That is not in the bill. If it \ncomes back to this body from the House with that in the bill, it is \ngoing to be something I am going to fight strongly against.\n  The bill is a good bipartisan bill. It has been worked out. It \ncertainly is not perfect. No bill is. It is something that has been \nworked out over a period of time, over a series of years, over a lot of \ninterests. It is the way we ought to legislate and move forward.\n  I say as a cautionary tale again to my colleagues that if the bill \ncomes back with provisions from the House that are problems for this \nbody, it is going to stop the bill and it then is not going to happen.\n  My urgings to my colleagues here and in the House would be, let's \nkeep with the primary design of what this bill has and not try to load \nit with other things that might be special projects for individuals who \nare going to kill the bill. I have concerns on any side, whether it is \non my side or the other side, of provisions being added that would kill \nthis bill that has been a hard fought, long legislative process for us \nto move forward. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation. It will \ncreate jobs. It will spur further development in our Nation's aviation \nsector, a sector that needs some help and support now. This bill does \nthat.\n  I can see a lot of ways this bill could get damaged and hurt along \nthe way. I am not opposed to putting amendments in that make sense and \nthat can continue to move the bill on through the legislative process. \nI am opposed to those amendments that would kill it and that would \nsubstantially harm it when this is something that has been worked on a \nlong time through several committees to get it moving forward.\n  For those reasons, I support it. I support it as it is. I think we \nought to move forward with it and move forward with it with some speed \nto help this critical industry in our country, to support safety in \nflying in this country, to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \naviation trust fund reauthorization. I support the bill, and I strongly \nurge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  In addition to discussing the bill's specifics, however, I would like \nto give some perspective about our current aviation system. Our current \nsystem relies on the use of radio detection and ranging--more commonly \nknown as radar. Radar was once a tremendous leap forward; that is, it \nwas a tremendous leap forward right before World War II. Let me take a \ncouple moments to retrace the history of air traffic control, starting \nbefore radar.\n  Before radar, pilots followed prominent landmarks, such as rivers or \nrailway lines, to navigate their routes. Naturally, bad weather and \ndarkness made flying especially hazardous. In the 1920s, commercial \nnight flights relied on something called the transcontinental lighted \nairway. That is an impressive-sounding name. What was it? It was just a \nseries of bonfires. Local farmers maintained those bonfires across many \nparts of America. More developed areas could use gas-fueled beacons.\n  In 1922, the first civil aviation midair collision happened in \nFrance. That collision created awareness of the need for some sort of \nair traffic control. I use the word ``control'' loosely. It took more \nthan another 10 years before this country's air traffic control center \nopened up in Newark, NJ, in 1935. The following year, additional \ncenters went up in Chicago and Cleveland. Elsewhere, the system still \nconsisted of flagmen standing on the airfield, waving flags to \ncommunicate with pilots.\n  But all that changed with the establishment of radar shortly before \nWorld War II. During the war, radar gave the British an extraordinarily \npositive tool--a defensive tool--for repelling Luftwaffe attacks. Soon, \nthe Allied Powers were using it for offensive purposes.\n  Radar provided air cover at Anzio and Normandy. It enabled air raids \ndeep into Germany, despite overcast skies, and it helped us disrupt \nAxis Power shipping routes and attack the Japanese Navy. We spent more \nduring the war on radar than on the atomic bomb.\n  No less an authority than German Grand Admiral Doenitz, when captured \nat the end of the war, said this:\n\n       We fell behind technically. We were unable to build \n     shortwave RADAR to compete with Anglo-American improved radio \n     location equipment.\n\n  Following the war, radar was adapted for civil aviation. Ultimately, \nit spawned the tremendous rise of the commercial air travel industry. \nIncidentally, this led Congress to properly fund aviation. In 1970, we \nestablished the airport and airways trust fund--commonly referred to as \nthe aviation trust fund--and that is what we seek to reauthorize today.\n  The aviation trust fund built on the success of the highway trust \nfund. The idea behind the aviation trust fund was for the system's \nusers to pay for its upkeep. Generally speaking, the aviation trust \nfund has managed to do that, to finance the needs of the air-traveling \npublic.\n  The aviation trust fund receives about $12 billion a year in user-\nbased taxes. Much of this funding goes into the Airport Improvement \nProgram. The airports in my State of Montana rely heavily on it. The \nDepartment of Transportation has estimated that every billion dollars \nspent in Airport Improvement Program funding creates or sustains more \nthan 20,000 jobs throughout the U.S. economy.\n  But now we need to do more. Our system needs modernization. We need \nto improve safety and efficiency. We need to enable direct routes, \nrather than flying along zigzag flight corridors, as we have since the \ntranscontinental lighted airway, and we need to keep up with air \ntraffic growth. Look at how bogged down our New York-New Jersey \nairspace already is.\n  We need Continuous Descent Arrival to reduce the amount of fuel that \naircraft burn. This reduces both cost and air emissions. During a \nrecent test in Atlanta, Delta Airlines saved as many as 60 gallons of \nfuel and cut carbon emissions by up to 1,250 pounds for every flight.\n  The Senate bill would fund the aviation trust fund for a little more \nthan 3 years. Importantly, the bill would provide needed funds for the \nestablishment of NextGen. NextGen is the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's plan to use satellite-based technology in order to \nmodernize the Nation's air traffic system. We need to invest in it now. \nOur 2010 trust fund, established in the early 1970s, is still funding \nradar. That is a technology that predates the Second World War. Some \nradar beacons are still located on the same sites as those early \nbonfire beacons.\n  NextGen, however, will enable planes to use global positioning \nsystems to continuously transmit location, speed, and altitude to other \nplanes, pilots, and controllers within 150 miles. That will improve \nefficiency and safety. This is a sea change. A number of other \ncountries have already invested in satellite tracking technology. The \nUnited States is behind the curve, and we can change that with the \npassage of this bill.\n  How do we pay for NextGen? The Finance Committee proposes the \nfollowing:\n  First, we set the tax for general aviation jet fuel at 36 cents a \ngallon. That is up from the current 21.9 cents a gallon. The general \naviation community agreed to this proposal.\n\n[[Page S1350]]\n\n  Second, we treat fractional aircraft; that is, partially owned \nplanes; as general aviation rather than commercial carriers. Owners of \nfractional aircraft believe this change will preserve their ability to \nfly and land in Europe.\n  All told, we raise nearly an additional $180 million to get NextGen \nstarted. More will be needed, especially given the rapid state of \ntechnological change. I know that both the Finance Committee and the \nCommerce Committee plan to monitor NextGen's implementation.\n  We will have a pretty good debate this week. I look forward to it. \nBut first I wish to thank my colleagues, especially Senator \nRockefeller, for his willingness to seek common ground. We have worked \ntogether on this for a long time--actually, for several years. In fact, \nwe had an agreement a couple years ago, but due to an extraneous event, \nit was unable to be realized.\n  Senator Rockefeller has written a very strong FAA reauthorization. I \nespecially appreciate his continued support for the Essential Air \nService Program, a program that matters a great deal to my constituents \nin eastern Montana.\n  So let us adopt NextGen to improve safety and improve efficiency. Let \nus reauthorize the aviation trust fund. It is time to bring American \nair travel into the 21st century.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3456 to Amendment No. 3452\n\n (Purpose: To reauthorize the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment 3456.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself, \n     Ms. Collins, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Ensign, and Mr. \n     Voinovich, proposes an amendment numbered 3456 to amendment \n     No. 3452.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I introduced this amendment with a \nbipartisan group of cosponsors, Senators Collins of Maine, Byrd of West \nVirginia, Feinstein of California, Voinovich of Ohio, and Ensign of \nNevada.\n  Its purpose is to reauthorize--in fact, to save--the Opportunity \nScholarship Program or OSP for students here in the District of \nColumbia.\n  We are introducing our amendment to this legislation, and I use the \nword ``save'' because without prompt action by Congress, there is a \nreasonable probability that the OS Program, the scholarship program, \nwill not just be limited to the number of students who are in it now--\nand, in fact, there have not been any new students admitted in the last \n2 years--but it will be doomed.\n  As I explained here on the floor of the Senate yesterday, the current \nadministrator has advised Secretary Duncan that it will no longer--the \nadministrator being a corporation, an entity--that it will no longer \nadminister the program without a reauthorization.\n  No other entity has yet expressed a willingness to take over, given \nthe constraints imposed by Congress. So despite President Obama's \nintent, stated in his budget message to continue this program, \nadmittedly only for those 1,300-plus students currently participating \nin it, it appears that even that will become impossible.\n  I think that would be a tragic result. This program has given a \nlifeline for students in failing schools in the District of Columbia, a \nscholarship to go to private or faith-based schools where, by all \naccounts, they are receiving a much better education and being given \nthe talents with which they can make something much greater of their \nlives.\n  We first offered our amendment to the American Workers, State, and \nBusiness Relief Act, which was passed earlier today. I was proud to \nsupport that measure. It is good for the economy, good for people \nhurting in our economy, good for businesses hurting in the economy. \nUnfortunately, we were not able to get a vote on this amendment on that \nbill. As promised, we are here today again in another attempt to get a \nvote in the Senate on this issue. It is time sensitive. It is urgent. \nThe life of this program hangs in the balance and, in a very real way, \nthe future of these 1,300-plus children in the District who are \nbenefiting from the program.\n  The truth is, the FAA reauthorization bill has been referred to as a \njobs initiative. I believe it is. What is more important to getting a \ngood job than getting a good education? That is what this bill is all \nabout.\n  Achievement gaps in our schools, including our schools in the \nDistrict of Columbia, have a profound impact on the quality of our \nworkforce and on the future of our economy and, in a classically, \ncharacteristically American sense, focusing on the individual children \nwho, by twists of fate, have ended up in schools that are not \nadequately preparing them. I will have more to say about this, but \nthese are schools I am not just personally judging to be failing \nschools but, under characteristics, standards created by the Federal \nGovernment under the No Child Left Behind Act, are designated as \nfailing schools. The OSP provides these low-income students in the \nDistrict with a chance at a better education.\n  Dollar for dollar, this program accomplishes this goal at a very low \ncost. Personally, how did I get involved in this? Of course like all of \nus, I have an interest in education. I have an interest in overcoming \nthe achievement gaps in American schools that are so profoundly related \nto income and to race. More particularly, I have followed the status of \nthis program in the District of Columbia for several years in my \ncapacity as a ranking member and now chair of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee because of the committee's traditional \njurisdiction in its governmental affairs aspect over and regarding the \nDistrict of Columbia, our Nation's Capital.\n  Last year our committee held a hearing on the Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram and heard testimony from students in the program and their \nparents. It was evident from their testimony that this program has \nserved as a lifeline to many students who otherwise would have been \nassigned to schools in which they would not have received a good \neducation, as designated by No Child Left Behind.\n  One parent whose annual income is only $12,200 testified that she had \nsought an opportunity scholarship, a voucher for her 8-year-old son \nafter her 17-year-old nephew was shot and killed at the Ballou High \nSchool. Her son since has thrived in the Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram, loves his school and his teachers, is part of the reading and \ndebate club, and now wants to be a doctor. His hopes have been \nfortified and elevated, and his achievement has been remarkably \nimproved. This mother believes that none of this would have happened \nhad her son been forced to stay in the school he was in in the DC \nPublic School System.\n  Another young man, Ronald Holassie, started in the Opportunity \nScholarship Program in sixth grade. He is now a high school student. He \ntold the committee the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program ``has changed \nmy life.''\n  Then he said:\n\n       No one should take away my future and dreams of becoming a \n     successful young man. No one should take that away from me \n     and the other 1,700 children in this program.\n\n  Now, because of the failure of Congress to support the program over \nthe last couple of years or fill the spots opened by graduation, it is \ndown to 1,300 children. Ronald Holassie became the deputy youth mayor \nfor legislative affairs of the District of Columbia and is now applying \nto college. What he said was right. This program provides a quality \neducation to economically disadvantaged students at half the per-pupil \ncost of educating students in the Public Schools.\n  Our committee also heard from Tiffany Dunston. She told us:\n\n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\n\n       Receiving a scholarship was a blessing for my family and \n     put me on the path to success. I grew up in a neighborhood \n     with a lot of poverty and crime. And there were such low \n     expectations for kids in my neighborhood schools. I would \n     watch kids hanging out in the streets and not going to \n     school. . . . My motivation to get the best education \n     possible was my cousin James who was shot and killed at 17. I \n     am always thinking of what he could have done. . . . With the \n     help of a scholarship my dream [has been] realized.\n\n  Those are very moving testimonies, personal anecdotes, affirmations \nof the worth of the program. But has there been an independent \nprofessional evaluation of the program? Yes, there has.\n  Required by Congress, the person chosen to carry out that program is \na man named Patrick Wolf, Dr. Patrick Wolf, the principal investigator \nof the valuation conducted by the U.S. Department of Education's \nInstitute of Education Sciences. This is a report required by Congress, \ncarried out by an institute under the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Dr. Patrick Wolf testified that the Opportunity Scholarship Program \nhas had a statistically significant, positive effect on the test scores \nof students in reading in this program.\n  I know some of the critics of the program, some of the opponents have \ndownplayed these results. However, the fact is, as I have learned, most \neducation innovation programs actually fail to show any significant \ngains, certainly in the first few years.\n  Dr. Wolf has said when compared to all other similarly studied \neducation innovations throughout our country--not talking about the the \nDistrict of Columbia--``the reading impact of the DC voucher program is \nthe largest achievement impact yet reported.''\n  He went on, the principal independent investigator, to say:\n\n       The DC voucher program has proven to be the most effective \n     education policy evaluated by the federal government's \n     official research arm so far.\n\n  So why stop it? Why terminate it? Certainly not based on this \nindependent evaluation, certainly not based on the testimony our \ncommittee and others have heard from the parents and students involved. \nThe reasons I leave to others, but I fear it is because of the \nopposition of teachers groups and others who don't want this kind of \ncompetition.\n  In sum, Dr. Wolf's study used the gold standard of research \nmethodology and found that the Opportunity Scholarship Program is \ngetting very impressive results. Those who oppose OSP argue in part \nthat vouchers take away funds from the public schools in the District. \nThis is simply false. When it was adopted in Congress, to overcome the \nargument that it would take money away from the public schools, this \nprogram did exactly the opposite. We reached an agreement to get the \nvotes to pass the program that whatever amount of money was given for \nthe OPS, the so-called voucher program in the District of Columbia, \nexactly that amount of money would be added, not subtracted, to the \npublic school budget of the District of Columbia. They otherwise would \nnot have received that money for the public schools.\n  Incidentally, a similar amount was appropriated for charter schools \nin Washington. Why? Because there is no one answer at this moment to \nthe challenge to give every child endowed by our Creator, as the \nDeclaration of Independence says, with an equal right to life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness which, in our time, is very much equated \nwith the right to an equal education. The fact is, previous Congresses \nhave been prepared to support all three of these ways because they were \nfocused not on a single method of educating our children but on \nbenefiting each and every one of our children.\n  I know some say these scholarships are not the solution to the \nproblems that beset the DC Public Schools. I agree. They are not the \nsole solution. But they can and should be part of the solution, \ncertainly, while the reform efforts of the chancellor, Michelle Rhee, \nare going forward and until they reach a turning point, a tipping point \nwhere the schools really have been broadly improved.\n  I strongly support Chancellor Rhee's efforts to reform and improve \nthe public schools in the District. I strongly support efforts across \nthe Nation to improve our public schools. That is always where we will \neducate most of our children. That is always where we should put the \ngreatest emphasis.\n  Chancellor Rhee, with the backing of Mayor Fenty, has moved \naggressively to turn around failing schools in the District. She is \ngetting results. She certainly has my full backing when it comes to the \nreforms she is working to implement. But Chancellor Rhee has said \nsomething so honest, so compassionate, so fair, so focused on the well-\nbeing of the children in Washington, DC, that, to me, it should end any \nargument against the amendment we are proposing.\n  She has said herself, Chancellor Rhee, that the reform effort in the \nDC Public Schools is making progress but it is not going to happen \novernight. As one of the students I just quoted said before our \ncommittee, the DC Public Schools did not get to the troubles they are \nin overnight, and they are not going to get out of the troubles they \nare in overnight.\n  But Chancellor Rhee said this is a multiyear process. In the \nmeantime, many District schools are failing our most economically \nchallenged children. For this reason, Chancellor Rhee, Michelle Rhee, \nthe head of the public schools in the District, has said the OSP should \ncontinue. I ask my colleagues, why wouldn't we want to use every means \nat our disposal to provide the best education possible to all children \nhere in Washington, DC?\n  Chancellor Rhee has been very explicit about this. She said that it \nmay take 5 years to turn around many of the schools that are failing--\nofficially failing--to give a decent education to the students in the \nDistrict of Columbia. She said, in a very personal and moving way, \nuntil she could say to parents of children who are in schools now \ndesignated as failing that they were no longer failing and the parents \ncould be confident that their children would receive a good education \nin those schools, she would support the Opportunity Scholarship Program \n5 years. Based on that assessment, our amendment reauthorizes the OSP \nfor 5 years.\n  Our amendment also continues to ask for a rigorous evaluation of the \nmerits of the program. At the end of the 5 years, we will have better \ninformation on both the effectiveness of this scholarship voucher model \nand the reform effort in the DC Public Schools. I want to suggest to my \ncolleagues, at the end of this 5-year period, we can determine whether \nwe want to continue to provide Federal support for these opportunity \nscholarship, school choice programs based on conditions at that time.\n  Our reauthorization proposal includes a number of improvements and \nenhancements to the program, including many sought by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, the chairman of the Appropriations \nsubcommittee that has in previous years funded the Opportunity \nScholarship Program. Specifically, we require that all schools in the \nprogram have certificates of occupancy, that core subject matter \nteachers have appropriate credentials and schools meet the accrediting \nstandards of the DC Public Schools; that regular site inspections be \nconducted; and that participating students take the same test as \nstudents in District of Columbia Public Schools.\n  There are currently 1,319 students benefiting from opportunity \nscholarships in the District of Columbia. I repeat that no students \nhave been allowed in for the last 2 years because of congressional \ninaction. At its peak, 1,930 students were enrolled in the 2007 to 2008 \nschool year. Because no new students can enroll, enrollment declined to \n1,721 last year and then 1,319 this year. Last year, 216 students who \nwere offered a scholarship had the offer revoked by the Secretary of \nEducation of the United States because of failure to support the \nprogram.\n  I want to repeat, over 85 percent of students in this program would \notherwise be attending a school in need of improvement, corrective \naction, or restructuring--in other words, a failing school designated \nunder the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  In closing, I would say this: 1,319 is the number of students \nbenefiting from the Opportunity Scholarship Program. If we do not \nreauthorize it, at this point there is no one to run the program and it \nprobably will simply die. Those are 1,319 reasons to save this program \nand offer hope and opportunity to these young boys and girls in this \ncity\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\nwho want as much as any child in this country to live a life of success \nand self-sufficiency and deserve that right as much as any other child \nin the country.\n  So I ask my colleagues to consider what we would want for our own \nchildren. All of us have the resources to essentially exercise school \nchoice, and that is precisely what many of us do because we want the \nbest for our children. But there are many parents around America--in \nthis case, particularly, who live in our Nation's Capital, the place \nwhere we work--who have much more limited resources and also want the \nbest for their children. They want to make a choice, which the \nOpportunity Scholarship Program allows them to make. So I appeal to my \ncolleagues to take up this amendment. Let's have a vote on it, and \nlet's act favorably on it to preserve this lifeline for a gifted and \nhopeful group of children in our Nation's Capital.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

Mr. President, earlier today we passed some legislation \nin the Senate that is important and will create jobs in our country, \nand I filed an amendment that was not considered. I know that was the \ncase with many amendments on the bill. One of the amendments I filed \nthat was never considered, unfortunately, and I hope will be considered \nin the future deals with the recommendation the President made during \nhis State of the Union Address.\n  In the State of the Union Address, the President spoke about jobs and \nsaid one of the things we ought to do to try to preserve and keep and \ncreate jobs in our country is to shut down or eliminate the tax \nloophole that rewards companies for moving jobs overseas. The President \nspecifically asked in his State of the Union Address for the Congress \nto eliminate that tax loophole. I have tried to eliminate that loophole \nI think on four different occasions on the floor of the Senate. We have \nhad four votes. On each occasion, I have failed.\n  One might ask, well, how on Earth can you fail on an amendment such \nas that? Well, there are a lot of big companies and groups in this \ntown--the Chamber of Commerce is an example--that like that loophole \nand want it retained, and they fight very hard to keep the loophole.\n  Here is what we have. We actually do have a circumstance where if you \nare on one side of a street corner and you have a competitor on the \nother side of the street making the identical product you do, earning \nthe identical income you earn, and you decide you are going to move \nyour plant to China, fire your workers, put a padlock on the front door \nof your manufacturing plant and move to China, the only difference \nbetween you and the person across the street that you used to compete \nwith and still do is that you now have lower labor costs but you also \nhave a tax break given to you by the Federal Government. It is \nastounding that exists, but regrettably it does. The President's call \nto eliminate the tax break is very important, and we ought to heed that \ncall.\n\n  I filed an amendment on the last bill, the one that passed today. I \ndid not get a vote on it. I intend to file it again on other pieces of \nlegislation because this Congress, at a time when so many millions of \npeople get up in the morning and put on their clothes and go out \nlooking for work and cannot find work, this Congress has a \nresponsibility to deal with this issue.\n  Think of this issue of trying to find jobs that are necessary to put \n17 million people back to work as trying to fill a bathtub. We are \nworking on a faucet to incentivize and create new jobs, but the drain \nis wide open, the drain of existing jobs going overseas; in fact, going \noverseas in search of cheap labor because this country actually rewards \nyou if you move your jobs overseas.\n  This is Hershey's chocolate. Many people have eaten York Peppermint \nPatties. York Peppermint Patties were made in a Pennsylvania plant but \nno longer. It is now Mexican food.\n  This is a newly built plant in Monterey, Mexico, now making York \nPeppermint Patties. On its Web site, Hershey's says:\n\n       That cool refreshing taste of mint, dipped in dark \n     chocolate will take you miles away.\n\n  Apparently meaning even Mexico. So an American brand goes south. That \nis not terribly unusual.\n  Hallmark Cards: ``When you care enough to send the very best.'' It is \na privately held Kansas City company. It has been around 100 years. It \nwas founded by a high school dropout who started the company in 1910 \nwith a shoe box of postcards he sold while living out of a YMCA. It is \nan unbelievable success story, Hallmark Cards. The company became far \nand away the most successful greeting card company in America, with a \nreputation of treating its workers fairly--a very good company.\n  But under current management, with annual revenues over $4 billion, \nthey started to move jobs from Kansas City to three plants in China. It \nmoved thousands of jobs overseas, though it is not required to disclose \nthe specific numbers.\n  What kind of a card do you send to a Hallmark worker whose job is now \nin China? The very best? We have a right in this country to be \nconcerned about that.\n  I have talked at length about Radio Flyer, the little red wagon, gone \nfrom Illinois to China; Huffy bicycle gone from Ohio to China. I spoke \nabout those at length. But there are new ones as well.\n  Whirlpool. At a time when we are losing so many jobs because of the \ndeep recession, Whirlpool announced last year it was shutting down a \n1,100-worker factory in Evansville, IN, and moving the work to a \nfactory in Mexico. Whirlpool made this decision even though the company \naccepted a $19.3 million grant by the U.S. Department of Energy as part \nof the Recovery Act to develop ``smart appliances.''\n  By the way, this is a picture of a Whirlpool worker walking out of \nhis place of employment, the last walk on the last day. One can wonder \nwhat was going through his mind as he understood he was going to have \nto tell his family he is now out of work. His job still exists, but it \nexists in a foreign country.\n  This is Natalie. Natalie worked for Whirlpool. She is 42 years old. \nShe worked at the Whirlpool appliance plant in Evansville for 19 years \nand in November of last year was told her job is moving to Mexico; $17 \nan hour was too much to pay, and you can get cheaper labor elsewhere. \nShe described that plant closing ``like a punch in the gut.'' You can \nimagine what it is like.\n  I am told local workers and local officials did everything they could \nto try to keep that Whirlpool plant in Evansville, IN, but they were \nunsuccessful.\n  We do see a lot of people wearing football jerseys. This is a Reebok \nPeyton Manning jersey. My guess is they sell a lot of those things. \nThere is not a better quarterback in professional football. He is quite \nan extraordinary football player.\n  Reebok makes this jersey. This jersey is made in El Salvador by a \nChinese-owned company. This jersey is sold for $80 in the United States \nand workers are paid 10 cents for the work they do in El Salvador to \nmake it.\n  Let me say that again. The workers get 10 cents, one thin dime, and \nthe customers pay $80 for the Peyton Manning Reebok football jersey.\n  Here is a photograph that shows the conditions of a sweatshop in El \nSalvador owned by the Chinese. According\n\n[[Page S1353]]\n\nto the National Labor Committee that investigates these things, workers \nare forced to put in 12 to 15 hours of unpaid overtime each week. They \nearn wages that are 77 percent lower than the basic subsistence wage \nfor the region. This is the photograph of the home of a worker at one \nof the Chinese-owned sweatshops. You can see the repressive poverty \nthat exists there, and they get a dime for a jersey the company is paid \n$80 for on the store shelf in the United States.\n  La-Z-Boy chairs announced it would eliminate 1,050 employees in \nDayton, OH, and move production plants to Mexico. I have spoken about \nLa-Z-Boy previously. A few days ago when I talked about jobs, I talked \nabout how La-Z-Boy went to Pennsylvania and bought Pennsylvania House \nFurniture. Pennsylvania House Furniture is a high-end furniture \ncompany, using special Pennsylvania wood to make terrific furniture. \nThey had great craftsmen who worked at that company. La-Z-Boy bought \nthe company. They did not want to have competition for La-Z-Boy in the \ncountry, so they moved Pennsylvania House Furniture to China and \nshipped the Pennsylvania wood to China, put the furniture together, and \nshipped the furniture back to the United States.\n  On the last day of work at the Pennsylvania House Factory, a company \nthat had been around for 100 years, on the last day the plant was open, \nall those craftsmen who were proud of their jobs and proud of their \nwork, when the last piece of Pennsylvania House Furniture came off the \nassembly line, they turned it over, and on the bottom of that last \npiece of furniture, every single worker at that plant came over and \ntook the pen and signed their name. Somebody in this country has a \npiece of furniture that they do not quite understand. It has, on its \nbottom, the signature of craftsmen who worked for a company that for \n100 years made fine furniture in America. They wanted to do that \nbecause they wanted to sign their name to a quality piece of furniture \nmade by an American worker who was proud of their job.\n  La-Z-Boy chairs sent Pennsylvania House Furniture to China. Now we \nunderstand La-Z-Boy furniture has announced it will eliminate 1,050 \njobs in Dayton, OH, and move the production to a plant in Mexico. They \nmoved other jobs to China. In a statement describing the 2008 layoffs, \nthe company said: We regret the impact these moves will have on \nfamilies and the lives of employees affected and so on.\n  I have demonstrated enough. I have a lot of examples of this, and I \nhave, over the years, provided a lot of examples. But I wish to \ndemonstrate that on Wednesday, today, 17 million or so people got up, \nwanted a job and couldn't find it, struggling to try to figure out how \non Earth they can make a living, how they can provide for their family.\n  Here is part of what is happening. This shows the deepening trade \ndeficits our country is experiencing. All this red demonstrates jobs \nmoving elsewhere--American jobs moving elsewhere.\n  This is a description of our trade deficit with China, the largest, \nsingle bilateral deficit in the history of humankind. I know where some \nof these jobs have gone. I know where they make Huffy bicycles. I know \nwhere they make Radio Flyer little red wagons. I know where they make \nEtch A Sketch. I know where they went. They went to China, and I know \nwhy they went there. Because they can hire people at 50 cents an hour. \nThey can work them 12 to 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  The people in Ohio are told: You cannot compete with that. We have to \npay you $11 an hour to make bicycles; you can't compete; sorry, you are \nout of here.\n  The question of a century, when we have developed safe plants, \nminimum wage, retirement benefits to lift America up, when we developed \nthose standards, retirement programs, health benefits, the question at \nthe end of a century is: Do we decide those standards don't matter, the \nlifting of those American workers to good jobs that pay well doesn't \nmatter because we are now saying to them: You compete with Third World \nconditions, you compete with Chinese sweatshops in El Salvador making \nfootball jerseys, you compete with people living 12 in a room, sleeping \nat night, when they do get a chance to sleep, in cinder blocks in China \nin Shinsen making children's toys; is that what we are saying is the \nkind of competition with which we want the American people to have to \ncompete? Because they cannot. Nobody can make a living working for 50 \ncents an hour here. You cannot make a living here if they strip away \nyour retirement and health care and give you 50 cents an hour and tell \nyou to work 7 days a week.\n  The reason I raise this point is because the President said a month \nand a half ago, when he spoke to the Nation and spoke to the Congress: \nClose this tax break that rewards companies that move their jobs \noverseas.\n  My position is not antibusiness. I want American businesses to \nsucceed. I want them to make profits and create jobs. I just want an \nunderstanding that trade agreements must be fair agreements in order \nfor us to compete. I will give an example.\n  This is an example of automobiles in Korea. Ninety-eight percent of \nthe automobiles driven on the streets of South Korea are made in South \nKorea. Is that an accident? Of course not. That is exactly the way the \nKoreans want it. They want to ship Korean cars to be sold in America, \nbut they don't want American cars to be sold in Korea. That has always \nbeen their position. The same is true with China.\n  We now have an agreement with China by which, in the next couple \nyears, we will have a massive influx of cheap Chinese goods coming into \nthis country in the form of automobiles. They probably want me to say \nless expensive automobiles from China. We have an agreement that when \nChinese automobiles come here, we will impose a 2.5-percent tariff. If \nwe ship cars to China, they will impose a 25-percent tariff, and we \nagree to that. That is fundamentally ignorant of our economic \ninterests. Those are the kinds of issues we have to address.\n  If we care about jobs, we need to do two things: One, work on the \nlegislation of the type we are working on. Senator Reid, Senator \nDurbin, myself, and others have worked very hard on legislation to try \nto incentivize the creation of new jobs in our country. We passed a \nbill about a week and a half ago and passed another bill today that is \njob creating. That is the faucet. We are trying to turn the faucet on \nto put jobs into this tub here. The problem is, the drain is wide open \nand we have jobs moving out just as aggressively. We have to plug the \ndrain by saying: Trade matters, fair trade matters most. You must stand \nfor the interests of good jobs that pay well in America. That is a \nfact.\n  I will speak more about this issue at another time. I did wish to say \nI filed the amendment on the bill we finished today and was not able to \ncall it up, as was the case with many amendments. I intend to file it \nagain on another bill. I hope very much we will get a vote on it, and I \nhope, when we get a vote on it, that given the things I just described \nthat are happening to jobs in America, given the fact the President has \nsaid let us at least plug this unbelievably pernicious, ill-advised tax \nbreak for companies that ship jobs overseas, let's at least get that \ndone. Let's try to save some jobs in this country. If we can do that, \nwe will have done something very significant for the people who awaken \nin the morning jobless and who hope to find work at some future date as \nwe restart the engine and start putting American workers back on the \npayroll again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1353-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1353-S1355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SMEARING OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ATTORNEYS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it saddens and concerns me that another \nline has been crossed, moving us further toward partisan excess and \nincivility. I refer to the calculated, political campaign-style attacks \non the loyalty and patriotism of honorable Department of Justice \nattorneys over the past few weeks.\n  Self-restraint is a crucial but often neglected value in our \ndemocracy. Just because a political attack that can put ``points'' on \nthe board is possible, does not make it right. Misleading appeals to \nfear, like this one, are corrosive to our system and to the rule of \nlaw.\n  Just as President Lincoln said of leadership generally, we must \nappeal to our better angels, not to fear and suspicion. Those who have \nmegaphones\n\n[[Page S1354]]\n\nmade possible by millions of dollars, and who use them to shape public \nopinion, must lead responsibly and constructively.\n  Walter Dellinger, a distinguished attorney with a long record of \npublic service, tells from personal experience the story of one \nattorney who is being smeared in these attacks. The glimpse he offers \ninto this issue is so clear and compelling that I will have printed in \nthe Record the full text of his piece, which appeared in the Washington \nPost on March 5.\n  This attack is not about transparency, nor about some purported \nconflict of interest. The Department of Justice set that canard to rest \nwith its February 18 letter. This is about a partisan and personal \nattack. Many of the forces that have been defending John Yoo and other \nBush-Cheney administration lawyers are the very ones seeking to smear \nthese Justice Department attorneys. It is shameful. These American \nlawyers did what they are supposed to do, and what American lawyers \nhave always done--provide legal counsel no matter what the charge or \nhow unpopular the person. That is what John Adams did when he defended \nthe British. This dedication deserves thanks, not reproach. The \nmilitary and civilian lawyers who have previously accepted the \ndifficult task of providing representation to individuals who have been \ndetained by the United States in terrorism cases did no wrong and do \nnot deserve this. Ted Olsen and Ken Starr, lawyers from the Reagan and \nBush administrations, know that and agree. It is saddening and wrong \nthat shallow partisan operatives would sink so low.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of the Justice Department letter \nand articles and editorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 9, 2010]\n\n      `Al-Qaeda 7' Smear Campaign Is an Assault on American Values\n\n                          (By Eugene Robinson)\n\n       The word ``McCarthyism'' is overused, but in this case it's \n     mild. Liz Cheney, the former vice president's ambitious \n     daughter, has in her hand a list of Justice Department \n     lawyers whose ``values'' she has the gall to question. She \n     ought to spend the time examining her own principles, if she \n     can find them.\n       A group that Liz Cheney co-chairs, called Keep America \n     Safe, has spent the past two weeks scurrilously attacking the \n     Justice Department officials because they ``represented or \n     advocated for terrorist detainees'' before joining the \n     administration. In other words, they did what lawyers are \n     supposed to do in this country: ensure that even the most \n     unpopular defendants have adequate legal representation and \n     that the government obeys the law.\n       Liz Cheney is not ignorant, and neither are the other co-\n     chairs of her group, advocate Debra Burlingame and pundit \n     William Kristol, who writes a monthly column for The Post. \n     Presumably they know that ``the American tradition of zealous \n     representation of unpopular clients is at least as old as \n     John Adams' representation of the British soldiers charged in \n     the Boston Massacre''--in other words, older than the nation \n     itself.\n       That quote is from a letter by a group of conservative \n     lawyers--including several former high-ranking officials of \n     the Bush-Cheney administration, legal scholars who have \n     supported draconian detention and interrogation policies, and \n     even Kenneth W. Starr--that blasts the ``shameful series of \n     attacks'' in which Liz Cheney has been the principal \n     mouthpiece. Among the signers are Larry Thompson, who was \n     deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft; Peter Keisler, \n     who was acting attorney general for a time during George W. \n     Bush's second term; and Bradford Berenson, who was an \n     associate White House counsel during Bush's first term.\n       ``To suggest that the Justice Department should not employ \n     talented lawyers who have advocated on behalf of detainees \n     maligns the patriotism of people who have taken honorable \n     positions on contested questions,'' the letter states.\n       But maligning is apparently the whole point of the \n     exercise. The smear campaign by Cheney, et al., has nothing \n     to do with keeping America safe. It can only be an attempt to \n     inflict political damage on the Obama administration by \n     portraying the Justice Department as somehow ``soft'' on \n     terrorism. Even by Washington's low standards, this is \n     unbelievably dishonest and dishonorable.\n       ``Whose values do they share?'' a video on the group's Web \n     site ominously asks. The answer is obvious: the values \n     enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.\n       The most prominent of the nine Justice officials, Principal \n     Deputy Solicitor General Neal Katyal, represented Osama bin \n     Laden's driver, Salim Hamdan, in a case that went to the \n     Supreme Court. In a 5-to-3 decision, the court sided with \n     Hamdan and ruled that the Bush administration's military \n     tribunals were unconstitutional. Are Liz Cheney and her pals \n     angry that Katyal was right? Or do they also question the \n     ``values'' and patriotism of the five justices who voted with \n     the majority?\n       The letter from the conservative lawyers points out that \n     ``in terrorism detentions and trials alike, defense lawyers \n     are playing, and will continue to play, a key role.'' It \n     notes that whether terrorism suspects are tried in civilian \n     or military courts, they will have access to counsel--and \n     that Guantanamo inmates, even if they do not face formal \n     charges, have a right to habeas corpus review of their \n     detention. It is the federal courts--not defense lawyers--\n     that have made all of this crystal clear. If Cheney and her \n     group object, they should prepare a blanket denunciation of \n     the federal judiciary. Or maybe what they really don't like \n     is that pesky old Constitution, with all its checks, balances \n     and guarantees of due process. How inconvenient to live in a \n     country that respects the rule of law.\n       But there I go again, taking the whole thing seriously. \n     This is really part of a death-by-a-thousand-cuts strategy to \n     wound President Obama politically. The charge of softness on \n     terrorism--or terrorist suspects--is absurd; Obama has \n     brought far more resources and focus to the war against al-\n     Qaeda in Afghanistan than the Bush-Cheney administration \n     cared to summon. Since Obama's opponents can't attack him on \n     substance, they resort to atmospherics. They distort. They \n     insinuate. They sully. They blow smoke.\n       This time, obviously, they went too far. But the next Big \n     Lie is probably already in the works. Scorched-earth groups \n     like Keep America Safe may just be pretending not to \n     understand our most firmly established and cherished legal \n     principles, but there is one thing they genuinely don't \n     grasp: the concept of shame.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 7, 2010]\n\n                Are You or Have You Ever Been a Lawyer?\n\n       In the McCarthy era, demagogues on the right smeared loyal \n     Americans as disloyal and charged that the government was \n     being undermined from within.\n       In this era, demagogues on the right are smearing loyal \n     Americans as disloyal and charging that the government is \n     being undermined from within.\n       These voices--often heard on Fox News--are going after \n     Justice Department lawyers who represented Guantanamo \n     detainees when they were in private practice. It is not \n     nearly enough to say that these lawyers did nothing wrong. In \n     fact, they upheld the highest standards of their profession \n     and advanced the cause of democratic justice. The Justice \n     Department is right to stand up to this ugly bullying.\n       Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has been \n     pressing Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. since November to \n     reveal the names of lawyers on his staff who have done legal \n     work for Guantanamo detainees. The Justice Department said \n     last month that there were nine political appointees who had \n     represented the detainees in challenges to their confinement. \n     The department said that they were following all of the \n     relevant conflict-of-interest rules. It later confirmed their \n     names when Fox News figured out who they were.\n       It did not take long for the lawyers to become a \n     conservative target, branded the ``Gitmo 9'' by a group \n     called Keep America Safe, run by Liz Cheney, daughter of \n     former Vice President Dick Cheney, and William Kristol, a \n     conservative activist (who wrote a Times Op-Ed column in \n     2008). The group released a video that asks, in sinister \n     tones, ``Whose values do they share?''\n       On Fox News, Ms. Cheney lashed out at lawyers who \n     ``voluntarily represented terrorists.'' She said it was \n     important to look at who these terrorists are, including \n     Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who had served as Osama bin Laden's \n     driver. Let's do that.\n       Mr. Hamdan was the subject of a legal battle that went all \n     the way to the Supreme Court. Ms. Cheney conveniently omitted \n     that the court ruled in favor of his claim that the military \n     commissions system being used to try detainees like him was \n     illegal. Republican senators then sponsored legislation to \n     fix the tribunals. They did not do the job well, but the \n     issue might never have arisen without the lawyers who argued \n     on behalf of Mr. Hamdan, some of whom wore military uniforms.\n       In order to attack the government lawyers, Ms. Cheney and \n     other critics have to twist the role of lawyers in the \n     justice system. In representing Guantanamo detainees, they \n     were in no way advocating for terrorism. They were ensuring \n     that deeply disliked individuals were able to make their case \n     in court, even ones charged with heinous acts--and that the \n     Constitution was defended.\n       It is not the first time that the right has tried to \n     distract Americans from the real issues surrounding detention \n     policy by attacking lawyers. Charles Stimson, the deputy \n     assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs under \n     George W. Bush, urged corporations not to do business with \n     leading law firms that were defending Guantanamo detainees. \n     He resigned soon after that.\n       If lawyers who take on controversial causes are demonized \n     with impunity, it will be difficult for unpopular people to \n     get legal representation--and constitutional rights that \n     protect all Americans will be weakened. That is a high price \n     to pay for scoring cheap political points.\n\n[[Page S1355]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5, 2010]\n\n               A Shameful Attack on the U.S. Legal System\n\n                         (By Walter Dellinger)\n\n       It never occurred to me on the day that Defense Department \n     lawyer Rebecca Snyder and Lt. Cmdr. William Kuebler of the \n     Navy appeared in my law firm's offices to ask for our \n     assistance in carrying out their duties as military defense \n     lawyers that the young lawyer who worked with me on that \n     matter would be publicly attacked for having done so. And yet \n     this week that lawyer and eight other Justice Department \n     attorneys have been attacked in a video released by a group \n     called Keep America Safe (whose board members include William \n     Kristol and Elizabeth Cheney) for having provided legal \n     assistance to detainees before joining the department. The \n     video questions their loyalty to the United States, asking: \n     ``DOJ: Department of Jihad?'' and ``Who are these government \n     officials? . . . Whose values do they share?''\n       Here, in brief, is the story of one of those lawyers.\n       In June 2007, I was at a federal judicial conference when I \n     received an urgent message to call the Defense Department. \n     The caller was Lt. Cmdr. Kuebler, a uniformed Navy officer \n     who had been detailed to the Office of Military Commissions. \n     As part of his military duties, Kuebler had been assigned to \n     represent Omar Khadr, a Guantanamo detainee who was to be \n     tried before a military commission. Kuebler told me that the \n     U.S. Supreme Court had agreed that day to review the case of \n     another detainee who had been a part of the same lower court \n     proceeding as Khadr. Because Kuebler's client had not sought \n     review at the Supreme Court, this situation raised some \n     complex questions of court practice with which Kuebler was \n     unfamiliar. Kuebler's military superior suggested he call me \n     and ask whether I could assist him in analyzing the \n     applicable Supreme Court rule.\n       It was a Friday night. I called Karl Thompson, a lawyer at \n     my firm who had previously been a Supreme Court law clerk, \n     and asked whether he could look into the question over the \n     weekend. I told Thompson that the military lawyers assigned \n     to these cases had a very burdensome workload and that it \n     seemed that Kuebler could really use our help. Even though \n     Thompson was extremely busy with other work at the firm, he \n     said he would somehow find time for this as well.\n       Over the next several months, Thompson (in addition to his \n     other firm work) provided assistance to Kuebler and his \n     Defense Department colleague in their briefing before the \n     Supreme Court and, in Khadr's case, the lower courts. Khadr's \n     case raises important questions, including the legal status \n     of juvenile detainees (he was 15 years old at the time of \n     capture). In 2009, Thompson left our firm to join the Office \n     of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department.\n       Thompson's assistance to the military officers who had been \n     assigned to Khadr's case seemed to me to be not only part of \n     a lawyer's professional obligation but a small act of \n     patriotism as well. The other Justice Department lawyers \n     named in this week's attack came to provide assistance to \n     detainees in a number of ways, but they all deserve our \n     respect and gratitude for fulfilling the professional \n     obligations of lawyers. This sentiment is widely shared \n     across party and ideological lines by leaders of the bar. As \n     former Solicitor General Ted Olson wrote in response to \n     previous attacks on detainee lawyers, ``The ethos of the bar \n     is built on the idea that lawyers will represent both the \n     popular and the unpopular, so that everyone has access to \n     justice. Despite the horrible Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, this \n     is still proudly held as a basic tenet of our profession.''\n       That those in question would have their patriotism, loyalty \n     and values attacked by reputable public figures such as \n     Elizabeth Cheney and journalists such as Kristol is as \n     depressing a public episode as I have witnessed in many \n     years. What has become of our civic life in America? The only \n     word that can do justice to the personal attacks on these \n     fine lawyers--and on the integrity of our legal system--is \n     shameful. Shameful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1355-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1355-S1356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAKE BURTON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \nhonor a dear friend and true entrepreneur, Jake Burton. As founder and \nowner of Burton Snowboards, a company whose name has become synonymous \nwith the successes of this popular winter sport, Jake Burton has built \nan empire from the ground up starting, first in his Londonderry, VT, \ngarage. His is a true tale of perseverance and triumph over obstacles \ngreat and small; where others saw only insurmountable challenges, Jake \nsaw possibility.\n  As a young man starting out with a vision, Jake sought to set the \nworld of winter sports on fire. He did so in true Vermont fashion, \npaying personal visits to ski areas hesitant to embrace snowboarding. \nTo this day, Jake makes a point of personally testing each of his \nproducts on the slopes before putting them on the market. His \ncommitment to quality and his investment in his employees continues to \npay off. Jake recognizes the value of a homegrown company and takes \nnothing for granted. His competitive edge and style set him apart from \nthe others in his line of work and serve him well as he continues to \ndefine the future of snowboarding. Marcelle and I have been fortunate \nto call Jake and his wife Donna our friends for many years. They are \nadmirable Vermonters and examples of how the pursuit of a dream through \nhonest hard work is still the cornerstone of American business.\n  On February 15, 2010, the Burlington Free Press published an article \nentitled ``Jake Burton: Chairman of the (snow)Board'' about Jake's \ncareer. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 15, 2010]\n\n                Jake Burton: Chairman of the (snow)Board\n\n                     (By Bruce Horovitz, USA Today)\n\n       His office has no desk. No inbox. Not even a wastebasket.\n       But it does have a sprawling wooden table for mounting \n     bindings onto snowboards, a sofa the size of a small living \n     room and a golden retriever named Maia, who's made the couch \n     her bed.\n       This is Jake Burton's life--a major cool one.\n       As the founder, cultural guru and chief prankster of the \n     world's largest snowboard company--and the guy who almost \n     single-handedly turned snowboarding into a multibillion-\n     dollar sport--he's got a lot to do. Like snowboard 100 days a \n     year. And surf for another 50, or so.\n       His mountaintop home in Stowe has an a outdoor hockey rink, \n     an indoor soccer field and a two-story treehouse with \n     electricity.\n       With the Winter Olympics under way in Vancouver, Burton \n     will soon join his team of Olympic snowboarders there and \n     probably cause a Burton-esque ruckus.\n       For one thing, the competition uniform Burton's company \n     designed for the U.S. snowboard team is raising eyebrows \n     before the torch is even lit. It's made from high-tech, \n     waterproof Gore-Tex material--but looks like a pair of ripped \n     blue jeans and a loose flannel shirt. Not necessarily what \n     buttoned-up Olympic officials had in mind.\n       ``That the outfit has created a controversy is fitting,'' \n     says Burton, 55, with a trademark smirk. ``If it's \n     unpatriotic, you should throw everyone wearing blue jeans and \n     flannel shirts out of the country.''\n       Still, the ride has been bumpy lately in snowboard land. \n     The sport of free spirits is under greater scrutiny since 22-\n     year-old Kevin Pearce, one of its stars and a Burton rider, \n     was almost killed in an accident while training for the \n     Olympics.\n       Even as Pearce heals, other problems for Burton's company--\n     and for all winter snow-sports businesses in this economy--\n     are festering.\n       Sales of winter sports equipment fell 8 percent last year, \n     and orders for 2010 are down 25 percent, reports the \n     SnowSports Industries America trade group. By one estimate, \n     nearly 10 small snowboard shops went belly-up every week in \n     2009. Although ski resort visits were up slightly overall for \n     the 2008-2009 season, several regions suffered steep \n     declines, and many resorts built visits with specials and \n     discounted lift tickets.\n\n\n                               tough year\n\n       Burton Snowboards, the industry kingpin, saw sales fall by \n     double-digits last year and had to take the unusual step of \n     laying off nearly 20 of its roughly 1,000 employees last \n     March. The company announced last week it was laying off 15 \n     more from its Burlington facility.\n       ``Nothing like a tough year to make you forget how far \n     Burton has come,'' Burton said.\n       But even in a tough year, Burton Snowboards' success is \n     impressive. The privately held company holds 40 percent of \n     the world's snowboard market. Sales are not reported, but are \n     believed to reach almost $700 million.\n       Thanks to diversification into surfing and skateboarding \n     and the opening of several brand stores, Burton could be a $1 \n     billion company within five years. ``I'm not hung up on that \n     number,'' said Burton, whose tousled salt-and-pepper hair \n     and red cheeks are evidence of the morning snowboard run \n     from which he's just returned. ``I'm not the kind of guy \n     who gets up every morning and says, `We have to get to $1 \n     billion.' ''\n       Even non-snowboarders are becoming familiar with the brand. \n     The uber-presence of Burton boards and clothing in the 2006 \n     Winter Games earned it an estimated $33 million in free \n     exposure. The company now makes more money selling apparel, \n     often to folks who've never been on a board, than it makes \n     from snowboard equipment.\n       But the Olympic participation is more about image than \n     sales, because the Games come at the tail of the season. \n     ``The timing of the Olympics from a business perspective is \n     awkward,'' he says. ``You're not affecting consumer buying in \n     mid-February.''\n       Viewers who go gaga over the team's tattered-blue-jean look \n     won't be able to buy it. ``It would not be our style to sell \n     Olympic uniforms,'' Burton said. ``We, as a company, are not \n     about uniforms.''\n       What Burton, the company, is about is ``cool.'' While the \n     company is as synonymous\n\n[[Page S1356]]\n\n     with snowboarding as Kleenex is with tissue, the hard part is \n     staying cool. It helps, Burton said, that Burton Snowboards' \n     decisions aren't dictated by Wall Street, ``but are made by a \n     guy and his family who snowboard 100 days a year.''\n       His leadership style includes traits such as:\n       He can't stand losing. Terje Haakonsen, a Burton athlete \n     widely regarded as the world's top snowboarder, says Burton \n     constantly challenges him at everything from snowboarding to \n     swimming. ``Jake just doesn't want to lose,'' he says.\n       He can't stand shoddy quality. During his 100 days of \n     snowboarding, Burton isn't goofing off. He tests most of the \n     company's equipment--from boards to gloves--before it goes to \n     market, and he makes detailed notes on index cards. Designers \n     wince when they receive one of the cards, Burton's CEO \n     Laurent Potdevin said. ``He has no patience for anything that \n     jeopardizes the riding experience.''\n       He can't stand boredom. One morning five years ago at a \n     sales meeting in New Zealand, Burton asked Dave Downing, who \n     does outside marketing for Burton, if he was up for surfing \n     and boarding--the same day. The two sneaked out of the \n     meeting and took a chartered helicopter to a beach to surf \n     then to a mountain to snowboard.\n       He can't stand leaving things alone. Burton will test any \n     product the design team sends him, says Chris Doyle, who \n     oversees product development. He was the first--and last--to \n     test pants with an internal fan ventilation system controlled \n     by a pocket switch. He gave the all-clear to a glove, a hot \n     seller this year, that comes with a beer-can holder. Even \n     after designers work months on new products, Burton has \n     turned them upside-down--or even nixed them--based on a \n     suggestion from a teenage boarder on a ski lift.\n       He can't stand serious. At a recent roundtable with top \n     executives and team riders, Burton broke it into ``a no-\n     holds-barred wrestling match,'' said Greg Dacyshyn, company \n     creative director. ``Jake will take on anyone at anything.''\n       He can't stand still. Shaun White, the Burton rider who is \n     an Olympic gold medalist and one of the U.S. team's great \n     hopes in Vancouver, says there's no stopping Burton on a \n     slope. ``When he's in the trees, he does ripping turns. He's \n     a wild man.''\n       He can't stand combs. Jake's wife, Donna, who helps run the \n     company and has been married to Jake for 22 years since \n     meeting him at a ski resort bar, remembers her mother's \n     comment after first meeting him: ``I don't think he combs his \n     hair.''\n\n\n                         Inauspicious beginning\n\n       That he got this far in business surprises no one more than \n     the guy who was born Jake Burton Carpenter, but goes by just \n     Jake Burton. ``I was a punk. I got kicked out of boarding \n     school at 15.''\n       For one thing, he was a self-described ``loser'' in shop \n     class. But wanting to improve the design of ``Snuffer'' \n     snowboards that were briefly popular when he was a kid, he \n     made a new kind of board in his Londonderry, Vt., garage.\n       He created his first business plan to sell snowboards on an \n     index card. He figured if he could make and sell 50 boards a \n     day, he'd be rich. He sold just 350 the entire first year and \n     ran up debt that nearly wiped him out.\n       But when he sold 700 boards the next year, he decided he \n     was onto something. Until the next setback, that is. His bank \n     cut off financing in 1984 when its executives decided \n     snowboarding was a passing fad.\n       He persevered, becoming a one-man cheerleading squad. He \n     visited hundreds of ski hills that had banned snowboarding, \n     trying to coax reluctant resort owners into allowing it. Many \n     equated snowboarding with rowdiness, or worse. But one by \n     one, they relented.\n       ``He took on all the ski resorts,'' said John Horan, \n     publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence newsletter. ``He's \n     absolutely the father of the sport.''\n       The sport has become so big that Burton Snowboards has \n     attracted acquisition interest from the sportswear giants. \n     Burton won't say who and insists, ``Everybody knows that \n     Burton is not for sale.''\n       The headquarters is in an industrial area here, a funky \n     building that looks more like a winter playground than a \n     workplace. There's a snowboarding park out front--with jumps. \n     Employees are free to use it at any time. Many workers are \n     accompanied by their dogs--they are encouraged to bring them \n     to work. Employees can warm up with company-supplied coffee \n     or hot chocolate at a giant, wood-burning fireplace in the \n     lobby.\n       Each also gets a free season lift pass to a nearby resort. \n     Anytime it snows more than 2 feet, the place shuts down and \n     everyone gets to go boarding.\n       There are worse things than to work for Jake Burton, but \n     there may not be many better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1356-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      95TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the \n95th anniversary of the American Medical Women's Association, AMWA. \nAMWA is the Nation's oldest and largest multispecialty organization for \nwomen in medicine.\n  The American Medical Women's Association was founded in 1915 in \nChicago by Dr. Bertha Van Hoosen. At the time, women physicians were a \nminority, representing only 5 to 6 percent of all physicians in the \nUnited States. With the creation of AMWA, Dr. Van Hoosen intended ``to \nbring Medical Women into communication with each other for their mutual \nadvantage, and to encourage social and harmonious relations within and \nwithout the profession.''\n  Since its inception 95 years ago, AMWA's membership has grown \nsignificantly. With more than 13,000 members today, AMWA has become a \nstrong and trusted voice for women's health and the advancement of \nwomen in medicine at the local, national, and international level. For \nnearly a century, AMWA has empowered its members to be leaders in \nimproving health for all, within a model that reflects the unique \nperspective of women.\n  AMWA's members include physicians, residents, medical students, and \nhealth care professionals, all of whom are engaged in making a \ndifference in the communities they serve. AMWA's charitable program, \nthe American Women's Hospital Service, has provided international \nrelief for more than 90 years, supporting clinics all over the world. \nThe Journal of Women's Health, AMWA's medical journal, is a trusted \nresource for research and information on a wide range of women's health \nissues, and has been cited by the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, \nUS News and World Report, and MSNBC.com. Through its many educational \nprograms, support and mentorship of young women physicians, health care \nadvocacy, and the promotion of excellence in medicine and scientific \nresearch, AMWA's members are truly champions for women's health.\n  Since 1915, the American Medical Women's Association has served as \nthe vision and voice of women in medicine. On its 95th anniversary, I \ncommend the American Medical Women's Association for its tireless \nefforts to advance women in medicine, and look forward to its many \nfuture successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1356-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NEBRASKA OLYMPIAN\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nCurt Tomasevicz of Shelby, NE, and his teammates who won the gold medal \nin the four-man bobsled at the Winter Olympic games in Vancouver, \nBritish Columbia, Canada. It was the first gold medal for the United \nStates in this event since the 1948 St. Moritz, Switzerland, games more \nthan 60 years ago.\n  After blistering the course with back-to-back track records, the U.S. \nsled only needed to post a solid fourth run to give the United States a \ngold medal. The Americans made it through the course in 51.52 seconds, \nresulting in a total time of 3:24.46, 0.38 seconds ahead of second \nplace.\n  Curt got his start in sports at Shelby High School, where he helped \nthe football team to the State semifinals and was an all-conference \npick as both a linebacker and a fullback. After high school, Curt \nattended the University of Nebraska, where he continued his football \ncareer as a Cornhusker.\n  In 2004, Curt began bobsledding; and just 2 years later, he earned a \nspot on the U.S. Olympic team competing in Torino, Italy. Since then, \nhe has continued to compete in international bobsledding events and \ntook home a World Cup gold medal in two-man sledding in 2007.\n  Curt's dedication and hard work is an inspiration to all Nebraskans. \nHe showed what can be accomplished through determination and teamwork. \nCongratulations, Curt, on your inspiring achievement of Olympic gold. \nIt is a tremendous accomplishment and instills pride in all Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1356-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1356-S1357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING DORIS HADDOCK\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Doris \nHaddock, who passed away on March 9. Doris was an extraordinary \nAmerican who showed all of us the meaning of dedication and conviction.\n  Known to so many of her admirers as Granny D, Doris walked across the \ncountry, from California to Washington DC, to push for passage of the\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\nMcCain-Feingold bill. That coast-to-coast trek would be a tremendous \naccomplishment at any age, to be sure, but Doris did it in her 90th \nyear. I had the pleasure of meeting Doris and walking with her through \nNashville, TN, many months into her trip. As we walked together through \nthe streets of Nashville, shouts of ``Go, Granny Go'' came from every \ncorner--from drivers in their cars, pedestrians on the sidewalk and \nconstruction workers on the job.\n  It was an honor to walk alongside her on her incredible journey, \nwhere she endured so much--intense desert heat, bone-chilling cold, and \nuncertainty about where she would find shelter along the way. Yet she \nwalked all that way, and as she did she inspired countless Americans to \nstand up for our democracy. She truly had the courage of her \nconvictions, and that is something she proved with every step she took.\n  I will always be proud to have had Doris's support for the Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act. Doris and Americans like her made all the \ndifference as we worked to ban soft money and curb the power of wealthy \ninterests in our democracy. And it turned out that with her walk across \nthe country, Doris was just getting started. She continued to work as a \ndedicated activist, wrote books and, at age 94, ran for the Senate in \nher home state of New Hampshire. Her energy and determination, at an \nage that most of us can only hope to reach, were truly incredible.\n  After I sent Doris a letter on her 100th birthday in January, I \nreceived a very kind note from her in response. In it she said that she \nwas ``working on plans for the future,'' which I thought was an \nabsolutely wonderful thing to say at such an advanced age. Doris was \nvery unhappy with the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United \ncase, and that was going to be a focus of her formidable energy going \nforward. After a century, Doris seemed to be just getting started, and \nthat was one of the many wonderful qualities that brought her so many \nfans and admirers. In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision allowing \ncorporate cash to flood our elections, we will remember her efforts as \nwe fight to ensure all Americans are heard on election day, not just \nthe rich and powerful.\n  My thoughts today are with Doris's family, and all who were lucky \nenough to know her. Our country is a better place because Doris Haddock \nwas constantly working on plans for the future, and on ways to build a \nbetter future for our country. I am personally deeply grateful for her \nmany efforts, and I am proud to pay tribute to her memory \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1357-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1357-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1357-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n             ON MARCH 15, 1995, WITH RESPECT TO IRAN--PM 49\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication stating that \nthe emergency declared on March 15, 1995, is to continue in effect \nbeyond March 15, 2010.\n  The crisis between the United States and Iran resulting from actions \nand policies of the Government of Iran that led to the declaration of a \nnational emergency on March 15, 1995, has not been resolved. The \nactions and policies of the Government of Iran are contrary to the \ninterests of the United States in the region and pose a continuing \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I have \ndetermined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency \ndeclared with respect to Iran and maintain in force comprehensive \nsanctions against Iran to respond to this threat.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 10, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1357-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4547.

A bill to prevent an economic disaster by providing budget \nreform; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I move around the State of Utah to \ntalk to my constituents, I find, with all of the other specifics they \nare concerned about, the one thing just about everybody is concerned \nabout is our long-term fiscal situation. They are worried about debt. \nThey are worried about the deficit in this year that is adding to the \ndebt. They say to me: What can we do about it? They listen to the \npundits who talk on the air about this particular project or that \nparticular project that sounds outrageous. Many times the projects are, \nin fact, legitimate, but they make good copy.\n  I say, if you add up all of these projects together--the good ones \nand the bad ones--and eliminated them all, you would reduce the Federal \ndeficit by less than 1 percent. Let's talk about where the money lies. \nLet's talk about where the challenge is. So I present to my \nconstituents a series of charts that I will present here that outline \nwhere the challenge is.\n  One of the things that becomes clear, as we go into this debate, is \nit is not just our financial situation that is in trouble. The \npressures created by our debt are crossing over into the area of \nnational security. We cannot maintain our military or our diplomatic \ninitiatives with the kinds of pressures continually increasing.\n  So a little bit of history, which I share with my constituents and \nthat I share here as the background for the bill I am introducing \ntoday.\n  This is a very simple pie chart that shows the components of Federal \nspending back in 1966. I ask my constituents: Why do I pick 1966 as the \nyear to start? Some of them know the answer; some of them do not. But \nin 1966, mandatory spending constituted 26 percent of the budget, and \ninterest on the national debt another 7 percent. You have to pay the \ninterest on the bonds, so that is mandatory spending as well. So the \ngovernment is committed for a third of the budget before the Congress \never gets around to appropriating any money.\n  In 1966, the biggest portion of mandatory spending was Social \nSecurity. The combination of Social Security and other mandatory \nprograms, and the interest cost, was one-third of the budget. The other \ntwo-thirds was available to the Congress. Of that spending, defense \nspending was 44 percent of the total. Defense spending, obviously, \ndominated nondefense discretionary spending.\n  Where are we today? What has happened in the years since 1966 and \ntoday? Here are the components of Federal spending in fiscal 2008. I \npicked that year, before the tsunami hit us--the financial tsunami that \ncaused the meltdown and all of the problems--as\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\nperhaps a demonstration of what is happening structurally within the \nbudget, not affected by any particular emergency.\n  Mandatory spending has now grown to 54 percent. Interest costs are \nfrom 7 to 8 percent. So the two of them constitute roughly two-thirds \nof the budget. From 1966 to 2008, mandatory spending now is twice as \nbig in its proportion of the budget than it used to be. Defense \nspending has shrunk to a half of what it was back in the 1960s, and \nnondefense discretionary spending is about the same.\n  All right. Now back to the question: Why did I pick 1966 as the year \nto start with? Because that is the year the Federal Government got into \nthe medical business and enacted Medicare. Since then, we have added \nMedicaid. So today, when you talk about mandatory spending, Social \nSecurity is no longer the dominant factor. It is a combination of \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  I will leave aside the issue of the value of those programs. I am \njust talking about the money we are spending here. Today, as we argue \nover congressional spending, we only have a third of the budget to talk \nabout, and half of that, roughly, is defense spending.\n  Let's go to fiscal year 2009. Mandatory spending has grown to 59 \npercent. The interest cost is 5 percent. Defense will have shrunk, \nnondefense will have shrunk. The reason the interest costs are \nshrinking is because we are borrowing money at a lower rate by virtue \nof the things that have happened with the financial tsunami.\n  But now let's go out 10 years to 2020 and see where we will be. In 10 \nyears, mandatory spending will have grown to 58 percent. The interest \ncosts will have grown to 13 percent, and defense and nondefense \ntogether will constitute only 30 percent. If defense is shrunk to 15 \npercent of the budget, it begins to bite very seriously into America's \nrole in national security around the world.\n  One author I have looked at who has talked about America's role in \nthe world in a very thoughtful way looks ahead to this, and he says the \ngreatest threat to America's position in the world is not China, it is \nnot India, it is not North Korea. It is Medicare. The greatest threat \nto America's ability to sustain itself and its national security is \ncoming from the growth of mandatory spending.\n  If we spend all of our time arguing over those tiny things that make \ngood copy in newspapers and on television and do not address this \ninexorable growth, we will discover that the Congress has become \nirrelevant. Three-fourths of the budget of Congress will already be \nspent before the Congress even meets, and only one-fourth will be left \nfor us to talk about, and that one-fourth will have to include our \nspending for national security, and you will see how everything else \nwill get squeezed out.\n  I had that hit me directly as we had the debate last year on the \nbudget resolution for fiscal year 2010. Standing at this very place, I \nlooked down at the bill that was presented and sitting here on a \npodium, and it projected Federal revenues for fiscal year 2010 at $2.2 \ntrillion--down because of the challenges we had with the economic \nmeltdown. Then on the next page it said: mandatory spending, $2.2 \ntrillion. That meant everything we do in government in fiscal year \n2010, other than mandatory spending--the Defense Department, the war in \nAfghanistan, the FAA which controls the airplanes, the national parks, \nour embassies overseas, the FBI, all of our law enforcement, the border \nsecurity--everything, every single dime we spend in government, other \nthan mandatory spending, in fiscal year 2010 had to be borrowed. We did \nnot have a single dime of tax revenue available to pay for anything in \ngovernment because it was all taken up in mandatory spending.\n  All right. What does this do to us long term as a nation?\n  People keep talking about the national debt and how it is growing and \ngrowing and growing. Actually, the national debt has not been growing \nand growing and growing over the years. Here is a chart that shows the \nnational debt measured in the way it should be measured, as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product, the size of the national debt \nwith respect to the size of the economy.\n  To illustrate why this is the way to do it--I have often used this \nexample on the Senate floor--I ran a company before I came here. When I \nbecame the CEO of that company it was very small. It had a debt of \n$75,000. When I stepped down to retire prior to running for the Senate, \nthe debt was $7.5 million. One might say: Well, Bob Bennett, you are \nnot a very good manager if you ran the debt up from $75,000 to $7.5 \nmillion. Then you look at the debt the way you should look at it.\n  At the time I became the CEO of that company, they were doing under \n$300,000 a year in total revenue. They had no margin at all. Every dime \nthey took in, in revenue, was eaten up with costs, and they could not \nmake the payments on the $75,000 debt. The $75,000 debt threatened the \nsurvival of the company. When we had a $7.5 million debt, the company \nwas doing over $80 million in business, and we had a 15-percent margin \non sales. We were earning more per year than the whole debt we had, and \nthe only reason we didn't pay it off is because we had some prepayment \npenalties built into the mortgages we had established. So I wasn't such \na bad steward after all, if you make the measure totally on the basis \nof the size of the debt. I was a good steward if you make it on the \nmeasure of the debt in relationship to the size of the enterprise.\n  That is what this chart shows: the national debt as a percentage of \nthe size of the enterprise, to use business terms; in this case, the \nsize of the economy.\n  We see that just after the Second World War our national debt was \nwell over 100 percent of GDP, and in the two decades after the Second \nWorld War, we come from 1945 to 1965, the debt had shrunk from over 100 \npercent of GDP to close to 30 percent of GDP. Even though it was going \nup in nominal dollars, it was coming down as a percentage because the \neconomy was growing so rapidly. Then, once again, we add to our \nentitlement spending, we add Medicare, and we see this is the trough. \nIt begins to grow and it begins to grow.\n  When we get to the end of the Cold War, it turns down again because \nof two things: No. 1, our defense spending goes down and the economy \nbooms. We get tremendous growth as a result of the end of the Cold War. \nIt was at 46.9 percent when Medicare and Medicaid got started, and not \nmuch different in 1989 by the end of the Cold War, 53.1 percent. This \nshows the historic level it has been.\n  OK. Now, this is the history, and the blue line shows the projections \nthat the Obama administration has given us as to what will happen under \ntheir spending plan. One thing we know about projections is that they \nare always wrong. We don't know whether they are wrong on the high side \nor the low side, but we know they are always wrong. What usually \nhappens is that the projections are always optimistic and circumstances \ncome in with a result that is less than we had hoped for.\n  So if we take this as an optimistic projection, we are saying when we \nget to 2020, which is only a decade away--only 10 years away--the \nnational debt will be back up very close to what it was at the end of \nthe Second World War. That is unacceptable. Everyone in this Chamber \nknows that entitlement spending is the driving force behind all of \nthis. Everyone in this Chamber knows shaving back a little on this \nprogram or cutting out a particular grant on another program will have \nno real impact on this if we don't have the courage to deal with \nentitlement spending.\n  So today I am introducing a bill to deal with entitlement spending. I \nhave no illusions that it is going to pass in this Congress, but I wish \nto lay it down so we at least have a marker from which to begin. I have \nalready done that with Social Security.\n  Several years ago, when I was chairman of the Joint Economic \nCommittee, I held a series of hearings on Social Security and \ndiscovered that we can indeed solve the Social Security problem. We can \nmove numbers around a little and say to everyone who is currently \ndrawing Social Security: You will continue to draw Social Security \nthroughout your lifetime, adjusted for inflation. Nothing will happen \nto it. Furthermore, your children can draw the same level of Social \nSecurity benefits that you draw adjusted for inflation through their \nlifetimes without any\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\ndanger to it, and their children can draw Social Security throughout \ntheir lifetimes at exactly the same level adjusted for inflation, \nwithout a tax increase.\n  How is that possible? The way it is possible is to say we are only \ngoing to allow Social Security benefits to grow as rapidly as inflation \ngrows. We already have built into the program that we are going to pay \nSocial Security plus inflation, plus a nice little kicker along the \nway. That nice little kicker along the way over 10 years, and then 20 \nyears, then 30 years pretty soon gets us into the kind of trouble I \nhave described. If we say, no, we will allow it to grow with respect to \ninflation, but we will not allow it to grow any more rapidly than that, \nthen the kind of thing that happened here can happen again. As the \neconomy grows more rapidly than the inflation rate, we will see the \nnational debt begin to come down, we will see the pressure on national \nsecurity begin to ease, and we will see the great concern that \nAmericans have about the financial situation begin to be addressed in \nthe way it was addressed in the years after the Second World War.\n  I am not saying we abolish entitlement programs. There are some of my \nconstituents who say that is the thing to do: just abolish Medicare; \nabolish Social Security. I say, yes, we want to abolish these things \nbut keep the taxes because that is what we would have to do if we are \ngoing to get the financial circumstance we like. No, over time, we can \ndo this without abolishing these programs, but we have to see to it \nthey do not grow.\n  So here is what my bill will do. It will control the growth of \nentitlement spending by reinstating spending limits and saying \nentitlement programs cannot grow at a rate faster than the inflation \nrate. That will mean to the future Congresses, if they adopt this bill: \nOK, we can still spend for Medicare, we can still spend for Medicaid, \nwe can still do Social Security, but we can't add things to it in such \na way that will cause it to grow more rapidly than inflation, No. 1. \nNo. 2, do the same thing with all nondefense discretionary spending. We \nwill allow it to grow each year in accordance with the inflation rate, \nbut we will not allow increases in nondefense discretionary spending \nmore rapidly than the inflation rate. Then, No. 3, enforce the spending \ncaps with automatic spending reductions and budget points of order, the \ndetails of the kind of thing we get into around here all the time.\n  The bill is very simple, very straightforward, but it gives the kind \nof direction that many of the solutions that have been proposed around \nhere don't do. Many of the solutions we have around here sound great, \nand they are very complicated--this point of order lies here, and that \nsituation there--but, overall, we are turning our backs on two-thirds \nof the Federal spending. We say we would not address them because these \nprograms are popular, and we don't want to offend the voters by saying \nsomething has to be done with the most popular programs in America.\n  I find the voters are saying we have to deal with this. We have to \nhave the courage to deal with it, which means we have to have the \ncourage to deal with entitlement spending and not just focus on \nnondefense discretionary spending.\n  The final thing my bill will do is to prohibit the creation of any \nnew mandatory spending programs, which is, again, part of the problem \nwe have had.\n  I close by repeating a question I ask my constituents as I am making \nthis presentation to them. I say: How many of you know who Willie \nSutton was? Most of my audience is young enough not to know the answer \nto that question, but there are a few who say Willie Sutton was a bank \nrobber, and that is true. He wasn't a very good bank robber because he \nkept getting caught. Each time he would serve his sentence and then he \nwould go out after he had been released from prison and he would rob \nanother bank.\n  Finally, somebody said to him--and this is why we remember Willie \nSutton, not for being a bad bank robber but for the comment he made. \nSomebody said: Willie, why do you keep robbing banks?\n  He said: Because that is where the money is.\n  We look at the national debt, we look at the problems we face, and we \nask the question: Where is the money? We have to rein in the \nentitlement spending because that is where the money is. It is two-\nthirds of the budget now, three-fourths of the budget within 10 years. \nIf we continue to ignore the growth of entitlement spending and focus \nentirely on the rest of it, that makes good press but not good policy. \nWe will find our financial situation is up here, our national debt will \nbe as high as it was with the percentage of GDP as it was after the \nSecond World War, and our national security will be threatened to the \npoint that our entire posture around the world will be changed, simply \nbecause we would not be able to afford it.\n  It is for that reason that I send to the desk an act that may be \ncited as the Economic Disaster Prevention Act of 2010 that deals with \nspending limits on entitlement programs as well as spending limits on \ndiscretionary spending, and the prohibition of any new mandatory \nspending programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Brown of \n        Ohio, and Mrs. Shaheen):\n  S. 3098. A bill to prohibit proprietary trading and certain \nrelationships with hedge funds and private equity funds, to address \nconflicts of interest with respect to certain securitizations, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to relay a story that says a \ngreat deal about how the worst financial crisis since the Great \nDepression came to be.\n  In 2006, a bond trader at Lehman Brothers struck up a conversation \nwith one of the firm's college interns. When the trader asked this \nintern, who had not yet begun his senior year, what he was doing on his \nwinter vacation, the young man replied that he would be trading \nderivatives for Lehman. That was a surprise, but the shock came when \nthe intern said the firm had given him $150 million of its own money \nfor this college student to bet on risky derivatives.\n  Now, one college junior and his $150 million trading account did not \nbring the entire financial system close to collapse. But it is just \nthis brand of recklessness that led to the need for multibillion-dollar \nbailouts and to the worst recession in decades, one that has left \nmillions of Americans without a job.\n  The losses that Lehman and other large financial firms racked up, \ntrading on their own account and not on the behalf of investors, helped \nbuild the bonfire that nearly engulfed our entire financial system.\n  That is why I have joined Senators Merkley, Kaufman, Sherrod Brown, \nand Shaheen to introduce the Protect our Recovery Through Oversight of \nProprietary Trading Act, or PROP Trading Act. With this legislation, we \nattempt to rein in some of the reckless practices that led to economic \ncatastrophe, the proprietary trading and hedge-fund operations that \nlost billions of dollars, caused the collapse of some of our biggest \nfinancial institutions, and pushed other major financial firms to the \nbrink of collapse.\n  This legislation would accomplish several important goals to ensure \nthat the abuses of recent years don't lead to another crisis. It would \nban taxpayer insured banks, and their affiliates and subsidiaries, from \nengaging in proprietary trading that is, trading on their own behalf \nand not that of their customers. It would ban taxpayer insured banks \nfrom investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds. \nNonbank institutions that are critically important to the systemic \nhealth of the financial system, i.e., those that have been deemed ``too \nbig to fail,'' would be subject to new capital requirements and limits \non their ability to trade on their own behalf or invest in hedge funds \nor private equity funds. Federal regulators would set those \nrequirements and limits. And our legislation would prohibit \nunderwriters of asset-backed securities from engaging in transactions \nthat create a conflict of interest with respect to the securities they \npackage and sell.\n  The reaction of Wall Street has been swift. Proprietary trading, they \ntell us, was not a large factor in creating the financial crisis. And \nrestrictions on proprietary trading would have no effect in preventing \nthe next crisis.\n  On both points, they are wrong. Here is why.\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\n  While Wall Street claims that proprietary trading was a tiny part of \nits operations before the crisis, their financial reports during the \nboom years tell a different story. Firms such as Goldman Sachs and \nLehman Brothers earned as much as half their revenue on proprietary \ntrades when markets were booming. Bank of America reported in a 2008 \nregulatory filing that losses in ``large proprietary trading and \ninvestment positions'' had ``a direct and large negative impact on our \nearnings.'' JP Morgan Chase warned in its 10K filing for 2008 that it \nheld large ``positions in securities in markets that lack pricing \ntransparency or liquidity,'' presumably proprietary positions. \nLikewise, Goldman Sachs told regulators that the collapse of \nproprietary asset values ``have had a direct and large negative \nimpact'' on its earnings.\n  What these firms are saying in the dry, lawyerly language of SEC \nfilings is that they had been betting big, and losing big, and those \nfailed bets had done them serious harm.\n  How much harm? By August of 2008, according to one estimate, the \nnation's largest financial firms had suffered $230 billion in losses \nfrom proprietary trading. Only a Wall Street trader could dismiss such \nlosses as immaterial; in fact, that total is about one-third the size \nof the Wall Street rescue package we were forced to approve. Nearly \nevery major financial institution suffered major losses in proprietary \ntrades. Lehman Brothers, whose bankruptcy was a major contributor to \nthe financial crisis, in 2006 derived more than half its revenue from \nproprietary trades. By 2007, its proprietary holdings totaled $313 \nbillion. But the firm lost $32 billion on such trades in 2007 and 2008, \nnearly double the value of the firm's common equity. Bear Stearns \ncollapsed and was bought by JP Morgan Chase with federal aid in large \npart because of the collapse of its hedge funds. Morgan Stanley, JP \nMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, each suffered major losses \nas a result of the risky bets they placed on securities that plummeted \nin value.\n  There also is a need to prevent financial institutions that create \nasset-backed securities from engaging in transactions connected to \nthose securities that present a conflict of interest. As has been \nwidely reported, some institutions at the height of the boom in asset-\nbacked securities were creating these securities, selling them to \ninvestors, and then placing bets that their product would fail. Phil \nAngelides, the chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, has \nlikened this practice to selling customers a car with faulty brakes, \nand then buying life insurance on the driver. It is an abusive \npractice, it should stop, and our legislation would stop it.\n  It would be irresponsible of us to allow such risk and abuse to \nremain present in our financial system, lying dormant until the day we \nare once again on the brink of financial catastrophe, and once again \nthe need to rescue financial firms who refuse to prudently manage their \nrisks. This legislation is urgently important, and I urge my colleagues \nto carefully consider the consequences of failing to act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n        Lugar, Mr. Bennet, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 3102. A bill to amend the miscellaneous rural development \nprovisions of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to \nauthorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make loans to certain \nentities that will use the funds to make loans to consumers to \nimplement energy efficiency measures involving structural improvements \nand investments in cost-effective, commercial off-the-shelf \ntechnologies to reduce home energy use; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will create jobs and lower energy bills for families and small \nbusinesses in rural communities by promoting energy-saving home \nrenovations.\n  I am honored to be joined in this effort by a bipartisan group of \ncolleagues that includes Senator Shaheen, Senator Lugar, Senator \nGraham, Senator Johnson, and Senator Bennet of Colorado. Our colleagues \nin the other chamber are introducing companion legislation sponsored by \nRepresentatives Clyburn, Perriello, Whitfield, and Spratt.\n  Our proposed Rural Energy Savings Program would assist rural electric \nco-operatives in offering ``on-bill'' financing to their customers. \nThis concept offers two clear and important benefits for consumers, \nincluding homeowners and owners of commercial or industrial property.\n  First, it addresses the challenge of the up-front cost of building \nrenovations. Energy efficiency measures almost always make business \nsense in the long term, because they lower the energy bill for the \nfamily or business. But often, the family or business cannot afford the \nupfront cost of the renovation. By offering low-cost financing, we can \nlet families and businesses pay for the cost of the renovation on the \nsame time frame that they are getting savings on their energy bill.\n  Second, we avoid complicating consumers' lives with another loan \npayment by offering a very simple repayment mechanism: under ``on-\nbill'' financing, the consumer repays the loan through a charge on \ntheir electric bill.\n  This bill offers these benefits to Americans across the country by \nusing existing structures in place to provide federal assistance to \nrural electric co-operatives. Specifically, the Rural Utilities Service \nwill offer loans at zero percent interest to rural co-operatives, who \ncan then offer on-bill financing to their customers at no more than \nthree percent interest. The difference can be used to pay the local \nnonprofit cooperatives' overhead expenses or to establish a loan loss \nreserve. There are more than 900 electric co-operatives serving 42 \nmillion Americans, so we expect this program to create jobs and help \nlower energy bills in rural communities all over the country.\n  For our rural communities to recover and thrive in the wake of the \neconomic crisis, we need to put people back to work and lower families' \nexpenses, and the Rural Energy Savings Program does both.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to help small businesses create new jobs and drive \nour Nation's economic recovery; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak to the urgent \nimperative of job creation in our country\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\nand impress upon my colleagues that if we are serious about assisting \nour Nation's small businesses--the very catalysts that will lead us out \nof the longest and deepest recession since World War II--we cannot \ndevolve once again into more delays. To that end, I filed an amendment \nto the tax extenders legislation before this Chamber which included a \npackage of six bipartisan, achievable policy reforms designed to \nfacilitate an entrepreneurial environment under which our Nation's \nalmost 30 million small business firms can create new jobs. I had hoped \nto offer this amendment, which I am introducing today as a freestanding \nbill called the Small Business Job Creation Act, but after talking with \nthe majority leader at length last week, I decided to forgo that \nopportunity, as the leader indicated to me personally--and to the \nentire Senate--that he, too, is anxious to address a small business \njobs bill in the coming weeks.\n  Now that we have cleared the tax extenders package today and are \ntaking up the long overdue Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization legislation, I hope the Senate as well will consider \nthe jobs package that will include small business initiatives that are \nso vital and imperative to the well-being of small businesses \nthroughout the country and that we can address this issue before the \nEaster recess.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I want to \nbegin by taking a moment to tout the work our committee has \naccomplished in this Congress.\n  As one of the most bipartisan panels in the Congress, I appreciate \nthe chair, Senator Landrieu, who has built on the foundation of 22 \nhearings and roundtables and reported out a series of bipartisan bills \non topics ranging from access to capital, to exporting, and, just last \nweek, small business contracting reform. I truly appreciate Chair \nLandrieu's approach in building a collaboration in the committee on \nthese key issues. Most of the provisions I am championing here tonight \noriginated from the work we have accomplished together in the committee \nas well.\n  When it comes to this jobs agenda, I would have preferred a different \napproach to advancing it--one that was more comprehensive and robust, \nfrankly. This kind of piecemeal strategy is not one I would embrace. It \nis not one the New York Times approves of, either, for that matter. In \nfact, an editorial of theirs this week contained the following \nobservation:\n\n       [T]he danger is that with stopgap measures boosting the \n     headline job numbers, Congress and the Administration will \n     avoid the heavy lifting that is required to clear away the \n     wreckage of the recession.\n\n  So it is not enough to say jobs, jobs, jobs are the new mantra. They \nmust be the new singular mission of this Congress that deserves \nrigorous action, not just in dribs and drabs but as the full-tilt \nagenda of this institution.\n  Make no mistake, time is of the essence if we are to assist our \nNation's small businesses. Nowhere is the test of meeting that \nchallenge more immediate than with our Nation's small businesses, which \nat each turn and in every sector are having to struggle, not only at \ntheir own expense but at the expense of job creation and reversing our \ndire economic downturn.\n  Based on what I have heard firsthand from numerous small business \nforums in Maine that I have held, not only this year but last year, \nthroughout the entire year of 2009, business owners are desperate for \nrelief, and they want answers to the pervasive uncertainty they are \nconfronted with on so many levels.\n  For example, as indicated on this chart, in an economic climate \ndevoid of continuity on tax policy, skyrocketing health care costs, \nonerous regulations, or volatile energy prices, how can small \nbusinesses expect to hire a new employee, buy additional equipment, \nexpand operations, or accurately forecast their operating costs? The \nregrettable fact is, they cannot as long as they remain not just unsure \nbut understandably anxious about whether or when Washington will exact \nanother tax, levy a new mandate, promulgate another regulation, or \ncreate more bureaucracy.\n  A solid foundational starting point would be enacting the provisions \nin the amendment I filed, many of which I underscored in a letter I \nsent to both the majority leader and the Republican leader. Frankly, \nthere is such wide agreement on so many of these ideas. In fact, the \nSmall Business Committee has approved many of these provisions \nunanimously, and the President has called for them to be included in a \njobs package. So I think most people would be shocked to learn that \nthey are not already enacted into law.\n  Getting back to the original proposition, it is the fact that there \nis uncertainty with respect to the policies that are emanating from \nWashington that creates a lot of anxiety and disenchantment about the \ndirection we are taking but more importantly anxiety about their cost \nof doing business. What is it going to do to increase the cost of doing \nbusiness, whether or not they are prepared to hire a new employee or \nmake investments in capital and equipment, if they do not know the \ncertainty of the propositions that come from Washington that could add \nto their costs of doing business? For example, if the centerpiece of \nany jobs agenda is assisting the best known job creators we have--our \nsmall businesses--then bringing some certitude to the expensing \nprovisions in the Tax Code is unquestionably the place to begin.\n  I know the Senate has already enacted this legislation, extending \nwhat had been part of the stimulus plan to increase expensing \nimmediately for small businesses to write off up to $250,000. That \nexpired at the end of last year, and we have extended that proposition \nfor the remaining 10 months in this year. But then again, it will \nexpire. So at that point, in 2011, then small businesses will only be \nable to write off up to $25,000. So that is a $225,000 decline. Exactly \nhow does that contribute to greater confidence for small business \nowners? How are they supposed to look to the future in the face of a \nDraconian measure of that magnitude? So, really, it is important to \nextend the small business expensing level of $250,000 not just for 10 \nmonths but at least for 5 years.\n  As we see in this chart I am showing in the Chamber this evening, \nbetween Republicans and Democrats and the administration, they support \nextending small business expensing, they support enacting a zero-\npercent capital gains rate for small businesses. So we have bipartisan \nsolutions across the board with respect to these initiatives.\n  It is also important to make sure there is continuity in these \npolicies, which is really the troubling point because it is so \nimportant to make sure they can look down the road. They might not be \nmaking a decision within the next 5 or 6 months or 10 months, but it is \nimportant for them to be able to see down the road beyond the 10 months \nthat there is certitude with respect to the policies we are enacting, \nespecially regarding tax relief and tax policy--the types of \ninitiatives that, frankly, are going to be instrumental in making a \ndifference in job creation.\n  So we have two initiatives here; that is, extending the small \nbusiness expensing and enacting a zero-percent capital gains rate for \nsmall businesses, of which I joined with Senator Kerry in introducing \nthat legislation. So it is true we can reach an agreement on some \nissues. That is important. And we are moving forward. But we have to \ngive more longevity to these tax policies given the severity of the \ndownturn, given the severity of the economic situation we face today, \nthat it is a jobless recovery. We need to create jobs. If we are going \nto create jobs, then we have to create more permanent tax relief.\n  We have seen that with the credit crisis. Why can we not join forces \nand address this stifling credit crunch that is placing a perilous \nchoke hold on our economy across the country? Why can we not agree on \ndoing something viable and bold to confront such a universally \nacknowledged problem? It remains an unmitigated outrage, frankly, that \nthe Federal Reserve's January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey found \nthe percentage of banks easing credit terms for small businesses was an \nastonishing zero percent--zero percent. The same was true in October, \nthe last time they conducted the survey.\n\n  So if you wanted not just to freeze credit but fossilize it, that \nwould be the way to do it. This is not a recipe for recovery. After \nall, lending is critical. It is a lifeline to our economy, it is the \nlifeblood, and it is certainly a\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\nlifeline for small businesses if they are going to be able to have \njobs, to preserve jobs, or to make investments in the future.\n  But here again is another area where we could take immediate action \nright here and now, where we can turn this deplorable trend around \nbeginning with boosting the SBA's access to credit. My provisions \ninclude key lending provisions from the bill I introduced in the Small \nBusiness Committee with Chair Landrieu which was reported out of our \ncommittee with a vote of 17 to 1--overwhelmingly bipartisan--to \nincrease the maximum limits for the SBA 7(a) program and the 504 loan \nprogram from $2 million to $5 million, raising the maximum microloan \nlimit from $35,000 to $50,000, and allowing for the refinancing of \nconventional small business loans through the SBA 504 program. Now, if \nfully utilized, the loan limit increases would create and retain up to \nan estimated 211,000 jobs.\n  I would note that enhancing SBA loans has already paid tremendous \ndividends, as in the stimulus bill, because we included these \nprovisions which have been credited with increasing loan volumes by a \nremarkable 86 percent nationwide and in my own State of Maine, 227 \npercent. That is all as a result of what we included in the stimulus \npackage last year in increasing and expanding the loan volumes under \nthese programs. So it obviously is indicative of what can be \naccomplished.\n  So with numbers such as these, not to mention the endorsement of 80 \nbusiness organizations, it is essential that we give these critical \nprograms the ability to grow more small businesses.\n  Just as there is much we can do right away domestically, how about \nfinally taking action to help our small businesses compete globally? \nGiven that fewer than 1 percent of our small businesses export, it is \nall the more vital that we take advantage of this untapped market and \nhelp those enterprises sell their goods and services to 95 percent of \nthe world's customers who live outside our borders.\n  In the State of the Union Address, President Obama made clear that we \nmust double our exports over the next 5 years, and small businesses are \na critical component of the administration's strategy and our national \ncompetitiveness. For this reason, my provisions were included in the \nsmall business exporting legislation I introduced with Chair Landrieu.\n  As this chart reveals, the provisions in the bill--larger SBA export \nloan limits, expanded export technical assistance, and enhanced \nassistance for trade promotion--had bipartisan support. They were \nreported unanimously by our panel and passed unanimously last \nDecember--unanimously. They have the administration's support. They \nhave been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. So we have \nsolidarity on this initiative, and for good reason, because it could \ncreate roughly 36,000 new American jobs in the year after enactment and \n170,000 jobs over the next 5 years. So there is no reason on Earth why \nwe cannot move on this bill today.\n  Whether we are debating trade or health care, a jobs bill or climate \nchange, whatever the issue, it is also time we retool our thinking so \nthat in every matter before us we are striving to create a climate in \nwhich our job creators cannot only survive but thrive. For example, for \nyears we have had environmental impact statements. Well, in 2010, it is \nhigh time we require job impact statements. Consider that in 2009 \nalone, there were close to 70,000 pages in the Federal Register, and \nthe annual cost of Federal regulations now totals more than $1.1 \ntrillion, with small firms bearing the brunt.\n  There are enough built-in impediments to starting a small business, \nnot to mention sustaining one, without the Federal Government \ncompounding the problem. That is why I have included language in my \nlegislation I introduced last month with Senator Pryor requiring the \nCongressional Budget Office to provide such job impact statements for \nevery single major initiative before Congress to evaluate its effect, \npositive and negative, on job creation, job losses, job preservation.\n  We didn't stop there. Our bill would also require Federal agencies to \nfully analyze the cost of regulations on small businesses which too \noften undermine and usurp the entrepreneurial spirit that has defined \nevery generation of Americans.\n  Our bill is strongly supported by groups including the NFIB, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, and the National Small Business Association.\n  My provisions include $50 million in funding for the Small Business \nDevelopment Centers which, again, provide critical technical assistance \nand counseling to small businesses at over 1,000 locations nationwide. \nThe SBDC program has a proven track record of job creation, and \naccording to an annual report by Dr. James Chrisman of Mississippi \nState University, between 2007 and 2008, employment levels of SBDC \nclients have increased 10 percent more than for businesses in general. \nAs a result of the additional funding I am pressing for, Dr. Chrisman \nestimates that over 20,000 new jobs would be created, while tens of \nthousands more will be saved.\n  Finally, while it is paramount that we move forward with the \ninitiatives I have just described, we must simultaneously be mindful of \ntheir cost. I have also included an offset for this legislation. I do \nhappen to think it is important that we provide offsets. I think we \nhave to reexamine the stimulus package we enacted last year, much of \nwhich has been meritorious, much of which has worked, but there are \nother parts of it that have yet to be implemented or expended, and I \nthink that is the point.\n  The fact is, with a projected $1.6 trillion deficit this year alone, \nit is essential that we look at ways in which we can pay for \nlegislation, especially targeted toward job creation, that can be \naccomplished immediately. That is why I am proposing to fully offset \nthe cost of my provision with unspent, unobligated funds that we \nappropriated as part of the stimulus.\n  I understand some of my colleagues oppose using unobligated stimulus \nfunds as an offset, citing Congressional Budget Office data that the \nRecovery Act has added up to 2.1 million jobs and has preserved many \njobs across this country. At the same time, I also believe it is our \nobligation to continually assess and reassess whether the Recovery Act \nis working because, after all, stimulus is supposed to be timely, \ntargeted, and temporary. In two of the three instances it has not met \nthose goals. In fact, as we have noted in this following chart, just \n$288 billion of the $787 billion that was enacted last February--only \n37 percent of the total--has actually been spent. When you consider \njust the $275 billion of the stimulus's appropriated funding for \nexpenditures such as contracts, grants, and loans, just $81.6 billion, \nor 30 percent, has been paid out.\n  That is where I think we need to reassess the three critical criteria \nof timely, targeted, and temporary. Obviously, for timeliness and being \ntargeted, we have not met those goals. That is why I think we should \nredirect some of these stimulus funds to other purposes that are more \neffective, more immediate to do the job.\n  That is where our small businesses enter the equation, with these \ninitiatives I have identified that are absolutely paramount to helping \nsmall businesses to create jobs across this country. After all, we are \ndepending on small businesses to lead us out of this economic downturn. \nThey have been the job generators in the past. They have created two-\nthirds of all the net new jobs in America.\n  We need to create millions and millions of jobs. We have 100,000 new \nentrants in the market every month, so we have to move expeditiously. \nThat is the point here tonight.\n  I have an array of initiatives that are very critical and vital to \nsmall business and job generation. One, we have to do it immediately. \nTwo, we have to be focused and we have to provide continuity of policy \nand certainty so that small businesses can look down the road and see \nwhat types of policies are emanating from Washington, DC.\n  As I said to the Secretary of the Treasury recently, would you take a \nrisk in making investments today? Would you take a risk knowing what \nyou are hearing in Washington? Since we will see more costs as a result \nof potential health care legislation, adding more costs to small \nbusinesses--and there is no question that with the Medicare payroll tax \nthat is embedded in that legislation, that really is another hidden \ntax, just as the alternative minimum tax. It will raise taxes\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\n62 percent, and it is not indexed for inflation. So we know what the \nexponential growth in that tax will become for small businesses. That \nis an example. Ten months does not make a policy of certainty with \nrespect to tax relief.\n  We need to provide continuity of that policy with respect to tax \nrelief, and small business expensing is certainly part of it. We can \nexpand the loan limits under the SBA's programs, and 7(a) and 504 \nalready demonstrated they can work. They did work in the year in which \nwe expanded those programs. It has been demonstrated nationwide and \ncertainly conclusively in my State. So why not move expeditiously to \naddress those issues?\n  Finally, we can pay for it. We can redirect the stimulus. I think \nthat is the most conservative, effective approach to paying for this \nlegislation because, after all, if we have only spent 30 percent of the \nappropriated funds under stimulus and only 37 percent overall of the \nstimulus, we may not even spend $600 billion at the end of this year; \nwe need to spend it now. That is the point, is spending it now. What \nare we waiting for?\n  There is no question that there is a sense of despair across the \nlandscape in looking at the unemployment numbers. We are not creating \njobs; we are losing jobs every month. Albeit it has improved in terms \nof the number of jobs lost, the fact is, we need to create millions and \nmillions of jobs in addition to offsetting the new entrants into the \nmarket every month. We have a 9.7-percent unemployment rate. That means \nwe have to get to work, and the only way we can do that is helping \nsmall businesses, and the only way we can do that is to put these \ninitiatives to work before the Easter recess. Let's not delay and \ndefer. We have time to do it now. It has broad unanimous support in the \nSmall Business Committee. There is no reason we cannot accomplish this \ngoal now.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's indication and commitment that he \nwill bring a small business package to the floor. I urge the leader and \nI urge all Members of the Senate to support doing that before the \nEaster recess because we need to adopt it now, not months from now, \nbecause people depend on these jobs. There is uncertainty, and people \nare looking on their Main Streets in their communities, and what are \nthey seeing is trouble. They are wondering whether the hardware store \nis going to stay open, or the barbershop. That creates either certainty \nor uncertainty; that is what creates either despair or hope.\n  So I hope we would move and that we would move with a sense of \nurgency with respect to small businesses. If we are depending on them, \nthen we have to get to work now. There is no reason, no rationale, no \nexcuse for not taking action in this Chamber in this Congress that can \nbe signed by the President and that we can move forward on. So we \nshould strive with every fiber of our beings to help these longtime \nbeacons of our economy, which is going to give hope to all Americans. \nWhat they deserve is to see action that will create the kind of \ncertainty, give them the kinds of resources that they deserve, and do \nit in a fiscally responsible manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1367-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 53--RECOGNIZING AND CONGRATULATING THE \n  CITY OF COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO, AS THE NEW OFFICIAL SITE OF THE \n NATIONAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES MEMORIAL SERVICE AND THE NATIONAL \n                  EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. BENNET (for himself and Mr. Udall of Colorado) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

The government continues to enforce \n     political conformity using criminal prosecutions, long- and \n     short-term detention, harassment, denial of employment, and \n     travel restrictions.''; and\n       Whereas in a 2008 annual report, the Inter-American \n     Commission on Human Rights reported that ``restrictions on \n     political rights, on freedom of expression, and on the \n     dissemination of ideas, the failure to hold elections, and \n     the absence of an independent judiciary in Cuba combine to \n     create a permanent panorama of breached basic rights for the \n     Cuban citizenry'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the life of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, whose \n     death on February 23, 2010, highlights the lack of democracy \n     in Cuba and the injustice of the brutal treatment of more \n     than 200 political prisoners by the Government of Cuba;\n       (2) calls for the immediate release of all political \n     prisoners detained in Cuba;\n       (3) pays tribute to the courageous citizens of Cuba who are \n     suffering abuses merely for engaging in peaceful efforts to \n     exercise their basic human rights;\n       (4) supports freedom of speech and the rights of \n     journalists and bloggers in Cuba to express their views \n     without repression by government authorities and denounces \n     the use of intimidation, harassment, or violence by the \n     Government of Cuba to restrict and suppress freedom of \n     speech, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and \n     freedom of the press;\n       (5) desires that the people of Cuba be able to enjoy due \n     process and the right to a fair trial; and\n       (6) calls on the United States to continue policies that \n     focus on respect for the fundamental tenets of freedom, \n     democracy, and human rights in Cuba and encourage peaceful \n     democratic change consistent with the aspirations of the \n     people of Cuba.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I am submitting a \nconcurrent resolution recognizing the life of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, \nwho died on February 23, 2010, in Cuban custody, and calling for a \ncontinued focus on the promotion of internationally recognized human \nrights, listed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in Cuba.\n  Mr. Zapata was a political prisoner facing 36 years in prison for \ndefying the Cuban regime. Originally arrested during the ``Black \nSpring'' of 2003, along with other peaceful supporters of the Varela \nProject, Zapata was originally sentenced to three years in prison but \nwas later convicted of additional ``acts of defiance'' and resentenced \nto a total of 36 years. In 2003, Amnesty International declared Zapata \na ``prisoner of conscience'' in recognition of his extraordinary \ncourage.\n  Mr. Zapata went on a hunger strike in December 2009 to demand respect \nfor his personal safety and to protest his inhumane treatment by the \nprison authorities in Cuba. According to Zapata's mother, Reina Luisa \nTamayo, her son was beaten repeatedly, tortured, and denied water \nduring his incarceration. While in prison, Mr. Zapata courageously \ndemanded basic dignities and resisted the regime's repression. In the \nend, he was prohibited from receiving medical attention and lost his \nlife in what Freedom House has called Cuba's ``deplorable prison \nconditions.''\n  To Orlando Zapata Tamayo's mother, family and friends, the United \nStates Senate sends our sincere condolences for your loss. To Mr. \nZapata's former colleagues and freedom fighters, we stand in solidarity \nwith you in your struggle against the forces of repression and \ntotalitarianism.\n  While there has been disagreement within this body in the past over \nthe most effective way for the U.S. to help the Cuban people, I think \nwe can all agree that the United States must continue to support \npolicies that focus on respect for the fundamental tenets of freedom, \ndemocracy, and human rights in Cuba. This resolution reaffirms those \nprinciples. When we talk about the promotion of internationally \nrecognized human rights in Tehran and Pyongyang, we must never forget \nthe political prisoners suffering in the cells of Camaguey and Havana.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, ``Cuba remains the one country in \nLatin America that represses virtually all forms of political dissent. \nThe government continues to enforce political conformity using criminal \nprosecutions, long- and short-term detention, harassment, denial of \nemployment, and travel restrictions.'' A Human Rights Watch report on \nCuban prisoners last year documented how critics of the regime who \nreport violations are subjected to extended periods of solitary \nconfinement and beatings, and denied medical treatment, family visits \nand telephone calls.\n  This resolution calls for the immediate release of all political \nprisoners detained in Cuba and the rights of all Cubans to be able to \nenjoy due process and the right to a fair trial. It also denounces the \nuse of intimidation, harassment, or violence by the regime to restrict \nand suppress freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of \nassembly, and freedom of the press. This resolution underscores our \nsupport for freedom of speech and the rights of journalists and \nbloggers in Cuba to express their views without repression by \ngovernment authorities. These rights are universal, but are all but \nabsent in the Cuba of today.\n  Orlando Zapata Tamayo's death is a sad reminder of the tragic cost of \noppression and a dictatorship that devalues human life. At the same \ntime, it's a reminder that the Cuban people continue to fight for their \nfreedom. Courageous Cubans like Mr. Zapata continue to suffer abuses \nmerely for engaging in peaceful efforts to exercise their basic human \nrights. We have seen the regime crackdown on other dissidents and \npolitical prisoners in the wake of Zapata's death.\n  Orlando Zapata Tamayo did not die in vain. Freedom-loving people \neverywhere must hold the Cuban regime responsible for the fate of \nOrlando Zapata Tamayo and for all the political prisoners and \ndissidents in custody in Cuba.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/10/senate-section/article/S1368-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1368-S1369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3452.

DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM \n                   ADJUSTMENTS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of the airport \n     disadvantaged business enterprise program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) \n     and 47113) to ensure that minority- and women-owned \n     businesses do not face barriers because of their race or \n     gender and so that they have a fair opportunity to compete in \n     Federally assisted airport contracts and concessions.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While significant progress has occurred due to the \n     enactment of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise \n     program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) and 47113), discrimination \n     continues to be a barrier for minority- and women-owned \n     businesses seeking to do business in airport-related markets. \n     This continuing barrier merits the continuation of the \n     airport disadvantaged business enterprise program.\n       (2) The Congress has received recent evidence of \n     discrimination from numerous sources, including congressional \n     hearings and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued \n     by public and private agencies, news stories, reports of \n     discrimination by organizations and individuals, and \n     discrimination lawsuits. This evidence also shows that race- \n     and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address \n     the problem.\n       (3) This evidence demonstrates that discrimination across \n     the nation poses a barrier to full and fair participation in \n     airport related businesses of women business owners and \n     minority business owners in the racial groups detailed in \n     parts 23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, and \n     has impacted firm development and many aspects of airport \n     related business in the public and private markets.\n       (4) This evidence provides a strong basis for the \n     continuation of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise \n     program and the airport concessions disadvantaged business \n     enterprise program.\n       (c) In General.--Section 47107(e) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (8) as paragraph (9); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (7) the following:\n       ``(8) Mandatory training program for airport concessions.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Not later than one year after the date \n     of enactment of the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and \n     Safety Improvement Act, the Secretary shall establish a \n     mandatory training program for persons described in \n     subparagraph (C) on the certification of whether a small \n     business concern in airport concessions qualifies as a small \n     business concern owned and controlled by a socially and \n     economically disadvantaged individual for purposes of \n     paragraph (1).\n       ``(B) Implementation.--The training program may be \n     implemented by one or more private entities approved by the \n     Secretary.\n       ``(C) Participants.--A person referred to in paragraph (1) \n     is an official or agent of an airport owner or operator who \n     is required to provide a written assurance under paragraph \n     (1) that the airport owner or operator will meet the \n     percentage goal of paragraph (1) or who is responsible for \n     determining whether or not a small business concern in \n     airport concessions qualifies as a small business concern \n     owned and controlled by a socially and economically \n     disadvantaged individual for purposes of paragraph (1).\n       ``(D) Authorization of appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as \n     may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.''.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 24 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, the House of Representatives Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure, and other appropriate \n     committees of Congress on the results of the training program \n     conducted under section 47107(e)(8) of title 49, United \n     States Code, as added by subsection (a).\n       (e) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Personal Net Worth \n     Cap; Bonding Requirements.--Section 47113 is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Personal Net Worth Cap.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\n     the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety \n     Improvement Act, the Secretary shall issue final regulations \n     to adjust the personal net worth cap used in determining \n     whether an individual is economically disadvantaged for \n     purposes of qualifying under the definition contained in \n     subsection (a)(2) and under section 47107(e).

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Scholarships for \n     Opportunity and Results Act of 2010'' or the ``SOAR Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions for their \n     children, including the educational setting that will best \n     serve the interests and educational needs of their child.\n       (2) For many parents in the District of Columbia, public \n     school choice provided under the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001, as well as under other public school choice \n     programs, is inadequate. More educational options are needed \n     to ensure all families in the District of Columbia have \n     access to a quality education. In particular, funds are \n     needed to provide low-income parents with enhanced public \n     opportunities and private educational environments, \n     regardless of whether such environments are secular or \n     nonsecular.\n       (3) Public school records raise persistent concerns \n     regarding health and safety problems in District of Columbia \n     public schools. For example, more than half of the District \n     of Columbia's teenage public school students attend schools \n     that meet the District of Columbia's definition of \n     ``persistently dangerous'' due to the number of violent \n     crimes.\n       (4) While the per student cost for students in the public \n     schools of the District of Columbia is one of the highest in \n     the United States, test scores for such students continue to \n     be among the lowest in the Nation. The National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress (NAEP), an annual report released by the \n     National Center for Education Statistics, reported in its \n     2007 study that students in the District of Columbia were \n     being outperformed by every State in the Nation. On the 2007 \n     NAEP, 61 percent of fourth grade students scored ``below \n     basic'' in reading, and 51 percent scored ``below basic'' in \n     mathematics. Among eighth grade students, 52 percent scored \n     ``below basic'' in reading and 56 percent scored ``below \n     basic'' in mathematics. On the 2007 NAEP reading assessment, \n     only 14 percent of the District of Columbia fourth grade \n     students could read proficiently, while only 12 percent of \n     the eighth grade students scored at the proficient or \n     advanced level.\n       (5) In 2003, Congress passed the DC School Choice Incentive \n     Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-199; 118 Stat. 126) to provide \n     opportunity scholarships to parents of students in the \n     District of Columbia that could be used by students in \n     kindergarten through grade 12 to attend a private educational \n     institution. The opportunity scholarship program under such \n     Act was part of a comprehensive 3-part funding arrangement \n     that also included additional funds for the District of \n     Columbia public schools, and additional funds for public \n     charter schools of the District of Columbia. The intent of \n     the approach was to ensure that progress would continue to be \n     made to improve public schools and public charter schools, \n     and that funding for the opportunity scholarship program \n     would not lead to a reduction in funding for the District of \n     Columbia public and charter schools. Resources would be \n     available for a variety of educational options that would \n     give families in the District of Columbia a range of choices \n     with regard to the education of their children.\n       (6) The opportunity scholarship program was established in \n     accordance with the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Zelman v. \n     Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639 (2002), which found that a \n     program enacted for the valid secular purpose of providing \n     educational assistance to low-income children in a \n     demonstrably failing public school system is constitutional \n     if it is neutral with respect to religion and provides \n     assistance to a broad class of citizens who direct government \n     aid to religious and secular schools solely as a result of \n     their genuine and independent private choices.\n       (7) Since the opportunity scholarship program's inception, \n     it has consistently been oversubscribed. Parents express \n     strong support for the opportunity scholarship program. A \n     rigorous analysis of the program by the Institute of \n     Education Sciences (IES) shows statistically significant \n     improvements in parental satisfaction and in reading scores \n     that are even more dramatic when only those students \n     consistently using the scholarships are considered.\n       (8) The DC opportunity scholarship program is a program \n     that offers families in need, in the District of Columbia, \n     important alternatives while public schools are improved. It \n     is the sense of Congress that this program should continue as \n     1 of a 3-part comprehensive funding strategy for the District \n     of Columbia school system that provides new and equal funding \n     for public schools, public charter schools, and opportunity \n     scholarships for students to attend private schools.\n\n     SEC. 1003. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to provide low-income parents \n     residing in the District of Columbia, particularly parents of \n     students who attend elementary schools or secondary schools \n     identified for improvement, corrective action, or \n     restructuring under section 1116 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316), with \n     expanded opportunities for enrolling their children in other \n     schools in the District of Columbia, at least until the \n     public schools in the District of Columbia have adequately \n     addressed shortfalls in health, safety, and security and the \n     students in the District of Columbia public schools are \n     testing in mathematics and reading at or above the national \n     average.\n\n     SEC. 1004.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lord's Resistance Army \n     Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For over 2 decades, the Government of Uganda engaged in \n     an armed conflict with the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in \n     northern Uganda that led to the internal displacement of more \n     than 2,000,000 Ugandans from their homes.\n       (2) The members of the Lord's Resistance Army used brutal \n     tactics in northern Uganda, including mutilating, abducting \n     and forcing individuals into sexual servitude and forcing a \n     large number of children and youth in Uganda, estimated by \n     the Survey for War Affected Youth to be over 66,000, to fight \n     as part of the rebel force.\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\n       (3) The Secretary of State has placed the Lord's Resistance \n     Army on the Terrorist Exclusion list pursuant to section \n     212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1182(a)(3)), and LRA leader Joseph Kony has been designated a \n     ``specially designated global terrorist'' pursuant to \n     Executive Order 13224.\n       (4) In late 2005, according to the United Nations Office \n     for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Lord's \n     Resistance Army shifted their primary base of operations from \n     southern Sudan to northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, \n     and the rebels have since withdrawn from northern Uganda.\n       (5) Representatives of the Government of Uganda and the \n     Lord's Resistance Army began peace negotiations in 2006, \n     mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan in Juba, Sudan, \n     and signed the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on August \n     20, 2006, which provided for hundreds of thousands of \n     internally displaced people to return home in safety.\n       (6) After nearly 2 years of negotiations, representatives \n     from the parties reached the Final Peace Agreement in April \n     2008, but Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance \n     Army, refused to sign the Final Peace Agreement in May 2008 \n     and his forces launched new attacks in northeastern Congo.\n       (7) According to the United Nations Office for the \n     Coordination of Humanitarian Relief and the United Nations \n     High Commissioner for Refugees, the new activity of the \n     Lord's Resistance Army in northeastern Congo and southern \n     Sudan since September 2008 has led to the abduction of at \n     least 1,500 civilians, including hundreds of children, and \n     the displacement of more than 540,000 people.\n       (8) In December 2008, the military forces of Uganda, the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo, and southern Sudan launched a \n     joint operation against the Lord's Resistance Army's bases in \n     northeastern Congo, but the operation failed to apprehend \n     Joseph Kony, and his forces retaliated with a series of new \n     attacks and massacres in Congo and southern Sudan, killing an \n     estimated 900 people in 2 months alone.\n       (9) Despite the refusal of Joseph Kony to sign the Final \n     Peace Agreement, the Government of Uganda has committed to \n     continue reconstruction plans for northern Uganda, and to \n     implement those mechanisms of the Final Peace Agreement not \n     conditional on the compliance of the Lord's Resistance Army.\n       (10) Since 2008, recovery efforts in northern Uganda have \n     moved forward with the financial support of the United States \n     and other donors, but have been hampered by a lack of \n     strategic coordination, logistical delays, and limited \n     leadership from the Government of Uganda.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to work with regional \n     governments toward a comprehensive and lasting resolution to \n     the conflict in northern Uganda and other affected areas by--\n       (1) providing political, economic, military, and \n     intelligence support for viable multilateral efforts to \n     protect civilians from the Lord's Resistance Army, to \n     apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and his top commanders from \n     the battlefield in the continued absence of a negotiated \n     solution, and to disarm and demobilize the remaining Lord's \n     Resistance Army fighters;\n       (2) targeting assistance to respond to the humanitarian \n     needs of populations in northeastern Congo, southern Sudan, \n     and Central African Republic currently affected by the \n     activity of the Lord's Resistance Army; and\n       (3) further supporting and encouraging efforts of the \n     Government of Uganda and civil society to promote \n     comprehensive reconstruction, transitional justice, and \n     reconciliation in northern Uganda as affirmed in the Northern \n     Uganda Crisis Response Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-283) and \n     subsequent resolutions, including Senate Resolution 366, \n     109th Congress, agreed to February 2, 2006, Senate Resolution \n     573, 109th Congress, agreed to September 19, 2006, Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 16, 110th Congress, agreed to in the \n     Senate March 1, 2007, and House Concurrent Resolution 80, \n     110th Congress, agreed to in the House of Representatives \n     June 18, 2007.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lord's Resistance Army \n     Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For over 2 decades, the Government of Uganda engaged in \n     an armed conflict with the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in \n     northern Uganda that led to the internal displacement of more \n     than 2,000,000 Ugandans from their homes.\n       (2) The members of the Lord's Resistance Army used brutal \n     tactics in northern Uganda, including mutilating, abducting \n     and forcing individuals into sexual servitude and forcing a \n     large number of children and youth in Uganda, estimated by \n     the Survey for War Affected Youth to be over 66,000, to fight \n     as part of the rebel force.\n       (3) The Secretary of State has placed the Lord's Resistance \n     Army on the Terrorist Exclusion list pursuant to section \n     212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1182(a)(3)), and LRA leader Joseph Kony has been designated a \n     ``specially designated global terrorist'' pursuant to \n     Executive Order 13224.\n       (4) In late 2005, according to the United Nations Office \n     for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Lord's \n     Resistance Army shifted their primary base of operations from \n     southern Sudan to northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, \n     and the rebels have since withdrawn from northern Uganda.\n       (5) Representatives of the Government of Uganda and the \n     Lord's Resistance Army began peace negotiations in 2006, \n     mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan in Juba, Sudan, \n     and signed the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on August \n     20, 2006, which provided for hundreds of thousands of \n     internally displaced people to return home in safety.\n       (6) After nearly 2 years of negotiations, representatives \n     from the parties reached the Final Peace Agreement in April \n     2008, but Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance \n     Army, refused to sign the Final Peace Agreement in May 2008 \n     and his forces launched new attacks in northeastern Congo.\n       (7) According to the United Nations Office for the \n     Coordination of Humanitarian Relief and the United Nations \n     High Commissioner for Refugees, the new activity of the \n     Lord's Resistance Army in northeastern Congo and southern \n     Sudan since September 2008 has led to the abduction of at \n     least 1,500 civilians, including hundreds of children, and \n     the displacement of more than 540,000 people.\n       (8) In December 2008, the military forces of Uganda, the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo, and southern Sudan launched a \n     joint operation against the Lord's Resistance Army's bases in \n     northeastern Congo, but the operation failed to apprehend \n     Joseph Kony, and his forces retaliated with a series of new \n     attacks and massacres in Congo and southern Sudan, killing an \n     estimated 900 people in 2 months alone.\n       (9) Despite the refusal of Joseph Kony to sign the Final \n     Peace Agreement, the Government of Uganda has committed to \n     continue reconstruction plans for northern Uganda, and to \n     implement those mechanisms of the Final Peace Agreement not \n     conditional on the compliance of the Lord's Resistance Army.\n       (10) Since 2008, recovery efforts in northern Uganda have \n     moved forward with the financial support of the United States \n     and other donors, but have been hampered by a lack of \n     strategic coordination, logistical delays, and limited \n     leadership from the Government of Uganda.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to work with regional \n     governments toward a comprehensive and lasting resolution to \n     the conflict in northern Uganda and other affected areas by--\n       (1) providing political, economic, military, and \n     intelligence support for viable multilateral efforts to \n     protect civilians from the Lord's Resistance Army, to \n     apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and his top commanders from \n     the battlefield in the continued absence of a negotiated \n     solution, and to disarm and demobilize the remaining Lord's \n     Resistance Army fighters;\n       (2) targeting assistance to respond to the humanitarian \n     needs of populations in northeastern Congo, southern Sudan, \n     and Central African Republic currently affected by the \n     activity of the Lord's Resistance Army; and\n       (3) further supporting and encouraging efforts of the \n     Government of Uganda and civil society to promote \n     comprehensive reconstruction, transitional justice, and \n     reconciliation in northern Uganda as affirmed in the Northern \n     Uganda Crisis Response Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-283) and \n     subsequent resolutions, including Senate Resolution 366, \n     109th Congress, agreed to February 2, 2006, Senate Resolution \n     573, 109th Congress, agreed to September 19, 2006, Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 16, 110th Congress, agreed to in the \n     Senate March 1, 2007, and House Concurrent Resolution 80, \n     110th Congress, agreed to in the House of Representatives \n     June 18, 2007.\n\n     SEC. 4.
