Following morning business, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of the credit card \nlegislation. Under a previous order, Senators Dodd and Shelby will be \nrecognized. Senator Dodd will offer the Dodd-Shelby substitute \namendment. There will be no rollcall votes today.\n  While we are talking about the schedule, I haven't had the \nopportunity yet to speak to the Republican leader, but I will as soon \nas we can work out a time to visit today. It appears that we have no \nalternative but to have votes next Monday. We have a number of \nnominations. I have to file cloture on all of them. It doesn't work out \notherwise. There are certain things we have to do before we go. We have \nthe credit card legislation. We need to do the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I am confident we can work something out on that. \nThat should go fairly quickly. The only thing that I see that could \ncause some concern is the closing of Guantanamo. Senator McCain, \nSenator Obama, during the campaign, indicated they thought it should be \nclosed. I agree with them. The issue is what we do with the prisoners \nwho are there.\n  What the House has done is just have nothing in the bill. What \nSenator Inouye and Senator Cochran have done, or they will do--I guess \nthey will mark it up Thursday--Senator Inouye told me they were going \nto fence the money so it wouldn't be available until the President came \nup with a plan and that there be no prisoners brought to the United \nStates during this fiscal year. But that looks like an issue that could \ncause a little bit of debate.\n  I have laid out what the two issues are and how we are trying to \nresolve them, but we are going to have to have votes next Monday. We \nhave a number of nominations. I have tried lots of different ways to \nget them done. But it appears the only thing we can do is file cloture. \nThere are three we have to do.\n  There is legislation that we need to complete because of what is \nhappening in the financial world that deals with the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation and calls for setting up a bipartisan 9/11-type \ncommission to take a look at what has happened, what caused the \nfinancial breakdown. It is offered by Senators Conrad and Isakson. We \nneed to finish that legislation before we go. That would just be a \nmessage from the House, which is amendable, but it would only require \none cloture vote.\n  So, anyway, I just wanted to alert everyone that unless we work \nsomething out in the next little bit, we will have to have votes on \nMonday. It was originally announced to be a no-vote day.\n\n[[Page S5304]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5304-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      HAPPY BIRTHDAY JIM JEFFORDS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a former colleague of ours celebrates a \nmilestone today. Jim Jeffords, who served his country in the military \nfor many decades and the people of Vermont and Congress for 32 years--\nand he did so on both sides of the aisle, over there and over here--was \nborn 75 years ago today.\n  Jim Jeffords, of course, was a lifelong Vermonter. His father was the \nchief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, and Jim Jeffords graduated \nfrom Vermont public schools, Yale University, and Harvard school. He \nwas a very smart man, as indicated with his academic background.\n  He served for 35 years in the U.S. Navy and Naval Reserve until he \nretired as captain while still sitting as a Senator. During Jim \nJeffords' time in the Senate, he did much to ensure children could get \na good education, that they could get a job when they graduated from \nschool. He cared deeply for the environment and for people with \ndisabilities. He served during his last years in the Senate as chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee. He was one of the \nleaders who pushed the United States to lead a humanitarian mission to \nRwanda during the country's terrible genocide. Of course, Senator \nJeffords also single-handedly shifted the balance of power in this body \nwhen, in 2001, he became an Independent and caucused with Democrats. It \nwas a very courageous thing for Jim to do.\n  As we have read in the history books, it wasn't easy for him to do \nthis. It cost him friends, supporters, even some of his own staff. When \nhe announced his decision, Senator Jeffords said:\n\n       The weight that has been lifted from my shoulders now hangs \n     heavy on my heart.\n\n  He knew the impact his decision would have on the people around him, \nand he cared deeply about that. At the time that he did this, it was a \nvery popular thing with the American people to do. When Senator \nJeffords was here in Washington and other places in the country, they \nwould recognize him; people would stand and applaud.\n  Jim has been very ill since he retired from the Senate. He is in \nextremely bad health. We wish him well. Senator Jeffords' family threw \nhim a small birthday party this past weekend. His son Leonard, his \ndaughter Laura, his grandson Patrick, and his granddaughter Hazel were \nall there.\n  I don't have nearly the voice in any way that Senator Jeffords had. \nFor many years he was a member of our very own barbershop quartet, the \nSinging Senators. So I will not break out in song, but on behalf of the \nentire Senate, we wish our friend Jim Jeffords a very happy 75th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5304-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5304-S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CREDIT CARD REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I was just a boy--as I look back, I \nreally don't know how old I was, probably 10, maybe 11--one of my older \nbrothers, 10 years older--a wonderful man; he died at age 47; he was a \nyoung man, not long out of high school--worked for the Standard station \nin Ash Fork, AZ, which was quite a ways from Searchlight. I had never \nreally been anyplace. My brother, being the great big brother he was, \nwanted me to see someplace other than Searchlight. So I went and spent \na couple weeks with him in Ash Fork, AZ. For me, it was a real eye-\nopening thing. I had never really traveled anyplace. He drove us over \nthere.\n  The one thing he didn't bother to tell me is that he had a \ngirlfriend, and so he spent a lot of time when he was not working with \nhis girlfriend. He still kept an eye on me and took good care of me, \nbut I spent most of my time with his girlfriend's brother. His \ngirlfriend's brother was older than I was. We would play games. There \nwasn't much he could do better than me. But I rarely won anything \nbecause he kept changing the rules in the middle of the game. I have \nalways remembered that. It is hard to win a game when the rules keep \nchanging.\n  The reason I mention that little personal vignette is, what do you do \nwhen you play by the rules but the rules change in the middle of the \ngame? There is a woman in Nevada named Shelley. Like millions of \nAmericans, she pays her credit card bill in full every month. She has \nnever been late. Whatever they say is the minimum payment, she at least \nmakes that payment and sometimes more. She is the model of what credit \ncard companies call ``in good standing.''\n  But Shelley recently was told that the interest rate on her card was \ngoing up from 9.5 percent to 17.5 percent; her rate was almost \ndoubling. For reasons unknown to her, she could not understand this. So \nShelley asked to close the account. But the bank told her the time to \nopt out of her contract had ended before she even knew it had started.\n  She played by the rules, Shelley did. But the rules changed in the \nmiddle of the game.\n  If we are truly to get our economy back on its feet, we must protect \npeople like Shelley and the millions of Americans who use credit cards \nfor everything from buying a sandwich to paying for college. Chairman \nDodd and ranking member Shelby have drafted a bill that puts fairness \nand common sense back into credit cards and protects consumers from \nexcessive fees, ever-changing interest rates, and complex contracts \nseemingly designed to do one thing above all--to keep people in the \ndark and in debt.\n  In short, this bill we will be taking up this afternoon at 3:30 \ncleans up the fine print so consumers can't get blindsided by the \ncredit card companies.\n  More and more Americans sign for and use credit cards every day. \nThree out of five credit card users carry a balance on their card. \nThere is nothing wrong with that. That balance averages more than \n$7,000. That is what the average is. But they are using credit cards \nthat have misleading terms and confusing conditions.\n  A recent study by the Pew Trust Foundation found that 100 percent of \ncredit cards came with policies that the Federal Reserve has determined \ncause harm to consumers--not 50 percent, not 60 percent, not 75 \npercent, 100 percent. And 93 percent of those contracts said the credit \ncard company could raise the interest rate anytime for any reason. Here \nare just a few of the things the legislation that will soon be before \nthe Senate does to fix that.\n\n  First, it protects consumers by establishing fair and sensible rules \nfor how and when credit card companies can raise interest rates. Credit \ncard companies must give a 45-day notice before increasing rates and \ncan no longer do so on existing balances.\n  Second, it cracks down on abusive fees. For example, consumers no \nlonger will have to pay a fee just to pay a bill. That happens. And \ncredit card companies must mail statements 21 days before the bill is \ndue so cardholders can avoid these hefty late charges.\n  Third, it protects young consumers such as college students from \npredatory marketers.\n  It strengthens oversight of the credit card industry to keep it in \nline.\n  For every greedy executive and devious con artist, there are millions \nof honest, hardworking Americans who struggle every day to simply make \nends meet. They worry every morning about how much longer their job \nwill be there and every night about how to keep their families healthy \nand keep a roof over their heads. They worry about troubles they did \nnot create; and even though they are stunned about these troubles they \ndid not create, they cannot cure them.\n  Too many hardworking Americans have already lost too much in this \nrecession. It is our job to protect them from losing even more.\n  This legislation will not only level the playing field and keep the \nrules consistent from beginning to end, it can also save families \nthousands of dollars a year.\n  Shelley, the woman I told the story about--the Nevada woman who told \nme about her frustrations with her credit card company, wrote:\n  I feel like I am being robbed by a company that my tax dollars are \ntrying to bail out.\n  Mr. President, I do not remember much from my trip to Ash Fork, AZ, \nother than my brother's future brother-in-law kept changing the rules \nin the middle of the game. That is what the credit card companies are \ndoing, and that is what we have to stop. We must protect those who play \nby the rules because it is not just their credit at stake, it is our \ncountry's credibility. I think at this stage, it is the Senate's \ncredibility. The bill that passed the\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\nHouse arrived over here with 377 votes. This is a bipartisan bill. It \nis something we need to do. We need to do it as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5305-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, even though President Obama has said we \nshould look forward, some in Congress insist on looking backward to a \nbroader investigation of interrogation tactics that were used against \n9/11 terrorists to find out whether even more airplanes were on their \nway to kill even more Americans.\n  These interrogation tactics are now well known. They had been \napproved by the National Security Council, approved by the Department \nof Justice, were known to senior Democratic and Republican Members of \nCongress who, CIA records now show, were briefed some 40 times. The CIA \nhas not used the tactics in question for several years. They are not \nbeing used today. The Congress has since enacted laws that make clear \nthat interrogation tactics used by the military are limited to those \ncontained in the Army Field Manual. The President extended those same \nlimitations to intelligence agencies this year by Executive order.\n  The President is following his own advice about looking forward by \nasking the National Security Council to review what tactics would be \nappropriate when terrorists are captured who might have information \nabout imminent attacks on Americans. The Senate Intelligence Committee \nis conducting its own review of tactics and is considering expanding \nthe briefing process for interrogation tactics.\n  Despite these investigations, some still say, let's have ``a full-\nblown criminal'' investigation.\n  That raises these questions: Investigation of whom? Where do we draw \nthe line? Where is the logical place to stop?\n  On Thursday, I asked these questions of the Attorney General, Eric \nHolder, at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing. He found it \ndifficult to give me specific answers.\n  To begin with, the Attorney General did not answer my question about \nwhat directions he had received from the White House concerning \ninterrogations.\n  Then, he would only answer ``hypothetically'' when I asked if we are \ngoing to investigate lawyers for giving their opinions, shouldn't we \nalso investigate intelligence agents who created the interrogation \ntechniques and asked for the opinions, or officials who approved the \ntechniques, or Members of Congress who knew about or approved or even \nencouraged the interrogation tactics?\n  The Attorney General could not remember whether he knew or approved \nof renditions that occurred during the Clinton administration when he \nwas Deputy Attorney General--renditions that took captured terrorists \nto other countries, for example, perhaps to Egypt, for custody, maybe \nfor interrogation. He did not say what precautions he took to make sure \nthese renditions followed the law.\n  The Attorney General's unresponsive answers and poor memory suggest \nwhat a difficult path it will be if the Government continues to \npublicize and expand its investigation of interrogation tactics.\n  This is not a pleasant subject. When we debated it in the Senate in \n2005, I was among those Senators, including Senator McCain, who \ndisagreed with the administration. We believed it was Congress's \nconstitutional responsibility to set the rules for dealing with \ndetainees and we helped enact a law requiring that techniques used by \nthe military should be limited to those in the Army Field Manual. But \nshowing videotapes of even those techniques will not be a pretty sight.\n  Public officials, of course, should follow the law. But it is not \nnecessary to have a circus to determine whether the law was followed.\n  If there is to be a broader investigation than currently is underway, \nit must be fair and evenhanded and lead wherever it may lead--perhaps \nto intelligence officers, perhaps to administration officials, perhaps \nto Members of Congress. The Attorney General himself needs to be \nwilling to say what he knew and when he knew it and what he did about \nrenditions during the Clinton administration when he was Deputy \nAttorney General.\n  Obsessively looking in the rear view mirror could consume our \nNation's every waking moment. There is plenty about America's history \nthat, in retrospect, we wish had not happened: Supreme Court decisions \nbarring Blacks from public facilities, Congress filibustering anti-\nlynching laws, excluding Jews from major institutions, denying women \nthe right to vote, incarcerating Japanese Americans during World War \nII.\n  We have dealt with those instances best by acknowledging and \ncorrecting them, not wallowing in them by recognizing that the United \nStates has always been a work in progress toward great goals, rarely \nachieving them, often falling back, but always trying. In fact, the \nlate political scientist Samuel Huntington has written that most of our \npolitical debates are about dealing with the disappointment of not \nmeeting great goals we have set for ourselves.\n  Then there is the thoroughly practical question of who will want to \nserve in public life in Washington, DC, if the first thing a newly \nelected administration does is to try to discredit, disbar, or indict \nall those with whom it disagrees in the last administration. Some of \nthat damage already has been done.\n  For all these reasons, I would hope the President will follow his \nfirst instinct and insist that we go forward as a country--focus on the \neconomy, on the banks and the auto companies, on health care and \nenergy, on a Supreme Court Justice, and two wars in which our men and \nwomen are serving.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe questions I asked Attorney General Holder on Thursday, along with \nhis answers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  ALEXANDER-HOLDER EXCHANGE ON INVESTIGATION OF INTERROGATION TACTICS\n\n Hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and \n                    Science Transcript, May 7, 2009\n\n       Senator Alexander: I have a few questions about the \n     interrogation of enemy combatants. I thought President \n     Obama's first instinct was a good one when he said that we \n     should look forward, but apparently not everyone agrees with \n     that. I notice that a member of the House of Representatives \n     yesterday said that she wanted a full, top-to-bottom, \n     criminal investigation. These are my questions: 1) What \n     directions or guidance have you received from the President \n     or his representatives or anyone in the White House \n     concerning the interrogation of enemy combatants?\n       Attorney General Holder: Well, as we have indicated, for \n     those people who were involved in the interrogation and \n     relied upon, in good faith and adhered to the memoranda \n     created by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, \n     it is our intention not to prosecute and not to investigate \n     those people. I have also indicated that we will follow the \n     law and the facts and let that take us wherever it may. A \n     good prosecutor can only say that. So, I think those are the \n     general ways in which we view this issue.\n       Senator Alexander: My second question would be: Should you \n     follow these facts\n\n[[Page S5306]]\n\n     and continue in an investigation if you're investigating \n     lawyers at the Department of Justice who wrote legal opinions \n     authorizing certain interrogations, wouldn't it also be \n     appropriate to investigate the CIA employees or contractors \n     or other people from intelligence agencies who asked or \n     created the interrogation techniques or officials in the Bush \n     Administration who approved them or what about members of \n     Congress who were informed of them or knew about them or \n     approved them or encouraged them? Wouldn't they also be \n     appropriate parts of such an investigation?\n       Attorney General Holder: Well, there is, as has been \n     publicly reported, an OPR inquiry into the work of the \n     attorneys who prepared those OLC memoranda. It is not in \n     final form yet and I have not reviewed that report. I will \n     look at that report and make a determination as to what we \n     want to do with it. It deals, I suspect, not only with the \n     attorneys, but people that they interacted with, so I think \n     we will gain some insights by reviewing that report. Our \n     desire is not to do anything that would be perceived as \n     political or partisan. We do want to report, to the extent \n     that we can do that, but as I said, my responsibility is to \n     enforce the laws of this nation and to the extent that we see \n     violations of those laws, we will take the appropriate \n     action.\n       Senator Alexander: If you're going to investigate the \n     lawyers whose opinion was asked about whether this is legal \n     or not, I would assume you could also go to the people who \n     created the techniques, the officials who approved them, and \n     the members of Congress who knew about them and may have \n     encouraged them.\n       Attorney General Holder: Hypothetically that might be true, \n     I don't know. What I want to do is look at, in a very \n     concrete way, what that OPR report says and get a better \n     sense from that report about what it says about the \n     interaction of those lawyers with people in the \n     administration and see from there whether further action is \n     warranted.\n       Senator Alexander: My last question is, once we begin this \n     process, where is the line drawn? According to former \n     intelligence officials, renditions, and by renditions we mean \n     moving captured people from our country to another country \n     where they might be interrogated or even worse. Those \n     renditions were used by the Clinton Administration beginning \n     in the mid-1990s to investigate and disrupt al-Qaeda. That's \n     the testimony before Congress by Michael Shoyer. He said they \n     began in the late summer of 1995, ``I authored it, I ran it, \n     I managed it against al-Qaeda leaders.'' The Washington Post \n     says the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, \n     George Tenet, said there were about seventy renditions \n     carried about before Sept. 11, 2001; most of them during the \n     Clinton years. Mr. Attorney General, you were the Deputy \n     Attorney General from 1997-2001. Did you know about these \n     renditions? Did you or anyone else at the Department of \n     Justice approve them? What precautions were taken to ensure \n     these renditions, any interrogations of such detainees on by \n     or behalf of the US Government complied with the law?\n       Attorney General Holder: I think the concern that we have \n     with renditions is renditions to countries that would not \n     treat suspects in a way that's consistent with the laws and \n     treaties that we have signed. If there is a rendition taking \n     a person to a place where that person might be tortured? \n     That's the kind of rendition that I think is inappropriate. \n     My memory of my time in the Clinton Administration, I don't \n     believe that we did that--that we had renditions where people \n     were taken to places where we had any reasonable belief that \n     they were going to be tortured. That would be the concern \n     that I would have. I wouldn't want to restrict the ability of \n     our government to use all the techniques that we can to keep \n     the American people safe, but in using those tools, we have \n     to do so in a way that's consistent with our treaty \n     obligations and values as a nation.\n       Senator Alexander: But I think you can see the line of my \n     inquiry which is that if we're going to ask lawyers who were \n     asked their legal opinions, if we're going to investigate \n     them, jeopardize their career, second guess them, look back, \n     then where does that stop? Do we not also have to look at the \n     people who asked for those techniques, people who approved \n     those techniques, the members of Congress who knew about and \n     encouraged those techniques perhaps, or in your case, in the \n     Clinton Administration, we don't know what the interrogations \n     were then. Perhaps you do and perhaps the question would be \n     whether you approved them. I prefer President Obama's \n     approach. I think it's time to look forward and I hope he \n     sticks to that point of view.\n       Attorney General Holder: Well, I will note that the OPR \n     inquiries we've done in the prior administration, and also \n     note that I'm a prosecutor. I've been a career prosecutor and \n     I hope a good one. A good prosecutor uses the discretion that \n     he or she has in an appropriate way and has the ability to \n     know how far an inquiry needs to go to satisfy the \n     obligations that that prosecutor has without needlessly \n     dragging into an investigation at great expense, both \n     personal and professional, people who should not be there and \n     that will be the kind of judgment that I hope I will bring to \n     making the determinations that you express concern about.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the statement before the House Committee on \nForeign Affairs of Michael F. Scheuer, former Chief of the CIA's Bin \nLaden Unit, in which he says:\n  The CIA's rendition program began in late summer, 1995. I authored \nit, and then ran and managed it against al-Qaeda leaders and other \nSunni Islamists from August 1995 until June 1999.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement Before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee \n      on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight \n                         Subcommittee on Europe\n\n\nextraordinary rendition in u.s. counter terrorism policy: the impact on \n                        transatlantic relations\n\n (Statement by Michael F. Scheuer, Former Chief, Bin Laden Unit, CIA, \n                             Apr. 17, 2007)\n\n\n                         the rendition program\n\n       The CIA's Rendition Program began in late summer, 1995. I \n     authored it, and then ran and managed it against al-Qaeda \n     leaders and other Sunni Islamists from August, 1995, until \n     June, 1999.\n       (A) There were only two goals for the program:\n       (1) Take men off the street who were planning or had been \n     involved in attacks on U.S. or its allies.\n       (2) Seize hard-copy or electronic documents in their \n     possession when arrested; Americans were never expected to \n     read them.\n       (3) Interrogation was never a goal under President Clinton. \n     Why?\n       --Because it would be a foreign intelligence or security \n     service without CIA present or in control.\n       --Because the take from the interrogation would be filtered \n     by the service holding the individual, and we would never \n     know if it was complete or distorted.\n       --Because torture might be used and the information might \n     be simply what an individual thought we wanted to hear.\n       (B) The Rendition Program was initiated because President \n     Clinton, and Messrs. Lake, Berger, and Clarke requested that \n     the CIA begin to attack and dismantle AQ. These men made it \n     clear that they did not want to bring those captured to the \n     U.S. and hold them in U.S. custody.\n       (1) President Clinton and his national security team \n     directed the CIA to take each captured al-Qaeda leader to the \n     country which had an outstanding legal process for him. This \n     was a hard-and-fast rule which greatly restricted CIA's \n     ability to confront al-Qaeda because we could only focus on \n     al-Qaeda leaders who were wanted somewhere. As a result many \n     al-Qaeda fighters we knew were dangerous to America could not \n     be captured.\n       (2) CIA warned the president and the National Security \n     Council that the U.S. State Department had and would identify \n     the countries to which the captured fighters were being \n     delivered as human rights abusers.\n       (3) In response, President Clinton et. al asked if CIA \n     could get each receiving country to guarantee that it would \n     treat the person according to its own laws. This was no \n     problem and we did so.\n       --I have read and been told that Mr. Clinton, Mr. Burger, \n     and Mr. Clarke have said since 9/11 that they insisted that \n     each receiving country treat the rendered person it received \n     according to U.S. legal standards. To the best of my memory \n     that is a lie.\n       (C) After 9/11, and under President Bush, rendered al-Qaeda \n     operatives have most often been kept in U.S. custody. The \n     goals of the program remained the same, although Mr. Bush's \n     national security team wanted to use U.S. officers to \n     interrogate captured al-Qaeda fighters.\n       (1) This decision by the Bush administration allowed CIA to \n     capture al-Qaeda fighters we knew were a threat to the United \n     States without on all occasions being dependent on the \n     availability of another country's outstanding legal process. \n     This decision made the already successful Rendition Program \n     even more effective.\n       (D) The following particulars about the Rendition Program \n     may be of interest to you.\n       (1) From its start until today, the Program was focused on \n     senior al-Qaeda leaders and not aimed at the rank-and-file \n     members. With only limited manpower to conduct the Rendition \n     Program, CIA wanted to inflict as much damage on al-Qaeda as \n     possible and therefore focused on senior leaders, financiers, \n     terrorist operators, field commanders, strategists, and \n     logisticians.\n       (2) To the best of my knowledge, not a single target of \n     rendition has ever been kidnapped by CIA officers. The claims \n     to the contrary by the Swedish government regarding Mr. \n     Aghiza and his associate, and those by the Italian government \n     regarding Abu Omar, are either misstatements or lies by those \n     governments.\n       --Indeed, it is passing strange that European leaders are \n     here today to complain about very successful and security \n     enhancing U.S. Government counterterrorism operations, when \n     their European Union (EU) presides over the earth's single \n     largest terrorist safe haven, and has done so for a quarter \n     century. The EU's policy of easily attainable political \n     asylum and its prohibition against deporting wanted or \n     convicted terrorists to country's with the death penalty have \n     made Europe a major, consistent, and invulnerable\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\n     source of terrorist threat to the United States.\n       (3) Each and every target of a rendition was vetted by a \n     battery of lawyers at CIA and not infrequently by lawyers at \n     the National Security Council and the Department of Justice. \n     For each rendition target, I, and then my successors as the \n     chief of the bin Laden/al-Qaeda operations, had to prepare \n     and present a written brief citing and explaining the \n     intelligence information that made the rendition target a \n     threat to the United States and/or its allies. If the \n     brief persuaded the lawyers, the operation went ahead. If \n     the brief was insufficient, the lawyers disapproved and no \n     operation was conducted against that target until \n     additional reliable evidence was collected.\n       --Let me be very explicit and precise on this point. Not \n     one single al-Qaeda leader has ever been rendered on the \n     basis of any CIA officer's ``hunch'' or ``guess'' or \n     ``caprice.'' These are scurrilous accusations that became \n     fashionable after the Washington Post's correspondent Dana \n     Priest revealed information that damaged U.S. national \n     security and, as result, won a journalism prize for abetting \n     America's enemies, and when such lamentable politicians as \n     Senators McCain, Rockefeller, Graham, and Levin followed Ms. \n     Priest's lead and began to attack the men and women of CIA \n     who had risked their lives to protect America under the \n     direct orders of two U.S. presidents and with the full \n     knowledge of the intelligence committees of the United States \n     Congress. Both Ms. Priest and the gentlemen just mentioned \n     have behaved disgracefully, and ought to publicly apologize \n     to the CIA's men and women who have executed the Rendition \n     Program.\n       (4) To proceed, the Rendition Program has been the single \n     most effective counterterrorism operation ever conducted by \n     the United States government. Americans are safer today \n     because of the program, but that degree of safety will ebb as \n     the Senators just mentioned slowly but surely destroy the \n     program. If there are those in this Congress, in the media, \n     in this country, or in Europe who believe that we would be \n     safer if Khalid Shaykh Muhammed, Abu Zubaydah, Mr. Hambali, \n     Ibn Shaykh al-Libi, Khalid bin Attash, and several dozen \n     other senior al-Qaeda leaders were still free and on the \n     street, then the educational systems and the reservoirs of \n     common sense on both sides of the Atlantic are in much more \n     dilapidated shape than I thought.\n       (5) On the issue of how rendered al-Qaeda leaders have been \n     treated in prison, I am unable to speak with authority about \n     the conditions these men found in the Middle Eastern prisons \n     they were delivered to at President Clinton's direction. I \n     would not, however, be surprised if their treatment was not \n     up to U.S. standards, but this is a matter of no concern as \n     the Rendition Program's goal was to protect America and the \n     rendered fighters delivered to Middle Eastern governments are \n     now either dead or in places from which they cannot harm \n     America. Mission accomplished, as the saying goes.\n       Under President Bush, the rendered al-Qaeda fighters held \n     in U.S. custody have been treated according to guidelines \n     that were crafted by U.S. government lawyers, approved by the \n     Executive Branch, and briefed to and permitted by at least \n     the four senior members of the two congressional intelligence \n     oversight committees.\n       (6) Finally, I will close by saying that mistakes may well \n     have been made during my tenure as the chief of CIA's bin \n     Laden operations, and, if there were errors, they are my \n     responsibility. Intelligence information is not the \n     equivalent of court-room-quality evidence, and it never will \n     be. But I will again stress that no rendition target was ever \n     approved or captured without a written brief composed of \n     intelligence information that persuaded competent U.S. \n     government legal authorities. If mistakes were made, I can \n     only say that that is tough, but war is a tough and confusing \n     business, and a well-supported chance to take action and \n     protect Americans should always trump other considerations, \n     especially pedantic worries about whether or not the \n     intelligence data is air tight.\n       --To destroy the Rendition Program because of a mistake or \n     two or more would be to sacrifice the protection of Americans \n     to venal and prize-hungry reporters like Ms. Priest, \n     grandstanding politicians like those mentioned above, and \n     effete sanctimonious Europeans who take every bit of American \n     protection offered them while publicly damning and seeking \n     jail time for those who risk their lives to provide the \n     protection. If the Rendition Program is halted, we will truly \n     be able to say, by paraphrasing the late film actor John \n     Wayne, that: War is tough, but it is a lot tougher if you are \n     deliberately stupid.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5307-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5307-S5308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TAX BURDEN AND BAILOUTS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first, I would like to ask unanimous consent \nthat two op-eds be printed in the Record. Let me identify them both.\n  The first is a piece in the Washington Post of today by Robert \nSamuelson, titled ``Tax Dodge Myths.'' I think he is one of the best \neconomists and writers in this country. He always has something very \nuseful to say, and his column today made the point that it would be \nfolly for the United States to add a tax burden on American \ncorporations such as Coca-Cola, IBM, Microsoft, Caterpillar--companies \nlike that--that are multinational in the sense that they do business \nhere but also do business in other countries.\n  It simply makes no sense to add a tax burden onto them as if they are \ndoing something unpatriotic by selling our products in other countries \nas well as in the United States.\n  The other is a piece called ``The Chrysler Power Grab.'' It was \ncarried in the Arizona Republic on May 6 of this year and was written \nby the finest columnist in Arizona. His name is Bob Robb.\n  In this column, he notes the irony of the fact that the United States \nhas been bailing out two American companies--Chrysler and General \nMotors--for the purpose of saving American jobs, when in point of fact \nit looks as though a lot of the results of this action are going to be \nto transfer jobs to other countries and ironically to compete with \ncompanies that may be owned abroad, such as Toyota, but have a lot of \nAmerican workers. He talks about the fact that Fiat, an Italian \ncompany, is hard to distinguish from Toyota, a Japanese company, but we \nare apparently saving the jobs for Fiat but not those for Toyota.\n  In any event, I think these are two interesting columns, and I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 11, 2009]\n\n                            Tax Dodge Myths\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       The U.S. tax code is ``full of corporate loopholes that \n     makes it perfectly legal for companies to avoid paying their \n     fair share.''--President Obama, May 4.\n       Like it or not, ours is a world of multinational companies. \n     Almost all of America's brand-name firms (Coca-Cola, IBM, \n     Microsoft, Caterpillar) are multinationals, and the process \n     works both ways. In 2006, the U.S. operations of foreign \n     firms employed 5.3 million workers. Fiat's looming takeover \n     of Chrysler reminds us again that much business is \n     transnational.\n       For most people, the multinational company is a troubling \n     concept. Loyalty matters. We like to think that ``our \n     companies'' serve the broad national interest rather than \n     just scouring the world for the cheapest labor, the laxest \n     regulations and the lowest taxes. And the tax issue is \n     especially vexing: How should multinationals be taxed on the \n     profits they make outside their home countries?\n       Listen to President Obama, and the status quo seems a \n     cesspool. Pervasive ``loopholes'' engineered by ``well-\n     connected lobbyists'' allow U.S. multinationals to skirt \n     American taxes and outsource jobs to low-tax countries. So \n     the president proposes plugging loopholes. Some jobs will \n     return to the United States, he said, and U.S. tax coffers \n     will grow by $210 billion over the next decade.\n       Sounds great--and that's how the story played. ``Obama \n     Targets Overseas Tax Dodge,'' headlined The Post. But the \n     reality is murkier; the president's accusatory rhetoric \n     perpetuates many myths.\n       Myth: Aided by those overpaid lobbyists, American \n     multinationals are taxed lightly--less so than their foreign \n     counterparts.\n       Reality: Just the opposite. Most countries don't tax the \n     foreign profits of their multinational firms at all. Take a \n     Swiss multinational with operations in South Korea. It pays a \n     27.5 percent Korean corporate tax on its profits and can \n     bring home the rest tax-free. By contrast, a U.S. firm in \n     Korea pays the Korean tax and, if it returns the profits to \n     the United States, faces the 35 percent U.S. corporate tax \n     rate. American companies can defer the U.S. tax by keeping \n     the profits abroad (naturally, many do), and when \n     repatriated, companies get a credit for foreign taxes paid. \n     In this case, they'd pay the difference between the Korean \n     rate (27.5 percent) and the U.S. rate (35 percent).\n       Myth: When US. multinationals invest abroad, they destroy \n     American jobs.\n       Reality: Not so. Sure, many U.S. firms have shut American \n     factories and opened plants elsewhere. But most overseas \n     investments by U.S. multinationals serve local markets. Only \n     10 percent of their foreign output is exported back to the \n     United States, says Harvard economist Fritz Foley. When Wal-\n     Mart opens a store in China, it doesn't close one in \n     California. On balance, all the extra foreign sales create \n     U.S. jobs for management, research and development (almost 90 \n     percent of American multinationals' R occurs in the United \n     States), and the export of components. A study by Foley and \n     economists Mihir Desai of Harvard and James Hines of the \n     University of Michigan estimates that for every 10 percent \n     increase in U.S. multinationals' overseas payrolls, their \n     American payrolls increase almost 4 percent.\n\n[[Page S5308]]\n\n       Myth: Plugging overseas corporate tax loopholes will \n     dramatically improve the budget outlook as multinationals pay \n     their ``fair'' share.\n       Reality: Dream on. The estimated $210 billion revenue gain \n     over 10 years--money already included in Obama's budget--\n     represents only six-tenths of 1 percent of the decade's tax \n     revenue of $32 trillion, as projected by the Congressional \n     Budget Office. Worse, the CBO reckons that Obama's endless \n     deficits over the decade will total a gut-wrenching $9.3 \n     trillion.\n       Whether Obama's proposals would create any jobs in the \n     United States is an open question. In highly technical ways, \n     Obama would increase the taxes on the foreign profits of U.S. \n     multinationals by limiting the use of today's deferral and \n     foreign tax credit. Taxing overseas investment more heavily, \n     the theory goes, would favor investment in the United States.\n       But many experts believe his proposals would actually \n     destroy U.S. jobs. Being more heavily taxed, American \n     multinational firms would have more trouble competing with \n     European and Asian rivals. Some U.S. foreign operations might \n     be sold to tax-advantaged foreign firms. Either way, \n     supporting operations in the United States would suffer. \n     ``You lose some of those good management and professional \n     jobs in places like Chicago and New York,'' says Gary \n     Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute.\n       Including state taxes, America's top corporate tax rate \n     exceeds 39 percent; among wealthy nations, only Japan's is \n     higher (slightly). However, the effective U.S. tax rate is \n     reduced by preferences--mostly domestic, not foreign--that \n     also make the system complex and expensive. As Hufbauer \n     suggests, Obama would have been better advised to cut the top \n     rate and pay for it by simultaneously ending many \n     preferences. That would lower compliance costs and involve \n     fewer distortions. But this sort of proposal would have been \n     harder to sell. Obama sacrificed substance for grandstanding.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From the Arizona Republic]\n\n                        The Chrysler Power Grab\n\n       The proposed end games for General Motors and particularly \n     Chrysler illustrate why government shouldn't have gotten \n     involved in the first place.\n       It's worthwhile to begin with the broader picture. \n     Americans used to buy about 17 million new cars and trucks a \n     year. Now, we're buying less than 10 million. That, of \n     course, puts considerable stress on manufacturers with weaker \n     products or financial structures.\n       How many new cars Americans will want to purchase in the \n     future is unknown. But there can be a high degree of \n     confidence in this: however many it is, someone will sell \n     them to us.\n       Moreover, they are likely to be produced in the United \n     States. A majority of cars sold by foreign manufacturers in \n     the U.S. are actually built here.\n       So, why should the federal government care who it is that \n     sells us our cars? There are two rationales offered. First, \n     to preserve an ``American'' auto industry. Second, to \n     preserve ``American'' jobs.\n       The proposed Chrysler restructuring gives the lie to both \n     rationales.\n       Under the Obama administration's proposal, Chrysler would, \n     in essence, be given to Fiat, an Italian company, to operate.\n       So, how is an Italian car manufacturer operating in \n     Michigan any more ``American'' than a Japanese manufacturer \n     operating in Kentucky?\n       And why should the federal government give a market \n     preference--through taxpayer financing and warrantee \n     guarantees to Italian cars produced by American workers in \n     Michigan over Japanese cars produced by American workers in \n     Kentucky?\n       The Obama administration's proposed restructuring is more \n     than just unjustified, however. It dangerously undermines the \n     rule of law, as explicated so beneficially by Friedrich Hayek \n     in his classic, ``The Road to Serfdom.''\n       The essence of the rule of law, according to Hayek, is that \n     what the government will do is known to all economic actors \n     in advance. That government will not act arbitrarily in \n     specific circumstances to favor some economic actors over \n     others.\n       Chrysler has $6.9 billion in secured debt. Under the law, \n     secured lenders have the first claim on the assets of the \n     debtor in the event of non-payment.\n       The Obama administration is attempting to muscle past this \n     law. Under its proposal, the health care trust of the auto \n     workers' union, an unsecured creditor, would forgive 57 \n     percent of what Chrysler owes it, and receive 55 percent of \n     the company's equity in exchange. The federal government \n     would forgive about a third of what it would loan Chrysler \n     and receive 8 percent of the company's equity. Fiat would pay \n     nothing for its 20 percent initial ownership.\n       The secured creditors, with the first claim on Chrysler's \n     assets, were asked to forgive 70 percent of what they are \n     owed and receive nothing in equity. When they refused and \n     forced the company into bankruptcy, they were excoriated by \n     Obama--a shameful act by a president who pledged to uphold \n     the law, not make it up as he went along.\n       The purposed GM restructuring is equally lopsided. The \n     union trust would forgive half of what it is owed and receive \n     39 percent of the company. The government would forgive half \n     of what it is owed and receive 50 percent of the company. The \n     other private lenders, in this case unsecured, would forgive \n     100 percent of what they are owed and receive just 10 percent \n     of the company.\n       In his recent press conference, Obama said he had no \n     interest in owning or operating car companies. Until this \n     point, I was willing to accept Obama at his word, while \n     fundamentally disagreeing with his economic policies.\n       Given his actions, however, it's hard to credit his \n     disclaimer in this instance.\n       These proposed restructurings are power grabs, pure and \n     simple. The positions of lenders are eviscerated to give \n     control to the union trust and the government. The emergent \n     companies are given market preference through taxpayer \n     financing and government warrantee guarantees. All to serve \n     no true national purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5308-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONDUCTING U.S. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

When we start looking \nbackward instead of forward, we want to be careful what we ask for \nbecause we just might get it, and it might be more than we bargained \nfor.\n  There have been a lot of mistakes the United States has made, a lot \nwe are not very proud of, and my colleague mentioned a couple of those. \nThere were certainly things in the last Democratic administration for \nwhich, had some of the officials there had it to do over again, I am \nsure they would do over. There were things the Republican \nadministration that succeeded the Clinton administration undoubtedly \ndisagreed with, but it seems to me that President Bush has acquitted \nhimself very well as a former President, not criticizing the \nadministration he succeeded, and certainly not suggesting those \ndisagreements should take the form of political trials or even criminal \ntrials. It would be very unseemly for that to occur with respect to the \nBush administration now that we have a new Obama administration.\n  But people who served previously in the Clinton administration, \nobviously those who served in the Congress and knew something about \nwhat went on, would certainly have to be prepared to defend themselves \nunder these circumstances as well. It is just an unseemly way, it seems \nto me--and I agree with my colleague from Tennessee--for the U.S. \nGovernment to be conducting its business. So I commend my colleague, \nSenator Alexander, for his statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5308-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5308-S5309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on a related matter, the Guantanamo Bay \ndetention facility and what we do about that--as everyone knows, our \nPresident fulfilled a campaign promise when he issued an Executive \norder to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.\n  Both President Bush and Secretary Gates had wanted to close it, but \nthey were confronted with a very difficult problem: what to do with the \nprisoners at the facility.\n  President Obama now faces that same dilemma. Campaign rhetoric, it \nturns out, is one thing; governing is quite another.\n  There are far more questions than answers about what the \nadministration will do with the prisoners at Guantanamo. Will it hold \nthem? Where will it hold them? Will they be sent to the United States? \nWill they be kept in military facilities or in Federal prisons here in \nthe United States? How will it guarantee that those who are released do \nnot return to the battlefield?\n\n  We don't have answers, of course, to these questions. Yet the \nadministration has asked Congress for $80 million, some of which, as is \nquite clearly stated in the language of the request, could be used to \ntransfer these detainees to the United States.\n  Last week, during the House Appropriations Committee's markup of the \nPresident's supplemental appropriations request, the chairman struck \nthe $80 million, noting that he could not defend the request because \nthe administration does not have a plan for closure. As the Senate \nAppropriations Committee prepares to mark up the supplemental request \nthis week, I urge the committee to follow the example of the House of \nRepresentatives. Majority Leader Reid has just informed us that the \nSenate committee would ``fence'' the $80 million, meaning that it would \nrelease it only when there is a plan,\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\nbut the plan could be almost anything. Nor is there any assurance in \nthe statement that no prisoners could come to the United States until \nOctober 1. That is not the kind of assurance that will get the Senate \nto support this request. As the majority leader said in his classically \nunderstated way: ``That looks like an issue that could cause a little \nbit of debate.'' I am sure he is absolutely correct about that. Surely, \nwe can all agree that the Congress should not approve significant \nfunding requests when we have no idea how the administration will use \nthe funding. Moreover, the stakes are huge. The terrorist population at \nGuantanamo is dangerous. These are the worst of the worst, some of the \nmost dangerous people in the world.\n  The 241 terrorists at Guantanamo include 27 members of al-Qaida's \nleadership, 95 lower level al-Qaida operatives, 9 members of the \nTaliban's leadership, 12 Taliban fighters, and 92 foreign fighters. \nAmong their ranks are Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is the mastermind of \nthe 9/11 attacks and who, in the aftermath of those attacks, was \nplanning a followup to attack a west coast skyscraper.\n  Another is Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali, who served as a key lieutenant for \nKSM--Khalid Shaikh Mohammed--during the planning for 9/11, and he, in \nfact, transferred money to the United States-based operative for that \nplan.\n  Ramzi bin al-Shibh helped to organize the 9/11 attacks and he was a \nlead operative in the post-9/11 plot to hijack aircraft and crash them \ninto Heathrow airport.\n  There is also a terrorist named Hambali, who helped plan the 2002 \nBali bombings that killed more than 200 people and who facilitated the \nal-Qaida financing for the Jakarta Marriott attack in 2004. Abd al \nRahim Al Nashire masterminded the attack on the USS Cole which claimed \nthe lives of 17 U.S. sailors in October of 2000.\n  The prior administration has stated that 110 of these detainees \nshould never be released because of the danger to the United States.\n  What about those who are considered safe for release? We have been \nundergoing a review of the prisoners from the time they have been \ntaken, and occasionally we release some because we think they no longer \nrepresent a threat. The Department of Defense stated in January that 61 \nformer Guantanamo detainees whom we had released returned to the \nbattlefield against the United States and allied forces in Afghanistan, \nIraq, and elsewhere. This represents in our criminal terms an 11-\npercent recidivism rate, and who knows how many of the rest of them may \nalso be engaged in acts of terror. One of these recidivists, Said ali \nal-Shihri, who was returned to his home in Saudi Arabia after his \nrelease from Guantanamo, went to Yemen and he is now the No. 2 in \nYemen's al-Qaida branch.\n  So what are we to do with these people? More than 100 days into the \nadministration, we don't know what their plan is. According to press \nreports, part of the plan may be to allow one group of these detainees, \n17 Uighurs from China, to have residence in the United States.\n  As the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, noted in two letters to \nthe Attorney General, such an action appears to be prohibited under \nUnited States law. Senator Sessions stated in his letter to Mr. Holder:\n\n       Just 4 years ago, Congress enacted into law a prohibition \n     on the admission of foreign terrorists and trained militants \n     into this country. Accordingly, Congress is entitled to know \n     what legal authority, if any, you believe the administration \n     has to admit into the United States Uighurs and/or any other \n     detainee who participated in terrorist-related activities \n     covered by section 1182(a)(3)(B).\n\n  Congress obviously must have the answer to this question before it \nconsiders funding that could possibly be used to bring these and other \nterrorists and detainees to the United States.\n  What of the rest of the terrorists? Will the administration bring \nthem to the United States to stand trial? If so, according to what \nrules? We have been told that the administration was shutting down the \nmilitary commissions process set up by Congress, but now it appears \nthat that process may be brought back. Will all of the remaining \nGuantanamo terrorists be tried in that system or will civilian courts \nbe used? And if civilian courts, which ones?\n  If you can't imagine these terrorists actually being tried in U.S. \ncivilian courts, you might try to imagine a little harder. The most \nlikely locations of trials are in Manhattan or Alexandria, VA--both \nvery high population areas. The 2006 death penalty trial of Zacarias \nMoussaoui turned Alexandria into a virtual encampment, with heavily \narmed agents, rooftop snipers, bomb-sniffing dogs, blocked streets, \nidentification checks, and a fleet of television satellite trucks.\n  And where will these detainees be held while awaiting trial? Federal \nprisons, which are already overcrowded, would be overburdened with the \nobligation of housing terrorist suspects. Zacarias Moussaoui, who spent \n23 hours a day inside his 80-square-foot cell, was constantly monitored \nand never saw other inmates. An entire unit of six cells and a common \narea was set aside just for him.\n  If not in Federal prisons, perhaps military prisons. Well, not so \nfast. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs \nnoted that extensive work would have to be done on existing military \nbrigs before Guantanamo detainees could be held there:\n\n       You can't commingle them with military detainees, so you'd \n     have to set up a separate wing or clear out the facility.\n\n  The structures would have to be reinforced so that they wouldn't be \nvulnerable to terrorist attacks. He concludes by saying:\n\n       And you would have to address secondary and tertiary--\n\n  in other words, security--\n\n     concerns with the town, the county and the State.\n\n  The reality of the situation is that there is simply no better place \nfor these terrorists than the state-of-the-art facility at Guantanamo.\n  This is why the Senate went on record voting against the proposition \nthat these detainees be brought to the United States. In fact, the \nSenate agreed to the amendment offered by the senior Senator from \nKentucky by a vote of 94 to 3. Among the people voting in support of \nthis resolution were the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the \nInterior, and the Vice President himself while they were Members of \nthis body. So key members of the Obama administration have agreed with \nthe language of the amendment which was that Guantanamo detainees--and \nI am quoting now--``should not be . . . transferred stateside into \nfacilities in American communities and neighborhoods.''\n  If the administration has a plan, I will listen to it, but with \napproximately 8 months to go before the President's arbitrary deadline, \nI see no good answers to the complicated questions of what to do with \nthe world's most dangerous terrorists.\n  Before the President asks for appropriations to shut down the \nGuantanamo facility, appropriations which could be spent to bring these \nterrorists to the United States, the least he could do is to provide \nCongress with a plan that explains how Americans will be safer having \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed and his partners as neighbors.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are soon going to be debating a bill that \nwould place limits on the interest rate increases that credit card \ncompanies can levy on their debtholders. I look forward to debating the \neffects this bill will have on American families.\n  But before we do that, I wish to consider the debt that the Federal \nGovernment is accruing--via the budget and stimulus spending--on the \nNation's credit card. That is the debt that all American families will \nbe responsible for repaying because, as it turns out, the comparisons \nbetween what you owe on your own credit card--the kind of bills you run \nup on your family credit card--are actually not very different from the \ndebt we are running up on the Federal credit card, except, of course, \nthat the Federal debt is much bigger.\n\n[[Page S5310]]\n\nBut the reality is that you owe both: your family credit card debt and \nyour portion of the national debt.\n  President Obama's budget puts us on a course to acquire debt that \nwill reach 82.4 percent of the gross domestic product by the year 2019. \nWhat does that mean? The first point is that the debt is not interest \nfree. There is debt interest charged on that just the same as on our \npersonal credit cards. In fact, from Sunday's Washington Post, there is \nan article called ``The President's Budget'' and in it the Post says \nthe following:\n\n       The budget relies on so much borrowing that it will cost \n     taxpayers more than $4 trillion just to cover interest \n     payments for the next 10 years--more than twice what the \n     federal government will spend on education, energy, homeland \n     security, and veterans combined.\n\n  Mr. President, $4 trillion in interest on this debt--just for the \nnext 10 years.\n  The Government will begin--as a result of the need to pay this back, \nstarting in 2013 we will be paying more than $1 billion per day on \nfinance charges to the people who hold this Federal debt.\n  Imagine a billion dollars a day in interest payments. I meant U.S. \ndebt. A billion dollars a day in interest payments equates to $3.3 \nmillion a day for every American. Think about that--$3.3 million a day \nto finance the debt for every American citizen.\n  Can a family play by these same rules and get away with debt that \nwould creep up to 84.2 percent of their total income? Let's use a \nspecific, typical example. A family in my State of Arizona earns an \naverage income of $47,215 a year. Following the example of the \nPresident's budget, this family would accrue nearly $38,000 in credit \ncard debt to pay for the things it wants. Again, that is a $47,000 \nincome and $38,000 in credit card debt. That is the same percentage of \nthe family's income that the Federal Government is acquiring as a \npercent of the Federal income, our national income.\n  What would that family's situation be like? First, let's focus on \nthese hefty interest payments that I talked about. Say that the \nfamily's credit card has a typical annual rate of 10 percent, which \nwould cost $3,800 a year or $316 a month. If the family misses a \npayment or two, the interest rate can shoot up to 20 or 30 percent a \nyear. That means the family could be spending as much as $11,200 a year \njust on interest. That is nearly a third of its total debt and nearly a \nquarter of its total income--just on interest alone. That is owed in \naddition to the monthly minimum payments for the principal borrowed. \nJust as the Government has to, the family probably would need to borrow \nmore to get by, and the downward spiral would get worse and worse.\n  Needless to say, this kind of debt is not sustainable--not for the \nfamily or the Federal Government. It would rapidly lower the family's \nstandard of living. In most cases, it would bankrupt them. Beginning to \nchip away at that kind of debt would require real sacrifice--not just \ngiving up nonessential spending, such as going to the movies or going \nout to dinner or going to the zoo but fundamental choices that would \nsignificantly lower the family's standard of living.\n  A family with such massive debt would also be considered a big risk \nfor other lenders, so it would be very difficult to go out and get more \ncredit or a loan. This is the situation we are getting into with China, \nwhich currently holds almost 10 percent of our Nation's debt. The \nChinese are saying to us: We are not sure you are a good credit risk in \nthe future or that we want to lend you any more money. We are relying \non the Chinese to continue buying that debt. But in mid-March, Chinese \nPremier Wen Jiabao voiced concerns about U.S. Government bond holdings. \nHe said:\n\n       We have lent huge amounts of money to the United States. Of \n     course we are concerned about the safety of our assets. To be \n     honest, I am a little bit worried, and I would like to . . . \n     call on the United States to honor its word and remain a \n     credible nation and ensure the safety of Chinese assets.\n\n  Of course, this is exactly how credit works. Borrow massive amounts \nof money, and you are in over your head. A huge chunk of your income is \nreserved for debt repayments and interest, leaving you with little \nmoney to get by or for discretionary spending. You continue to borrow \nmore, and your creditors probably get very nervous. Pretty soon, they \nmay cease lending to you or hike up your interest rates to hedge their \nadditional risk. The only way to get back on track is to stop \nspending--and that is if you can afford to get back on track by just \nstopping spending and not having to borrow more or taking bankruptcy.\n  That is a choice the U.S. Government doesn't have. Yet there are no \nplans in Washington to halt the out-of-control spending. The massive \namount of debt we are accumulating in entitlement obligations alone is \nmore than can be sustained. These are things such as Social Security, \nMedicaid, and Medicare. We say that is an obligation we cannot default \non. Yet we also know we cannot continue to fund that obligation. As the \nPresident's head of the Office of Management and Budget has said, \ncontinued debts of the kind we are talking about are unsustainable. \nThere have been some minor reductions in spending noted in the budget. \nSome are in the area of defense, which is perhaps not the best area to \ncut back. But the minor amount of spending reduction doesn't go nearly \nfar enough when we are talking about multiple trillions of dollars in \nspending and debt--$4 trillion just in debt service in the next 10 \nyears alone.\n  The overwhelming majority of American families, of course, don't \nengage in this kind of reckless borrowing and spending. They cannot. \nThey have to make hard decisions to determine what they can afford to \ndo.\n  Washington needs to do the same. These are hard choices. We need to \nmake hard choices. The editorial in the Washington Post from last \nSunday made the same point. Again, the title was: ``The President's \nbudget, Leaving the hard choices for the next one.'' It notes that when \nthe President was campaigning, he said:\n\n       ``We can no longer afford to leave the hard choices for the \n     next budget, the next administration, or the next \n     generation,'' declared President Barack Obama last week as he \n     unveiled his budget.\n\n  As the Post notes:\n\n       We, yes, but that is exactly what he does.\n\n  They conclude that:\n\n       We just hope that it is only until the next budget rather \n     than the next administration.\n\n  The bottom line is, the budget sent to us by the President doesn't \ntackle the big issues, it doesn't reduce spending, it doesn't even cut \nexisting programs substantially, with the net result that we are going \nto be taking on debt that will require financing of $4 trillion over \nthe next 10 years. As was noted, that is not sustainable. We cannot pay \nfor that, just as a family who makes $47,000 a year cannot afford to \ntake on $38,000 in debt. That is the relative proportion.\n  One more time, the amount of debt we are taking on compared to our \nnational income is the same ratio as a family making $47,000 taking on \n$38,000 of debt on their credit card. I am not talking about a 30-year \nmortgage on the house but something that has to be paid back at the end \nof the month. And if you don't pay it, your interest rate goes up to 25 \nor 30 percent. That is simply not sustainable.\n  I hope that by putting this into the context of a real family budget, \nit is clear to people this isn't some hypothetical, unrealistic \ncomparison. When we take on this much debt at the Federal Government \nlevel, there are real consequences. When you talk about $3.3 million a \nday for each citizen of the United States to repay in interest alone, \nyou see the magnitude of what we are taking on. We have never done this \nbefore in the history of the country. There is no experience of how we \nwould possibly deal with this. This one budget, during this one 10-year \nwindow, accumulates more debt than all the debt in the United States in \nour entire history, from George Washington all the way through George \nW. Bush. In that 220-year history, we have less debt than is \nrepresented in this one budget. That is unsustainable.\n  The American people cannot make enough money to repay that amount of \nmoney. Our standard of living will be diminished substantially. The \nonly way out of it is to reduce the amount of spending in the future. \nWe can start with that right now. We don't have to start after next \nyear. We can actually start with it this year.\n  I ask my colleagues, as we talk about the budget the President has \nannounced, as we start working on the appropriations bills that will be \ncoming from the Appropriations Committee, that we stop and think about\n\n[[Page S5311]]\n\nthe amount of debt we are imposing on ourselves, our kids, and our \ngrandkids. That debt will come due more quickly than we think. The \nconsequences could be dire.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for weeks, Republicans in Congress have \nbeen saying what Democrats are finally beginning to acknowledge: that \nthe administration has no plan for closing Guantanamo and that closing \nthis secure facility without a safe alternative is irresponsible, \ndangerous, and, frankly, unacceptable.\n  Over the years, Guantanamo has housed some of the most hardened \nterrorists ever captured alive, and many of those who remain are the \nworst of the worst. Some have already killed innocent Americans, and \nmany are outspoken about their desire to kill more Americans. These men \nare exactly where they belong: locked up in a safe and secure prison \nand isolated from the American people where they can do no harm.\n  America has not been attacked at home since 9/11 because of the hard \nwork of our Armed Forces, dedicated intelligence officials, the men and \nwomen at the Department of Homeland Security, and State and local law \nenforcement officials. But another reason we have not been attacked is \nbecause some of those most likely to do so are locked up down at \nGuantanamo. These inmates are not spectators. They are the enemy. They \nare the plotters, the planners, the funders, the ones who pull the \ntrigger.\n  The administration says our country would be safer if Guantanamo is \nclosed and its inmates are transferred overseas or onto U.S. soil. If \npeople knew who was down there, I think they would disagree.\n  One of the men who is locked away safely at Guantanamo is Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed, the man who actually organized the 9/11 attacks. We \ncaptured him while he was planning followup attacks to 9/11, including \na plot to destroy a west coast skyscraper. If we had not captured \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed, he may very well have succeeded in carrying out \nthe same kind of attack on the west coast that he carried out on the \neast coast. This is a man who boasts about using his ``blessed right \nhand'' to decapitate the American journalist Daniel Pearl. And he is \nunrepentant. Earlier this year, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed joined a number \nof detainees at Guantanamo in declaring themselves ``terrorists to the \nbone'' and proclaiming September 11, 2001, as a ``blessed'' day.\n  Another inmate who still declares himself a ``terrorist to the bone'' \nis Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali, who served as a key lieutenant for KSM on \nseveral plots against the United States and the United Kingdom, \nincluding the 9/11 attacks. During what he described as the ``blessed \n11 September operation,'' Ali transferred money to U.S.-based \noperatives and served as a sort of travel agent for some of the \nhijackers. This man is responsible for the deaths of thousands of \nAmericans.\n  Another terrorist at Guantanamo who is responsible for the deaths of \nAmericans is Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who masterminded the attack on \nthe USS Cole which killed 17 U.S. sailors in 2000. When he was \narrested, Nashiri was planning new terrorist attacks, including a plot \nto crash an airplane into a Western naval vessel and a plan targeting a \nU.S. housing compound in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.\n  These are just three of the men locked up safely and securely on an \nisland miles from the United States in a facility that even the \nadministration acknowledges to be humane and well run. Americans want \nthese men kept out of our neighborhoods and off the battlefield, and \nGuantanamo guarantees that. Closing this facility by an arbitrary \ndeadline without an alternative is irresponsible and it is dangerous. \nIt is unacceptable to the American people and unacceptable to an \nincreasing number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n  The Attorney General has said that when it comes to Guantanamo, his \nchief concern is the safety of the American people. Yet, at the moment, \nthe safest option is clearly the one we are exercising. If safety is \nour top concern, then the administration will rethink its arbitrary \ndeadline for closing Guantanamo until it presents us with an equally \nsafe alternative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5311-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5311-S5312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this week we commemorate National \nPolice Week, recognizing the service and sacrifice of the men and women \nacross America in law enforcement. We especially honor those peace \nofficers who have been tragically killed in the line of duty while \nprotecting our communities and safeguarding our democracy.\n  Over 25 years ago, I served as a county executive in Jefferson \nCounty, KY, which includes my hometown of Louisville. I got to work \nwith the county's police force and witnessed up close their dedication \nand their professionalism. In Jefferson County, we pioneered new \ntechniques for tracking down abducted children that met with much \nsuccess--enough success that other jurisdictions adopted these \ntechniques, eventually leading to Congressional establishment of the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n  Decades later, peace officers in Louisville are still proud to \nprotect and serve, even with their lives in the balance. And those we \nhave lost are not forgotten. I was moved to read in my hometown paper \nrecently an article about a memorial ceremony in Louisville coinciding \nwith National Police Week. Fellow officers and family members of fallen \nofficers gathered to remember them and thank them for their service. \nPolice forces across Kentucky reverently marked National Police Week as \nwell. At a service in Richmond, Gov. Steve Beshear watched 120 police \ncadets march at the State Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, while \nflags were presented to family members of those lost in the performance \nof their duties. This Friday in Covington, officers will honor their \nfallen brothers at the northern Kentucky law enforcement memorial.\n  This Senate has the deepest admiration and respect for police \nofficers in every community in the Nation. We recognize their work is \nboth an honorable job and a dangerous one. They bravely risk their \nlives for ours, and America is grateful.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full articles about the recent ceremonies in both Louisville and \nRichmond.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, May 8, 2009]\n\n Fallen Police Officers Honored at Jefferson Square Service: Courage, \n                     Commitment to Duty Are Honored\n\n                          (By Jessie Halladay)\n\n       Sue Wells' eyes filled with tears as she stood next to a \n     wreath she helped lay at the law enforcement memorial in \n     Jefferson Square yesterday.\n       Her husband, Forest Hills Police Chief Randy Wells, was \n     killed in October 2007 while working an off-duty traffic \n     detail.\n       Yesterday, Wells joined other family members and friends of \n     officers killed in the line of duty to remember and pay their \n     respects during a service at Jefferson Square downtown.\n       ``It's wonderful that they remember,'' Wells said. ``It's \n     very heartwarming, but it's heart-wrenching too.''\n       Members of the city's fraternal order of police lodges for \n     several agencies helped plan the event, for which the \n     University of Louisville police union was host.\n       ``When their duty called, they laid down their life for \n     their community, for us,'' U of L Officer Russell Fuller said \n     during the ceremony. ``We will not let their actions fade \n     into history.''\n       Memorials of this type mean a lot to those families left \n     behind, said Jennifer Thacker, who spoke during the service. \n     Thacker's husband, Brandon, was shot in April 1998 while \n     working as an investigator for the Kentucky Department of \n     Alcoholic Beverage Control. Thacker now serves as national \n     president of the group Concerns of Police Survivors, or COPS.\n       She spoke to those attending about the value of always \n     being a member of the law enforcement family.\n\n[[Page S5312]]\n\n       ``I found hope and courage through the support of others,'' \n     she said.\n       Louisville Metro Police Chief Robert White attended \n     yesterday's ceremony because he said it's important to pay \n     respects and keep the memories alive of those who have died \n     in the service of their community.\n       He said these annual ceremonies serve not only as reminders \n     but as a renewed pledge of the commitment officers make to \n     their fellow officers and those officers' families.\n       ``It really reiterates the importance of maintaining honor \n     and respect for those men and women who have lost their lives \n     in the line of duty,'' White said.\n       Wells said while the service brings up many painful \n     memories, she is grateful for the support she has received \n     during her loss, which continues today.\n       ``If I need anything I know I could call in the wee hours \n     of the morning,'' she said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Richmond Register, Apr. 28, 2009]\n\n            State Adds 28 Names to Law Enforcement Memorial\n\n                           (By Bill Robinson)\n\n       As a kilted bagpiper played and Gov. Steve Beshear watched \n     Monday morning, 120 Kentucky law enforcement cadets marched \n     in military fashion to a ceremony honoring two law officers \n     who died in the line of duty last year.\n       A bright spring sun flooded the state's Law Enforcement \n     Officers Memorial at Eastern Kentucky University with light \n     for the ceremony attended by officers and family members from \n     across the state.\n       In addition to the names of Harlan County Constable Joe \n     Howard and Bell County Deputy Sean Pursifull, the names of 26 \n     other officers who died in the line of duty between 1862 and \n     1993 were added to the memorial's wall of honor.\n       American flags were presented to the families or \n     departments of each officer whose name was added this year.\n       Pursifull and his K-9 partner were killed Jan. 10, 2008, \n     when a vehicle driven by a fleeing suspect hit their car.\n       Howard suffered a fatal heart attack while serving a \n     warrant on April 1, 2008.\n       Howard's son, Tim, an 11-year veteran of the Harlan County \n     Sheriff's Department, attended the ceremony with his wife and \n     8-year-old daughter.\n       In addition to eulogizing the fallen officers, Beshear \n     praised the cadets who ``knowing the dangers, marched with \n     their heads held high, undeterred from their goal of becoming \n     a peace officer.''\n       Today's law officers must be better trained than ever, \n     Beshear said, because criminals in the 21st century are more \n     sophisticated, methodical and organized.\n       However, ``The heart and soul required of you, our \n     protectors, never change,'' he said.\n       ``I pray we never have to engrave any of your names, or any \n     other peace officer, on this memorial.''\n       The 120 cadets who took part in the ceremony included \n     members of the current Kentucky State Police Academy class.\n       ``I'm proud to have protected this KSP Academy class from \n     budget cuts,'' the governor said, ``because I know how \n     important they will be to our state.''\n       The ceremony concluded with a 21-gun salute as a squad of \n     seven officers fired three rifle volleys and a bugler played \n     ``Taps.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5312-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I wish to briefly discuss an issue that \nI think is important and at one time would probably have been worthy of \nfront-page news articles around the country. Instead, I notice it is \njust another piece of news in the middle of a paper.\n  Last Thursday, Mr. Stephen Friedman announced his resignation, \neffective immediately, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork, considered a central reserve bank in the country, the one that \nnow-Secretary Geithner used to serve as president. As Chairman, Mr. \nFriedman stepped down only after a Wall Street Journal story questioned \nhis ties to Goldman Sachs, a banking institution, at the same time he \nwas serving on the New York Fed's board. Unfortunately, his bad \njudgment is just another example in a long line of examples \ndemonstrating the tangled web we have woven in allowing so prominent a \ngovernment role in private businesses, involving hundreds of billions \nof dollars.\n  Let me read what the Wall Street Journal reported last Monday, May 4:\n\n       The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shaped Washington's \n     response to the financial crisis late last year, which buoyed \n     Goldman Sachs . . . and other Wall Street firms. Goldman \n     received speedy approval to become a bank holding company in \n     September [of last year] and a $10 billion capital injection \n     soon after. That is a $10 billion capital injection after \n     they redefined themselves as a bank holding company. Prior \n     to that they were not eligible.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       During that time, the New York Fed's chairman, Stephen \n     Friedman, sat on Goldman's board and had a large holding in \n     Goldman's stock, which because of Goldman's new status as a \n     bank holding company was a violation of Federal Reserve \n     policy. The New York Fed asked for a waiver, which, after \n     about 2\\1/2\\ months, the Fed granted. While it was weighing \n     the request, Mr. Friedman bought 37,300 more Goldman shares \n     in December. They've since risen $1.7 million in value.\n\n  This is a troubling matter. Members of the Senate cannot even allow a \nlobbyist to buy our lunch. Yet this man can be on a board and can buy \nstock while he is asking for approval to do something he wants to do--\nand they eventually gave him that approval--and he continues to buy \nstock and it goes up in value $1.7 million.\n  According to the article:\n\n       [Mr. Friedman] says he checked with a Goldman lawyer to \n     make sure there was no timing issue with such a purchase. He \n     says he didn't check with the Fed. New York Fed lawyers say \n     they didn't learn about his share purchase until the Journal \n     raised questions about them in April. . . . [The day after \n     receiving a waiver,] Mr. Friedman purchased 15,300 more \n     Goldman shares. . . . That million-dollar purchase brought \n     his holdings to 98,600 shares, according to the filings.\n\n  I find this unacceptable behavior. There is a reason the Federal \nReserve has a policy prohibiting a chairman of any regional Fed bank \nfrom having any connections with regulated financial institutions. You \ndo not want the regulator to have a personal financial interest in \nthose being regulated.\n  I appreciate Mr. Friedman doing the right thing now and resigning. \nThat is a good thing. However, too many officials have been acting in a \nway that suggests an erosion of propriety and the proper separation of \ninterest.\n  Recently, we learned from the New York attorney general that \nGovernment officials may have threatened Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis \nto continue a merger with Merrill Lynch or lose his job. After he \nfigured out it was going to be very bad for his stockholders and \nindicated he was not going through with it, they told him they would \nfire him if he didn't go through with it.\n  Some of the stories are unclear about how that all happened, but the \nissue does remain, and I will be interested to see what more we learn \nabout this troubling matter when the House Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform holds a hearing with Mr. Lewis and top Government \nofficials, who will testify under oath.\n  Since last year, when then-Secretary Paulson told us we must act or \nthe economy would go into collapse--and we heard those dire warnings \nrepeatedly--we have seen more and more of these instances of \nimpropriety and lack of wisdom.\n  Through TARP--the $700 billion bailout--a blank check with no \naccountability was given to the Government to do basically as it \npleased. The money was given to the Secretary of the Treasury, and he \nmet in private with many of these banks. Many of them were people he \nknew and were friends and buddies with, and he started allocating this \n$700 billion. It has continued now under Mr. Geithner, a man who \npreviously was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n  Last month, Neil Barofsky, the special inspector general overseeing \nthis $700 billion bailout, issued a report stating he has opened 20 \ncriminal investigations and 6 audits into whether\n\n[[Page S5313]]\n\ntax dollars are being misused or wasted.\n  I think we have entered a time in American history where the line \nbetween Government and free enterprise has become muddled more than \never. During good times and bad--but particularly during times such as \ntoday--the American system of capitalism and free enterprise should not \nbe manipulated for the benefit of insiders. We expect the people who \nare setting policy to be independent and above that kind of action.\n  I will note that the reports concerning how the AIG bailout was \nhandled remain unchallenged. This is what the report is indicating: \nthat Mr. Paulson, who was Secretary of the Treasury and who had been \nthe CEO of Goldman Sachs, was in and out of a meeting--a very important \nmeeting--involving the insurance company AIG. Also, in that meeting, as \nI recall, was Mr. Kashkari, Mr. Paulson's assistant, who was also from \nGoldman Sachs. But who else was in that meeting? The chairman of the \nboard of Goldman Sachs--the current, immediate chairman at that time--\nand they were talking about an insurance company, AIG, and they decided \nto pump $80 billion into that company. Now we have pumped in $170 \nbillion. Of course, we now know that of the money that went to AIG, $20 \nbillion went to Goldman Sachs.\n  So these are the kinds of things that are causing me great \ndifficulty. I am a lawyer. I know how things are supposed to work. When \nyou ask for money, you raise your hand under oath. People ought to be \nasking you questions. If you are in bankruptcy, you have to be cross-\nexamined by lawyers. The judge gets to ask questions. You have to \nsubmit certified financial statements before you get money. We cannot \njust allow a handful of people to meet in secret, decide we are in an \nemergency, and pass out hundreds of billions of dollars without the \nkind of accountability that I think is necessary.\n  I will say to my colleagues in the Senate, that when we passed the \nTARP bill, I opposed it, and I said it was far too much a grant of \npower to one man--the Secretary of the Treasury--to allocate money that \nCongress should be appropriating. I raised that point, and it was one \nof my top objections. I believe history has shown the language in that \nbill was even more broad than we thought. Because, originally, we were \ntold the money would be used to buy toxic mortgages from banks that \nwere in trouble. That is what Mr. Paulson told us. That is what \neverybody thought they were voting on--except the language was much \nbroader than that, if anybody took the time to read it.\n  As soon as he got the money, within a week or so, he had decided not \nto buy toxic assets but to buy stock in the banks. He bought stock in \nthe banks. Then, pretty soon, he was buying stock in an insurance \ncompany--AIG--pumping half the money into one insurance company, and \n$40 billion of the money that went into AIG went to foreign banks to \npay the claims those banks had against AIG, as it did with other banks. \nWe, the taxpayers, became the guarantor of an insurance company's \nresponsibilities, which was never discussed with the Senate, the House \nor the American people. They just did it.\n  The amount of money they committed was tremendous--I believe $170 \nbillion; whereas, the Federal highway budget for the whole United \nStates is just $40 billion, and the education budget for the United \nStates, the Federal Government, is $100 billion.\n  I don't like this process. I am seeing too many stories such as this \none involving Mr. Friedman, and it is time for Congress to get serious \nabout it. I hope the Obama administration will stand and be counted. \nMr. Friedman came in, I believe, under the Bush administration, so I am \nnot being partisan. But it is time for the Obama administration to take \na stand too. Mr. Geithner was in the middle of most of this; he helped \nwrite the proposal and was, what many called, the brains behind the \nPaulson proposal--the $700 billion bailout.\n  This is a continuing problem in both administrations. It is time for \nCongress to reassert its constitutional responsibility to monitor the \npurse and to not allow money to be distributed in these kinds of sums \nwithout direct approval of the people through their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.)\n  Mr. DODD. For the purpose of my colleagues, this is the substitute \namendment that Senator Shelby and I have worked on over the last number \nof days. I want to begin by expressing, first, my gratitude to the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, for his leadership and support in the \neffort to get this matter to the point we are this afternoon. Of course \nI express my gratitude to Senator Shelby and his staff as well as my \nown staff, who worked all through the weekend to try to resolve \noutstanding differences to bring us to the point where we have the \nbipartisan proposal to offer reform of the credit card laws in our \ncountry that most Americans do not need much of a speech about. Many \ntimes we are involved in a discussion and we are informing the public \nfor the first time about a problem, or at least a very limited number \nof people are aware of it. In this case, the public is probably more \naware than many about problems with interest rates and fees and \npenalties and the like. Every single day people go through this. This \nafternoon I want to talk about this bill. I want to tell my colleagues \nwhat is in this credit card reform bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, a member of the Banking Committee, \nalong with other members of the committee who worked with us over the \nlast number of weeks to try to complete a product here that can enjoy, \nI hope, as we go through this over the next day or two, broad \nbipartisan support.\n  Let me take, if I can, the next few minutes and talk about the bill \nspecifically, what the provisions are and why we have worked so hard to \npull this bill together.\n  This is not a new issue for me. I have been at credit card reform \nissues for actually more than 20 years. In the past I have not \nsucceeded, candidly, reforming the credit card laws of our Nation. But \nin light of what has occurred over the last number of months and years, \nI think there is a greater indication of the need to step up and create\n\n[[Page S5314]]\n\nsome real changes, given the conditions our constituents are living \nwith, the number of people unemployed, the obvious problem of \nforeclosure rates, and the like.\n  This issue is finding a tipping point. I believe we have a wonderful \nopportunity to create some meaningful reforms, and nothing would please \nme more than to have that kind of strong bipartisan support for these \nchanges.\n  I rise in strong support of the Credit Card Accountability, \nResponsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009. The substitute amendment, I \nhave offered on behalf of myself and Senator Shelby of Alabama, the \nformer chairman of the Banking Committee. I thank him and his staff, \nand, of course, my own staff, who worked very hard on this issue--I \nwill make specific reference to them during the debate--and who have \ndone a terrific job in bringing this together in this bipartisan \nfashion.\n  The bill before us addresses an issue of critical importance to \nmillions of American consumers and their families and to the stability \nof our financial system; that is, the need to reform the practices of \nour Nation's credit card companies and provide a comprehensive regime \nof tough new protections for consumers.\n  I begin by thanking Senator Shelby for his diligence throughout this \nprocess. I also acknowledge the hard work his staff has put in \nnegotiating this important bill, along with my own staff who have \nworked very hard as well.\n  Americans know they have a responsibility to live within their means \nand to pay what they owe. But they also have a right not to be \ndeceived, misled, or ripped off by unfair and arbitrary practices that \nhave become all too common within the credit card industry. Banning \nthese practices is especially critical today.\n  Since the recession began in December of 2007, 5.1 million jobs have \nbeen lost in our Nation, with almost two-thirds of those losses \noccurring in the last 5 months alone. It is clear the financial crisis \nis hitting American families very hard indeed. But precisely at a time \nwhen our economy is in crisis and consumers are struggling to live \nwithin their means, credit card companies too often are gouging them \nwith hidden fees and sudden interest rate hikes that for many make the \ntask nearly impossible.\n  With the average outstanding credit card debt for households with a \ncredit card now nearly $10,700, credit card companies are making an \nalready difficult economic downturn suffocating for far too many \nmillions of our American citizens.\n  The range of abusive practices is as long as it is appalling: \nretroactive rate increases on existing balances; double-cycle billing \nthat charges interest on balances the consumers have already paid; \ndeceptive marketing to young people; changing the terms of the credit \ncard agreement at any time, for any reason, on any balance; \nskyrocketing penalty interest rates, some as high as 32 percent.\n  My colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, has called this ``trip-\nwire pricing,'' saying the whole business model of the credit card \nindustry is not designed to extend credit but to induce mistakes and \ntrap consumers into debt. I think he is absolutely right, \nunfortunately. This is an industry that has been thriving on misleading \nits consumers and its customers.\n  If you need any evidence of that, just look at how they even hike \ninterest rates on consumers who pay on time and consistently meet the \nterms of their credit card agreements. Take Phil Sherwood of my State, \nwho always paid his bills on time, who had a credit score in the 700s. \nHe is an upstanding member of his community; in fact, a city councilman \nin New Britain, CT. One day recently he received a notice from his \ncredit card company informing him that his interest rate was nearly \ndoubling, and the associated fees on his account were going up as well. \nHe had done nothing wrong, not been late, no changes whatsoever, just \nan arbitrary increase.\n  A recent survey of the country's 12 largest credit card issuers by \nthe Pew Charitable Trust found that Phil Sherwood was not alone. Pew \nreported that 93 percent of surveyed cards allowed the issuer to raise \ninterest rates at any time, for any reason.\n  Between March of 2007 and February of 2008, credit card companies \nraised interest rates on nearly one out of every four accounts, nearly \n70 million cardholders who were charged $10 billion in extra interest \nrates. That is within an 11-month period.\n  That $10 billion is not paying for college tuition; it is not paying \nfor groceries or for safe, affordable shelter in the midst of a housing \ncrisis. It is going straight into the pockets of credit card companies; \nand they are doing it for one reason--because they can.\n  Little wonder that we have seen a tenfold increase in the penalty \nfees customers have been charged in the last decade alone. Even the \nFederal financial regulators who dropped the ball terribly, in my view, \nduring the subprime mortgage crisis have recognized the harm these \nsinister practices pose not only to consumers but also to our economy \nas a whole.\n  Recently, in fact, the Federal Reserve, the Office of Thrift \nSupervision, and the National Credit Union Administration finalized \nrules aimed at curbing some of these practices. These rules are a good \nfirst step. I want to commend them for it. They deserve commendation \nfor having stepped up and proposed these regulations. These rules made \na difference already.\n  But with our economy hanging in the balance, layoffs mounting, and \nconsumers struggling to pay for basic necessities, I think the moment \nis right for more comprehensive reform, despite the good first step of \nthe Federal Reserve and others.\n  I first began waging this fight to reform credit card company \npractices more than 20 years ago. Back then it was difficult to get \nanyone to pay much attention to what was clearly becoming a slippery \nslope toward more abusive and deceptive practices by these card \nissuers. It was a lonely fight in those days.\n  But today we have an American President, President Obama, on our \nside. He recognizes that credit card reform is not incidental to our \neconomic recovery. As he has stated over and over again, it is \nessential to it. He has pledged to get credit card reform ``done in \nshort order'' to quote him exactly, and said this weekend that he wants \nus to send him a bill by Memorial Day.\n  I intend to do everything I can, and I am sure my colleagues will, to \nensure we meet that challenge--not for the President, not for the White \nHouse, but for the consumers and customers out there who are waiting to \nsee whether we will step up on this side of the ledger and do something \non their behalf.\n  We have spent a lot of time in this body, a lot of time over the past \nweeks and months, to help the financial institutions, to stabilize \nthem, to get them on their feet, to get credit flowing again. I believe \nthose decisions, by and large, we have made have been the right ones, \nalthough clearly we could have started earlier.\n  But now it is time to do something for the other side of that ledger; \nthat is, for consumers out there who deserve a break, particularly with \npractices, as I mentioned: 70 million accounts having their rates \nraised in the last year alone, and people such as Phil Sherwood having \nthem raised for no reason whatsoever, solely because the issuer can do \nso.\n  So it is time we do this--not for the President, not for the White \nHouse, not because the President would like it but, more importantly, \nbecause the American consumers deserve it in these times to get the \nhelp they need in this area.\n  So today as the Senate takes up the credit card legislation, we stand \nup for the people in this country who want no more of these practices, \nno more tricking customers into taking on more debt than they agreed \nto, no more taking advantage of financially responsible credit card \nusers, and no more abuse of consumers that goes unpunished.\n  The time has come to insist on consumer protections that are strong \nand reliable, rules that are transparent and fair, and statements that \nare clear and informative. Those principles are the very essence of the \nCredit Card Act.\n  Allow me to take, if I can, just a few minutes to explain how the \nprovisions of this bill will work. First and foremost, this legislation \nprevents unfair and arbitrary increases in interest rates and changes \nin the terms of credit card contracts.\n\n[[Page S5315]]\n\n  Why is this so important? I recently met Kristina Jorgensen, a \ngraphic designer from Southbury, CT. She transferred her student loans \nto a credit card to take advantage of the low ``fixed rate'' offer, \nonly to have the interest rates on that debt increase from 5 percent to \n24 percent.\n  Her monthly payments increased by $260. She had to cash in her \nretirement IRAs to pay off the credit card debt, all because she paid 1 \nday late by phone. Let me repeat that: never in trouble before, saw an \nopportunity to pay off her student loans, she sent out, with that 5-\npercent rate she had because of her good record over the years, and all \nof a sudden, because she is 2 days late--one of them a Sunday, by the \nway, because she paid by phone, not through the mail--her rates went \nfrom 5 percent to 24 percent, thereby crippling her ability, draining \noff that IRA. She did not graduate from college a year or two ago. I \nwill tell you she is far closer to my age than a high school senior or \na college graduate's normal age.\n  So here she is at a point of retirement in her life where her IRA, \nher individual retirement account, now has been drained of a good part \nof its value because her rates went from 5 to 24 percent.\n  What happened to Ms. Jorgensen is wrong. Having one's retirement \nsecurity wiped out is frightening under any circumstances. But it is \npositively terrifying in a recession.\n  Samantha Moore and her husband, a small business operator--Samantha \nis a paralegal from Guilford, CT--experienced a similar situation. She \nhad her credit card interest rate raised from 12 percent to 27 percent. \nWhy? Because she was 3 days late on a credit card payment for the first \ntime in 18 years. She and her husband, who own a small business, saw \ntheir credit card limit drop from $31,000 to just over $4,000--the \ncredit limits from $31,000 to just over $4,000, a small business, 3 \ndays late, first time in 18 years, and they watched the rate jump to 27 \npercent, and their credit limits plummet to a point which pushes that \nbusiness into jeopardy.\n  So I would ask my colleagues: What is a family in this economy \nsupposed to do if they are counting on that credit card to help them \nthrough a medical crisis. That one patently unfair decision could mean \nthe difference between scraping by during a recession and a financial \ncatastrophe.\n  The legislation Senator Shelby and I have put together prevents \ncredit card companies from unjustifiable ``anytime, any reason'' rate \nincreases on existing balances for people such as Samantha and \nKristina.\n  Our bill also prohibits credit card issuers from increasing rates on \na cardholder in the first year after a credit card account is opened \nand requires promotional rates to last at least 6 months.\n  Our bill prohibits issuers from changing the terms governing the \nrepayment of an outstanding balance. For the first time ever we put \nprovisions in place that ensure that risk-based pricing will not always \nwork against the consumer and drive up rates.\n  This legislation says, if your issuer has raised your rate since the \nbeginning of the year, they have to review your account within 6 months \nand bring the rate back down if the review warrants it, thus putting an \nend to the kind of risk-based pricing that always costs the consumer \nmore and never less.\n  Secondly, our bill puts an end to the exorbitant and unnecessary fees \nthat drive families further into debt. Not that long ago, if you were \nover your credit card limit, your card was declined at the store. I am \nold enough to remember when that could happen--it happened to me--that \nawkward moment when you have gone to purchase something, and you are \nstanding in line, and all of a sudden that clerk says, ``I am sorry, \nbut you have been rejected.''\n  That is always an awkward moment, particularly if people are standing \nbehind you in that line, and you take your purchases and sheepishly \nwalk away and put them back on the shelf because you went over your \nlimit.\n  It was not comfortable, but it protected you against going over the \nlimit. In those days you did not have to ask for it, it happened \nautomatically. Well, that has all changed, of course, in recent days. \nIn fact, the issuers enjoy that moment because when you walk up and \npurchase something, despite the fact that you may want a fixed limit, \nat that point you go over, of course, then the penalty fees and other \ncharges pour in. Of course, that becomes a bonanza on additional \npenalties collected.\n  Now, I am not suggesting the consumer does not bear a responsibility. \nBut in the past there was a responsibility exercised on both sides of \nthat equation, a borrower and lender. Here lately, of course, that \nequation has been disrupted. Today we have repeatedly heard about \ncardholders being charged enormous fees for unknowingly going a few \ndollars over their credit limit.\n  Our bill prohibits issuers from charging hidden over-the-limit fees. \nIt says if cardholders want to go over their card limit, they have to \n``opt in'' with their issuer, putting the choice of going over the \ncredit card limit and paying extra fees squarely in the hands of \nconsumers, not the banks.\n  Our bill also requires penalty fees to be reasonable and proportional \nto the violation. Further, our bill prevents companies from charging \nfees for customers making payments by mail, telephone, or \nelectronically, and strengthens protections against excessive fees on \nlow-credit, high-fee credit cards. The days of issuers unreasonably \njacking up these fees to unreasonably high levels to make money on the \nbacks of consumers will be over.\n  Third, our bill protects the rights of financially responsible credit \ncard users. Say last month, for instance, you had a credit card debt of \n$1,000, and since then you have paid $900 of that debt off. It is not \nuncommon for some credit card companies to keep charging interest not \non the remaining $100 of debt but on the full previous $1,000 of debt. \nOur bill puts an end to this so-called ``double-cycle billing,'' and \nsays if the credit card company delayed crediting your payment, you \nwill not be charged for their mistake.\n  Our bill also requires the credit card statement to be mailed 21 days \nbefore the bill is due rather than the current 14. The bill also \nencourages transparency in credit card pricing, requiring the \nGovernment Accountability Office to study the effect that interchange \nfees have on our merchants and consumers.\n  I thank a number of my colleagues who expressed a strong interest in \nthat subject matter. There will be a study done on this issue. It is a \ncomplicated area, the interchange fees, but a lot of retail stores are \ndeeply concerned about these fees, the excessive charges they believe \nexist. They would like to see some changes.\n  I have promised my colleagues who expressed an interest that we will \ntake this up. I believe it is Senator Corker of Tennessee who has \nwritten a stronger study provision than the one we had originally \ncrafted. I thank him. I know he has a strong interest in this subject, \nas do other Members. We will get to the interchange fees at a later \ndate. Certainly, a study would give us a better framework in which to \nconsider legislation.\n  Fourth, our bill provides far better disclosure of card terms and \nconditions. One member of the credit card industry recently told Time \nmagazine, ``The American people cannot manage their credit.'' Well, it \nis not hard to understand why. A quarter of a century ago, a typical \ncredit card contract was about a page in length. Today, it is 30 times \nas long and 100 times more incomprehensible. You practically need a \nmicroscope to read what it says and a law degree to understand what it \nmeans. If this financial crisis has taught us anything, it is that \nconsumers can only make responsible decisions if they have all the \nnecessary information. The American consumer should not have to live in \nfear that a clause buried in the fine print of their credit card \ncontract might someday be their financial undoing.\n  Our legislation also requires credit card issuers to provide far \nbetter disclosure of terms and conditions. The bill says cardholders \nmust be given 45 days' notice of an interest rate increase. The bill \nmandates that issuers disclose to consumers when the card terms have \nchanged, and it forces issuers to disclose how long it will take to pay \noff a card balance if you only make minimum payments, something our \ncolleague from Hawaii, Senator\n\n[[Page S5316]]\n\nDan Akaka, has led the fight for over many years.\n  The bill also requires the Federal Reserve Board to post consumer \ncredit card agreements on its Web site.\n  Fifth, our bill insists on a fair allocation of payments. Many \ncardholders hold multiple credit card balances with multiple interest \nrates. If you send an extra thousand dollars along, for example, with \nyour minimum payment, that amount should be credited to the account \nwith the highest interest rate first. Our legislation ensures that it \nwill be.\n  Our bill also prohibits issuers from setting early-morning deadlines \nfor credit card payments. We all understand that we have to pay our \ncredit card bills on a specific date, but what too many card companies \ndon't tell you is that it isn't just the date the payment is due but \noften a specific time in the day. In too many cases, it is in the \nmorning rather than at the end of business for that day. So, for \nexample, if you pay your bill--call the company or make an online \npayment--before the close of business on the due date, sometimes you \nwill get penalized for a late payment because the credit card deadline, \nunbeknownst to the cardholder, was at 10 a.m. that morning on the due \ndate. This legislation puts a stop to that as well.\n  I should add that for the very first time the Federal Government will \nprovide new protections for recipients of gift cards, and we thank our \ncolleague from New York, Senator Schumer, for his leadership on this \nissue. This legislation will make it easier for recipients of gift \ncards to cash them in. Under the Schumer provision, if you receive a \ngift card, your balance won't disappear before you have a chance to \nspend it.\n  Sixth, this legislation includes robust protections for young people \nand students. Recently, my 7-year-old daughter received a credit card \nsolicitation in the mail. We laughed it off, but it brings up a serious \npoint. Young people--and ultimately their parents--are faced with an \nonslaught of credit card offers, often years before they turn 18, \nusually as soon as they set one foot on a college campus. Just as we \nsaw in the mortgage crisis with lenders and borrowers, too often \nissuers offer cards to young people without verifying any ability to \nrepay whatsoever. This is particularly true for students. According to \nSallie Mae, college students graduate with an average credit card debt \nof more than $4,000. That is up from $2,900 just 4 years ago. Nearly 20 \npercent of college students have credit card balances of over $7,000.\n  Our bill requires issuers soliciting anyone under the age of 21 to \nobtain the signature of a parent or guardian or someone else who will \ntake responsibility for the debt or proof that the applicant, as many \nare capable of doing under the age of 21, has some independent means of \nrepayment. It prohibits increases in credit card limits unless that \nperson who is a cosponsor or is jointly liable approves of the increase \nin writing. Our bill limits the kinds of prescreened offers that get so \nmany young people into trouble.\n  I thank our colleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, for his \nleadership on this issue. It is time to insist that credit card \ncompanies take into account a young person's ability to repay before \nallowing them to take on what is all too often a lifetime worth of \ndebt. Very little we do in our legislation will be more important than \nthese provisions. Many of my colleagues on the Banking Committee \nexpressed a strong interest in these provisions. I don't have the \nstatistics in front of me, but a significantly high percentage of \nstudents drop out of school because of the debt they have incurred. A \nlot of it is credit card debt, not just the student loans but the \ncredit card debt.\n  That is also why the final component of our bill is so critical as \nwell. That involves tougher penalties and enforcement. Credit card \ncompanies need to understand that if they violate the terms of an \nagreement with a cardholder, there will be serious consequences.\n  With this legislation, if your credit card company wrongly raises \nyour rate, the company could pay as much as $5,000 per violation--even \nhigher if the company is found to engage in a pattern or practice of \nviolations. Our goal is not to be punitive, although I can understand \nwhy someone might want to be, given some of the practices that have \ngone on over the last number of years. Rather, we need to put in place \nstrong incentives that will encourage these companies to act more \nresponsibly in the first place.\n  Every one of these provisions I have mentioned is rooted in simple \ncommon sense; no more tricks, no more strings attached. Over and over, \nwe have heard that consumers should act responsibly when it comes to \ncredit cards. I agree completely. We all need to act more responsibly. \nBut it is time the credit card companies were held to that same \nstandard, and with this legislation they will be.\n  I thank Senators Schumer, Akaka, Menendez, Tester, and Kohl on the \ncommittee, who have strongly supported the fight to protect consumers \nagainst predatory credit card practices. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan \nhas been a champion of credit card protections for many years as well \nand generated some important ideas that are included in the bill \nSenator Shelby and I are offering. For decades, their efforts have \nfallen on deaf ears but not this time.\n  Today, with practices so brazen and widespread, as our economy quite \nliterally hangs in the balance, one thing is clear: This is the moment \nfor credit card reform. Our economy will not recover if we allow \npractices such as those I am talking about today that drive so many \nfamilies deeper and deeper into debt. Americans do not deserve and \ncannot afford to be pushed down this economic ladder by credit card \nissuers any longer. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. In my \nview, we will never have a better opportunity to protect consumers than \nwe do today with what we propose.\n  This legislation has been worked on extensively over the last number \nof weeks. We listened to a lot of people, including the issuers, to \nmake sure what we are doing is fair and balanced and gets to the heart \nof the matter; that is, to cut out these excessive increases, without \nwarrant, in rates and fees and penalties that I have mentioned.\n  Forty-six years ago, President John Kennedy delivered his special \nmessage to Congress on protecting consumer interest. In that speech, he \nestablished four very simple rights: the right to safety, the right to \nbe informed, the right to choose, and, above all, the right to be \nheard, to be assured that consumer interests would receive full and \nsympathetic consideration in the formulation of Government policy. I \ncannot think of a single issue or moment where the need to act on \nprinciples articulated nearly half a century ago--and embraced by our \ncurrent President and many in this Chamber of both political parties--\nwas clearer or more urgently needed than those articulated by President \nKennedy more than four decades ago.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, to stand up for \nAmerican families who are already facing tremendous difficulties on a \ndaily basis, with rising costs in energy and health care, the \ndifficulty of holding on to their homes. All of these issues are \nconfronting them. At the very least, having spent as much time as we \nhave on dealing with stabilizing financial institutions, to take out a \nfew days in all of the debate and stabilize American families by \nreducing outrageous and egregious practices that have added so many \nfinancial burdens to them is long overdue.\n  Senator Shelby and I are proud of this substitute. We thank our \ncolleagues who helped us work on it. We look forward to the debate on \namendments that may be offered. Some may strengthen what we have \nsuggested. Others may try to undo it. But we need to have a full and \nopen debate. Then my hope is that, by an overwhelming vote, my \ncolleagues will support this legislation.\n  The House has already acted--I commend them--under the leadership of \nBarney Frank and others on the Financial Services Committee in that \nChamber. Our intention is to follow with this legislation. \nCongresswoman Carolyn Maloney deserves credit, having authored the \nlegislation in the House.\n  We think we have a good bill, a strong bill. We think we have made \nsome improvements on what the House recommended. I look forward to the \ndebate that is forthcoming.\n  Amy Friend and Lynsey Graham, who are sitting here next to me, did a\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\nremarkable job in negotiating, working with other Members, with outside \ninterests, including the issuers and consumer groups, on putting this \nbill together. Charles Yi, as well, worked on this, and Colin McGinnis. \nA lot of people worked on this. But these three--Charles Yi, Lynsey \nGraham, and Amy Friend--did a great job.\n  Our staffs do so much hard work and don't get the credit they deserve \nfor the work they do. I am deeply grateful to them for their tremendous \nleadership as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                75th Birthday of Senator James Jeffords\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, today we celebrate the 75th birthday of \nSenator James Merrill Jeffords of Vermont, who was born in Rutland, VT, \non May 11, 1934.\n  He is the son of Marion Hausman and Olin Jeffords. His father served \nas chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court.\n  Jim Jeffords went to college at Yale University and thereafter got a \nlaw degree from Harvard Law School. He served 3 years of Active Duty in \nthe U.S. Navy and was in the Naval Reserves until he retired as captain \nin 1990.\n  In 1966, he entered the political world and was elected to the \nVermont State Senate. Two years later, he ran for Vermont attorney \ngeneral and was elected to that position. In 1974, he ran for Vermont's \nseat in the U.S. House of Representatives and served for 14 years. In \n1988, Jim Jeffords was elected to the Senate of the United States. He \nwas reelected in 1994 and 2000. In 2006, he retired from public life.\n  Jim Jeffords' mother was a music teacher. Her work had a profound \nimpact on his life. While in Congress, he cofounded the Congressional \nArts Caucus. He also began the Congressional High School Art \nCompetition, a bipartisan program that celebrates the talents of local \nhigh school students in congressional districts all across America. \nThat program still exists and flourishes.\n  Jim Jeffords' work in both the House and the Senate was centered on \neducation, on job training, and on individuals with disabilities, \nculminating in his strong support for the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. He will be long remembered as a champion of education, \nand especially for providing new and rich educational opportunities for \nthose millions of Americans with disabilities who in too many instances \nwere ignored by our schools.\n  Jim Jeffords continued a long Vermont tradition, in the footsteps of \nhis predecessors Senator Robert Stafford and Senator George Aiken, of \nserving on the Environment and Public Works Committee. When he assumed \nthe chair of that committee, he provided early and courageous \nleadership on an emergent problem, which today we recognize as the \ncentral environmental issue of our time: global warming.\n  Early on, Jim Jeffords recognized that the buildup of greenhouse \ngases would change the climate of our entire planet. He said about it:\n\n       The climate is warming, it is due to human activity, and \n     only a change in human behavior will ensure that my grandson, \n     Patton Henry Jeffords, will not suffer the consequences.\n\n  But he not only recognized the problem, he set about finding a \nsolution, drafting far-reaching cap-and-trade legislation which even \ntoday represents the single most important Federal route to reducing \ngreenhouse gases and to lessening and hopefully reversing global \nwarming. As we consider cap-and-trade legislation in this session, we \nwill be continuing the work Jim Jeffords helped begin and which his \nforesight set on the national agenda.\n  In 2001, Jim Jeffords, in a move of great courage, left the \nRepublican Party and became an Independent. This action changed control \nof the Senate, won widespread support in Vermont, and thrust this \nnormally reserved and quiet man into the national spotlight.\n  On October 1, 2002, Jim Jeffords was 1 of 23 Senators to vote against \nauthorizing the use of military force in Iraq.\n  I, personally, have known Jim Jeffords for 37 years, and I can attest \nto the warmth and affection with which he is held to this day in the \nState of Vermont. Unassuming, straightforward, and honest, he is \nrespected not only by those who agreed with his views but by those who \ndisagreed. His service has been a beacon of Vermont independence and \nvision, and so I join the rest of my fellow citizens in Vermont and the \nSenators in this body in wishing Jim a very happy 75th birthday.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I understand there is a unanimous consent \nagreement that needs to be propounded, and I yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Requests--H.R. 131\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of my colleague \nfrom Michigan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 131, the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act. \nI ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, as a counter to that proposal, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 49, H.R. 131, the Reagan Commission bill; \nthat a Feingold amendment, which is at the desk--the text of S. 564, \nthe Wartime Treaty Study Act--be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed; and the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I would note that the objection I \nregistered was on behalf of Senator Feingold, and I wish the Record to \nreflect that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will so reflect.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am here today to strongly support the \nDodd-Shelby substitute to the House bill on credit card reform. Before \nI proceed with my statement, I wish to say how appreciative I am, and \nthe country will be, for the efforts of Chris Dodd and Senator Shelby. \nThis has been an effort on the part of Senator Dodd which has been \nongoing for a long time. It is a very difficult, complex effort that he \nhas taken under his wing and mastered. When we can get this passed--and \nhopefully we will by the end of May, as the President has requested--\nthere will be a very strong feeling across this country that, \nhallelujah, the Congress has finally acted to correct some of the \nabuses which have cost our consumers so many hundreds of billions of \ndollars in unfair charges by some credit card companies.\n  Millions of Americans today are facing the worst economic crisis of \ntheir lifetime. Their hardship is being compounded by unfair credit \ncard fees and interest charges. It is long past time for us to do \nsomething about it. The Credit Cart Accountability, Responsibility, and \nDisclosure Act of 2009, which is 414, introduced earlier this year by \nSenator Dodd, myself, and a number of our colleagues to combat credit \ncard abuses, is the best chance we have to do just that. With this \nsubstitute, we are going to be able, I believe, on a bipartisan basis, \nwith hopefully enough support in the Senate, to accomplish our goal.\n  With home prices falling and unemployment rising, millions of \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S5318]]\n\nwho are still managing to pay their credit card bills on time have \nnonetheless been subjected to hiked interest rates. They have been hit \nwith a double whammy--hard economic times and abusive credit card \ninterest rates and fees. It is simply wrong for America's banking \ngiants to try to dig themselves out of the hole they put themselves in \nby putting American families into a deeper hole with fees and sky-high \ninterest charges that are often retroactively applied. Even as the \nprime rate of interest has gone down, some credit card companies have \nhiked interest rates on millions of customers who play by the rules. To \nadd insult to injury, banks that received bailouts are frequently the \nones that are punishing the very taxpayers they came to for financial \nrescue.\n  Credit card companies have used a host of unfair practices. They \nunilaterally hike the interest rates of cardholders who pay on time and \ncomply with the credit card agreements they entered into. They impose \ninterest rates as high as 32 percent, and they apply higher interest \nrates retroactively to existing credit card debt. They pile on \nexcessive fees and then charge interest on those fees, and they engage \nin a number of other unfair practices that are burying American \nconsumers in a mountain of debt.\n  I have received thousands of letters from people who have been \ntreated unfairly by their credit card companies and feel they are \npowerless to do anything about it. The letters come from people from \nall over the country, from all walks of life; letter after letter, each \nmore poignant than the next.\n  The President has also heard those voices. He has made clear his \nsupport for ending abusive practices which cause so much pain and \nfinancial damage to American families, and he has called on Congress to \nsend him a bill by the end of this month.\n  We can and we should meet that deadline. The House has acted. Their \nversion of this bill passed the House on April 30 by a vote of 357 to \n70, garnering support from a majority from both parties. A similar vote \nin the Senate on the CARD Act will send a strong message that standing \nup for the American taxpayer and consumer is a bipartisan priority.\n  Under this bill, card issuers will no longer be able to engage in the \nabusive business practice of first extending credit at one interest \nrate, and then unilaterally jacking up the interest rate after the \nmoney is owing. Our bill doesn't restrict fair lending; it only affects \ncredit card companies that engage in irresponsible lending practices \nthat bury people unfairly in debt, the sort of debt that the companies \noften don't even expect to fully recover, but profit from nonetheless, \nthrough the extraction of fees and interest.\n  Some argue that it is the role of regulators, not Congress, to combat \nunfair lending practices. But for years Federal regulators have not \ntaken up that task. Instead, they stood largely by silently while \ndeceptive and unfair practices became entrenched in the credit card \nindustry. The Federal Reserve, in particular, charged with issuing \ncredit card regulations, failed to take action until congressional \nhearings and public outrage forced attention on credit card abusers.\n  Six months ago, the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators finally \nacted, issuing a regulation last December to stop some of the unfair \npractices. For example, the new regulation prohibits banks from \nretroactively raising interest rates on cardholders who meet their \nobligations, requires banks to mail credit card bills at least 21 days \nbefore the payment due date, and forces banks to more fairly apply \nconsumer payments.\n  But the regulation, regrettably, leaves in place blatantly unfair \ncredit card practices that mire families in debt. It fails to stop, for \nexample, abuses such as charging interest on debt that was paid on \ntime, charging people a fee simply to pay their bills, and hiking \ninterest rates on a credit card because of a misstep on another \nunrelated debt, a practice known as universal default. It doesn't stop \nthe charging of interest on fees. Legislation is needed not only to end \nthose abusive practices that are not prohibited by the Federal Reserve \nregulation, but also to provide a statutory foundation for the new \ncredit card regulation so that it cannot be weakened or withdrawn in \nthe future.\n  The Dodd-Levin bill, as introduced, banned each of these unfair \npractices that were still allowed by the Federal Reserve rules. The \nsubstitute introduced today would not go as far as the Dodd-Levin bill, \nbut offers a good compromise with strong consumer protections that \nought to attract widespread support in the Senate. The substitute \nremains stronger, for example, than both the Federal Reserve credit \ncard regulations and the House credit card bill in a number of ways. \nFor example, it would prohibit retroactive interest hikes for \ncardholders who pay their bills on time and would allow them only for \nthose who pay more than 60 days late. Even then, if would require banks \nto restore a lower interest rate for persons who had paid 60 days late \nbut then made 6 months of on-time payments. The bill would also \nprohibit interest charges for debt that is paid on time, a key consumer \nprotection for which I have been fighting for years. In addition, the \nbill would put its consumer protections in place 9 months from now \ninstead of the longer regulatory deadline of July 2010 or the 1-year \ndelay in the House bill.\n  The bill, of course, will not only help protect consumers and ensure \ntheir fair treatment, but it will also make certain that credit card \ncompanies that are willing to do the right thing are not put at a \ncompetitive disadvantage by companies continuing unfair practices.\n  In 2006, Americans used 700 million credit cards to buy about $2 \ntrillion in goods and services. The average family has five credit \ncards. Credit cards are being used to pay for groceries, mortgage \npayments, and even taxes. And they are saddling U.S. consumers, from \ncollege students to seniors, with a mountain of debt. The latest \nfigures show that U.S. credit card debt is now approaching a trillion \ndollars. Credit cardholders are routinely being subjected to unfair \npractices that squeeze them for ever more money, sinking them further \nand further into debt.\n  I strongly commend Senator Dodd, chairman of the Banking Committee, \nfor taking action to move our credit card bill through the committee, \ndespite some opposition. I also commend Senator Shelby for joining him \nin this substitute. Now is the time for the full Senate to act so that \nwe can then resolve any differences with the House, and send the bill \nto President Obama, who has said he is ready to sign credit card \nlegislation.\n  For years now, we have been combating abusive credit card practices \non our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. The \nsubcommittee held two investigative hearings in 2007, exposing those \npractices. I introduced legislation that same year, S. 1395, the Stop \nUnfair Credit Practices in Credit Cards Act. I am pleased that at that \ntime we had so many cosponsors, including Senators McCaskill, Leahy, \nDurbin, Bingaman, Cantwell, Whitehouse, Kohl, Brown, Kennedy, and \nSanders. We followed that by introducing the Dodd-Levin bill in this \nCongress. It incorporated much of the previous Senate bill that I \nreferred to, and it added other important protections as well. The \nDodd-Levin bill then provided the foundation for the Dodd-Shelby \nsubstitute.\n  Senator Dodd already outlined most of the important provisions in the \nCARD Act. I want to highlight three provisions that I believe are \ncritical to delivering relief to American families and returning common \nsense to the credit card business.\n  First, the bill will prohibit interest charges on any portion of a \ncredit card debt which the cardholder paid on time during a grace \nperiod. Virtually all credit cards provide a grace period, so called, \nin which a credit card debt can be repaid without incurring interest \ncharges. But what most people don't realize is that the credit card \nindustry restricts this grace period to people who pay off their entire \nbalance in full. If a cardholder repays only part of the balance during \nthe grace period, even though it is more than the minimum amount, the \nissuer charges interest on the entire balance--even the portion that \nwas repaid on time.\n  If I charge $5,000 in a month and pay off $2,500 by the due date--\nagain, an amount far more than the minimum payment required--I will \nstill be charged interest on the full $5,000 balance, starting with the \nfirst day of the\n\n[[Page S5319]]\n\nbilling period. That policy is unfair, counterintuitive, and it is \nunknown to a vast majority of cardholders who pay the added interest. \nThe CARD Act will return a commonsense interpretation of the grace \nperiod and simply prohibit the charging of interest on debt that is \npaid on time.\n  Another key provision would limit the circumstances under which a \ncredit card company can hike the interest rate applicable to a \ncardholder's existing debt. Right now, credit cards are the only type \nof loan I know of whose terms can be unilaterally changed after the \nloan is incurred. Even in the toughest market conditions, for example, \ncar companies cannot increase the interest rate on a car loan, even if \na borrower pays late. The credit card companies can unilaterally hike a \ncardholder's interest rate at any time, for just about any reason, or \nno reason at all. This patently unfair practice violates accepted \npractice in the lending field outside of credit cards, and the bill \nwill put an end to that. The substitute will ban retroactive rate hikes \nfor existing balances except in limited circumstances, the most \nimportant of which is that it would ban such interest hikes for \ncardholders who pay on time and would allow them only for cardholders \nwho pay more than 60 days late. Even then, it will require banks to \nrestore the prior lower rate if the cardholder follows with 6 months of \non-time payments. While our Dodd-Levin bill would have gone even \nfurther and banned retroactive rate hikes, period, the substitute \noffers a reasonable compromise that will provide greater protection in \nthis area than the Federal Reserve regulation, or the House bill, both \nof which would allow retroactive interest rate hikes if a person paid \nmore than 30 days late.\n  Finally, while the substitute before us does not go as far as our \nDodd-Levin bill did to prohibit universal default, the substitute does \nplace important limits on how card companies can raise rates when \ncardholders have met their obligations and pay their credit card bills \non time. Right now, credit card companies can unilaterally hike a \ncardholder's interest rate if the company receives information \nindicating that the cardholder is an increased risk of not paying his \nor her debts, even if the cardholder has a years-long record of on-time \npayments and has never paid a bill late to that company. The companies \ncan apply the new higher rate to the cardholder's existing debt, as \nwell as future debt.\n  The substitute would put an end to that practice as it applies to \nexisting balances. It provides that if a cardholder meets the \nobligation of the card agreement by paying on time and staying under \nthe credit limit, the credit card company must hold its end of the \nbargain and honor the terms of the agreement. In other words, it cannot \nraise the interest rate applicable to the cardholder's existing debt. \nThe substitute would, however, allow the credit card company to \nincrease the interest rate applicable to future debt--meaning debt not \nyet incurred. In addition, under the substitute, if a card company \nincreased an interest rate on a cardholder because of credit risk, or \nmarket condition, the company would be required to review the increase \nafter 6 months and reverse it if conditions warrant. While my \npreference would be to prohibit unilateral rate increases entirely, the \ncompromise is a significant improvement over current law. It would ban \nunilateral interest rate hikes on existing debt for consumers who play \nby the rules.\n  To understand why these protections are needed, here are some \nexamples of the credit card abuses we uncovered and some of the stories \nthat American consumers shared with us during the course of the \ninquiries carried out by my Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  The first case history we examined illustrates the fact that major \ncredit card issuers today impose a host of fees on their cardholders, \nincluding late fees and over-the-limit fees that are not only \nsubstantial in themselves but can contribute to years of debt for \nfamilies unable to immediately pay them.\n  Wesley Wannemacher of Lima, OH, testified at our March 2007 hearing. \nIn 2001 and 2002, Mr. Wannemacher used a new credit card to pay for \nexpenses mostly related to his wedding. He charged a total of about \n$3,200, which exceeded the card's credit limit by $200. He spent the \nnext 6 years trying to pay off the debt, averaging payments of about \n$1,000 per year. As of February 2007, he had paid about $6,300 on his \n$3,200 debt, but his billing statement showed he still owed $4,400.\n  How is it possible that a man pays $6,300 on a $3,200 credit card \ndebt, but still owes $4,400? Here's how. On top of the $3,200 debt, Mr. \nWannemacher was charged by the credit card issuer about $1,100 in late \nfees, $1,500 in over-the-limit fees, and about $4,900 in interest. He \nwas hit 47 times with over-limit fees, even though he went over the \nlimit only 3 times and exceeded the limit by only $200. Altogether, \nthese fees and the interest charges added up to $7,500, which, on top \nof the original $3,200 credit card debt, produced total charges to him \nof $10,700.\n  In other words, the interest charges and fees more than tripled the \noriginal $3,200 credit card debt, despite payments by the cardholder \naveraging $1,000 per year. Unfair? Clearly, but our investigation has \nshown that exhorbitant interest charges and fees are not uncommon in \nthe credit card industry.\n  The week before our March hearing, his credit card company decided to \nforgive the remaining debt on the Wannemacher account, and while that \nwas great news for the Wannemacher family, that decision didn't begin \nto resolve the problem of excessive credit card fees and sky-high \ninterest rates that trap too many hard-working families in a downward \nspiral of debt.\n  These high fees are made worse by the industry-wide practice of \nincluding fees in a consumer's outstanding balance in a manner that \nwould also incur interest charges. Those interest charges magnify the \ncost of the fees and can quickly drive a family's credit card debt far \nbeyond the cost of their initial purchases. It is one thing for a bank \nto charge interest on funds lent to a consumer; charging interest on \npenalty fees goes too far.\n  Another troubling case history involves Charles McClune, a 51-year-\nold Michigan resident who is married with one child. Mr. McClune had a \ncredit card account which he closed in 1998, and has been trying to pay \noff for more than 10 years. Due to excessive fees and interest rates, \nand despite paying more than four times his original credit card debt \nof less than $4,000, Mr. McClune still owes thousands on his credit \ncard, with no end in sight.\n  Mr. McClune first opened his credit card account while in college, in \n1986, through a student-targeted credit promotion at a Michigan bank. \nAfter leaving college, the credit limit on his card was increased to \n$4,000. By 1993, although he had not exceeded the credit limit through \npurchases, Mr. McClune had missed some payments and was assessed \ninterest and fees that pushed his balance over the $4,000 limit. From \n1993 to 1996, he exceeded his limit again, on several occasions, due to \ninterest and fee charges. He stopped making purchases on the credit \ncard in 1995.\n  In 1996, Mr. McClune's credit card account was purchased by Chase \nBank. In 1998, Mr. McClune asked Chase to close the account, and Chase \ndid so. Although he never made a single purchase on his credit card \nwhile the account was with Chase, Chase repeatedly increased the \ninterest rate on his account, including after the account was closed. \nIn 2002, for example, his interest rate was about 21 percent; by \nOctober 2005, it had climbed to 29.99 percent where it remained for \nmore than two years until March 2008; it then dropped slightly to 29.24 \npercent. The higher interest rates were applied retroactively to Mr. \nMcClune's closed account balance, increasing the size of his minimum \npayments and his overall debt.\n  Chase also assessed Mr. McClune repeated over-the-limit and late \nfees, which began at $29 and increased over time to $39 per fee. Chase \ncannot locate statements for Mr. McClune's account prior to February \n2001, so there is no record of all the fees he has paid. The records in \nexistence show that, since February 2001, he has paid 64 over-the-limit \nfees totaling $2,200. Those fees stopped after the March 2007 hearing \nbefore my subcommittee, in which Chase promised to stop charging more \nthan three over-the-limit fees for a single violation of a credit card \nlimit. In addition to the 64 over-the-limit fees, since February 2001, \nChase has charged Mr. McClune nearly $2,000 in late fees.\n\n  The records also show that since 2001, Mr. McClune was contacted on \nseveral\n\n[[Page S5320]]\n\noccasions by Chase representatives seeking payment on his account. If \nhe agreed to make a payment over the telephone, Chase charged him--\nwithout notifying him at the time--a fee of $12 to $15 per telephone \npayment. When asked about these fees, Chase told the subcommittee that \nthe fees were imposed, because on each occasion Mr. McClune had spoken \nwith a ``live advisor.'' Since 2001, he has paid a total of $160 in \nthese pay-to-pay fees.\n  Altogether, since 2001, Mr. McClune has paid nearly $4,400 in fees on \na debt of less than $4,000. If the more than 4 years of missing credit \ncard bills were available from 1996 to 2000, this fee total would be \neven higher. In addition, each fee was added to Mr. McClune's \noutstanding credit card balance, and Chase charged him interest on the \nfee amounts, thereby increasing his debt by thousands of additional \ndollars.\n  In February 2001, Chase records show that Mr. McClune's credit card \ndebt totaled nearly $5,200. For the next 7 years, although he did not \npay every month, Mr. McClune paid nearly $2,000 per year toward his \ncredit card debt, but was unable to pay it off. At one time, he paid \n$150 every 2 weeks for several weeks. Those payments did not bring his \ndebt under the $4,000 credit limit, or reduce his interest rate.\n  In January 2007, Mr. McClune received a letter from Chase stating \nthat if he made his next payment on time, he would receive a $50 credit \non his debt. Mr. McClune cashed out his IRA and paid $4,000 on his \ncredit card debt. Because he made this payment in February, however, he \ndid not receive the $50 credit for an on-time payment. Instead, he was \nassessed a $39 late fee, a $39 over-the-limit fee, and a $14.95 payment \nfee for making the $4,000 payment over the telephone.\n  Mr. McClune was never offered a payment plan or a reduced interest \nrate by Chase to help him pay down his debt. His credit card bills show \nthat from February 2001 to June 2008, he paid Chase a total of $15,800. \nIf the 4 years of missing credit card bills from 1996 to 2000 were \navailable, his total payments would likely exceed $20,000. In June \n2008, his credit card bill showed he was charged 29 percent interest \nand a $39 late fee on a balance of $3,300.\n  How could Mr. McClune pay $15,000 to $20,000 on credit card purchases \nof less than $4,000, and still owe $3,300? His credit card statements \nsince 2001 show that he was socked with over $9,700 in interest \ncharges, $2,200 in over-the-limit fees, $2,000 in late fees, and $160 \nin pay-to-pay fees. All of these interest charges and fees were \nassessed by Chase while the account was closed and without a single \npurchase having been made since 1995. Despite his lack of purchases and \npayments totaling $15,800, Chase records show that, from February 2001 \nuntil June 2008, Mr. McClune was able to reduce his credit card balance \nby only about $1,850.\n  Mr. McClune is not trying to avoid his debt. He has made years of \npayments on a closed credit card account that he has not used to make a \npurchase in 13 years. He has paid thousands and thousands of dollars--\nfour and possibly five times what he originally owed--in an attempt to \npay off his credit card account. He is still paying. But his thousands \nof dollars in payments are not enough for his credit card issuer which \nis squeezing him for every cent it can, fair or not, for years on end.\n\n  Tragically, Mr. McClune and Mr. Wannemacher have a lot of company in \ntheir credit card experiences. The many case histories investigated by \nmy subcommittee show that responsible cardholders across the country \nare being squeezed by unfair credit card lending practices involving \nexcessive fee and interest charges. The current regulatory regime--even \nwith the new Federal Reserve regulation--is insufficient to prevent \nthese ongoing credit card abuses. Legislation is clearly needed.\n  Another galling practice featured in our hearings involves the fact \nthat credit card debt that is paid on time routinely accrues interest \ncharges, and credit card bills that are paid on time and in full are \nroutinely inflated with what I call ``trailing interest.'' Every single \ncredit card issuer contacted by the Subcommittee engaged in both of \nthese unfair practices which squeeze additional interest charges from \nresponsible cardholders.\n  Here's how it works. Suppose a consumer who usually pays his account \nin full, and owes no money on December 1st, makes a lot of purchases in \nDecember, and gets a January 1 credit card bill for $5,020. That bill \nis due January 15. Suppose the consumer pays that bill on time, but \npays $5,000 instead of the full amount owed. What do you think the \nconsumer owes on the next bill?\n  If you thought the bill would be the $20 past due plus interest on \nthe $20, you would be wrong. In fact, under industry practice today, \nthe bill would likely be twice as much. That is because the consumer \nwould have to pay interest, not just on the $20 that wasn't paid on \ntime, but also on the $5,000 that was paid on time. In other words, the \nconsumer would have to pay interest on the entire $5,020 from the first \nday of the new billing month, January 1, until the day the bill was \npaid on January 15, compounded daily. So much for a grace period! In \naddition, the consumer would have to pay the $20 past due, plus \ninterest on the $20 from January 15 to January 31, again compounded \ndaily. In this example, using an interest rate of 17.99 percent, which \nis the interest rate charged to Mr. Wannamacher, the $20 debt would, in \n1 month, rack up $35 in interest charges and balloon into a debt of \n$55.21.\n  You might ask--hold on--why does the consumer have to pay any \ninterest at all on the $5,000 that was paid on time? Why does anyone \nhave to pay interest on the portion of a debt that was paid by the date \nspecified in the bill--in other words, on time? The answer is, because \nthat's how the credit card industry has operated for years, and they \nhave gotten away with it.\n  There is more. You might think that once the consumer gets gouged in \nFebruary, paying $55.21 on a $20 debt, and pays that bill on time and \nin full, without making any new purchases, that would be the end of it. \nBut you would be wrong again. It is not over.\n  Even though, on February 15, the consumer paid the February bill in \nfull and on time--all $55.21--the next bill has an additional interest \ncharge on it, for what we call ``trailing interest.'' In this case, the \ntrailing interest is the interest that accumulated on the $55.21 from \nFebruary 1 to 15, which is the time period from the day when the bill \nwas sent to the day when it was paid. The total is 38 cents. While some \nissuers will waive trailing interest if the next month's bill is less \nthan $1, if a consumer makes a new purchase, a common industry practice \nis to fold the 38 cents into the end-of-month bill reflecting the new \npurchase.\n  Now 38 cents isn't much in the big scheme of things. That may be why \nmany consumers don't notice these types of extra interest charges or \ntry to fight them. Even if someone had questions about the amount of \ninterest on a bill, most consumers would be hard pressed to understand \nhow the amount was calculated, much less whether it was incorrect. But \nby nickel and diming tens of millions of consumer accounts, credit card \nissuers reap large profits. I think it is indefensible to make \nconsumers pay interest on debt which they pay on time. It is also just \nplain wrong to charge trailing interest when a bill is paid on time and \nin full.\n  My subcommittee's hearings also focused on another set of unfair \ncredit card practices involving fair interest rate increases. \nCardholders who had years-long records of paying their credit card \nbills on time, staying below their credit limits, and paying at least \nthe minimum amount due, were nevertheless socked with substantial \ninterest rate increases. Some saw their credit card interest rates \ndouble or even triple. At the hearing, three consumers described this \nexperience.\n  Janet Hard of Freeland, MI, had accrued over $8,000 in debt on her \nDiscover card. Although she made payments on time and paid at least the \nminimum due for over 2 years, Discover increased her interest rate from \n18 percent to 24 percent in 2006. At the same time, Discover applied \nthe 24 percent rate retroactively to her existing credit card debt, \nincreasing her minimum payments and increasing the amount that went to \nfinance charges instead of the principal debt. The result was that, \ndespite making steady payments totaling $2,400 in 12 months and keeping \nher purchases to less than $100 during that same year, Janet Hard's \ncredit card debt went down by only $350. Sky-high interest charges,\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\ninexplicably increased and unfairly applied, ate up most of her \npayments.\n  Millard Glasshof of Milwaukee, WI, a retired senior citizen on a \nfixed income, incurred a debt of about $5,000 on his Chase credit card, \nclosed the account, and faithfully paid down his debt with a regular \nmonthly payment of $119 for years. In December 2006, Chase increased \nhis interest rate from 15 percent to 17 percent and in February 2007, \nhiked it again to 27 percent. Retroactive application of the 27 percent \nrate to Mr. Glasshof's existing debt meant that, out of his $119 \npayment, about $114 went to pay finance charges and only $5 went to \nreducing his principal debt. Despite his making payments totaling \n$1,300 over 12 months, Mr. Glasshof found that, due to high interest \nrates and excessive fees, his credit card debt did not go down at all. \nLater, after the subcommittee asked about his account, Chase suddenly \nlowered the interest rate to 6 percent. That meant, over a 1-year \nperiod, Chase had applied four different interest rates to his closed \ncredit card account: 15 percent, 17 percent, 27 percent and 6 percent, \nwhich shows how arbitrary those rates are.\n\n  Then there is Bonnie Rushing of Naples, FL. For years, she had paid \nher Bank of America credit card on time, providing at least the minimum \namount specified on her bills. Despite her record of on-time payments, \nin 2007, Bank of America nearly tripled her interest rate from 8 to 23 \npercent. The Bank said that it took this sudden action because Ms. \nRushing's credit score had dropped. When we looked into why it had \ndropped, it was apparently because she had taken out Macy's and J. Jill \ncredit cards to get discounts on purchases. Despite paying both bills \non time and in full, the automated credit scoring system run by the \nFair Issac Corporation had lowered her credit rating, and Bank of \nAmerica had followed suit by raising her interest rate by a factor of \nthree. Ms. Rushing closed her account and complained to the Florida \nattorney general, my Subcommittee, and her card sponsor, the American \nAutomobile Association. Bank of America eventually restored the 8 \npercent rate on her closed account.\n  In addition to these three consumers who testified at the hearing, \nthe Subcommittee presented case histories for five other consumers who \nexperienced substantial interest rate increases despite complying with \ntheir credit card agreements.\n  I would also like to note that, in each of these cases, the credit \ncard issuer told our Subcommittee that the cardholder had been given a \nchance to opt out of the increased interest rate by closing their \naccount and paying off their debt at the prior rate. But each of these \ncardholders denied receiving an opt-out notice, and when several tried \nto close their account and pay their debt at the prior rate, they were \ntold they had missed the opt-out deadline and had no choice but to pay \nthe higher rate. Our subcommittee examined copies of the opt-out \nnotices that the companies claimed to have sent, and found that some \nwere filled with legal jargon, were hard to understand, and contained \nprocedures that were hard to follow. When we asked the major credit \ncard issuers what percentage of persons offered an opt-out actually \ntook it, they told the Subcommittee that 90 percent did not opt out of \nthe higher interest rate--a percentage that is contrary to all logic \nand strong evidence that current opt-out procedures do not provide fair \nnotice.\n  The case histories presented at our hearings illustrate only a small \nportion of the abusive credit card practices going on today. Since \nearly 2007, our subcommittee has received letters and emails from \nthousands of credit cardholders describing sometimes unbelievable \ncredit card practices and asking for help to stop it. These are more \ncomplaints than I have received in any other investigation that we have \nconducted in that subcommittee, or an earlier subcommittee which I \nchaired, in more than 30 years now in Congress. The complaints stretch \nacross all income levels, all ages, and all areas of the country.\n  The bottom line is that these abuses have gone on for far too long. \nIn fact, these practices have been around for so many years that they \nhave, in many cases, become the industry norm. Our investigations have \nshown that many of the practices are too entrenched, too profitable, \nand too immune to consumer pressures for us to have confidence that the \ncompanies will change them on their own. For these reasons, I hope our \ncolleagues will pass the substitute before us. It is time to return \ncommon sense, responsibility, and fairness to the credit card industry.\n  With thanks and gratitude to the leaders in the Banking Committee, \nSenators Dodd and Shelby, for the initiative they have taken and the \ncourage they are showing in taking on some very difficult and \nentrenched practices.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am proud to once again have joined my \nfriend, Senator Ensign, in introducing legislation that is good for \nNevada and will help create jobs and contribute to rebuilding Nevada's \neconomy.\n  The Federal Government owns 87 percent of Nevada's land. Nevada reaps \ntremendous benefits from this land--we have some of the most scenic \nareas and clearest skies in the country. This land is also blessed with \nsome of the most valuable clean energy resources America has to offer--\nthese resources alone could power the entire Nation with the right \ninvestments in our transmission grid.\n  I could not be prouder that President Obama and Secretary Salazar are \ncommitted to using our public lands to develop solar, wind, geothermal \nand biomass energy resources, and without harming sensitive areas. A \nweek ago Saturday, Secretary Salazar came to Nevada to announce over \n$26 million in Recovery funding for Nevada--a large portion for \nexpediting renewable energy projects on BLM land. This commitment is \ninvaluable to Nevada's future as the Nation's leader in clean renewable \nenergy.\n  To continue helping this very effort and to ensure that solar and \nwind projects on Federal land provide maximum value to the State, \nSenator Ensign and I have introduced the Renewable Energy Permitting \nAct, REPA. This legislation is very similar to provisions I included in \nthe Clean Renewable Energy and Economic Development Act, S. 539, that I \nintroduced in March of this year.\n  REPA will help solar and wind projects receive BLM approval more \nquickly so these projects can begin generating clean energy and \ncreating jobs sooner, rather than later and sustainable economic \ndevelopment opportunities\n  It will also set aside a portion of the rental fees that are \ncollected by the Government for the use of Federal lands by providing \n50 percent of these revenues to the State and 25 percent to the county \nin which a project is located. Additionally, 20 percent will be placed \ninto a renewable energy permit processing improvement fund for Nevada, \nWyoming, Arizona, and California. The last 5 percent will be \nresponsibly set aside to augment the restoration and reclamation that \nwill be needed if and when these facilities are removed from our public \nlands. Portions of this money will also be available to acquire and \nprotect other sensitive lands. This is an important step since, during \nthe operation of these beneficial renewable energy facilities, the \nAmerican people will lose access to hundreds of thousands of acres of \nincredible open space and wildlife habitat.\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\n  Our goal, is to do this right from the beginning. That means \nresponsibly developing our vast renewable energy resources and to give \nStates and communities new economic development opportunities that will \ncreate sustainable growth and grow the clean energy industry locally.\n  Senator Ensign and I have a long history of working together to \novercome the challenges Nevada faces because of the significant \npresence of Federal land in our State. Our efforts have made those \nlands work for Nevadans from all walks of life.\n  I look forward to continuing these efforts with my friend Senator \nEnsign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5322-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5322-S5324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SILVER STAR RECIPIENTS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, on Thursday I was privileged to host a \nbipartisan lunch of the Senate Democratic and Republican policy \ncommittees, in honor of a team of Green Berets who earned the Silver \nStar for extraordinary bravery in combat operations in Afghanistan. \nThese are true American heroes, and their actions were in the proudest \ntraditions of our Armed Forces in general, and of our Special \nOperations forces in particular.\n  On April 6, 2008, this team's mission was to capture or kill several \nvery high-ranking members of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, HIG, militant \ngroup. The insurgents were in their stronghold, a village perched in \nNuristan's Shok Valley that is normally accessible only by pack mule.\n  During a harrowing, nearly 7-hour battle on a mountainside, this team \nand a few dozen Afghan commandos they had trained took fire from all \ndirections. Outnumbered, the Green Berets fought on even after half of \nthem were wounded--and managed to kill an estimated 150 to 200 enemy \nfighters.\n  For their heroism in battle, 10 members of Operational Detachment \nAlpha 3336 from the 3rd Special Forces Group received the Silver Star, \none of the highest awards for valor in the U.S. Military. This was the \nhighest number of such awards for a single engagement since the Vietnam \nwar.\n  The men who earned these Silver Stars were CPT Kyle Walton, SFC Scott \nFord, SSG Luis Morales, SSG Seth Howard, SSG Ronald Shurer, SSG John \nWalding, SSG Dillon Behr, SGT David Sanders, SGT Matthew Williams, and \nSPC Michael Carter.\n  I will ask to have printed in the Record a copy of their Silver Star \ncitations. I will also ask to have printed in the Record a copy of a \nWashington Post report describing the battle on that Afghan \nmountainside.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, it was our privilege to honor \nthese heroic Green Berets, who were joined at the lunch by SSG Robert \nGutierrez, Jr., an Air Force special tactics combat controller who \ntargeted airstrikes during the mission. For his actions, he was awarded \nthe Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' device for valor.\n  No words can truly express the depth of our gratitude to these men \nand all the other members of our Armed Forces who have answered their \ncountry's call.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the materials to \nwhich I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Dec. 12, 2008]\n\n        10 Green Berets To Receive Silver Star for Afghan Battle\n\n                          (By Ann Scott Tyson)\n\n       After jumping out of helicopters at daybreak onto jagged, \n     ice-covered rocks and into water at an altitude of 10,000 \n     feet, the 12-man Special Forces team scrambled up the steep \n     mountainside toward its target--an insurgent stronghold in \n     northeast Afghanistan.\n       ``Our plan,'' Capt. Kyle M. Walton recalled in an \n     interview, ``was to fight downhill.''\n       But as the soldiers maneuvered toward a cluster of thick-\n     walled mud buildings constructed layer upon layer about 1,000 \n     feet farther up the mountain, insurgents quickly manned \n     fighting positions, readying a barrage of fire for the \n     exposed Green Berets.\n       A harrowing, nearly seven-hour battle unfolded on that \n     mountainside in Afghanistan's Nuristan province on April 6, \n     as Walton, his team and a few dozen Afghan commandos they had \n     trained took fire from all directions. Outnumbered, the Green \n     Berets fought on even after half of them were wounded--four \n     critically--and managed to subdue an estimated 150 to 200 \n     insurgents, according to interviews with several team members \n     and official citations.\n       Today, Walton and nine of his teammates from Operational \n     Detachment Alpha 3336 of the 3rd Special Forces Group will \n     receive the Silver Star for their heroism in that battle--the \n     highest number of such awards given to the elite troops for a \n     single engagement since the Vietnam War.\n       That chilly morning, Walton's mind was on his team's \n     mission: to capture or kill several members of the Hezb-e-\n     Islami Gulbuddin (HIG) militant group in their stronghold, a \n     village perched in Nuristan's Shok Valley that was accessible \n     only by pack mule and so remote that Walton said he believed \n     that no U.S. troops, or Soviet ones before them, had ever \n     been there.\n       But as the soldiers, each carrying 60 to 80 pounds of gear, \n     scaled the mountain, they could already spot insurgents \n     running to and fro, they said. As the soldiers drew closer, \n     they saw that many of the mud buildings had holes in the \n     foot-thick walls for snipers. The U.S. troops had maintained \n     an element of surprise until their helicopters turned into \n     the valley, but by now the insurgent leaders entrenched above \n     knew they were the targets, and had alerted their fighters to \n     rally.\n       Staff Sgt. Luis Morales of Fredericksburg was the first to \n     see an armed insurgent and opened fire, killing him. But at \n     that moment, the insurgents began blasting away at the \n     American and Afghan troops with machine guns, sniper rifles \n     and rocket-propelled grenades--shooting down on each of the \n     U.S. positions from virtually all sides.\n       ``All elements were pinned down from extremely heavy fire \n     from the get-go,'' Walton said. ``It was a coordinated \n     attack.'' The insurgent Afghan fighters knew there was only \n     one route up the valley and ``were able to wait until we were \n     in the most vulnerable position to initiate the ambush,'' \n     said Staff Sgt. Seth E. Howard, the team weapons sergeant.\n       Almost immediately, exposed U.S. and Afghan troops were \n     hit. An Afghan interpreter was killed, and Staff Sgt. Dillon \n     Behr was shot in the hip.\n       ``We were pretty much in the open, there were no trees to \n     hide behind,'' said Morales, who with Walton pulled Behr back \n     to their position. Morales cut open Behr's fatigues and \n     applied pressure to his bleeding hip, even though Morales \n     himself had been shot in the right thigh. A minute later, \n     Morales was hit again, in the ankle, leaving him struggling \n     to treat himself and his comrade, he said. Absent any cover, \n     Walton moved the body of the dead Afghan interpreter to \n     shield the wounded.\n       Farther down the hill in the streambed, Master Sgt. Scott \n     Ford, the team sergeant, was firing an M203 grenade launcher \n     at the fighting positions, he recalled. An Afghan commando \n     fired rocket-propelled grenades at the windows from which \n     they were taking fire, while Howard shot rounds from a rocket \n     launcher and recoilless rifle.\n       Ford, of Athens, Ohio, then moved up the mountain amid \n     withering fire to aid Walton at his command position. The \n     ferocity of the attack surprised him, as rounds ricocheted \n     nearby every time he stuck his head out from behind a rock. \n     ``Typically they run out of ammo or start to manage their \n     ammo, but . . . they held a sustained rate of fire for about \n     six hours,'' he said.\n       As Ford and Staff Sgt. John Wayne Walding returned fire, \n     Walding was hit below his right knee. Ford turned and saw \n     that the bullet ``basically amputated his right leg right \n     there on the battlefield.''\n       Walding, of Groesbeck, Tex., recalled: ``I literally \n     grabbed my boot and put it in my crotch, then got the boot \n     laces and tied it to my thigh, so it would not flop around. \n     There was about two inches of meat holding my leg on.'' He \n     put on a tourniquet, watching the blood flow out the stump to \n     see when it was tight enough.\n       Then Walding tried to inject himself with morphine but \n     accidentally used the wrong tip of the syringe and put the \n     needle in his thumb, he later recalled. ``My thumb felt \n     great,'' he said wryly, noting that throughout the incident \n     he never lost consciousness. ``My name is John Wayne,'' he \n     said.\n       Soon afterward, a round hit Ford in the chest, knocking him \n     back but not penetrating his body armor. A minute later, \n     another bullet went through his left arm and shoulder, \n     hitting the helmet of the medic, Staff Sgt. Ronald J. Shurer, \n     who was behind him treating Behr. An insurgent sniper was \n     zeroing in on them.\n       Bleeding heavily from the arm, Ford put together a plan to \n     begin removing the wounded, knowing they could hold out only \n     for so long without being overrun. By this time, Air Force \n     jets had begun dropping dozens of munitions on enemy \n     positions precariously close to the Green Berets, including \n     2,000-pound bombs that fell within 350 yards.\n       ``I was completely covered in a cloud of black smoke from \n     the explosion,'' said Howard, and Behr was wounded in the \n     intestine by a piece of shrapnel.\n       The evacuation plan, Ford said, was that ``every time they \n     dropped another bomb, we would move down another terrace \n     until we basically leapfrogged down the mountain.'' Ford was \n     able to move to lower ground after one bomb hit, but \n     insurgent fire rained down again, pinning the soldiers left \n     behind.\n       ``If we went that way, we would have all died,'' said \n     Howard, who was hiding behind 12-inch-high rocks with bullets \n     bouncing off about every 10 seconds. Insurgents again nearly \n     overran the U.S. position, firing down from 25 yards away--so \n     near that the Americans said they could hear their voices. \n     Another 2,000-pound bomb dropped ``danger\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\n     close,'' Howard said, allowing the soldiers to get away.\n       Finally, after hours of fighting, the troops made their way \n     down to the streambed, with those who could still walk \n     carrying the wounded. A medical evacuation helicopter flew \n     in, but the rotors were immediately hit by bullets, so the \n     pilot hovered just long enough to allow the in-flight medic \n     to jump off, then flew away.\n       A second helicopter came in but had to land in the middle \n     of the icy, fast-moving stream. ``It took two to three guys \n     to carry each casualty through the river,'' Ford said. ``It \n     was a mad dash to the medevac.'' As they sat on the \n     helicopter, it sustained several rounds of fire, and the \n     pilot was grazed by a bullet.\n       By the time the battle ended, the Green Berets and the \n     commandos had suffered 15 wounded and two killed, both \n     Afghans, while an estimated 150 to 200 insurgents were dead, \n     according to an official Army account of the battle. The \n     Special Forces soldiers had nearly run out of ammunition, \n     with each having one to two magazines left, Ford said.\n       ``We should not have lived,'' said Walding, reflecting on \n     the battle in a phone interview from Fort Bragg, N.C., where \n     he and the nine others are to receive the Silver Stars today. \n     Nine more Green Berets from the 3rd Special Forces Group will \n     also receive Silver Stars for other battles. About 200 U.S. \n     troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have received the \n     Silver Star, the U.S. military's third-highest combat award.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Master Sergeant Scott E.

Sergeant Sanders' actions are in keeping with the \n     finest traditions of military service and reflect great \n     credit upon himself, Combined Joint Special Operations Task \n     Force--Afghanistan, Special Operations Command Central, and \n     the United States Army.\n\n Citation To Accompany the Award of the Bronze Star Medal (With Valor) \n                        to Robert Gutierrez, Jr.\n\n       Staff Sergeant Robert Gutierrez, Jr., distinguished himself \n     by heroism as a Special Tactics Combat Controller, 21st \n     Expeditionary Special Tactics Squadron, Combined Joint \n     Special Operations Air Component while engaged in ground \n     combat against an enemy of the United States in Afghanistan \n     on 6 April 2008. On that day, Sergeant Gutierrez was attached \n     to Army Special Forces Operational Detachment-Alpha 3312 as a \n     Joint Terminal Attack Controller, in support of Operation \n     COMMANDO WRATH. He provided critical Airmanship skills during \n     a violent 6 and a half hour battle against heavily armed and \n     entrenched enemy fighters. While approaching the objective, \n     while climbing near-vertical terrain, the assault force was \n     ambushed by anti-Coalition forces which pinned down the lead \n     team on a 60-foot high rock cliff and produced several \n     friendly casualties. Sergeant Gutierrez coordinated with the \n     engaged element and directed lethal gun, missile, and bomb \n     attacks from AH-64s and F-15Es. Despite these strikes, the \n     attack intensified onto his team's position. Despite being \n     struck twice by 7.62 millimeter bullets in the helmet, \n     Sergeant Gutierrez maintained his calm demeanor and continued \n     to prosecute targets. As the fight continued, the insurgents \n     shifted their efforts toward arriving helicopters and engaged \n     them with heavy fire. Sergeant Gutierrez coordinated with the \n     ground force commander to delay friendly force extraction \n     until the enemy positions could be suppressed. Enabled his \n     systematic control of air power during the fight, all 17 \n     friendly casualties were safely evacuated and 40 enemy \n     fighters were killed. By his heroic actions and unselfish \n     dedication to duty, Sergeant Gutierrez has reflected great \n     credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5324-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5324-S5325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING JACK KEMP\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to a great American \nand friend, former Congressman Jack Kemp. I was deeply saddened to \nlearn of his passing and offer my sincerest condolences to his sweet \nwife Joanne; their four children, Jeffrey, Jennifer, Judith, and James; \nand 17 grandchildren. Jack has left a lasting impression and legacy \nthat will be honored and long remembered by a grateful nation.\n  Jack came to Congress after 13 years as a professional football \nquarterback. His career in professional football demonstrates the value \nof persistence, self-confidence, and courage. Jack began his football \ncareer slowly and without much success. However, he was fiercely \ncompetitive and eventually led the Buffalo Bills to 33 victories and 2 \nleague championships. He was selected All-League quarterback, AFL \nPlayer of the Year, Most Valuable Player, and appeared in five AFL \nchampionship games and seven AFL All-Star games. Jack was also \nrecognized by Sporting News as one of the top 50 quarterbacks of all \ntime. Sports taught him that the only real failure is not trying again \nand that out of adversity comes strength, determination, and ultimate \nvictory.\n  When asked if being a football star helped him get elected to \nCongress, Jack responded, ``Yes, to the extent that I had name \nrecognition and people knew who I was. That kind of identification cuts \ntwo ways. On the one hand, it was harmful because some people consider \nprofessional football to be anti-intellectual and an inadequate \ntraining ground for political leadership. To the contrary, I believe \npro football is great training for leadership. In fact, I hope more \nathletes choose politics as a profession so that we don't leave the \nfield to attorneys.''\n  Jack made the transition from athlete to politician in 1971, when he \nwas elected to represent the 31st Congressional District of New York. \nHe was an enthusiastic speaker, especially when the topic was tax \nrevision, and was once told he talks ``as though somebody had pulled \nthe trigger of a machine gun.'' I can certainly attest to that. \nHowever, it wasn't the way Jack talked that had everyone's attention; \nit was what he was saying. I would dare argue that much of what he was \nfighting for in the seventies and eighties still holds true today. For \nexample, Jack argued that the U.S. Government should shoulder the \nburden of international leadership by becoming ``an active exporter of \nthe American idea.'' In his view, the ``greatest weapon in our arsenal \nis the prospect of general well-being that results from the embrace of \nAmerican ideas about opportunity, initiative, and enterprise.''\n  During his time as Congressman, Jack was probably best known as a \nchampion of tax cuts. He became a fervent supply-side evangelist who \nbelieved that tax cuts would not only spur economic growth but also \nbring in more revenue for the Government. Jack coauthored the Kemp-Roth \ntax bill, which became the blueprint for what became known as \n``Reaganomics.'' Jack referred to his comprehensive Federal tax-cut \npackage as ``the number one offensive play in the country.'' Reagan \nbiographer Lou Cannon said Jack, as much as anybody, helped persuade \nReagan to embrace an economic policy of supply-side economics, \nstimulating economic growth through reducing taxes.\n  ``Generally speaking,'' Jack said, ``if you tax something, you get \nless of it. If you subsidize something, you get more of it. In America, \nwe tax work, growth, investment, employment, savings, and productivity. \nWe subsidize nonworking, consumption, welfare, and debt.'' How true \nthat is.\n  Jack served as a Congressman for 18 years, until 1989 when he became \nthe U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President \nGeorge H.W. Bush. Jack was the author of the Enterprise Zones \nlegislation to encourage entrepreneurship and job creation in urban \nAmerica and continued to advocate the expansion of home ownership among \nthe poor through resident management and ownership of public and \nsubsidized housing.\n  Jack received the Republican Party's nomination for Vice President in \nAugust of 1996 and afterward continued a career of public service by \ncampaigning nationally to reform the tax system, Social Security, and \neducation.\n  Jack was always uplifting and optimistic. He consistently \ndistinguished himself by exhibiting the rare ability to see real \nopportunity in the seemingly mundane. He seized those opportunities to \ndemonstrate qualities of judgment, character, and commitment. Jack once \nsaid, ``I do not believe there is any future for the Republican Party \nin trying to defeat Democrats. You don't run to fight opponents. You \nrun to promote ideas. Ideas are what rule the world. We, the \nRepublicans, haven't been offering an alternative. We need more \npositive ideas.''\n  When asked about his political ideals, Jack was quick to reply: \n``After going into the highly competitive business of pro football, I \ngained an even deeper appreciation of the competitive free-enterprise \nsystem to which this country owes its past, present, and future \nprogress and freedom. I believe competition breeds the best, and the \nsystem of free enterprise has brought about the greatest society ever \nknown.'' He also praised the American political system as ``the \ngreatest experience in human dignity and human freedom that mankind has \never known.''\n  In a sweet and endearing letter to his grandchildren, Jack talked \nabout the future of America. The letter was written days after Barack \nObama secured the Presidency. Jack wrote, ``My advice for you all is to \nunderstand that unity for our nation doesn't require uniformity or \nunanimity; it does require putting the good of our people ahead of \nwhat's good for mere political or personal advantage. You see, real \nleadership is not just seeing the realities of what we are temporarily \nfaced with, but seeing the possibilities and potential that can be \nrealized by lifting up peoples' vision of what they can be.''\n  I would suggest that Jack is one of the greatest political leaders \nthe world has ever seen. We all appreciate his efforts and service but \nnone so more than me. My dear friend, you will be sorely missed. May \nGod bless you and keep you.\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5325-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5325-S5326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My husband and I live in Grand View on a cowboy's wages \n     plus my disability. We were having a hard time just making it \n     because of my medical bills. Now, with the cost of fuel, I \n     have had to cut back on how many visits I make to doctors. It \n     is a huge drain on our budget just getting to Mountain Home \n     to buy the few groceries that we can afford, let alone go to \n     Boise every month. We have horses to feed so our hay costs \n     have more than doubled and the idea of just letting them \n     loose on the desert is abhorrent to us. There are lots of \n     people doing that because they cannot feed their animals \n     anymore.\n       You know what is really sad? It is sad that all of these \n     prices are based upon what might happen. A hurricane might \n     hit the Gulf. I watch the stock market and wonder how they \n     sleep at night when most of the decisions are based upon what \n     might be or could happen. I understand paying more when there \n     is a shortage or cost is high but why is it that in July/Aug \n     we are being punished for what might happen in November? \n     Maybe these people need to spend a year living off a cowboy's \n     wage before they are allowed to make decisions that affect \n     people they have nothing in common with?\n     Kim and Lisa.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I are on fixed incomes and are having a very \n     hard time making ends meet. My husband is 69 years old and is \n     still having to work as I had to take a disability from my \n     job with [the local] school district. I have worked in the \n     special needs program for 22 of those years and have just \n     worn my body out. I am on Social Security, but with them \n     taking out almost $95 a month for medical which does not \n     cover vision or dental. I had to have a hip replaced besides \n     all the other things that are wrong. If they keep up trying \n     to take away or just quit having Social Security, what are we \n     supposed to do? I have tried to get my disability from PERSI \n     and they keep telling me if I can help my daughter with her \n     kids two weeks out of the month, then I should be able to \n     continue my job. I told them that there is quite a difference \n     in lifting a 20-pound child who can help you to helping lift \n     kids that weigh from 90 to 150 pounds and cannot help you. I \n     dropped my granddaughter when she was six months old on her \n     head because of my shoulders. I cannot afford to hurt a child \n     at school or one of the other aides and be sued.\n       We do not have much as it is but we cannot start over again \n     trying to if someone sued us because they will not settle for \n     what the union would pay; they would want everything we \n     owned. Most of us are in this desperate kind of situation and \n     need the people back in Washington to understand that we do \n     not have a retirement system like they do and need to be able \n     to keep as much of what we have as we can. Please help us to \n     at least keep what we are getting, it is not great but it is \n     better than nothing which is what they seem to want for the \n     working people. God bless you in your efforts to help all of \n     us that are struggling and have worked all our lives to get \n     nothing much and have those who get it all want to take it \n     away from us. Thank you.\n     Nancy.\n                                  ____\n\n       My view\n       No thanks to all of the Oil Companies.\n       1. The oil and housing speculators have impaired the \n     logical pricing soundness of gasoline and diesel oil, now \n     causing all wholesale and retail price of goods and services \n     to rise, offsetting this rising cost in the national economy \n     used in the economic activity through the business \n     establishments as energy in and for mobility.\n       2. This mobility for the time and motion factor to create \n     productivity and profitability through transportation and \n     distribution in the gathering and production and supply \n     within the GNP.\n       3. This use correlated to the employment of money capital \n     and mankind capital used in the profit and loss sheets to \n     generate business revenue through sales that maintains the \n     national economy, and provides the base for the ultimate \n     consumer for all of the desires and demands put upon it and \n     is the base for private side revenue.\n       4. Private side revenue from money capital labor and \n     mankind labor to be taxed by direct and indirect taxes for \n     the revenue to maintain government for all desires and \n     demands put upon it.\n       5. The government sector through the private sector depends \n     upon maximum investment, maximum employment, maximum income, \n     maximum spending thus maximum sales through all the profit \n     and loss sheets to generate maximum revenue for governments \n     operation to tax and for cost and expenses, profit, earnings \n     and income.\n       6. [This will all combine to] destroy the United States of \n     America, [simply] by consuming the very thing that gives the \n     people the wherewithall by working the nation's capital to \n     produce a viable national economy to support the nation's \n     needs through business in the private sector and the \n     government sector.\n       7. We the people have given you trillions of dollars in \n     money, subsidies, and [yet Congress has not acted to resolve \n     the problem].\n       A. This has put the economy in disarray, and capital \n     through instability is not now productive enough to generate \n     economic activity through all of the profit and loss sheets, \n     to generate revenue to be taxed to [provide tax breaks for \n     oil companies], along with all of the government operations \n     (federal, city, county, states) for things the people cannot \n     afford individually, only collectively through tax revenue. \n     Then we also cannot afford for FEMA, the military, flood, \n     fire protection, police protection, education, weather, all \n     and any government agency to operate as they derive tax \n     revenue, due to the inefficacity, lack of productivity within \n     thru GNP through the economic system.\n       B. The people are not addicted to fuel as energy (gasoline \n     and diesel); the people are dependent upon fuel (gasoline and \n     diesel) to maximize productivity through mobility of and in \n     the use of asset money as money capital and asset labor as \n     labor capital invested and risked within all of the profit \n     and loss sheets.\n       C. Gasoline and diesel creating a more efficient source in \n     supply, manufacturing, and in use and consumption to maximize \n     productivity through mobility are separate sources of energy, \n     used in a completely different function within the GNP by the \n     economic system for the purpose of and function from wind \n     power, coal, oil for electrical power generators, yet \n     dependent upon mobility.\n       D. The oil companies will destroy this nation's economic \n     system and the nation itself by their glut pricing for \n     profits as the use of oil in the economic system is for \n     mobility to create productivity for money capital, mankind \n     labor capital for revenue from sales to create and maximize \n     income and profits.\n       E. The use of oil in plant and equipment and mobility for \n     production and supply are two separate entities but dependent \n     upon each other as sales always leads production.\n       The national economy depends upon stability and \n     responsibility and is relative to geographical location, \n     environment, resources, man and money as capital invested in \n     the domestic economy. (One P sheet to generate taxes will \n     not pay government debt, it takes a collective million and \n     more through the GNP.)\n       ``1929'' ``The Starvation, the silent factories, the goods \n     thrown away, the men standing idle, were the result of \n     irresponsible human financial and economic activities.''.\n       ``The whole class of people living on investments with \n     fixed interest and annuities were pauperized and driven to \n     the most abject expedients to live, all scientific, literary \n     and educational activities endowments stopped. Officials, \n     teachers, professional men and such-like living on fixed \n     salaries or fixed fees were never able to increase stipends \n     in proportion to the rise in prices. There was in fact a \n     massacre of the poor educated.''\n       A nation that cannot feed itself, maintain physical health \n     and mental health and strength through the labor of capital \n     and mankind for its survival of its people, maintain the \n     viability, continuity of the economic system through all of \n     the collective profit and loss sheets of Private enterprise \n     is at a great disadvantage in social and economic stability \n     in the international power field.\n                                                     John, Emmett.\n       [P.S.] Sales create revenue.\n       The national economy is what pays the nation's way, its \n     government's way and debt through and by the people in the \n     private sector through the collective profit and loss sheets \n     of the Entrepreneurial interest. GNP is not a Perpetual \n     Motion Machine: one has to work in order to have work done: \n     thus motion.\n       1. The GNP is what the people produce as durables, non \n     durables and service. (PRIME): The left-hand side is the \n     supply side WORK; (+y -x -y), dependent upon mobility for \n     productivity): This creating employment and income in the \n     process of production, producing the Economic Goods or \n     Service to satisfy human wants creating the demand object. \n     When you put people to work one automatically puts money to \n     work.\n       2. The GNP: (PUMP) to buy, durables, non durables and \n     service, dependent upon mobility for productivity is the \n     right-hand side and is the consumption side WORK DONE; (+y +x \n     -y):\n       3. The left side and right-hand side reciprocating within \n     the GNP through all of the collective Profit and Loss sheets \n     from the -X\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\n     to +X time line through +Y (revenue earnings, income, direct \n     and indirect taxes) by -Y sales (cost, value, expenses) then \n     back to -X from +X.\n                                  ____\n\n       The price of fuel has been affecting my family \n     tremendously. I am currently enrolled in college classes and \n     I live about 30 miles from my school. I have to live here \n     because living in a college town means the price of the home \n     is considerably too high. I drive 60 miles a day, and spend \n     at least $60 a week on gas for my vehicle alone. I am married \n     and my spouse is in a carpenters' union. This requires he \n     drive to wherever the employment is. Please do something, \n     Congress. I have never had to reach my hand out for help \n     before. My family believes in taking care of ourselves, but \n     the food bank is becoming more and more of an option. I do \n     not have a solution, but something needs to be done. Thank \n     you for your time.\n     Diane.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your newsletter regarding the energy problem \n     facing our nation. People are [frustrated with the inaction \n     from Congress], and those of us in Idaho recognize how much \n     harder this makes your work which is greatly appreciated.\n       Regarding the impact of gasoline prices upon me: I am a \n     retired widow living on my Social Security income. As to my \n     driving habits, they have practically come to a standstill. \n     My car sits for days at a time, not driven due to the cost of \n     gasoline, driven only for necessities. My tracking of the \n     daily oil commodity prices does not paint a pretty picture.\n       Then there [are politicians who do] not favor drilling in \n     ANWR or offshore. I agree with you that we must do all the \n     things possible to provide sufficient energy for our own use. \n     To think that Americans historically are known for \n     innovation, one ponders ``What has become of our ingenuity?'' \n     Is it politics as usual? Those more astute than I will figure \n     out how to handle the problem of drilling for oil, the \n     building of nuclear power facilities, the construction of \n     windmills, the development of biofuels, the use of oil shale. \n     The use of corn for ethanol is one of the crazier ideas put \n     forth. Anyone suggesting penalizing oil companies or \n     suggesting that they are making obscene profits needs to look \n     at the dollar amount of taxes put on gasoline. The lack of \n     understanding by some of business economics is sad. Stop \n     putting restrictions on energy companies so that they can \n     proceed without government red tape. Work with, not against, \n     companies to proceed post haste.\n       There is no reason that America cannot move forward with \n     programs to make us energy self-sufficient. It is \n     embarrassing to read that France has nuclear power while we \n     are sitting on our hands. It is upsetting to read that \n     foreign countries have leases to drill for oil in the Gulf of \n     Mexico. It is maddening to hear people say we are becoming a \n     Third World nation. I am proud of my country but I am \n     disgusted with [partisan politics]. It would seem that \n     earmarks come ahead of doing what is right for our country.\n       Needless to say, the energy problem has impacted our food \n     prices. This makes it hard for those of us on limited income. \n     Families with children should not be limited when it comes to \n     buying food for growing children.\n       In closing, we are at the crossroads of history. By not \n     looking ahead in the past, we are suffering the consequences \n     now. Now is the time to do something besides talk. The \n     American public wants action now. Americans have spoken. Why \n     is not Congress listening?\n     LaVergne, Hayden.\n                                  ____\n\n       I appreciate your desire to at least try to find answers to \n     this energy debacle. I am greatly concerned over the attitude \n     of our lawmakers and their passive attitude toward this vital \n     issue. There is a great feeling of uncertainty as to whether \n     we will be able to afford visiting families, harvesting \n     crops, and the myriad of other activities that are vital to \n     our livelihood. I believe environmentalism is accomplishing \n     what communism could not. It has brought our economy to its \n     knees. It is destroying our way of life, and most disturbing \n     it is denying us access to our own resources, which then \n     makes us hostages to foreign nations for our hand-to-mouth \n     existence. I fear the next step they will take will be the \n     nationalization of the oil industry as they try to make the \n     people feel they have the answers instead of letting private \n     enterprise and the free market, the very principle that has \n     made us great, have free reign. The American people have been \n     sold a socialistic bill of goods in the name of saving the \n     environment. They have been conditioned to think that man has \n     no place in nature, that their meat comes from a package and \n     their shoes from a box, with no realistic understanding of \n     the realities of production. These are very trying times. \n     Failure to properly address this issue could destroy our \n     status as the hope of nations and a light to all free \n     thinking people of the world.\n     Dell, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Over 63 years ago, Japan was using all electric cars/taxis/\n     buses/street cars because they had no oil--duh!\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am responding to your request for specific impacts the \n     cost of energy is having on individual families in Idaho. In \n     my view, targeting individuals is something like fiddling \n     while Rome is burning. As usual, [politicians do] not seem to \n     understand that inaction over the past 20 to 30 years in \n     regards to a realistic energy policy will at some point \n     destroy the country's way of life. Everything we have \n     achieved in the past 100 years is tied to energy in one way \n     or another. Farming, manufacturing, healthcare, \n     transportation, building, etc. could not have been achieved \n     without energy. [There has been a dramatic lack of leadership \n     in] addressing the energy problems. They, like you, are \n     focusing on how gas prices affect individuals while you \n     should be looking at how the energy situation could shut down \n     our whole economy. Our enemies have long ago determined that \n     they could not defeat us and destroy our country in a \n     traditional war, but they can destroy us from within. A few \n     hundred people acting as environmentalists have been able to \n     lock up our abundant natural resources. We have spent \n     hundreds of billions of dollars for oil purchased from some \n     of our most dangerous enemies, some who preach our death and \n     destruction. We have with our oil purchases enabled these \n     enemy countries to arm themselves and at some point in time \n     our young grandsons will probably need to stand up to the use \n     of these arms.\n       No one says we do not want to protect the environment \n     because we can. The technology and proven performance is \n     being demonstrated all over the world. The Congress must \n     remove the road blocks to our own natural resources--now! \n     Atomic energy must be allowed to develop and be an integral \n     part of the solution. Some say we cannot drill our way out of \n     this mess, which should have been done 25 years ago. If the \n     road blocks were removed, oil prices would drop like a rock, \n     because the speculators would need to consider the eventual \n     increase and volume of marketable oil. There are so many \n     things that could be done, however based on the performance \n     of our government nothing will be done.\n       [I do not believe our Congress will address this problem \n     effectively and that politicians will continue to profit from \n     this disaster for the American people.]\n     Gary, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       This fuel price is out of hand. I do think Congress needs \n     to step in and do something. I think we need to drill for oil \n     where they know it is. I am like another person who wrote in \n     and said that it should be up to the U.S. citizens. Let us \n     vote on whether we should be drilling in the U.S. and its \n     coastal waters. It should be our choice.\n       My husband and I own a big rig and he hauls potatoes into \n     [a processing plant] in Nampa. He gets a fuel surcharge but \n     it does not come close to covering the amount that the fuel \n     has gone up. We are slowly going under. We own our rig and do \n     not have payments so I do not know how anyone could survive \n     with making payments. My husband hopes to retire in the next \n     couple of years and we do not even know if we can make it \n     until that time. Then when we do retire how are we going to \n     afford to do anything? We would like to do some traveling but \n     with fuel so high, we will not be able to do so.\n       Our Senators and Representatives need to represent the \n     people!\n     Mary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5326-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5326-S5327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  CONGRATULATING RIVERBANK HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Riverbank High School is the first California \nschool to receive the College Board Inspiration Award in 5 years.\n  Each year, the College Board presents Inspiration Awards to three \nsecondary schools nationwide in recognition of their college \npreparation programs and the partnerships among the schools' teachers, \nparents, and community organizations that foster students' academic \nachievements and advancement.\n  Riverbank High School has consistently strived to provide its \nstudents with a challenging and rigorous curriculum.

Riverbank High School's 2008 graduating class produced a 91 \npercent acceptance rate to a 2 or 4-year college. The school has \naveraged an impressive 98 percent graduation rate over the past 3 \nyears.\n  As the administrators, teachers, parents, and students of Riverbank \nHigh School gather to celebrate this outstanding and well-deserved \nachievement, I thank them for their commitment to education and \nacademic excellence and wish them continued success.\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5327-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO HERBERT BRUCE CLEVELAND\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I wish today to recognize \nHerbert Bruce Cleveland of Rapid City, SD, on the occasion of his 50th \nanniversary of ordination in the Lutheran ministry. Herb has developed \na distinguished career in the ministry, both as a local pastor \nministering to the needs of South Dakotans dating back to the 1950s and \non a national level, having been appointed to numerous capacities in \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs by three Presidents.\n  Born in North Dakota and a graduate of the University of North Dakota \nand University of Michigan, Herb joined the U.S. Army in October 1952 \nand completed various stateside and international duty assignments. \nShortly after becoming ordained as a Lutheran pastor, Herb came to \nwestern South Dakota in 1959 and immediately developed a close working \nrelationship with the families in the Homestake Gold Mine in Lead. \nAfter ministering to the needs of hospitalized parishioners at the \nnearby veterans hospital at Fort Meade, he served veterans at the VA \nHospital in a full-time capacity in the early 1960s, a relationship \nwith veterans that continues today. Herb has witnessed the impacts of \nwar on soldiers and their families, and he has met these challenges \nwith professionalism, commitment, and dedication.\n  He led local and national efforts to develop a system to address post \ntraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and psycho-social issues. \nHe established the first substance abuse treatment center at the Fort \nMeade VA Chapel. He developed a strong bond with Native American \nveterans, working to add a Lakota chaplain to the VA staff and the \ninitiation of Lakota worship services and events such as pow-wows and \nsweat lodge experiences.\n  He worked tirelessly to address the evolving needs of veterans and \ntheir families while continuing a strong presence in Black Hills \ncommunities, assisting in youth and community events and fundraisers. \nIn 1983, the Veterans' Administration established new leadership in the \nchaplains service in Washington, DC, and summoned Herb, who had been \nworking with South Dakota veterans for 20 years, to become the new \nDeputy Chief of Chaplains. In this position, he served as Human \nResource Director and Educational Development Director and became \nincreasingly involved in the ecumenical relations with all the faiths \nthat were held by members of the Armed Forces. He recruited minority \nchaplains to serve the increasing number of minorities serving in the \nArmed Forces and veterans in the VA system.\n  He developed numerous institutes of training to address the needs of \ndisabled veterans and worked to educate and identify the unique issues \nimpacting young veterans, older veterans, and women veterans. Until his \nterm in Washington, the chaplaincy had been exclusively male, and Herb \nrecruited a number of women chaplains to serve the growing numbers of \nwomen veterans. He helped create the Chaplains School, which among its \nmany missions was providing professional training to women chaplains.\n  President Reagan appointed Herb as Chief of Chaplains in 1988, \nbecoming the first Lutheran and first clergy member from South Dakota \nnamed to such a capacity. He served in this position during President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush's Presidential term.\n  As national VA chaplain, Herb and his wife Connie participated in the \ninternational exchange of choral and symphonic music, which helped \nfoster better cultural and artistic understanding among numerous \nnations. Herb would oversee the largest single trip of a choir of 150 \nvoices that accompanied the national VA symphony that performed with \nthe Russian Army Chorus in Moscow and St. Petersburg on the first \nanniversary of freedom.\n  Chaplain Cleveland was then appointed by President Bill Clinton as \nDirector of Ethics for Health Care Management, where he would continue \nto address the health and faith challenge and issues affecting our \nNation's veterans.\n  After a decade of valued service in Washington, DC, Chaplain \nCleveland and his wife returned to South Dakota in retirement. As a \nvolunteer, Herb continues to service funerals, memorial services, \nweddings, and reunions. During 3 years of peak deployment to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, Herb served as chaplain to the National Guard and Army \nReserve cadets at the Fort Meade officers training facility.\n  Also in retirement, he has established mission tours to Southeast \nAsia with trips to China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and \nMyanmar. These people-to-people visits emphasize and foster \nunderstanding of different cultures. He was recognized by the president \nof Payap University in Thailand with the Distinguished Alumni Award for \nhis missionary work. This award is among numerous important \nrecognitions for Chaplain Cleveland. These honors include the Point of \nLight Award from President George H. W. Bush for his work with homeless \nveterans; the Exceptional Service Award from the VA Secretary for \nservice to the Nation's veterans; the National Black Chaplains of \nAmerica Award for Exceptional Service to America's Veterans, and he was \nnominated by Coretta Scott King to serve on the National Steering \nCommittee for Chaplains at the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center in \nAtlanta in 1986. He also received the ELCA Award for Exceptional \nService while serving the Lutheran Church and the Chaplaincy in \nAmerica. His most recent honor was notification of induction into the \nSouth Dakota Hall of Fame with ceremonies this September.\n  Over the years, Chaplain Cleveland has maintained a steadfast \ncommitment to his faith and God and has continued to fulfill a lifelong \nmission to address the emotional and spiritual needs of veterans and \ntheir families. He remains firmly rooted in his family and his \ncommunity and understands the importance of service. I consider myself \nvery fortunate and blessed to have known and worked with him in various \nendeavors during my years in Congress.\n  I want to wish Chaplain Cleveland a heartfelt congratulations on the \noccasion of his 50 years of service in the Lutheran ministry and for \nhis many years of great service to veterans, their families, and to \nthis Nation. I also wish him many more years of continued service in \nhis many endeavors in the Black Hills region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5327-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5327-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5327-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRANSMITTING THREE VOLUMES COMPLETING THE BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES \n   GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010: UPDATED SUMMARY TABLES MAY 2009, \n         ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVES, AND HISTORICAL TABLES--PM 18\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January \n30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the Committees \non the Budget; and Appropriations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the following volumes, which together complete my \nFiscal Year 2010 Budget: Analytical Perspectives, Historical Tables, \nand Updated Summary Tables.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 11, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5327-5", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5327-S5328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n       S. 1014.

A bill to reauthorize the Cane River National Heritage Area \nCommission and expand the boundaries of the Cane River National \nHeritage Area in the State of Louisiana; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills, S. \n1017 and S. 1018, one that will help to protect and preserve \nLouisiana's rich cultural and historic legacy, and one that will \ncontribute to historic research and preservation throughout the \ncountry.\n  The first bill will protect and preserve an important and treasured \npart of our historical legacy--the Cane River National Heritage Area. \nThis breathtaking region in northwestern Louisiana is known for its \nhistoric plantations, its distinctive Creole architecture, and its rich \ncultural legacy. Historically, this region was where the French and \nSpanish realms intersected as they explored the ``New World.'' Both the \nSpanish and the French left an indelible imprint on the area's people, \non its architecture, and ultimately on the U.S. as a whole.\n  Congress recognized this lasting legacy when it created the Cane \nRiver National Heritage Area in 1994. Today I ask that Congress \nreaffirm its commitment to this rich legacy and act to reauthorize the \nCane River National Heritage Area Commission until 2025.\n  The central corridor of the heritage area begins just south of \nNatchitoches, the oldest permanent settlement in the Louisiana \nPurchase, and extends along both sides of Cane River Lake for \napproximately 35 miles. The heritage area includes Cane River Creole \nNational Historical Park, seven National Historic Landmarks, three \nState Historic Sites, and a dense area of historic plantations, homes, \nand churches. While much of the roughly 116,000-acre heritage area is \nprivately owned, many sites are open to the public.\n  The community's pride in its history and traditions is legendary. The \nresidents of Northwest Louisiana stand united in their interest and \ninvolvement in preserving their traditions and their landscape for \nfuture generations. The Heritage Area offers residents a collaborative \napproach to conservation that does not compromise traditional local \ncontrol over and use of the landscape.\n  The landscape of Cane River is an American treasure--one that we must \npreserve. The Cane River region has been the focal point for American \nIndian settlements, colonial forts, and Creole plantations. The river \nitself was a major trade route, one that sparked alliances with \nAmerican Indians and brought European colonial powers to the area.\n  To protect their interests, the French established Fort Saint Jean \nBaptiste in 1714. Shortly thereafter, the Spanish responded by building \nthe presidio known as Los Adaes 15 miles to the west. Settlements \nspread from these early outposts, and the town of Natchitoches grew up \naround Fort Saint Jean Baptiste to become the most prosperous town in \nthe region.\n  As countries came together in this place, so did cultures. American \nIndians were joined by European settlers, who imported large numbers of \nenslaved Africans to farm the land. The interaction of these groups led \nto the development of a distinctive Creole culture, a culture that cut \nacross racial categories and drew from many traditions but remained \ngrounded in French colonialism and Catholicism.\n\n  A thriving agricultural economy developed along the banks of the \nriver by the time the region was joined to the United States in 1803, \nby the Louisiana Purchase. Natchitoches was the region's commercial \ncenter. Downriver from the town, in the areas known as Cote Joyeuse \n``Joyous Coast'' and Isle Brevelle, large and small plantations \nproduced indigo, tobacco, and later cotton.\n  The Civil War and its aftermath brought great economic devastation \nand cultural change to the residents of the Cane River region. Tenant \nfarming and sharecropping replaced slavery, exchanging one labor-\nintensive system for another. After World War II, mechanized farming \npermanently supplanted the old agricultural practices that depended on \nhuman labor in the fields. As a result, many people migrated to urban \ncenters, leaving the fields behind.\n  This is the complex past that Congress acted to honor, preserve, and \nprotect when it established the Cane River National Heritage Area in \n1994. Today I call upon my colleagues to continue their recognition of \nthe history and culture of this unique region.\n  The next bill I would like to call up and introduce is related to the \nHeritage Area, but the entire Nation will benefit from its prompt \npassage. This bill simply authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to \nenter into an agreement with Northwestern State University in \nNatchitoches, Louisiana, to construct a curatorial center for the use \nof Cane River Creole National Historical Park, the National Center for \nPreservation Technology and Training, and the University. These \ninstitutions emerged in the Cane River region because its beauty and \nrich historical legacy have attracted some of the Nation's finest \nhistorians and experts in historical preservation from the world over.\n  Cane River Creole National Historical Park has a veritable treasure \ntrove in its museum collection--boasting more than 1,000,000 objects. \nUnfortunately, this valuable cultural storehouse has been granted short \nshrift in terms of Federal funding. Today it is housed in leased space \nthat fails to meet National Park Service museum standards, since there \nis no land in the area which is above the 500-year floodplain.\n  But the historical park has a longstanding partnership with \nNorthwestern State University. In 1992, the National Center for \nPreservation Technology and Training was established at Northwestern \nUniversity. The National Center for Preservation Technology and \nTraining requires additional space to house equipment and workspace \nconnected with the development and dissemination of preservation and \nconservation skills and technologies. The University is willing to make \navailable land suitable for the National Park Service to construct a \nfacility for curatorial and workspace needs. This bill simply allows \nthat to happen. Since this Center facilitates the training and research \nof experts nationwide, I submit that this bill will do much to aid \nhistorical preservation efforts in every State, and I ask my colleagues \nto supports its prompt passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1017\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 139\n\n       Whereas in January 1947, the communist Democratic Bloc \n     party seized control of the Polish Parliament in a rigged \n     election orchestrated by the Government of the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas from 1947 to 1952, the communist Government of \n     Poland prosecuted, imprisoned, and executed many individuals \n     who fought as part of the wartime Underground Resistance, an \n     organization that valiantly supported the Allied struggle \n     against Nazi Germany as part of the largest resistance \n     movement in occupied Europe;\n       Whereas in July 1952, the passage of a new constitution \n     formally created the communist People's Republic of Poland \n     and outlawed any non-communist candidate from\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\n     seeking office to represent the people of Poland;\n       Whereas during the ensuing years of communist rule, the \n     people of Poland suffered severe hardships because of the \n     communist-led government's failure to provide for the basic \n     economic needs of its people;\n       Whereas under communist rule, Polish intellectuals, \n     religious leaders, labor officials, students, and reformers \n     were imprisoned and exiled for speaking out against a \n     succession of increasingly corrupt, inefficient, and \n     repressive pro-Soviet puppets;\n       Whereas despite the harsh repression of the communist-led \n     government and the great personal risk they faced, the Polish \n     people struggled for freedom by staging strikes, publishing \n     underground newspapers, organizing street protests, and \n     speaking out against the economic and political failures of \n     the communist regime;\n       Whereas in August 1980, in the wake of a shipyard workers' \n     strike in Gdansk, the Solidarity Movement was created as the \n     first free trade union in the Soviet Bloc nations;\n       Whereas ultimately 1 in 4 Polish citizens became members of \n     the Solidarity movement, which served as the driving force \n     for Poland's liberation from communist rule;\n       Whereas on June 4, 1989, the Solidarity Party secured an \n     overwhelming victory over the existing communist government \n     in the first open election in Poland since the end of World \n     War II, marking the fall of pro-Soviet rule in Poland; and\n       Whereas this victory inspired a succession of similarly \n     peaceful transitions from communism to democracy in other \n     former Soviet Bloc nations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 20th anniversary of the end of communist \n     rule in Poland;\n       (2) expresses its admiration for the people of Poland for \n     their bravery and resolve in the face of economic hardship \n     and political oppression under communist rule;\n       (3) congratulates the people of Poland for their \n     accomplishments in the years since the end of pro-Soviet \n     communist rule in building a free democracy, and for their \n     contributions as international partners;\n       (4) expresses its appreciation for the close friendship \n     between the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of Poland; and\n       (5) urges the Government of the United States to continue \n     to seek new ways to enhance its partnership with the \n     Government of Poland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5332-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 140--COMMEMORATING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEDICATION \nAND SACRIFICE MADE BY THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES WHILE \n                  SERVING AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Rockefeller, \nMr. Kohl, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kaufman, and \nMr. Merkley) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 141\n\n       Whereas Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia (HHT), also \n     referred to as Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome, is a long-\n     neglected national health problem that affects approximately \n     70,000 (1 in 5,000) people in the United States and 1,200,000 \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas HHT is an autosomal dominant, uncommon complex \n     genetic blood vessel disorder, characterized by \n     telangiectases and artery-vein malformations that occurs in \n     major organs including the lungs, brain, and liver, as well \n     as the nasal mucosa, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and skin \n     of the face and hands;\n       Whereas left untreated, HHT can result in considerable \n     morbidity and mortality and lead to acute and chronic health \n     problems or sudden death;\n       Whereas 20 percent of those with HHT, regardless of age, \n     suffer death and disability;\n       Whereas due to widespread lack of knowledge of the disorder \n     among medical professionals, approximately 90 percent of the \n     HHT population has not yet been diagnosed and is at risk for \n     death or disability due to sudden rupture of the blood \n     vessels in major organs in the body;\n       Whereas it is estimated that 20 to 40 percent of \n     complications and sudden death due to these ``vascular time \n     bombs'' are preventable;\n       Whereas patients with HHT frequently receive fragmented \n     care from practitioners who focus on 1 organ of the body, \n     having little knowledge about involvement in other organs or \n     the interrelation of the syndrome systemically;\n       Whereas HHT is associated with serious consequences if not \n     treated early, yet the condition is amenable to early \n     identification and diagnosis with suitable tests, and there \n     are acceptable treatments available in already-established \n     facilities such as the 8 HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence \n     in the United States; and\n       Whereas adequate Federal funding is needed for education, \n     outreach, and research to prevent death and disability, \n     improve outcomes, reduce costs, and increase the quality of \n     life for people living with HHT: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the need to pursue research to find better \n     treatments, and eventually, a cure for HHT;\n       (2) recognizes and supports the HHT Foundation \n     International as the only advocacy organization in the United \n     States working to find a cure for HHT while saving the lives \n     and improving the well-being of individuals and families \n     affected by HHT through research, outreach, education, and \n     support;\n       (3) supports the designation of June 2009 as National \n     Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia (HHT) month, to \n     increase awareness of HHT;\n       (4) acknowledges the need to identify the approximately 90 \n     percent of the HHT population that has not yet been diagnosed \n     and is at risk for death or disability due to sudden rupture \n     of the blood vessels in major organs in the body;\n       (5) recognizes the importance of comprehensive care centers \n     in providing complete care and treatment for each patient \n     with HHT;\n       (6) recognizes that stroke, lung, and brain hemorrhages can \n     be prevented through early diagnosis, screening, and \n     treatment of HHT;\n       (7) recognizes severe hemorrhages in the nose and \n     gastrointestinal tract can be controlled through \n     intervention, and that heart failure can be managed through \n     proper diagnosis of HHT and treatments;\n       (8) recognizes that a leading medical and academic \n     institution estimated that $6,600,000,000 of 1-time health \n     care costs can be saved through aggressive management of HHT \n     in the at-risk population; and\n       (9) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe and support the month through \n     appropriate programs and activities that promote public \n     awareness of HHT and potential treatments for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/11/senate-section/article/S5332-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5332-S5333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1058.

We do \nnot thank them enough.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. tomorrow \nmorning, Tuesday, May 12; that following the prayer and the Pledge of \nAllegiance, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning \nhour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for \ntheir use later in the day, and there be a period of morning business \nfor up to 1 hour, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach and the time equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the Republicans controlling the first \nhalf and the majority controlling the second half. Further, I ask that \nfollowing morning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. \n627, the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights legislation. I further ask \nthat the Senate recess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the \nweekly caucus luncheons.\n  Madam President, before that is approved, I hope that Senators who \nwish to make opening statements or statements regarding this \nlegislation would do so. I also hope that people who wish to offer \namendments would offer amendments. We are going to move this bill as \nquickly as possible. This is a bill that has wide support. The two \nmanagers will be Senators Dodd and Shelby. They have worked long and \nhard to come up with their amendment that is now pending. We have the \nexample set by the House of Representatives, where 377 Members voted \nfor this totally bipartisan bill, and it is something that is badly \nneeded.\n  It is interesting, Madam President. Senator Dodd, the manager of this \nbill, was talking to the pages today. These young boys and girls, who \nare juniors in high school, have received numerous preapproved credit \ncards. So I think this legislation is necessary. I think this has \ngotten way out of hand, just as subprime lending for houses got out of \nhand. We are not trying to punish any of the people who offer credit \ncards. This is something that has become a way of life. But there has \nto be some control over the way they are handled.\n  So I have a unanimous consent request pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  There being no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in short, I would hope people with \namendments to offer would do so. We need to get this done as quickly as \nwe can.
