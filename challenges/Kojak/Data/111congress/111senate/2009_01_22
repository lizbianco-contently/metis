Mr. President, for nearly half a century, the Equal Pay Act \nof 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have made it clear that \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex with regard to compensation paid to \nwomen and men for substantially equal work performed in the same \nestablishment is illegal. As do my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, I strongly support both of these antidiscrimination laws.\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues are misleadingly stating in the \ndebate about the legislation pending that it is about pay \ndiscrimination. That is not true. The only issue is the length of time \nof the statute of limitations that will apply in such cases.\n  In the case Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, the Supreme \nCourt considered the timeliness of the civil rights title VII sex \ndiscrimination claim that was based on paycheck disparities between a \nfemale plaintiff and her male colleagues. Under title VII, a\n\n[[Page S734]]\n\nplaintiff must file suit within 180 days of the alleged unlawful \nemployment practice. In this case, the plaintiff attempted to argue \nthat each paycheck constituted a new violation of title VII and \nconsequently restarted the 180-day clock. The Supreme Court disagreed \nwith that argument and held that:\n\n       A new violation does not occur, and a new charging period \n     does not commence, upon the occurrence of subsequent \n     nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting \n     from past discrimination.\n\n  In other words, the Court held that the plaintiff's suit had not been \nfiled in a timely manner since the 180-day statute of limitations had \nlong since passed.\n  In the Ledbetter case, the Supreme Court restated its support for and \nthe rationale behind a statute of limitations, stating they:\n\n       Represent a pervasive legislative judgment that it is \n     unjust to fail to put the adversary on notice to defend \n     within a specified period of time and that the right to be \n     free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right \n     to prosecute them.\n\n  In creating a 180-day statute of limitations period, Congress sought \nto encourage the prompt processing of all employment discrimination \ncases.\n  Now, there are some additional commonsense reasons why virtually \nevery criminal and civil law articulates a timeframe within which the \ncharge or the complaint must be filed. The loss of evidence, which is \nmore likely to occur with the passage of time due to loss of documents, \ncloudier memories, or even death can have a significant impact on the \ndefendant's ability to mount a fair defense in the case.\n  The other side has raised an interesting point, because information \nabout an individual's paycheck is frequently a private matter, and the \nidea is, well, there was no way this plaintiff could have known she \nhad, in fact, been discriminated against. So the argument is that there \nshould be in effect no statute of limitations along the lines of the \nact today of 180 days but, rather, should be tolled with each \nsucceeding check.\n  While everybody agrees with the argument, the point is there is \nalready an answer to this and it has been in the common law for \nhundreds of years. It has been in statutory law, and it has been \nadopted by courts. It is the doctrine of equitable tolling, which \nessentially is, when you should have become aware of something, that is \nwhen the statute begins to run. When an employee did not know and could \nnot be expected to know about certain facts relating to alleged \ndiscrimination, then the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the \nEEOC, and the courts may ``toll'' or freeze the running of the clock as \nit relates to the filing of the deadlines.\n\n  In fact, there is a U.S. Supreme Court case square on point called \nCada v. Baxter Health Care Corporation in which the Supreme Court \nclearly established the doctrine of equitable tolling which in the \nCourt's words:\n\n       Permits a plaintiff to avoid the bar of the statute of \n     limitations if, despite all due diligence, he is unable to \n     obtain vital information bearing on the existence of his \n     claim.\n\n  That has always been the law.\n  Senator Hutchison has introduced an amendment--an alternative to the \nbill that is before us--which preserves the balance between an \nemployer's need for certainty with the right of an aggrieved employee \nto file a valid claim of discrimination. It does this by preserving the \nexisting 180-day filing period for standard claims while offering \nemployees the right to assert claims beyond the filing period in \nsituations where they were unaware of the discrimination or where there \nwere impediments to discovering the discrimination--exactly the \nallegation in this particular case. In essence, the Hutchison amendment \ncodifies the doctrine of equitable tolling, which is the remedy to the \nalleged injustice in the Ledbetter holding, and makes sure that such \ntolling is applied more uniformly.\n  Unfortunately, the majority legislation goes far beyond the remedy to \nthe particular problem I have just discussed. It arguably provides the \ngreatest expansion of the Civil Rights Act since 1964. It does this in \nthree specific ways. First, it effectively eliminates the statute of \nlimitations, as I said, by imposing this arbitrary paycheck rule which \neviscerates the statute of limitations. Second, it expands the class of \npeople who may file a claim by applying the statute to ``affected \npersons'' without defining what the limitation on affected persons is. \nSo this class expansion would allow not only the aggrieved plaintiff or \nemployee but any spouse, children, or other individuals who might claim \nto be affected by the discrimination to file a claim. Finally, the \nexpansion would not just apply to sex discrimination but to all \nprotected classes of multiple employment laws covering civil rights, \nage, disability, and so on. So it is a much broader statute than is \nbeing portrayed by some who are simply saying this is about employment \ndiscrimination and changing the statute of limitations.\n  So I wish to stand with all Members of this body who I am sure agree \nthat we need to have laws such as the Civil Rights Act to protect our \nNation's citizens. I believe Senator Hutchison's amendment strikes the \nright balance between the needs of employers for certainty and the need \nof an aggrieved employee to file a valid claim alleging discrimination. \nI hope my colleagues will be supportive of the Hutchison amendment as a \ngood-faith attempt to combine these two doctrines and in a way that has \nalready been blessed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Cada decision.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Arizona \nas usual for his very clear explanation of the issues. He is one of the \nlegal scholars in the Senate with a great deal of experience. There is \nno need for me to go through the details of what he has just explained, \nso let me think about it and talk about it in a little bit different \nway.\n  On Tuesday, a couple million people here and millions all over the \nworld watched an eloquent ceremony from our Nation's Capital, the very \nmoving speech by President Obama, and were reassured by his eloquence \nin a time of difficulty for our country. Among all of the difficulties \nwe have, of course, the most important seems to be--or is--our economic \ntroubles. The new President promised he would make his first order of \nbusiness to get this economy moving again, get people working again, \nand to create new jobs. So it then becomes extremely important to say \nthat is what the new President said, and we agree with him.\n  I think we agree with that on the Democratic side and on the \nRepublican side. The Democrats are in charge of the Congress, so it is \nimportant to see what their priorities are for fulfilling the \nPresident's promise to get the economy moving again. Would it be \ncutting payroll taxes so people have more money in their pockets? Would \nit be building new roads and bridges to try to create new jobs quickly? \nWould it be to extend unemployment benefits? Would it be new \ninvestments in energy research and development? All of those, one might \nexpect, would be priorities. The President has talked about many of \nthose ideas. But no, it is none of those.\n  The first priority of the new Democratic Congress, which was already \npassed by the House and brought to the floor of the Senate without even \nbeing considered by a committee, and which we are debating today, is a \ntrial lawyer bailout. Let's give our friends the trial lawyers a big \nbailout as the first order of business in our effort to help the \neconomy. That is exactly what the Democrats' bill does.\n  Why does it do that? The bill Senator Kyl talked about attempts to \nregulate a solution that is fair to employees and fair to business \nabout a pay discrimination lawsuit, whether you are a woman or whether \nyou are a man. You need to have a reasonable amount of time for the \nemployee to file the cause of action, the act of discrimination, but \nyou have to have a reasonable amount of time for the employer to know \nthat the chances of that lawsuit being brought are limited. That is a \npart of every aspect of our law, and we call it the statute of \nlimitations. You cannot sit in your backyard for 20 or 30 years with a \ncause of action in your pocket and then run up to the courthouse and \nsay: Oops, I should have brought this 30 years ago, but I noticed now \nall the witnesses are dead, nobody is around to defend this; I am going \nto bring it now. That is, in effect, what we are talking about today.\n\n  We have differences in our responses to the Supreme Court decision \nabout\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\nwhat the reasonableness of a statute of limitations on a cause of \naction on pay discrimination might be. On this side of the aisle, \nSenator Hutchison's amendment on which we will be voting on later this \nmorning says: Let's expand the current law and say that an employee \nshould bring the lawsuit, not just within 180 days as the Supreme Court \nand the law now says, but whenever that employee could have known or \nreasonably should have known about the lawsuit. So that gives the \nemployee even more fairness than the law exists today.\n  On the other side of the aisle the solution is: Let's, in effect, \nabolish the statute of limitations and have never-ending lawsuits.\n  What would the effect of this be in practical terms? I can speculate \nwhat the effect will be. I think it means that employers will have to \nkeep more records. We are not talking about General Motors and General \nElectric here. They have big staffs who already keep lots of records \nand big law firms, in effect, that work for their companies. We are \ntalking about the shoe shop owner, the filling station owner, and the \nsmall business owner who works 10 or 12 hours a day every day of the \nweek. We are talking about the men and women in America on whom we are \nrelying to create the largest number of jobs to spur the economic \nrecovery that our new President talked about and that we all want.\n  What are we saying to them? We are saying: Mr. and Mrs. Small \nBusiness Person, we want you to keep a lot more records. That means you \nmight have to spend money you are earning to hire an employee to keep \nrecords going back interminably so you can defend a lawsuit. We want \nyou to be careful about pay for performance, rewarding one person over \nanother person, because under the law proposed by that side, years \nlater, some son or daughter or relative of that person may say: \nSomebody wasn't fair to mama or daddy and bring a lawsuit after \neverybody is gone, particularly whoever knew about whatever this \nsituation was.\n  So employers and small business people will be discouraged from being \nmore competitive by saying to one employee over another employee that \nwe are going to have pay for performance, which is never easy to do. \nThe legitimate complaints, people who are real victims of real pay \ndiscrimination, also are going to be hurt. The Equal Opportunity \nEmployment Commission had 75,000 or so claims and most of them were not \nmeritorious. That means everybody is delayed in terms of the \nmeritorious claims, and this will open the floodgates and slow justice \nfor the real victims.\n  It will mean, if you are a small businessman in America and this law \npasses, if Senator Hutchison's amendment is not adopted, you better get \nready to hire a recordkeeper, you better get ready to pay some \nsettlements to lawyers because, for the interminable future, a lawyer \nand someone who used to work for you or is a relative of that person \nmay come in and allege pay discrimination, even though it was 25 years \nago and they knew it all the time.\n  What does that mean for you? You better set aside $25,000, $50,000, \n$200,000 of money that you could use to hire more people or pay a \ndividend or get the economy moving again to bail out the trial lawyers.\n  I am disappointed with the proposal on the other side of the aisle. I \nfully support Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who has a proposal that I \nhope we adopt at 11:30 this morning that is fair to employees and that \nis fair to small businesses.\n  I would think the majority would have something better to offer the \nAmerican people in response to the new President's eloquent suggestion \nthat it is time to get the economy moving again than a bailout for \ntheir friends, the trial lawyers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT of Utah. Mr. President, I rise to comment with respect to \nthe proposed Lilly Ledbetter legislation, and I bring the perspective \nof a small employer, for I have presided over firms with as few as half \na dozen employees. I have been fortunate enough to see some of those \nfirms grow to larger firms. Indeed, one firm I joined as the fourth \nemployee in the history of that firm ended up listed on the New York \nStock Exchange. So I have seen the travails employers go through as \nthey deal with growth situations and creating jobs. The company with \nwhich I was involved grew from the original four employees to a staff \nof 4,000.\n  One of the challenges that comes with a company that is growing that \nrapidly and creating that number of jobs is you are always involved \nwith change. You are always involved with uncertainty. It is not the \nsame thing as presiding over a company that has been established for 60 \nor 70 years and has a degree of stability. Every month is a new \nadventure, a new challenge, and you are constantly changing your \nemployee base. As new people are hired, the old people sometimes get \nresentful of the new people and say: We were here at the beginning; why \naren't we getting these promotions? And you have to explain to them \nthat the company has changed and we need new talents, we need to bring \non board new skills, and, quite frankly, the small group that was with \nus in the beginning has to be augmented with new people.\n  There are resentments, there are concerns, and occasionally there are \ndiscrimination cases filed.\n  But if we were to take the position of the underlying legislation \nthat says if there was genuine wage discrimination in a circumstance, \neveryone who was involved in writing a paycheck after that \ndiscrimination has committed the discrimination again and has \neffectively reset the clock for the statute of limitations.\n  As I consider the impact of this on a business, I realize this, in a \nway, is the asbestos fight all over again. We saw in the asbestos fight \ncompanies that were taken down for actions that occurred outside the \ncompany on the part of those who worked in other companies that were \nacquired decades later. Let's put it specifically.\n  Let's assume a business had a situation where there was, in fact, \nwage discrimination that took place. The individual against whom this \ndiscrimination was practiced did nothing with respect to it but \ncontinued to stay employed and continued to receive the paycheck.\n  Under the Lilly Ledbetter legislation, the clock would be reset for \nthe statute of limitations. The individual who performed the \ndiscrimination, let us say, was discharged. The individual who \nsupervised the situation was unaware that discrimination had occurred. \nThe company in which it happened is later acquired by another company. \nAnd then the trial lawyers discover this had been going on years ago. \nThey now sue the eventual company that acquired the first company for a \ngreat amount of money, perhaps even a class action suit is filed. You \ncannot prove what happened because all the people involved have \ndisappeared. They have gone away. They no longer work for the company. \nThey have no memory of what happened. It is decades later.\n  It doesn't matter. Under this legislation, the statute of limitations \nthat is crafted to deal with a situation where there are no available \nwitnesses anymore somehow magically, by virtue of this bill, keeps \ngetting set again and again going forward.\n  The Supreme Court got this one right. The attempt on the part of \nthose who want to curry favor with the trial lawyers have got this \nwrong. What will happen? Will more people who have had wage \ndiscrimination receive benefits? There is no guarantee that will \nhappen. Will trial lawyers who are looking for causes of action receive \nfees? There is a pretty good guarantee that will happen. Will small and \nmedium-size businesses that cannot afford legal fees be faced with \nenormous settlement charges? I am pretty sure that will happen. Will \njobs be destroyed as a result of this, as they were in the asbestos \ncase? I guarantee that will happen.\n\n  Here we are, in the worst financial situation any of us can recall, \ntalking about a circumstance that would destroy jobs among small \nbusinesses and that would discourage employers who are struggling to \ncreate new jobs in medium-size businesses. We are talking about putting \nout billions of dollars in the name of a stimulus while simultaneously \ndiscussing legislation that would destroy jobs and create chaos among \nthose who are trying to survive in this financial circumstance.\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\n  This is bad legislation on its face and bad legislation on its \nmerits. But the timing of this proposal is atrocious. To be making \nthese kinds of proposals in this kind of financial circumstance is \nincomprehensible to me, unless I assume that there are those who say \nthe trial lawyers played an important part in the election; the trial \nlawyers need to be rewarded for the important part they played in the \nelection; let's have a bill that will line the pockets of the trial \nlawyers and look the other way in terms of the economic consequences.\n  I compared this to the asbestos litigation. I was in the Chamber when \nwe dealt with what are called strike suits, where trial lawyers would \nfile lawsuits on behalf of clients who were, in fact, not aggrieved but \nwere simply posing in behalf of a class that the trial lawyer himself \nhad put together.\n  We passed that legislation. It was vetoed by President Clinton. It \nwas the only Clinton veto that was overridden in this Chamber, as \neveryone was outraged at the behavior of the trial lawyers who brought \nthese strike suits.\n  There are those who said: Oh, you still don't get it, you who are \npicking on the trial lawyers. They do wonderful things. I agree that \nthe ability to file a grievance and have a trial lawyer carry it \nforward, even in a class-action suit, is a protection the American \npeople need. But these lawyers were going far beyond anything that was \ngood for the American people.\n  The position was summarized by Bill Lerach, known as the ``king of \nthe trial bar,'' when he said: I have the ideal law practice. I have no \nclients. He is now in jail because his practices finally caught up with \nhim, as it was finally demonstrated that the people on whose behalf he \nwas suing were, in fact, not real clients. They were paid by him to \npose as people who were aggrieved.\n  We saw those kinds of abuses that came out of that situation. We \nfinally saw his law firm destroyed, and this man, and others like him \nfrom the trial bar, went to jail for their activities.\n  Let's not create another circumstance where there is a temptation to \nonce again take advantage of people who have been legitimately hurt, \nbut by manipulating the law in such a way as to maximize the return to \nthe plaintiff's bar, we see the economy hurt.\n  The Supreme Court, as I say, got this one right.

WADE\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today is a sad day. We had a wonderful \ninauguration a couple of days ago, phenomenal crowd, a great \ncelebration, and a peaceful transfer of power took place. It was \namazing. I was there on the front steps of the Capitol watching it, \nparticipating in it, excited about the first African-American President \nof the United States; an amazing thing to take place within one \ngeneration of Martin Luther King's marches and what he did in this \ncountry. My State has been a big part of all of those things and what \nhas taken place. Today is a sad day, though. Today, 36 years ago, the \nSupreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade banned all impediments to having \nan abortion in the United States and said abortion is a constitutional \nright that the individual carries in the United States and that it \ncannot be infringed upon, cannot be limited. It did later limit some of \nthat and gave a few places where the State could act to limit--most \nrecently partial-birth abortions, where the Supreme Court has recently \nruled that the State can limit partial-birth abortions. And there were \na few minor areas in the Roe decision, but overall it made a \nconstitutional right to abortion. That was 36 years ago.\n  The reason I say it is a sad day is there have been roughly--and \nnobody knows for sure--40 million children who are not here today \nbecause of that decision. It ratcheted up, escalated up substantially \nthe number of abortions in the United States that took place after \nthat. It moved forward to the point that most estimates are that one in \nfour pregnancies in the United States will end in an abortion and a \nchild dying. And it even gets worse from that point. When you look at \nchildren with special needs, such as Down syndrome children, the number \nis somewhere between 80 to 90 percent do not make it here, as I have \nstated on this floor previously, as they are aborted and they are \nkilled because of their genetic type. They get a test, the \namniocentesis test, which says they have an extra chromosome, and \ngenerally because of that extra chromosome they are aborted and they \nare killed, even though the fact is, if they would get here on the \nground, life and the prospects for a Down syndrome child now have never \nbeen better. Life expectancy, quality of life issues, if that is your \nmeasure, have never been better than they are now. Plus, the families \nwho have a Down syndrome child look at those children as the \ncenterpiece of the family, an amazing person. Yet somewhere between 80 \nto 90 percent of these amazing people never make it here, and that is \nbecause of what happened 36 years ago this day in the Supreme Court of \nthe United States.\n  That is why there will be hundreds of thousands, primarily young \npeople, marching today in Washington, DC. They will get no mention. \nThere will be very little press, if any, outside of some of the \nreligious press that will be there. But outside of that, they will get \nvirtually no coverage. There will be hundreds of thousands of young \npeople here marching and asking for a change and something different, \nsomething that I hope President Barack Obama would embrace. He was \nempowered on the legs of young people and young enthusiastic minds \nlooking for change, looking for something different. That same young \ngeneration is the most pro-life demographic in our country today. That \nage group that is below the age of 25 is the most pro life. They are \nlooking for something different. They are looking for a sanctity of \nlife. They are looking for us to protect all innocent human life. They \nare looking for us to work to make all human life better, whether that \nis a child in the womb or a child in Darfur. Whether it is somebody in \nprison or somebody in poverty, they want that person's life to be \nbetter.\n  That is a beautiful pro-life statement. It is one that we need to see \nmirrored. It is one we need to see acted upon. It is one we need to see \nhappen, rather than the repealing of things such as Mexico City \nlanguage which says we can now use taxpayer dollars to fund groups \noverseas that work and support and fund abortion. Yet apparently that \nis what the Obama administration is going to do, it is going to repeal \nMexico City language and say that taxpayer dollars can now be used for \nthese purposes that most Americans disagree with. That is not the \nchange people are looking for. Those are chains to the past. Those are \nthings that bind us to a culture that doesn't affirm life, that doesn't \nsee it as sacred and beautiful in all its places and dignity in every \nhuman life no matter who it is. Those are ones that say quality of life \nis your measure, as to whether you should be the recipient of such a \ngift of life.\n  It is a sad day. It is a tough day. I hope it is a day that doesn't \ngo on as far as our having many future annual recognitions of the Roe \nv. Wade decision but, rather that in the future we will be a life-\naffirming place and that we will say, in a dignified culture every life \nat every place in every way is beautiful and it is unique and it is \namazing and it is something that should be celebrated and it should not \nbe killed. When we move to that, that will be real change. That is the \nsort of change that people can look at and say, that is what I want my \ncountry to be like.\n  You know, the sadness doesn't stop with the death of the children. We \nare now seeing more and more studies coming out about the impact on \npeople who have abortions. In August this past year, 100 scientists, \nmedical and mental health professionals, released a joint statement \nthat abortion does indeed hurt women. The Supreme Court of the United \nStates concluded some women do regret their abortions and can suffer \nsevere depression and loss of\n\n[[Page S737]]\n\nself-esteem. These professionals have officially confirmed these facts. \nThey say the number of women adversely affected by abortions cannot be \noverlooked by the medical community.\n  In looking at this in our own family situation, every one of our \nchildren is incredibly precious. If I think of one of them not being \nthere, it is one of those stunning sort of thoughts of despair, and yet \nto think of the 40 million who aren't here and of the stunning amount \nof despair there must be in a number of people's lives and hearts as \nthey think, I made that decision fast, or I did that under a lot of \npressure, or I didn't think I had another choice. But other choices did \nexist. People want to adopt, and people want to adopt Down syndrome \nchildren. As Ted Kennedy and I recognized, in my bill we got passed \nlast year on prenatally and postnatally diagnosed diseases, which \nestablished a list of people who wanted to adopt Down syndrome children \nor children with special needs--some people look at a child in that \nsituation and say, I can't handle that, and I understand. But there are \npeople who believe they can handle it and they want to take a child and \nraise it.\n  So I hope as we look forward, we will work together and say, this is \nsomething that shouldn't be happening the way it is in the United \nStates and we want to make it different. I hope we will recognize these \nyoung people who are marching out here now, who are hoping for change, \nand understand the change they want is quite valuable, it is beautiful, \nit is life affirming, and that ultimately it is going to happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this is truly a historic week in \nWashington. Those of us who were among the millions who were on the \nMall a few days ago witnessed a moment in history which I am sure we \nwill talk about, and future generations will refer to, for a long time. \nSomeone during the course of this lead-up, the few days of preinaugural \nactivities, said it was the third chapter in America's social history.\n  The first chapter was when Thomas Jefferson announced, then wrote, \nthat all men were created equal, endowed by their creator with certain \ninalienable rights, but living in a time when even in his own household \nthere was slavery. That was the first chapter. In the second chapter, \nthey referred to, of course, Abraham Lincoln, who said it is worth \nblood and war to fight for this right of equality and to preserve this \nunion dedicated to that principle. And, of course, what happened this \nTuesday was the third chapter, a graphic validation of the fact that \nAmerica has made dramatic progress toward equality.\n  There is so much more to do, and I am particularly honored that the \nman who now leads our Nation is one whom I served with as a colleague \nin the Senate, a person I encouraged to run, and a person who I think \nhas grown immeasurably to the position he has reached today.\n  America has so much faith in Barack Obama and what he can bring, but \nhe is the first to caution us that we face unparalleled challenges. You \nhave to go back 75 years to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came to the \nPresidency in the midst of the Great Depression, when the economic \nplight of the United States was even worse than today. People had lost \nhope, they had lost their savings, and they had lost their jobs. There \nwas gloom across America. That man, with braces on his legs, staggering \nto the podium, brought a new confidence to the American people. He \nbegan a turnaround that literally took years but eventually succeeded \nin restoring the faith and the economy of America.\n  When Barack Obama took to the podium just last Tuesday to give his \ninaugural address, his message was reminiscent, telling America that we \nare facing difficulties that will require our best efforts on a \nbipartisan basis. We have to work together. All of the division in this \nChamber and across Capitol Hill notwithstanding, the American people \nare tired of it. They expect us to come here and achieve something. \nThey understand the momentous challenge we face.\n  President Obama spoke 2 days ago of gathering clouds and raging \nstorms. He said we are in the midst of a crisis, and he spoke about our \nNation at war on two fronts and our economy in disrepair.\n  Yesterday, I think we took an important step forward in addressing \none of those challenges. It was the right, under the Senate rules, of \nthe minority side to ask for a rollcall on the appointment of Senator \nClinton as our new Secretary of State. I understand that and I respect \nit. I believe the fact that they allowed that rollcall to be brought to \nthe floor in a timely basis is consistent with this new attitude that \nwe will not give up the traditions of Congress, the traditions of our \nGovernment, but will understand that we face a special urgency in \ndealing with issues. The vote last night on the Senate floor was 94 to \n2 in favor of the confirmation of Hillary Clinton as our next Secretary \nof State. I am so happy she is going to have that responsibility, and I \nknow she will do an excellent job.\n  Today, President Obama has asked us to take up a measure of similar \nurgency. It is a measure known as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. You \nmay have heard some of the debate on the floor, and the debate has been \nan important one. I do not question those who oppose this. I understand \nthat they do not favor discrimination. But I have to say that I \ndisagree with them.\n  We, those of us who I believe will show a majority vote for this \nmeasure, believe that when there is discrimination in the workplace, \nwhether it is in pay or age or gender discrimination, that is not \nAmerican, that is not consistent with our values, and that the person \nwho is wronged, the person who is the victim should have an opportunity \nto come to court for justice.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter case is a classic illustration. This woman, \nworking in a Goodyear tire plant in Gadsden, AL, after 15 years, \nnearing retirement, in the management ranks, came to learn she had been \nunderpaid for the same job the males at her establishment were being \npaid more. Naturally, when she learned this, after years of doing the \nsame work for less pay, she believed it was unfair. I did too. Anyone \nwould. She took her case to court asking for compensation, asking that \nthe company pay for their discrimination.\n  The case went through the courts and eventually ended up across the \nstreet at the U.S. Supreme Court, and they came up with a decision \nwhich was nothing short of incredible. They said that from the first \nmoment when the first discriminatory paycheck was given to Lilly \nLedbetter, she had 180 days to file a claim. That overlooks the \nobvious: People who work in private sector jobs don't know the pay of \nthe person at the next desk in a position similar to their own. It is \nnot published. There is no way they would know it. In this case, to \nhold Lilly Ledbetter to an unreasonable standard to filing this case so \nquickly after the first discrimination is to overlook the obvious. The \ndiscriminatory activity continued beyond that first paycheck, and Lilly \nLedbetter, when she brought this case, brought it within 180 days of \nthe discovery of this discrimination. What we are doing through the \nleadership of Senator Mikulski is to finally right this wrong, and \nPresident Obama has asked us to send this to his desk. I hope we do it \nand do it quickly.\n  Then we are going to shift to an even larger undertaking as we work \nto address the troubles of our economy. We have to do this boldly and \nquickly--no excuses. It is a grim beginning for that administration in \nthe fields of jobs, health care, and housing. Rarely has a new \nPresident been immediately confronted with an economic situation so \ngrim.\n  This is just a sampling of the headlines, the job cut headlines, \nacross the United States of America from Washington; St. Louis; \nPortland, OR; Hartford, CT; Detroit--all across the United States. We \nknow these stories. Americans continue to wake up to headlines like \nthese every day--another company decides to lay off or close.\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\n  Then, of course, we know what this toll means to us in terms of daily \nstatistics. This is another one of these statistics which are hard for \nus to absorb; to think that 17,000 Americans will learn today that they \nhave lost their job, and 17,000 tomorrow, and 17,000 the day after. \nThat is what happened in December--over 500,000 Americans lost their \njobs, and sadly, they think in this month of January the number may be \n600,000. At the same time, 11,000 Americans lost their health care \ncoverage. They were told the company is in trouble, sales are not good, \nthe people who run the company are going to have to cut back on \nbenefits. Health care, one of the more expensive benefits, is one of \nthe first to go. Mr. President, 17,000 out of work, 11,000 lost their \nhealth care. But then another 9,000 will go home and open the mail and \nbe told they are facing foreclosure, they are about to lose their home. \nThink about that--17,000 losing their jobs, 11,000 losing their health \ninsurance, and 9,000 losing their homes. You can understand the gravity \nof the economic crisis that faces us.\n  We are in the midst of one of the greatest economic crises since the \nGreat Depression. For the middle class, working Americans, the current \nsituation is hard to bear because they have gained so little over the \npast 8 years. It is not as if you are losing a job that was giving you \na paycheck that allowed you to keep up with the pace of the cost of \nliving. For the last 8 years, the average American family smack dab in \nthe middle of the middle class has been falling further and further \nbehind. We know why. For a time, the cost of gasoline was up over $4 a \ngallon. We know the cost of utilities has gone up, the cost of daycare, \nthe cost of health care, and wages have not kept pace. While some have \npronounced prosperity over the last 8 years, the reality is that for \nreal families facing the real world, prosperity has not been there \ndespite their best efforts, and they have fallen further and further \nbehind.\n  Eight years ago, we celebrated the turn of a new millennium with hope \nand optimism. Most people believed they and their children would be \nbetter off in the future. Those hopes have been shaken.\n  Unemployment has risen from 5.6 million people--that was 3.9 percent \nin December of 2000--to over 11 million people today, 7.2 percent. That \nis a doubling of the number of unemployed people over the course of the \nlast administration. Mr. President, 5.5 million more Americans are \nunemployed today at the dawn of the 21st century.\n  Median or middle household income for working-age households--those \nheaded by someone under the age of 65--has actually decreased over the \nlast 8 years by $2,000 adjusted for inflation. For those in the middle \nclass who still have a job, workers are earning less for every hour \nthey contribute.\n  The number of Americans not covered by health insurance has increased \nfrom over 38 million people--13.7 percent of our population--in 2000 to \nover 45 million people--15.3 percent of our population--in 2007, and \nthe number obviously will grow when the statistics are reported for \n2008. At least 7 million more Americans are uninsured than at the \nbeginning of the decade.\n  In the year 2000, we first heard the phrase ``subprime mortgage'' \nspoken on the floor of the Senate and around our Nation. The boom and \nbust of irresponsible lending since that time has left us with a record \nnumber of foreclosures across America. In just the last 2 years, \nindividual foreclosure filings have risen 226 percent.\n\n  I have looked at maps of the great city of Chicago which I am honored \nto represent. Many people who travel know Midway Airport. Midway \nAirport is surrounded by bungalows--which is kind of a traditional \nhouse for the city of Chicago--neat little brick bungalows, one after \nthe other, that people are so proud to have. You see the backyards with \nthe little swimming pools, the above-ground pools, as you fly into \nMidway, and the well-kept lawns. Many of these families are second or \nthird generation, from Ireland and Poland and all over the United \nStates. They come into this area because middle-class families see this \nas a great place to live and work in the city of Chicago.\n  Then somebody showed me a map. They took the ZIP code around this \nMidway Airport and they put in little red dots for every home under \nforeclosure in each block. There were maybe four or five blocks that \ndid not have a home in foreclosure in that solid, middle-class \nneighborhood in the middle of the city of Chicago. It clearly is a \nsituation almost out of control.\n  Some of the experts, such as Credit Suisse, predict that between 8.1 \nmillion and 10 million American families will lose their homes in the \nnext 4 years.\n  I will just tell you point blank, I do not think we can come to grips \nwith this recession, that we can really turn this economy around, until \nwe do something bold, dramatic, and comprehensive about mortgage \nforeclosures. We have waited patiently for too long. We kept saying to \nthe banks: We know you are going to lose a fortune when a home goes \ninto foreclosure. Do the bankers want to start cutting the grass? Do \nthey want to start making sure the place looks good for a real estate \nshowing? Of course not. They are in the financial business. We say: Why \ndoesn't the banking business step up and start to renegotiate the \nmortgages so people have a fighting chance?\n  I got on a plane flying back to Chicago just 2 weeks ago, and a \nflight attendant said: Senator, I need to talk to you. She came over \nand knelt down in the aisle next to me once the flight was underway and \nsaid: I want to tell you my story. I am a single mom. I have three \nkids, two in high school. I live in a suburb of Chicago. This is my \njob. It has been tough. Airlines have struggled, wages have not \nincreased. But I keep coming to work because this is how we keep our \nfamily together. I am underwater with my mortgage.\n  Do you know what that means? That the value of her home currently is \nless than the principal balance of her mortgage. She is underwater.\n  She said: I am paying over 6 percent on my mortgage, and if I do not \nget this mortgage interest rate lower, I don't know what to do. \nSenator, what should I do?\n  You know, I can give her advice but not very good advice. I can tell \nher: If you go into foreclosure, maybe the bank will come in and talk \nto you, maybe you can renegotiate the mortgage. If you go any further \nalong, though, who knows. You may end up losing the house and your kids \nwill be out in the street.\n  That is the literal truth of life for many people in America. We have \nto do something about that. We have waited so long for the banks to get \nit together, to renegotiate these mortgages, and it has not happened.\n  I like Henry Paulson, our former Secretary of the Treasury. I really \ndo. He has been a good friend, and I know he has tried through a \ncrisis. But every time I bring this up to him, he says: We are going to \ntry to do it on a voluntary basis. But it has not worked. He set up a \nplan called HOPE, and the plan was supposed to encourage banks to \nrenegotiate mortgages. They said: Our goal is 400,000 mortgages are \ngoing to be renegotiated. At the end of the day, fewer than 400 were \nrenegotiated.\n  We have to do more and, sadly, we are not. I hope we address this and \naddress it soon.\n  I see the minority leader, the Republican leader is on the floor, and \nI know he wanted to speak at 10, so I am going to bring these remarks \nto a close by just saying this. We have to act and act quickly. We have \nto act together, Democrats and Republicans. We cannot do this alone. \nAll Democratic votes cannot reach the magic number of 60 in the Senate \nChamber. We need to hope that some of the Republicans who understand \nthe gravity of this economic crisis in their own States and in our \nNation, who understand the need to move quickly--which we hear from, \nbasically, economists of all political stripes and backgrounds--who \nstood and listened to our new President challenge us to step up and act \nand act quickly--we need to hope they will join with us.\n  Then, in return, we have a responsibility in the majority, as \nPresident Obama has said, to listen to constructive suggestions and \nideas, to try to put together a package that represents the best of \nDemocratic thinking, the best of Republican thinking. That is what I \nheard then-President-elect Obama say to Senator McConnell at a meeting \nwe had just a few weeks ago.\n  It is in that spirit, with that approach, that I think we can start \nto\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\nsolve these problems. But we have to get moving on it. We have to do it \nnow. We have to do it with a sense of urgency.\n  Senator Reid, the Democratic majority leader, has said that before we \nleave in the middle of February--I think the date is February 14--we \nneed to pass this economic recovery and reinvestment plan. That means \nrolling up our sleeves and getting down to business. I know we can do \nit. I know the American people expect nothing less from this Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico).

Mr. President, we have heard a lot of debate over the \npast few days on the question of fairness. Every Member of this body \nsupports equal pay for equal work. I could not find anybody who does \nnot support that.\n  But this so-called Ledbetter bill is a trial lawyers' bailout. It is \nnot about fair pay.\n  Pay discrimination has been illegal since 1963. Let me say that \nagain. Since 1963. This bill is about effectively eliminating the \nstatute of limitations on pay discrimination. It unfairly targets \nbusiness owners who, in many cases, will no longer have the evidence \nthey will need to mount a just defense.\n  As we all know, job creators have enough to worry about these days. \nWe should not add the threat of never-ending lawsuits. Republicans have \na better idea to ensure fairness in the workplace. Senator Hutchison \nhas crafted a commonsense proposal that says the clock should not run \nout on someone who has been discriminated against until he or she \ndiscovers the alleged discrimination. That is fair to both sides.\n  If we are going to grow our economy, we need to focus on legislation \nthat will create jobs, not put undue hardships on job creators. So we \nwill have an opportunity to vote on the Hutchison amendment, which is \nabsolutely fair to anyone who has been discriminated against in the \nworkplace but also does not create a plaintiffs' lawyer bailout, which \nis what is at stake if we pass this bill without the Hutchison \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It was in my \nenthusiasm that I neglected a few parliamentary housekeeping tasks.\n  On April 23, when we had the vote in the Senate to vote on the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act, we lost it by two votes. On that day, I said we \nwould continue our fight and that we needed to--we the women of America \nand the men who supported us--square our shoulders, suit up to fight \nfor a new American revolution. I called upon the other women of America \nto put their lipstick on and be ready to go. Well, today is ``go day.'' \nAnd we are actively debating this amendment.\n  One of the arguments that is often made is that this Fair Pay Act we \nare advocating could trigger either needless and enormous volumes of \nlawsuits or it creates a shifting ball of the statute of limitations. \nBoth of those criticisms are false.\n  First, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act will not trigger more \nlawsuits. Because this bill the Democrats are advocating--and, oh, by \nthe way, it is a bipartisan bill. We have over 54 cosponsors; \nRepublicans are joining with us. It does not in any way trigger \nenormous lawsuits, because it simply restores the law, with greater \nclarity, that existed before the outrageous Supreme Court decision.\n  We were not flooded with volumes of lawsuits on wage discrimination. \nThere was an orderly process that occurred.\n  The other is this floating statute of limitations argument. Well, \nthat is a foggy term. But I tell you what is foggy is the Hutchison \namendment.\n  Now, I so admire the gentlewoman from Texas. We have worked together, \nas I said, on many issues. I know her intentions are good, but her \nlanguage is flawed. I should say, not her language, but the language of \nher amendment. It is foggy.\n  Let me go on to this a little bit. The amendment does not address the \nfundamental problem of the pay discrimination case, Ledbetter v. \nGoodyear, which created unreal and strict limitations for filing pay \ndiscrimination claims. It also fails to recognize that pay \ndiscrimination, unlike other kinds of discrimination, is repeated each \ntime a worker receives an unfair paycheck.\n  I want to repeat that. The Hutchison amendment fails to recognize \nthat pay or wage discrimination, unlike other forms of discrimination, \nis repeated each time someone receives an unfair paycheck. Instead, the \nHutchison amendment creates a new confusing standard that requires \nworkers to either be subject to the Ledbetter rule or prove they had no \nreasonable suspicion of discrimination when the employer first decided \nto pay them.\n  Well, you have to prove a negative. That is almost impossible. From \nthe day you walk onto the job or the day your coworker who gets a \nraise, when the guys get it and the girls do not, you would have to be \nsnooping around and creating a very hostile workplace, branded a \ntroublemaker, because you were saying, well, you would have to every \nweek say, well, what did you get paid, Mr. Udall? What did you get \npaid, Mr. Tester? What did you get paid?\n  Well, I know we get paid the same pay, and I know we are doing the \nsame, equal work. But that is not true in the workplace. So we believe \nthe Hutchison amendment actually creates more fog than solutions.\n  I want to continue the debate on this. I note that the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas has not come in, but I see the gentleman from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak on her time.\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What I would recommend is kind of rotating back and \nforth every 5 minutes. That way everybody gets a chance to speak, \neveryone gets a chance to debate, and everyone will get a chance to \nvote at 11:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if you would let me know when 4 minutes \nhas expired.\n  I thank the chairwoman for allowing me to speak. I wanted to make the \nRecord clear. I am not in a fog about the Hutchison amendment. I think \nit makes a lot of sense. The reason I am on the floor is I have a \npretty good reputation of making sure that people have a fair day in \ncourt. There is nothing more important in a free democratic society \nthan to be able to take your cause to court and have your day in court. \nBut what we are doing here, in my opinion, is creating a statutory \nstatute of limitations that we have not seen before, that, quite \nfrankly, does not make a whole lot of sense to me, if we pass the bill \nthat came out of committee.\n  Let me tell you why. The ability to create a job in America and keep \na job here is very much at risk. The way we regulate, the way we \nlitigate, and the way we tax will determine if the business will create \na job in America or go somewhere else. We are on the verge, in my \nopinion, of having a taxation system, a regulatory system, and a \nlitigation system that is going to drive people out of business and \nleave this country.\n  Quite frankly, if we go down the road this bill is charting, we are \ngoing to make it harder to do business in this country and we will not \nenhance fairness. The whole concept of the Hutchison amendment is that \nyou have 180 days from the time you knew or should have known you are \nbeing discriminated against.\n  The Supreme Court case has a ruling that says you had 180 days from \nthe event. That does not seem quite fair to me. But this idea that you \ncould realize discrimination or know of it for 20 years and file a \nlawsuit 20 years later, based on the last paycheck, is not fair to the \nlegal system, and not fair to business, because a lot of the people \nhave left.\n  So this is not foggy at all to me. I think a fair process would be \nthat within 180 days of the time you knew or should have known you are \nbeing discriminated against in the workplace, you should file a lawsuit \nto preserve the evidence, to allow people to come in and testify with a \nfresh memory of what is going on.\n  That is not what we are doing here. We are allowing people to file \nlawsuits decades, potentially, after they knew or should have known \nthey were being discriminated against, and that would create legal \nchaos.\n  So we are not advancing fairness, we are creating a system that is \ngoing to make it harder to do business. And for those employees in the \nworkplace who count on their employer opening the door, they are going \nto lose, and the people who have been discriminated against in a \nlegitimate way are not going to be enhanced.\n  So to the Senator from Texas, I am not in a fog at all about what you \nare trying to do. I think you are trying to do a reasonable thing; that \nis, to protect the rights of people who have been discriminated against \nin a fair way, or have a claim that they think they may have been \ndiscriminated against in a fair way: 180 days from the time you knew or \nshould have known of the act of discrimination, not decades after you \nknew or should have known.\n  I think this is the right balance. And if we do not watch it as a \nNation--we live in a global economy. I want regulations that protect \nthe air and the water and the worker. I want a taxation system that \ncollects a fair amount from the American people to run this Government \non which we all depend. I want a legal system that gives everybody \ntheir day in court with no bias, a fairminded jury or judge deciding \nthe claim. If we don't watch it and we go down the road of this bill, \nwe are going to make it hard to do business in America, harder than it \nought to be, harder than fairness requires, and we are going to shut \nout some businesses because the ability to do business in this country \nis at risk in a global economy if we overtax and overregulate and we \nhave unfair litigation rules. The idea is to be fair and balanced.\n\n  The Hutchison amendment achieves that, and the base bill does not. I \nwill be supporting the Senator from Texas, opposing the bill coming out \nof committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina. I believe he laid it out very well. I am very concerned \nabout the broadening aspects of the underlying bill. As I have said on \nmany occasions, Senator Mikulski and I have worked on so many issues to \nadvance the cause of women, the rights of women, fair treatment of \nwomen. I would like to be able to support her bill, and I support the \nconcept of her bill.\n  My concern is in two major areas: One is the inability for a \nlegitimate defense to be raised if a person waits when they should have \nknown there was discrimination, to be able to address that immediately \nor within a reasonable amount of time. I want people to be able to \nraise the issue.\n  I have heard of company policies. I have worked in a place where it \nwas company policy that one didn't talk about pay. That was when I was \nmaking $600 a month. Maybe there was discrimination there. If there is \na company policy or a feeling in the company that if you talk about \npay, you are going to be punished or maybe even fired, then that makes \nthe statute of limitations not function at that point. That, then, is a \npolicy that is discriminatory. That is what we are trying to do: give \nthe right of the plaintiff to show that he or she could not have known, \ndidn't know, and could not have known.\n  The second area that is of great concern to me is the expansion of \nthe right of the plaintiff to go beyond the plaintiff himself or \nherself, to allow a person affected by the alleged discrimination to \nfile suit, which could even occur after the person is not even there or \nis dead. That is putting into our system a possibility that the person \nmight not have filed the claim on their own, didn't file it, might not \nhave wanted to, might have believed it wasn't the right thing to do, or \nmight have believed there were other areas that made up for what the \nperson might have thought was not right in one particular area, such as \nthe area where he or she worked or the amount of pay.\n  I think you have to have a right yourself, but when it is a tort in \nour English law, in our American law, that does not accrue to another \nperson generally. There are specific exceptions to that, but in general \nthe tort claim goes with the person against whom the tort is committed. \nIt should be that way in a discrimination area as well. So adding the \nability for someone to sue on behalf of someone who isn't suing for \nsomething that happened to the person who isn't suing is a trail that \nis going to go way beyond the fairness that we try to put into our \nlegal system.\n  I hope we can pass my amendment. I hope we can keep working on this \nbill. I wish there had been a markup in committee because there might \nhave been more of a capability to shape this bill so that it would be \nsomething that would meet the test of adding to a plaintiff's claim, \ncause of action, opportunities, but without producing such an unfair \ndisadvantage to anyone to be able to defend by having a statute of \nlimitations that is not effective and by increasing the capability of \nsomeone to make a claim on behalf of someone who has chosen or doesn't \nmake the claim.\n  I hope our colleagues will look at this issue. I hope we will be able \nto keep working on this matter. I would vote for this bill if my \namendment passes. It will be a much harder decision if my amendment \ndoes not pass because I know the struggles of small business. I have \ngreat admiration for people who are in small business. I have been in \nsmall business myself. I know many times margins are very thin, and you \nwant to make sure you know what your liabilities might be and that you \nhave the ability to plan for that. We want business to thrive. We want \nbusiness to keep employees. We don't want to do anything that causes \nfewer people to be employed because of greater potential liabilities. \nWe don't want to do anything that adds\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\nto the instability of the job market today. We want to help our \nbusinesses get through this time by keeping people working. I am afraid \nthe underlying bill will be a deterrent in that respect.\n  I appreciate those who have spoken for this amendment. I hope we can \ncontinue to work on it together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains in the debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland controls 25\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Texas controls 19 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the arguments \nthat have been made by the advocates for the Hutchison amendment. \nFirst, let me say this: If you are a business and you want to avoid a \nlawsuit, there is one clear remedy that does not require statutory \naction, and that is called give equal pay for equal or comparable work. \nIf you don't want to end up in court, you don't want to end up at the \nEEOC, you don't want to end up with a tattered and tarred reputation, \npay people equal pay. That is the way to avoid a lawsuit. Then you \ndon't need a law.\n  But, no, there are those in our country who still think we are back \nin the 20th or 19th centuries, and we are not going to put up with it. \nWe can talk about the 180-day rule and wage-setting decisions and so \non. I am a pragmatic, pro-business, pro-fairness Senator. My \ngrandmother ran a small bakery and was known as having the best \ndoughnuts in Maryland--well, certainly in Baltimore. My father ran a \nsmall grocery store. We paid equal pay for equal work.\n  When we talk about small business, I know about small business.\n  I also know the Hutchison amendment would create more problems. For \nexample, the discovery rule fails to hold employers fully accountable \nfor ongoing discrimination. That is a very big deal. If workers suspect \ndiscrimination but delay filing the claim for fear of retaliation or \nhopes that things could be worked out without litigation, they should \nnot be forced to suffer continued wage discrimination indefinitely. \nWage discrimination continues with every new unfair paycheck. If harm \nis ongoing, the remedy should be as well, regardless of when a worker \nlearned of it.\n  Doesn't this rule make things better for employers? No. The Hutchison \namendment is very vague and foggy. The rule encourages premature claims \nwhich is going to increase litigation. Workers are going to feel \ncompelled to file formal claims with the EEOC or take legal action for \nfear that they will be accused of delay. That is what the Supreme Court \naccused Lilly Ledbetter of. They didn't accuse Goodyear of \ndiscriminating in their paycheck. They accused Lilly Ledbetter of delay \nand Lilly Ledbetter lost out.\n  There is a new day coming, including on the Supreme Court. I can't \nwait for those votes. Workers will feel compelled, as I said, to file \nformal claims quickly.\n  The Hutchison amendment adopts an uncertain legal requirement that \nwill increase litigation costs for workers and employers alike. It also \ncreates an environment that is hostile. It means if you are a worker, \nyou have to act on rumor or speculation. My gosh, this is like the \nFrench Revolution and letters of cachet, and it was rumored that they \nwere not faithful to concepts of the Revolution. We can't have that in \nour workplace. We have to have a workplace that we are all in together. \nSo the Hutchison amendment is well intentioned but deeply flawed in the \nvery objective that it seeks to accomplish.\n  I hope we defeat the Hutchison amendment and move on with debating \nother amendments.\n  I also want to say to the Senator from Texas, if I may have her \nattention, we are going to have a vote, up or down, on her amendment. I \nwill not move to table. I think she deserves a clear vote, the way we \nare talking about a new style of civility and openness and so on. At \nthe conclusion, that would be the process, rather than going through a \ntabling motion. Is that agreeable with the Senator?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I appreciate that very much from the Senator from \nMaryland, as always, because I would like an up-or-down vote. This is \nan amendment that is the decision on this bill. I appreciate that. This \nwhole debate has been sort of the test. Harry Reid said we would be \nable to have amendments. Our leader said we would take up the \namendments that would be relevant to this labor issue. I think everyone \nhas performed admirably. I hope we can keep going. I thank the Senator \nvery much.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 31\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in the interest of time, I have filed \nthree amendments. I know the majority leader wants to move this \nthrough, so I am going to call up one of them and not speak on it at \nthis time during the discussion and debate of the Hutchison amendment. \nI ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call up \nthe DeMint amendment No. 31 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Withholding the right to object pending an inquiry, is \nit the Senator's purpose simply to call it up so we can consider it \nlater today?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I just want to get it pending. I will not speak on it \nright now.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint], for himself \n     and Mr. Vitter, proposes an amendment numbered 31.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To preserve and protect the free choice of individual \n employees to form, join, or assist labor organizations, or to refrain \n                         from such activities)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RIGHT TO WORK.\n\n       (a) National Labor Relations Act.--\n       (1) Rights of employees.--Section 7 of the National Labor \n     Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 157) is amended by striking ``except \n     to'' and all that follows through ``authorized in section \n     8(a)(3)''.\n       (2) Unfair labor practices.--Section 8 of the National \n     Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 158) is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a)(3), by striking ``: Provided, That'' \n     and all that follows through ``retaining membership'';\n       (B) in subsection (b)--\n       (i) in paragraph (2), by striking ``or to discriminate'' \n     and all that follows through ``retaining membership''; and\n       (ii) in paragraph (5), by striking ``covered by an \n     agreement authorized under subsection (a)(3) of this \n     section''; and\n       (C) in subsection (f), by striking clause (2) and \n     redesignating clauses (3) and (4) as clauses (2) and (3), \n     respectively.\n       (b) Amendment to the Railway Labor Act.--Section 2 of the \n     Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 152) is amended by striking \n     paragraph Eleven.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 25\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment be reinstated for the debate and the vote as previously \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is pending.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just want to say my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from Maryland, said it is easy for an employer \nto know they will not have a liability; just pay equal. Simple: Pay \nequal. But let me give you an example of what an employer actually \nfaces.\n  You take the situation where, say, an employer owns a bakery. One \nemployee punches in at 8, leaves at 4, does an adequate job during that \ntime, and that employee is paid one wage. Another employee always stays \nlate when\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\nthere is a need to stay late for a reason and comes in early if the \nemployer has a big order and needs help early, and the second employee \nis paid more than the first one. But the first one believes there is \ndiscrimination for some reason--age, race, gender--and, therefore, \nbelieves they have a claim.\n  That is not a situation where the employer should have to pay exactly \nthe same to two different people when one goes the extra mile and one \ndoes not. This is just one example a person who has been in small \nbusiness can tell you happens every day in every business in our \ncountry. The people who go the extra mile, who do a little more, should \nbe able to be rewarded. That is what ownership of a business thrives \non.\n  So I think to just say: Just don't discriminate, is to say, well, if \none person is doing more, adding more to the business, and becoming \nmore productive, we should have the ability as an employer to allow \nthat person to make a little more or do something extra. So I do not \nthink we want to get into a situation where you are only to pay the \nsame wage for two different people who bring different things to the \ntable. That is why we have lawsuits. It is why we have EEOC, to make \nthose judgment calls.\n  So I am trying to make sure we keep an equal and level playing field \nso people who own a business who are struggling in this very tough \neconomy have the ability to make the decisions that will keep those \nemployees employed and make the judgment calls so that an owner--who is \nthe one signing the checks, the one signing the loan applications, the \none putting forth their whole livelihood and their family's security--\nalso has a fair chance in any kind of a dispute to do what is best for \nthe business and for the employees of the business.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Texas to speak on this issue. She has been an unabashed and----\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from California, not Texas.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Excuse me. The Senator from California. It is the big \nState, with big gals here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You got it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from California has been such a \nlongstanding and faithful advocate for those who have been left out and \nleft behind and particularly an intrepid voice for women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much, I say to Senator Mikulski.\n  The bill Senator Mikulski is urging us to vote for simply restores \nthe law to what it was in almost every State in the country before the \nSupreme Court dealt us a very serious blow and said, in fact, you had \nto move from the minute the discrimination started.\n  Well, what if you had no clue you were being discriminated against, \njust like Lilly Ledbetter, who did not know until an anonymous note \nappeared from a male colleague, and he told her: The men who are doing \nthe same work as you are getting paid far more. Well, she did not know \nthat for years and years and years. Although the lower courts acted in \nthe right fashion, the Supreme Court, in the tightest of decisions, \ndestroyed what I consider to be the ability to recover damages when you \nhave been blatantly and unabashedly discriminated against simply \nbecause you are a woman.\n  Now, I urge my colleagues to defeat these pernicious amendments that \nare coming. As to the one from my friend, Senator Hutchison, believe \nme, it is a wolf in sheep's clothing. If we adopt the Hutchison \namendment, people such as Lilly Ledbetter simply would not be helped. \nThe Hutchison amendment essentially adopts the flawed decision by the \nSupreme Court in the Ledbetter case. It creates a confusing new \nstandard for employees. Let's not take my word for it or Senator \nMikulski's word for it. Let's take the words of the National Women's \nLaw Center. Their whole life has been spent fighting for women's \nrights.\n  What do they say? They say: Under the Hutchison amendment--and I am \nquoting--``employees are left without any remedy against present, \ncontinuing pay discrimination if they do not file a complaint within \n180 days of the first day when they `have or should have expected to \nhave' enough information to suspect discrimination.''\n  Well, take Lilly Ledbetter. If you never met her, she is the most \nhard-working, direct individual I have ever met. She worked so hard for \nGoodyear Tire. She had no clue, no time to think about whether she was \ngetting equal pay. She got up in the morning, she got dressed for work, \nand she worked hard, never suspecting her work would not be rewarded in \nan equal fashion to her male counterparts.\n  Under the Hutchison amendment, she is left out in the cold, and all \nthose other women who have no clue. Sometimes discrimination is carried \nout in a way that you have no way of knowing that it is happening.\n  Now, in the Senate, we have open books. Everybody can see what I \nmake, what my staff makes. It is clear. If there is any discrimination \ngoing on, you can ferret it out, figure it out, and, by the way, you \nhave a cause to seek recompense. We do not have a situation as they do \nin the private sector where it is a totally private situation. So it \ncould be you could be working for years and years and years and never \nknow.\n  This bill on which Senator Mikulski is leading us is so important \nbecause it says every time you get a paycheck, that 180 days runs, so \nyou have a chance to make up for this discrimination. So I say to my \nfriends, you are going to see these amendments coming at you. Do not \nfall for them. Do not fall for them because they actually undermine, \nundercut, and destroy what we are trying to do for the women of \nAmerica.\n  I say to my friend, Senator Mikulski, how proud I am to stand with \nher. She feels this issue in her heart of hearts. She is a working \nwoman. She comes from a working-class family. I have to say, I came \nfrom a family where my mother never even went to high school. She could \nnot graduate because she was forced to go to the workplace to support \nher parents. The thought of my mother working so hard every day and \nhaving someone in the workplace say: Don't worry about that little lady \nover there, she has no power, no clout; we can pay her less than we pay \na man--and I am sure that occurred because this was a long time ago--\nthe thought of my mother in the workplace being discriminated against \nand not having the opportunity to do anything about it really sets me \noff.\n  I think about all the moms out there in the workplace and I think \nabout the grandmas in the workplace. I think about single women in the \nworkplace. They have a right to be protected.\n  Vote no on Hutchison; vote no on Specter; vote yes on the underlying \nMikulski bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I control the time.\n  Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Montana, a \nvery good friend on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland for her leadership on this issue. \nThis is a critically important issue in this country today.\n  I would also like to welcome the Senator from New Mexico in the \nChair. It is good to see you there.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Act. It is a fair, commonsense piece of legislation that honors the \nhard work and dedication of a great Montanan, that Montanan being \nJeannette Rankin, who was America's first Congresswoman, an outspoken \npeace activist and a champion of equal rights.\n  Congresswoman Rankin would have voted yes today because she fought so \nhard for equality and fairness.\n  Every employee deserves to earn the same pay for doing the same work, \nregardless of artificial timelines. Lilly Ledbetter worked at Goodyear \nTire Company for 19 years, and she discovered she was being paid \nsignificantly less than her male colleagues for doing the exact same \namount of work. A jury agreed. The jury awarded Ms. Ledbetter \nsignificant--significant--damages. The U.S. Supreme Court said\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\ntoo much time had passed since her first paycheck, and the Court ruled \nthat Ms. Ledbetter's claim was invalid and even took away that jury \naward. Thankfully, this legislation undoes that wrongheaded decision. \nIt clarifies the law to make it fair to America's workers.\n  When he signed the original Equal Pay Act in 1963, President Kennedy \nsaid protecting America's workers against pay discrimination is ``basic \nto democracy.'' Forty-six years after President Kennedy signed that \nhistoric piece of bipartisan legislation, American women still make \nonly 77 cents for every dollar a man makes for doing the same work. \nAfrican-American workers make 18 percent less, while Latinos make 28 \npercent less for doing the same work. American Indians make even less.\n  Nearly 100 years after Jeannette Rankin came to Congress, we cannot \nignore this kind of discrimination. We have a duty to speak out against \npay discrimination and to make sure the law is clear. Hard-working \nAmericans deserve nothing less than equal pay for equal work.\n  Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to pass the Lilly Ledbetter \nFair Pay Act.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland controls 9 minutes \n35 seconds. The Senator from Texas controls 13 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to reserve my time. There is \nanother speaker coming down now on my side. The Senator from Maryland \nmay wish to go forward or we may wish to wait and have the time equally \ndivided.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, while we are working this out, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum, with the time equally divided, while we \nestablish our next steps forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are in the closing minutes of the \ndebate on the Hutchison substitute. We know there is one more speaker \nbesides the Senator from Mississippi. This is not going to be my last \nsay for this bill, but I do wish to offer my concluding arguments on \nthe Hutchison amendment.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the record a Q on the \nquestion of the Hutchison amendment because when all is said and done, \nI wish for there to be a very clear record on congressional intent so \nwe won't have the type of Supreme Court decisions that brought us here \ntoday.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to have a Q on the Hutchison amendment \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Q & A on the Hutchison Amendment\n\n        Q: What does Senator Hutchison's amendment do?\n       A: The amendment doesn't address the fundamental problem of \n     the pay discrimination case, Ledbetter v. Goodyear, which \n     created unrealistic limits for filing pay discrimination \n     claims. It also fails to recognize that pay discrimination, \n     unlike other kinds of discrimination, is repeated each time a \n     worker receives an unfair paycheck. Instead, the amendment \n     creates a confusing new standard that requires workers to \n     either be subject to the Ledbetter rule, or prove that they \n     had no reasonable suspicion of discrimination when the \n     employer first decided to pay them less than others.\n       Q: Would Senator Hutchison's amendment have solved the \n     problems for Lilly Ledbetter?\n       A: No. The Hutchison amendment would have imposed \n     additional burdens on Ms. Ledbetter and increased the costs \n     of her litigation. It is impossible to show exactly when a \n     worker would have known discrimination was occurring. Yet the \n     Hutchison amendment forces workers to prove a negative--that \n     they did not have information to suspect discrimination. This \n     unnecessary requirement will lead to confusion and needless \n     litigation. Goodyear argued that Ms. Ledbetter should have \n     realized earlier based on workplace rumors that she was a \n     victim of discrimination, even though they kept salaries \n     hidden. Ms. Ledbetter would have had to spend time and \n     resources litigating this issue, which has nothing to do with \n     the real problem of discrimination.\n       Q: Isn't the Hutchison amendment a fair approach to the \n     problem, since it gives a claim to workers who have no way of \n     discovering discrimination within 180 days of an employer's \n     pay-setting decision?\n       A: No. The discovery rule fails to hold employers fully \n     accountable for ongoing discrimination. If workers suspect \n     discrimination, but delay filing a claim for fear of \n     retaliation or in hopes of working things out without \n     litigation, they should not be forced to suffer continued pay \n     discrimination indefinitely. Pay discrimination continues \n     with every new unfair paycheck. If the harm is ongoing, the \n     remedy should be as well--regardless of when a worker learned \n     of it.\n       Q: Doesn't this rule make things better for employers?\n       A: Not at all. The rule encourages premature claims, which \n     will increase litigation. Workers will feel compelled file \n     formal claims quickly, for fear that they will be accused of \n     delay, even if the only evidence they have is based on rumors \n     or speculation. In addition, the amendment adopts an \n     uncertain legal requirement that will increase litigation \n     costs for workers and employers alike.\n       Q: Is there a better way of fixing the problem created by \n     the Ledbetter case?\n       A: The bipartisan Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act creates a \n     fair, bright-line rule that workers and employers can easily \n     understand, and which was applied by most courts and the EEOC \n     under both Republican and Democratic Administrations before \n     the Ledbetter decision.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Now, let's get to the facts. The difference between the \nHutchison alternative and the Lilly Ledbetter bill is this: The Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act restores the law to the way it was before the \nSupreme Court decision, Ledbetter v. Goodyear. The Hutchison \nalternative creates a whole new legal standard which regrettably is \nvery vague and I am concerned will trigger a tremendous amount of \nlawsuits and further add to hostility and suspicion in the workplace. \nThe issue of triggering more lawsuits as an argument for the Hutchison \nalternative is flawed because the Hutchison substitute will create \nconfusion in the courts and for employers trying to interpret when \nemployees should have known they were being discriminated against. The \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act establishes a legal framework that had been \naccepted by nine appellate courts and the EEOC, and it has been a \nstandard that has stood essentially the test of time.\n  Let's go to the statute of limitations. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct says it is 180 days from the last unequal paycheck, not from the \ninitial point of hiring or the initial point of a discriminatory pay \nraise. The Hutchison alternative goes 180 days from when employees have \nor should have been expected to have knowledge that they were being \ndiscriminated against. This ``expected to have'' is really what is so \nfoggy. Also, as long as employers are discriminating, employees can get \njustice. Under the Hutchison alternative, employees have no remedy if \nthe claim is not brought when they should have known. I don't know when \nyou should have known.\n  Also, the Lilly Ledbetter Act gives workers a chance to figure out \nwhether they are being discriminated against, approach the employer, \nand perhaps have an alternative dispute resolution on this before EEOC \ncomplaints, before going to court, and so on. I am concerned that the \nHutchison amendment language ``should have known''--this ``should have \nknown,'' where you would have to operate on rumor and speculation--will \nforce many lawsuits as employees will sue before running out of time.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act also gives workers a chance to be \nable to resolve this. If an employer is currently paying women less \nthan men, that is illegal. Under the Hutchison amendment, it forces \nemployees to prove when they suspect discrimination. I have made that \npoint over and over.\n  So in summary, I say to the private and nonprofit sector: If you \ndon't want to be sued, don't discriminate. That is the best way to go. \nIf you don't want to be sued, don't discriminate.\n  The other point I wish to make is that the Fair Pay Act doesn't only \naffect women, it affects anyone who might be discriminated against in \nwages. So that means yes for women, but this bill would cover you if \nyou have been discriminated against on the basis of race, ethnicity, \nnational origin, religion, and the traditional forms\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\nof discrimination that regrettably we have dealt with. So this bill is \nnot a women-only bill. We women certainly wouldn't discriminate against \nother people.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act takes us to where we need to be to \nfully implement the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If we have a dream, I \nhave one too: that we pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are 5 minutes away from voting. The \nlast speaker on my side was not able to make it, so I wish to close on \nmy amendment.\n  What some courts around our country do is allow a plaintiff to say \nthat he or she knew or didn't know, allow the person to say why they \ndidn't know, and let the plaintiff go forward to give their defense or \nto give this statement as the reason why the statute of limitations \nshould be tolled. In many jurisdictions, this is accepted and the \nstatute of limitations is tolled.\n  What my substitute does is codify this so every jurisdiction will \nallow the plaintiff to have a right to say: I didn't know, and here is \nwhy I didn't know, and I need to be able to toll the statute of \nlimitations to have my rightful amount of pay or the job I have been \ndenied. It codifies so that it is clear. It brings clarity to the law \nand a unification of all the districts' views that this plaintiff \nshould be allowed to say: I could not have known, and that is why I \ndidn't file my claim earlier.\n  The other part of my amendment that I think is very important is that \nit does not allow the added person who is not the person who alleges \nthe discrimination to still file a lawsuit on behalf of that person who \ndid not file the lawsuit. That is in the underlying bill. I think it is \na huge increase in another area of litigation that we don't have in the \nlaw today. In fact, in most tort claims we don't allow that because it \nis important when a person has a claim that they make the decision to \npursue that claim. Having another person who might claim to be affected \nby the discrimination against someone else really takes one into a \nwhole other realm of ``he said, she said.'' Well, why would an heir be \nable to file when the other person didn't? Maybe the person is gone, \nmaybe the person is dead, maybe the person did not want to make this \nclaim or would have had they been alive and they could make the \ndecision. It just adds an element of instability in the system that I \ndon't think we have seen really in any other area of the law.\n  I want to have a fair judicial system. I want there to be more rights \nfor the plaintiff to be able to come forward and sue for discrimination \nif they feel they have been discriminated against and to be able to \nsay: I didn't know, I couldn't have known, our company doesn't let us \ntalk about what we make, and have that before the court because I don't \nwant anyone in this country to be discriminated against.\n  I also want a businessperson--a small businessperson, a big \nbusinessperson, anyone who is creating jobs in our country and trying \nto make it so that we keep our economy strong and keep jobs from being \nlet go--I want that person to have a fair chance too. If you have a \nperson who files a claim when the supervisor who is alleged to have \nmade the discrimination is dead, that is a problem for the company to \nbe able to make a defense, and that is what this whole case is about.\n  I believe Lilly Ledbetter was a good employee. I think she probably \nput forward her claim believing she had a discrimination, and I believe \nshe probably did. I believe she started at a lower level, and even \nthough she was increased at the same level every year as her peers, \nbecause she started out at the bottom or at a lesser level, that did \ncause discrimination.\n  If she had brought the claim in a timely way when she first knew or \nshould have known because of a note that she received that was \nanonymous, then she probably would have been able to prevail.\n  I think she is a good and nice person, but we are setting a standard \nin the law that is going to make it very difficult for businesses to \nknow what their liability is if a person claims something that happened \n6, 8, 10 years ago. Not being able to have the records, not being able \nto have the witnesses, not being able to have the memories of people is \ngoing to be a significant deterrent for the employer to run the \nbusiness.\n  I particularly have a place in my heart for small businesses because \nI know it is very difficult for a small business to make the salaries \nand the payroll and to put their livelihoods on the line.\n  I want to make sure we are fair to everyone. I want a person who is \ndiscriminated against to have a right of action. I do. I have said it \nbefore, I have been discriminated against. I know how it feels to be on \nthe lower level when you know you are working harder. I know. But it is \nso important that also the person I am working for have a chance to \ndefend with their witnesses and their records and let the court have \neverything to make a fair decision.\n  In America, one of the things we have prided ourselves on that was \nput in the Constitution by our Founding Fathers is fairness, justice. \nWe are a country that prides itself on fairness and justice. We have to \nmake sure we continue to have equal rights of plaintiffs and defendants \nto be heard, and that is what my amendment does.\n  If my amendment is adopted, I know we will add to the plaintiffs' \ncapabilities, but with a fair right for the defense to make their case. \nAnd that is what our justice system should be.\n  I hope we will adopt this amendment. I hope we can keep working on \nthis bill. I am sure there are other things we can do. I would like for \nus to talk about the ability to have a negotiation. I tolled the \nstatute of limitations when a point is brought up and there is a \nnegotiation, an arbitration going on between an employer and an \nemployee. When we go to conference, if my amendment is adopted, and we \ncan work something like that out, I will be for it. I think it is a \nfair point because we do want to have the total ability of the \nplaintiff to be able to make his or her case, and we want to keep \npeople employed in this country, and we do not want there to be a \ndeterrent for small businesses to keep the people they have employed so \nwe can get the economy going again in this country and go back to the \nfull employment we had maybe 2 years ago and try to make sure we don't \nhave in any way a deterrent for people to know what their liabilities \nare and start pulling back.\n  I hope we can adopt my amendment and continue to work on this bill.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have now concluded the debate on the \nHutchison amendment. It is time for change. It is time to turn the page \nrather than turn back the clock. It is time to defeat the Hutchison \namendment and proceed with the bill. We have five pending amendments. \nWe are fired up, and we are ready to go.\n  I yield back my time, and if the Senator does so, I will ask for the \nyeas and nays and then vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield back my time, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 25 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin) and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 40, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 7 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--40\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\n\n     Murkowski\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Hagan\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Harkin\n     Kennedy\n       \n  The amendment (No. 25) was rejected.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been making progress on this bill. \nPeople are cooperating. While we have a lot of Senators in the Chamber, \nI have to add that we have a lot of work to do. I mentioned briefly \nyesterday, and I will say briefly again today, when the time is up, the \nvote is going to be cut off. It will affect Republicans and Democrats, \nbut maybe we will get here in time to vote. We cannot hold up this \nplace, we have so much work to do. We are going to finish Ledbetter \ntoday or tonight. Whatever it takes, we will finish that. I think we \nhave set a good tone. I hope I do not have to file cloture on this \ntonight for a Saturday cloture vote. I don't want to do that. We have a \nlot of other things we can do that we can get done and not have to mess \nwith the weekend.\n  I am in touch with the Republican leader, and I think we have a way \nof moving forward next week, but everyone who has amendments to offer \non Ledbetter should do it today and we can finish this early this \nevening, late this afternoon, or sometime tonight.\n  We have other things to do. We have nominations we have to move. I \nspoke to the Republican floor staff today. They said they are hotlining \na number of nominations. President Obama is getting very anxious on the \nnominations that have not been approved. He wants to get that done as \nquickly as possible, to get the country moving with the Cabinet spots \nbeing filled.\n  The manager of the bill, Senator Mikulski, is in charge of this \nlegislation, as she is in charge of everything in her life. I \nappreciate her good work, and we are going to move this bill. She \nunderstands we are going to finish this bill today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Taking the lead from the majority leader, would now be \nan appropriate time to call up an amendment I have filed at the desk? I \ncall up amendment No. 37.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. The only problem, I say to my friend from Georgia, is we do \nnot have a copy of it. If we could see it, that would be terrific.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The staff is copying it now.\n  Mr. REID. What we are trying to do, I say to Senator Isakson and the \nrest of the people in the Chamber, is, we have a number of amendments \nthat have been filed. We want to try to set them up. We want to try to \nset up a process to get rid of the amendments that have already been \nfiled. We certainly look forward to the Senator from Georgia offering \nthe amendment.\n  I see no reason we should not go ahead and have the Senator offer \nthat now. Everyone should be alerted we are going to have the managers \nof this legislation clear the decks after Senator Isakson offers his \namendment. If people want to offer amendments after that, certainly \nthat is appropriate. But we are going to get rid of these amendments \neither by tabling them or having votes on them after people have had \nenough debate on them.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mine is a short amendment. I can summarize with a one-\ncompound sentence explanation. Do you want me to do it now or later?\n  Mr. REID. I saw it. Just lay it down now.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 37\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I would like to lay down amendment No. \n37, the Isakson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 37.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To limit the application of the Act to claims resulting from \ndiscriminatory compensation decisions, that are adopted on or after the \n                     date of enactment of the Act)\n\n       On page 7, strike lines 11 through 20 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--This Act, and the amendments made by this \n     Act, take effect on the date of enactment of this Act, except \n     as provided in subsection (b).\n       (b) Claims.--This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, \n     shall apply to each claim of discrimination in compensation \n     under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \n     2000e et seq.), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.), title I and section 503 of the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and sections 501 and \n     504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, if--\n       (1) the claim results from a discriminatory compensation \n     decision and\n       (2) the discriminatory compensation decision is adopted on \n     or after that date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, would it be appropriate now for me to \ngive that one-line explanation or wait until the manager of the bill is \nback? Shall I go ahead now?\n  Mr. President, amendment No. 37 is very simple. It says the \nprovisions of this legislation take effect on the day the legislation \nbecomes law and is not retroactive, which is obviously the intent of \neverything we do. So any incident that occurred in the past could not \nbe reopened for litigation, but any case after the day of enactment \nwould be governed by the provisions of the law as they are in the new \nlegislation. I think it is a simple, straightforward amendment, and I \nurge its adoption at the appropriate time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, it is unbelievable to me that more than \nfour decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil \nRights Act women are only making 78 cents on the dollar for every \ndollar a man makes. Discrimination takes many forms. Sometimes it is \nbrazen and in your face, like Jim Crow and apartheid, and sometimes it \nis silent and insidious. That is what is happening in workplaces all \nacross America today.\n  Millions of female-dominated jobs--social workers, teachers, \nchildcare workers, nurses, and so many more--are equivalent in effort, \nresponsibility, education, et cetera, to male-dominated jobs, but they \npay dramatically less. The Census Bureau has compiled data on hundreds \nof job categories, but it found only five job categories where women \ntypically earn as much as men, five out of hundreds.\n  Defenders of this status quo offer all manner of bogus explanations \nas to why women make less. How many times have I heard the fairy tale \nthat women work for fulfillment but men work to support their families? \nThis ignores, first of all, so many single women who work to support \nthemselves and their families, and married\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\nwomen whose paycheck is all that allows their families to make ends \nmeet and educate their kids. It also ignores the harsh reality that so \nmany women face in the workplace that they have to work twice as hard \nto be taken seriously or they get pushed into being a cashier instead \nof a more lucrative sales job. These acts of discrimination deny women \nfair pay, but they also deny women basic dignity.\n  Let me cite one example of what I am talking about. Last year, in a \nhearing before our Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, we \nheard testimony from Dr. Philip Cohen of the University of North \nCarolina. Dr. Cohen compared nurses' aides, who are overwhelmingly \nwomen, and truckdrivers, who are overwhelmingly men. In both groups the \naverage age is 43. Both require ``medium amounts of strength,'' and in \nsome cases nurses' aides have to be stronger than truckdrivers. \nTruckdrivers now have power steering and power brakes and stuff like \nthat. Nurses' aides have to pick up patients and turn them over and \nstuff like that. Nurses' aides on average have more education and more \ntraining than truckdrivers. But nurses' aides make less than 60 percent \nof what a truckdriver makes.\n  Given that this discrimination is so obvious and pervasive, you would \nexpect that women would have no trouble obtaining simple justice \nthrough our court system, but in a major decision in June of 2007 in \nthe case of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, the Supreme \nCourt took us back. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the Court made it extremely \ndifficult for women to go to court to pursue claims of pay \ndiscrimination, even in cases where the discrimination is flagrant. A \njury acknowledged that Lilly Ledbetter, a former supervisor at \nGoodyear, had been paid $6,000 a year less than her lowest paid male \ncounterpart. But the Supreme Court rejected her discrimination claim. \nWhy? The Court held that women workers must file a discrimination claim \nwithin 180 days of their pay being set when they were first hired, even \nif they were not aware at the time their pay was significantly lower \nthan their male counterparts.\n  That is important to note. The Court said you have to file your \ndiscrimination claim within 180 days of your pay being set when you are \nhired, even if you don't know, even if you did not know that your pay \nwas significantly lower than your male counterparts.\n  As Justice Ginsburg said in a forceful dissent, this is totally out \nof touch with the real world of the workplace. In the real world, pay \nscales are often kept secret, employees are often kept in the dark \nabout coworkers' salaries. Lacking such information, how can you \ndetermine when your pay discrimination begins? Furthermore, the vast \ndiscrepancies are often a function of time. If your original pay was \njust a little bit lower than your colleagues' pay, but you worked there \nfor 20 years and you all get pay raises, you can see over 20 years that \ngap widens and widens and widens.\n  So what started out to be a small gap winds up being a big gap over a \nperiod of time. Now, in the case of Lilly Ledbetter, not only was she \ndiscriminated against for all of her lifetime of work at Goodyear \nbecause she started out at a lower pay scale, that gap widened over \ntime, but she is also now going to be discriminated against for the \nrest of her life in terms of her pension. Because she is making so much \nless than her male counterparts, her pension is going to be less.\n  But Lilly Ledbetter did not get discriminated against once, she got \ndiscriminated against for over 20 years, and now for the rest of her \nlifetime in terms of the pension she gets. So what the Supreme Court \ndecision means is that once that 180-day window for bringing a lawsuit \nis passed, this discrimination gets grandfathered in. This creates a \nfree harbor for employers who have paid female workers less than men \nover a long period of time. Basically, it gives the worst offenders a \nfree pass to continue their gender discrimination.\n  Think about it. Once the 180 days has passed, the employer is home \nfree. So you hire women, you pay them a little bit less than their male \ncounterparts, but they do not know that because you do not publish the \ncoworkers' salaries. After 180 days, you are home free. You can \ncontinue that discrimination for the next 10, 15, 20, 25 years, and \nthere is not a darn thing a woman can do about it under that Supreme \nCourt 5-to-4 decision.\n  Well, now, I also heard several businesses were complaining that if \nwe peg, if we peg the 180-day limit to the continued payment of \ndiscriminatory paychecks, which is what this bill before us does, they \nwill keep accruing liability. So the companies will continue to accrue \nliability.\n  Well, there is a simple answer to that. They can stop the clock \nanytime they want. Go through the books one day, make sure all the \nwomen are being paid fairly. On that day, you stop sending everyone \ndiscriminatory paychecks. On that day, everyone gets a fair deal. On \nthat day, you stop accruing liability.\n  The very thought that an employer would say: Well, we cannot have \nthis bill, the Lilly Ledbetter bill we are talking about, because, gee, \nyou know, after 180 days I keep accruing liability. Well, stop it. Stop \npaying the discriminatory pay. Go through your books, find out what the \ndiscrimination is, if it exists, and pay everyone fairly.\n  Ledbetter was a bad decision. As Justice Ginsburg says, it ignores \nthe reality of today's workplace. I am glad to work together with \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Mikulski, champions of this effort, to \nreverse the damage done by that decision.\n  This bill would establish that the unlawful employment practice under \nthe Civil Rights Act is the payment, is the payment, of a \ndiscriminatory salary, not the original setting of the pay level.\n  It would be a great miscarriage of justice for this Senate to tell \nLilly Ledbetter that her 20 years of discrimination, and the resulting \nloss of income in retirement, in her pensions should go unchecked \nbecause she did not have a crystal ball telling her what her coworkers \nwere making at the time her pay was set. She had no way of knowing \nthat.\n  While the need for the passage of this legislation is critical and \nimmediate, it is not enough. It is not good enough to go back to the \nway the law worked 2 years ago, because at that time, women were still \nmaking only 78 cents on the dollar as compared to men. That should be \nintolerable in our society.\n  Moreover, if pay scales are kept secret, if there is not some \ntransparency, how can women know if they are being discriminated \nagainst? That is why we need to pass the Fair Pay Act, which I have \nintroduced in every Congress starting in 1996, the Fair Pay Act. Not \nonly does that act require that employers provide equal pay for \nequivalent jobs, my bill also requires the disclosure of pay scales and \nrates for all job categories at a given company.\n  This will give women the information they need to identify \ndiscriminatory pay practices. This could reduce the need for costly \nlitigation in the first place. Now, I am not saying a company has to \npublish the salary of every single person. That is not what I am \nsaying. What our bill says, the Fair Pay Act says, is you have to make \ntransparent what the pay scales are in categories, certain categories.\n  Now, I asked Lilly Ledbetter, when she appeared before our committee \na year ago, I think it was, I asked her about the Fair Pay Act. I said: \nIf you had had this kind of information when you first went to work, \ncould you have negotiated for better pay and avoided the litigation? \nAnd she said: Yes. But she did not have that information. Well, there \nare countless more Lilly Ledbetters out there who are paid less than \ntheir male coworkers but will never know about it unless they have this \nkind of information. My Fair Pay Act amends the Fair Labor Standards \nAct of 1938 to prohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on the \nbasis of sex, race, national origin. Most importantly, it requires each \nindividual employer to provide equal pay for jobs that are comparable \nin skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions.\n  We know about the Paycheck Fairness Act. I support that also. But we \nhave the Equal Pay Act that was passed in, I think, 1963--1963--which \nsays that, if a woman has the same job as a man, equal pay for equal \njobs, you have to pay them the same. That has been in law since 1963. \nTo be sure, it has not been enforced enough, and that is why we need \nthe paycheck fairness bill that is here, to enforce it more.\n\n[[Page S747]]\n\n  But the fact is, it has been the law since 1963, equal pay for the \nsame job. What we now need to address 45, 49, 46 years later is equal \npay for equivalent work because so many jobs in our society are kind of \ndenoted as ``women's jobs.'' Are they crucial to our society? You bet \nthey are.\n  But for some reason, because they are ``women's jobs,'' they get paid \nless. I used the example of a truckdriver. Philip Cohen, from the \nUniversity of North Carolina, testified before our committee, and he \ngave this example. They did a large study. I will repeat it again for \nemphasis sake of truckdrivers and nurses' aides.\n  Truckdrivers, overwhelmingly men; nurses' aides, overwhelmingly \nwomen; medium age for all of them, 43. They both require median levels \nof strength. Truckdrivers do not need a lot of strength anymore; they \nhave power steering and power brakes and everything else. Nurses' aides \nstill have to lift people and duties such as that. So a median amount \nof strength is required. Nurses' aides actually have more education and \nmore training than truckdrivers. Yet nurses' aides are paid less than \n60 percent of what a truckdriver makes.\n  Why is that? Is it somehow nurses' aides are not as important as a \ntruckdriver? I will be glad to debate that any day of the week. When \nyou are ill or when you need long-term care, do you want a truck driver \nor a nurses' aide? Answer me that question. I think a truckdriver is \nimportant, I do not mean to denigrate them, but I am saying nurses' \naides are every bit as important.\n  Childcare workers. What could be more important to our country than \ntaking care of our country's youngest children? Mostly women, grossly \nunderpaid, compared to male workers in terms of skill, effort, \nresponsibility, and working conditions.\n  A lot of people say: Well, you know, we cannot--this is all nice pie-\nin-the-sky stuff. We cannot do it. But 20 States, 20 States have fair \npay policies in place for their State employees, including my State of \nIowa. I would point out the State of Iowa passed a fair pay bill for \nall State employees in 1985, when we had a Republican governor and a \nRepublican legislature.\n  Oh, the sky was going to fall. This was going to cost our taxpayers \nenormous sums of money. Well, the sky did not fall. Women are making \nmore money, and our State is better for it. I might point out that our \nneighbor to the north, Minnesota, not only has fair pay policies for \ntheir State employees, they have it for their municipal and local \nworkers also.\n  Twenty States have done this for State employees. So, again, this \nshould not be any kind of partisan issue. Some people say: We do not \nneed any more laws, that market forces will take care of the wage gap. \nBut experience shows there are some injustices the market simply will \nnot rectify. That is why we did pass the Equal Pay Act in 1963, why we \npassed the Civil Rights Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the \nbill that has my name on it, the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n  Were there market forces out there pushing to end discrimination \nagainst people with disabilities? No. But we did it. We are better off. \nThat is the same way market forces are not going to take care of this, \nthis issue of unequal pay for women in so many jobs in our country.\n  I guess now that we are on the Enzi amendment, which would eliminate \nthe language saying that those affected by discriminatory pay practices \ncan sue--well, I am glad about one thing, that my colleagues are \nacknowledging discrimination hurts everyone because it does. It hurts \neveryone in two ways. First, an injury to one is an injury to all. But, \nsecond, I defy you to find a person in America who does not have a \nwoman in their family, a person of color, someone with a disability, \nsomeone who observes a different or any religious practice. That is the \npoint we have been trying to make all along.\n  But this bill, as written, does not allow all those very indirectly \naffected parties to bring suit. This is patterned after language in the \n1991 Civil Rights Act, and that legislation has not resulted in all the \npeople who are hurt by discrimination to bring suit.\n  It has been interpreted all those years to mean the party directly \ninjured by the discriminatory practice. However, if we strike this \nlanguage, we risk failing to fix the full extent of the problem caused \nby the Ledbetter decision.\n  It is important to use precise language to make sure all the \nemployees affected by discriminatory pay decisions by their employer \nare covered, not just the one who was discriminated against but all \nthose employees affected.\n  I would like to close with a story from a woman from my State, Angie. \nShe was employed as a field office manager at a temp firm, temporary \nworkers firm. The employees there were not allowed to talk about pay \nwith their coworkers. Only inadvertently did Angie find out that a male \noffice manager at a similar branch who had less education, less \nexperience, was earning more than she was.\n  Well, in this case, the story has a happy ending. She cited this \ninformation in negotiations with her employer, and she was able then to \nget a raise. But the experience left her feeling bewildered and \nbetrayed, and this ultimately led her to quit her job. Had she not \ninadvertently found this out, she would have continued to have been \ndiscriminated against.\n  So I think there is a twofold lesson in this true story. The first \nlesson is that if we give women information about what their male \ncolleagues are getting, they can negotiate a better deal for themselves \nin the workplace.\n  The second lesson is that pay discrimination is a harsh reality in \nthe workplace. Not only is it unfair, it is also demeaning and \ndemoralizing, and it should cease its existence in our society.\n  Individual women should not have to do battle in order to win equal \npay. We need more inclusive national laws to make equal pay for equal \nwork a basic standard and a legal right but also equal pay for \nequivalent work so that we don't discriminate against whole classes of \npeople just because of the job they do. Childcare workers, social \nservice workers, nurses aides, nurses, homemakers--why should people \nwho are cleaning houses make less than janitors? People who clean \nhouses are generally women and janitors happen to be men, but they are \nboth doing the same kind of work.\n  We have to come to grips with this before we will ever really end \ndiscriminatory pay. The Lilly Ledbetter bill before us is a step in the \nright direction. But unless and until we pass the Fair Pay Act, which \nhas been supported by the business and professional women of America \nsince we first introduced it in 1996, until we pass that, \ndiscrimination against women will continue wholesale in America. We \nwill continue to demean the kinds of jobs so important to us--\nchildcare, nurses, nurses' aides, teachers, Head Start workers, the \nwomen who clean our homes, take care of our elderly in long-term care \nfacilities. Go into any long-term care facility, go where your \ngrandparents are or maybe your parents. Who is taking care of them? \nNine times out of ten, it will be a woman. Their responsibilities are \nimmense. Their effort, the training they need is important. They have \nto have all that. Yet they are making much less than their male \ncounterparts in other parts of society.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter bill is important. We have to pass it, but we \nhave to get the Fair Pay Act passed one of these years. As I said, I \nhave been introducing it since 1996. Then they get the paycheck \nfairness bill up. We have to do that. That is important. Don't get me \nwrong, that is important. But the biggest discrimination in our society \nis the discrimination that occurs against women who have what has been \ndenoted as ``women's jobs'' in our society. It is time to end that \ndiscrimination.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, it is great to see you as our \nPresiding Officer. I might call to the attention of the Senate again \nthat the Presiding Officer, the junior Senator from North Carolina, has \nroots that go very deep in the State of Florida. Her\n\n[[Page S748]]\n\nfamily is one of the prominent families of our State. The Senator \nhappens to have been raised in Lakeland, FL, in Imperial Polk County. \nIt is a delight to have her come join the Senate family.\n  I wish to address the matter before us, which is the Lilly Ledbetter \nbill. We have a chance, with passage of this legislation, which is \ngoing to occur perhaps tonight, to have it as a major first step in the \nlegislative process that will ultimately go to the new President for \nhis signature into law to right a wrong, to bring justice where justice \nhas not been because of an insidious kind of discrimination, \ndiscriminating in the employment workplace, by paying women less than \nmen for the same task that is performed.\n  You would think that back in the 1920s, with America finally coming \nto realize that American women had the right to vote, the course would \nhave been set back then in removing that discrimination. But here it is \nin the new century, in the dawn of a new age, and we still have to \nconfront this inequity. We will do that. It is too bad we had to do \nthat now as a result of a 5-to-4 decision in the Supreme Court that, \nfor technical reasons, said Mrs. Ledbetter could not be made whole \nfinancially because she did not know of the discrimination that had \nhappened to her some 15 years before. Whatever that technicality was, \nit was unfortunate that the Supreme Court, in that 5-to-4 decision, \nstruck down her ability to get compensation, to get recompense for the \ninjustice that had been bestowed upon her. But since we are a \ngovernment of three separate branches, where there has been a mistake \nmade, we have the opportunity to correct it. So we are going to do that \ntoday here in the Senate. I am certainly going to be a part of it \nbecause I will be voting for this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1 p.m. \nthe Senate resume consideration concurrently of the pending Enzi \namendments No. 28 and No. 29, that they be debated concurrently for 1 \nhour, and that the time be equally divided between Senators Enzi and \nMikulski or their designees; following the use or yielding back of time \non the Enzi amendments, the Senate resume consideration concurrently of \nthe Specter amendments No. 26 and No. 27; that they be debated \nconcurrently for 1 hour, and that the time be equally divided between \nSenators Specter and Mikulski or their designees; following the use or \nyielding back of time on the Specter amendments, the Senate proceed to \nvotes in relation to the Enzi and Specter amendments in the order \nlisted below:\n  Specter No. 26, Specter No. 27, Enzi No. 28, and Enzi No. 29; \nfurther, that no amendments be in order to the pending Enzi and Specter \namendments prior to the votes; that there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided between the votes; and that all rollcall votes after \nthe first vote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                       Amendments Nos. 28 and 29\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nfrom the Enzi time on the Enzi amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today, I have stated several times, and I \nagain state, I am in opposition to S. 181, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct, and reinforce my support for Senator Hutchison's alternative, S. \n166 and amendment No. 25, the title VII Fairness Act.\n  What we are told by the other side of the aisle is that the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act is about protecting the right of employees who \nmay not know they have been discriminated against. But in reality, this \nbill represents a tremendous burden on employers and a boon for trial \nlawyers across the country. It is an overly broad and cumbersome \napproach, essentially eliminating the statute of limitations.\n\n  Senator Hutchison's alternative, on the other hand, takes a measured \napproach and applies a targeted remedy by allowing claimants to bring \nsuit within the statute of limitations, which runs from the time they \nshould be expected to have enough information to support a reasonable \nsuspicion that they are being discriminated against. The rationale for \nstatutes of limitation is to ensure fairness and balance--balance \nbetween access to the courts for aggrieved parties while allowing \ncertainty for those who may be called to defend themselves. S. 181 \nclearly steps beyond this, greatly reducing confidence in the civil \ndiscovery process and forcing businesses to stage a defense on \ndecisions that were made years--perhaps dozens of years--before the \naction was brought.\n  There have been a lot of amendments. I did vote in favor of the \nHutchison amendment and feel that would be one that was a very \nreasonable compromise. Tomorrow in Oklahoma I will be meeting with \nvoters in Clinton and Burns Flat and other areas in southern Oklahoma. \nIt will be my unfortunate duty to tell them that this burden has been \nunfairly placed upon them and their businesses in this difficult \neconomic time. But I will be proud to say that my vote did not \ncontribute to the passage of S 181; rather, I stood with my colleague, \nSenator Hutchison, and we worked for a balanced approach that provides \na remedy to those who have legitimate discrimination claims and at the \nsame time allows employers, many of whom have never made a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision, to mount a defense based upon \ndiscovery of reliable evidence. I register my opposition to the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act because it is such a clear departure from \nprevious legal principles.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the \nbill that is before us, which is the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  It doesn't take a legal scholar to understand that the U.S. Supreme \nCourt did get it wrong when they ruled against Lilly Ledbetter in 2007. \nIn fact, I think the issue is rather simple. All I have to do is look \nout across my great State of Arkansas at the number of single mothers \nwho are working hard to care for their families and who need equal pay \nand deserve equal pay.\n  In today's business environment, where women make on average 78 cents \nfor every dollar their male counterparts make for the same work, it can \nbe impossible for someone to know that they have been discriminated \nagainst until long after the fact. Employees are not privy to pay data \nin the workplace, as we are. Our pay is published, as well as for our \nstaff, but in the regular workforce it is not published. In many \ninstances, they can actually be disciplined or fired if they share pay \ninformation with one another.\n  In the case of Lilly Ledbetter, she was hired as a supervisor at a \ntire plant in Alabama nearly 30 years ago. For years, day upon day, she \nwent to work next to her male counterparts working hard to do her job \nthe best she could, doing the same job or an extremely similar job to \nwhat these gentlemen were doing. She received unequal pay for equal \nwork to her male colleagues. She only discovered she was a subject of \ndiscrimination after she received an anonymous tip shortly before her \nretirement. Although an Alabama jury found in her favor, her employer \nappealed the decision and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against her. In \na 5-to-4 decision, they overturned years of precedent and said that she \nshould have filed a complaint every time she received a smaller raise \nthan the men she served alongside, even though she didn't know what \nthey were making or if the pay was discriminatory. How could she know? \nShe was not privy to that information, and she was prohibited from \nasking.\n\n[[Page S749]]\n\n  In her very spirited dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg said that \nthe majority clearly misinterpreted the law and that ``the ball is now \nin Congress's court'' to correct this inequity. It is in our court. It \nis in our court to ensure that the women of this country are going to \nreceive the equal pay that is due to them for the job they do working \nalongside their male counterparts.\n  So that is why we are here today, to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Act. It is a responsible and fair piece of legislation which \nensures that all employees, regardless of their race, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin, are treated the same. That is what we have \njust celebrated in the inauguration of a new President: the values we \nhold dear as a part of this great country, the blessing of being \nAmerican, and that we would have the same opportunity to reach our \npotential--each of us as individuals--whether we are men or whether we \nare women.\n  I know in some of the business communities they are concerned that \nthis bill will extend the statute of limitations and expose employers \nto numerous lawsuits. However, I reject those arguments, because this \nbill provides little incentive for employees to sit on claims with only \na 2-year limit on back pay. In addition, it does not create new grounds \nfor filing lawsuits. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office expects \nthat it would not significantly affect the number of filings within the \nEEOC. So I encourage my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  When I first came to the Congress in 1992, I came to the House \nrepresenting the eastern district of Arkansas, and I remember my \ncampaign vividly. I was a young single woman at the time. People \nthought I was crazy, not only because of my age and my gender, but \nbecause of the fact that I was unmarried, and it was unheard of for a \nyoung single woman to be out there running for the Congress.\n  I remember sitting next to a distinguished banker in one of my \nhometown communities. He looked quite conservative, and sitting next to \nhim I got a little nervous. He started asking me about some women's \nissues that would probably be before me at one time or another if I \nwere elected to the Congress. He started to quiz me pretty heavily. I \ngot nervous, but I came back with what I felt were strong and concise \nand well thought out answers. At the end of our conversation, he looked \nat me and he said: I have kind of been a little hard on you, but I \nwanted to know how you felt about these issues. I wanted to know how \nyou truly, deep down felt about these issues, because I have three \ndaughters who are in the workforce and one of them is a single mom. I \nwant to know that you are going to be fighting for them and for their \nchildren.\n  So it is not just the women who are interested in what happens here; \nit is the fathers and grandfathers, it is the brothers of women who are \nout in the workforce doing their best, working hard to make a living \nfor their families, to care for their children, or to help their aging \nparent. I found, when I came to the House and then to the Senate, my \ncolleagues were always ready to work with me regardless of my gender or \nmy age, if I came to the table prepared and ready to work hard, and if \nI was honest in where I was coming from on those issues and wanted to \nwork hard to bring about results for the betterment of my \nconstituencies in Arkansas. So I hope as we look at this, we will \nrealize that is what we are talking about here: for American women \nacross this great land who are working hard--many of them in the same \njob as a man; maybe supporting a family by themselves or taking care of \nan aging parent, financially and otherwise--that we would do the right \nthing, the thing this country is based on, which is equity and fairness \nand justice, and that we would provide for those women the reassurance \nthat the principles we stand for are not lost in them or in their \npaycheck, but that we do see the importance of standing up and saying \nhow important it is to who we are and what we stand for that they \ndeserve to have that equal pay. It is a fair and responsible bill that \nrestores the congressional intent and ensures that those responsible \nfor discrimination are held accountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, can you tell me what the time agreement is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour equally divided for debate. \nThe Senator from Wyoming has 26\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to call up amendment No. 28 and ask \nunanimous consent that as soon as we have disposed of amendment No. 28, \nthat we will voice vote amendment No. 29 based on the decision of \namendment No. 28, because there are two different sections of the law \nthat say the same thing. So we have to have both pieces, but if one is \nacceptable, the other one ought to be acceptable. If one is not \nacceptable, the other one should not be acceptable. So I know it is a \nchange in parliamentary procedure, but I am trying to speed things up \nby having as few votes as possible but still get the decisions made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Amendment No. 28 is now pending.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have offered amendments Nos. 28 and 29 and \nthey respond to the question many have asked about the underlying bill. \nThose of us who have looked at the bill have wondered what a particular \nprovision means. This provision appears to greatly expand the number of \npeople who can bring a Title VII lawsuit beyond those who have directly \nexperienced discrimination.\n  As drafted, the bill extends the right to sue for employment \ndiscrimination, not only to the person who is discriminated against but \nalso to any individual who is affected by application of a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other practice. This can \nclearly be read to include spouses, family members, and other \nindividuals, depending on the employee's income or pension, or even \nmore broadly. There is a lack of definition in this part of the bill. \nIn this part of the bill that we are debating, I am trying to amend to \nadd some clarity, and Senator Specter will be trying to amend if mine \nfails to again bring some clarity to this issue. These are steps to see \nhow expansive we can make the trial lawyer bailout.\n  So S. 181 would not only allow decades-old claims to be suddenly \nrevived, it doesn't even require that they be revived by the person who \nwas discriminated against, even if that person won't bring the action \nor even if that person is no longer around. The language is so broad \nthat the claim could be brought by virtually anyone. It is nothing more \nthan an invitation to trial lawyers to litigate a situation compounded \nby the fact that such claims would be largely indefensible because of \nthe passage of time, maybe not even having the person around who was \ndiscriminated against.\n  Do we really want to see employers forced to expend resources \ndefending decades-old, stale claims that are not even being brought by \nthe individuals who are the supposed objects of the discrimination?\n  What we are looking at here could be an exponential increase in \nlawsuits at a time when many employers are struggling to make their \npayroll and avoid laying people off. It was reported this week that a \ncertain type of employment-related class of lawsuits have increased 99 \npercent over the last 4 years--just the last 4 years, a 99-percent \nincrease. If enacted as drafted, this bill could make that increase \nseem minuscule.\n  Our new President has made some proposals intended to stimulate the \neconomy. One proposal he made at one point was to offer a $3,000 tax \ncredit to employers who create new jobs. Perhaps that was a great idea, \nbut if you couple that with increased litigation liability such as that \nincluded in this bill, it will not only cancel each other out, it would \nmake that tax credit seem minuscule, very small, particularly when you \ncompare it to the cost of a lawsuit. A small businessman faced with a \nlawsuit that is going to cost him $20,000, $25,000, $100,000 to defend \ncannot afford the time or the money to do that and may work harder at a \nsettlement and encourage people to do lawsuits that may not have the \nsame merit we are trying to achieve in this bill. I can tell you as a \nformer small businessman, I would rather not have the tax credit and \nnot get sued any day--not that the two are even related.\n\n[[Page S750]]\n\n  I hope the bill's sponsor can explain why this provision should be \nincluded in the bill. It is the sort of question that might have been \nsorted out more easily if the bill had gone through the proper \ncommittee process. But the majority has opted to circumvent that \nprocess again. My amendments would strike the provision entirely.\n  I understand there might be some, and I am sure we will hear some \nexplanation of it, where there might be some instances where there were \nspecial circumstances. But this bill goes well beyond just special \ncircumstances. It opens it up dramatically.\n  I look forward to a debate and vote on my amendment later today.\n  We also will be voting on two amendments that Senator Specter has \noffered to improve the underlying bill. I will use some of my time to \nspeak in favor of those amendments as well.\n  Senator Specter's amendment No. 26 shows there is justifiable concern \namong many Members that allowing individuals to go far back in time and \nclaim that pay decisions made years ago were discriminatory does place \nunfair burdens on employers.\n  Senator Specter's amendment No. 26 provides a small measure of \npotential relief to employers who must face the daunting task of trying \nto defend decisions made in the distant past by individuals who may not \nbe available and based on documentation that no longer exists. We will \nhave to increase the amount of time that we expect people to keep all \nof their records if this bill goes through the way that it is.\n  Senator Specter's amendment makes it clear that an employer in those \ncircumstances may still raise traditional equitable defenses to those \nclaims, such as the defense of laches. For example, if an employer can \ndemonstrate an employee knew or should have known the allegedly \ndiscriminatory nature of a pay decision made years ago, but lets the \nclaim slip, then it may be barred if the employer is hindered in \nmounting a fair defense because of the passage of time.\n  The proponents of S. 181 have said repeatedly that it is not their \nintent to limit employers in their use of equitable defenses. \nAccordingly, they too should support Senator Specter's amendment. It \nwould restore a small measure of fairness in employment discrimination \nlitigation. I commend Senator Specter for offering it. I support the \namendment in full. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nlook at it and support it.\n  Senator Specter's amendment No. 27 has also offered another amendment \nto improve the underlying bill which deserves full and fair \nconsideration from colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We know \nSenator Specter has been very involved in judiciary work and that he \ndoes reasonable amendments and is concerned about some of the \nimplications of the bill.\n  He has offered another amendment to improve the underlying bill. I \nhope we will give that a careful look. I have been clear that I am \ntroubled by the fact that this bill effectively eliminates the statute \nof limitations from employment discrimination claims since I believe \nthat statutes of limitations do serve an important function. They speed \nrecovery to the victims of discrimination, as well as ensure fairness \nin our legal process and accuracy in the resolution of disputed claims. \nThe important role they play demands that any effort to change or \neliminate the statute of limitations be carefully defined and clearly \ntargeted at the precise problem the legislation purports to address. As \npresently drafted, S. 181 does not come close to achieving this \nstandard. Senator Specter's amendment does much to correct this very \nproblematic lack of precision.\n  The proponents of S. 181 have been careful to note that the concern \nwhich they seek to address by this legislation relates to \n``discriminatory pay decisions.'' The language of the bill, however, is \nmuch broader. The bill would not only eliminate the statute of \nlimitations with regard to discriminatory pay decisions, it would also \ndo so with respect to any ``other practice.'' However, this legislation \nnowhere defines what is meant by ``other practice.''\n  Virtually all personnel decisions--promotions, transfers, work \nassignments, training, sales territory assignments--affect an \nindividual's compensation, benefits, or their pay. It appears that the \nother undefined ``other practices'' language would extend liability far \nbeyond simple pay decisions to include anything that might conceivably \naffect compensation. This would include claims of denied promotions, \ndemotions, transfers, reassignments, tenure decisions, suspensions, and \nother discipline, all of which could be brought years after they \noccurred and years after the employee left employment, and, without my \namendments, be brought by other people. The phrase could also \npotentially embrace employment decisions with no discriminatory intent \nor effect.\n  This result is plainly an overreach and goes far beyond the publicly \nstated aims of this legislation's proponents. Defending a claim based \nupon a pay decision made years and years earlier is a heavy burden. \nReaching back years and years to defend the dozens of other personnel \nactions an employer takes every day is an impossible burden. Senator \nSpecter's amendment limits the reach of S. 181 solely to discrete pay \ndecisions and makes clear that S. 181 does not apply to any other \npersonnel decisions. While I believe it does not cure all the ills \nwhich S. 181 creates, it does put this very problematic interpretation \nto rest, and I support his effort and amendment.\n  I heard many on the other side of the aisle state that S. 181 has \nbeen fully vetted because two hearings were held on it last year. I \npoint out that the HELP Committee hearing was held before Senator \nHutchison offered her alternative legislation, her ``better \nLedbetter.'' Neither hearing covered this or any other alternative \nmeans to accomplish the goal on which we all agreed. If we had been \nable to explore alternatives in a hearing and have a markup--and a \nmarkup is a point I keep emphasizing--I believe we might have come to a \nchange in the legislation that would more clearly state what is trying \nto be done and wind up with an agreement on both sides which would \ngreatly reduce the amount of time that it takes to do amendments. The \namendments, again, are done up or down rather than having slight \nrevisions that could perhaps make them palatable to both sides.\n  Our side has turned in amendments that are relevant, that are \ndesigned to hopefully improve the bill, and do it in a way that it does \nnot eliminate the purpose of the bill. There could have been a lot of \nconstructive work in a committee markup, but that is not the choice, so \nwe will continue to proceed and we have been proceeding with \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, for his cooperation in moving this bill \non the floor. He has been a big help working with this side of the \naisle and working with us and the respective leadership to line up \nthese amendments so that we can actually offer them and discuss them, \nand we are going to be voting on them. I thank him for doing that.\n  Also, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming had a very content-rich \npresentation. He covered his amendments, the Specter amendments, and \nother comments. He even discussed the Hutchison amendment. What I am \ngoing to do is respond to sections 3 and 4 of the bill and his concerns \nabout the words ``affected by.''\n  I oppose Senator Enzi's amendments to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct. Those amendments strike the words ``affected by'' from sections 3 \nand 4 of the bill. These amendments, I believe, are not necessary, and \nI am concerned that they could lead courts to mistakenly read this \nlegislation in too narrow a framework.\n  The Senator from Wyoming argues that his amendments are necessary \nbecause the bill somehow expands the category of persons who may sue \nfor discrimination under the civil rights laws referenced in the bill. \nHis concern and his claim is that the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nwould allow spouses and other relatives of the workers who suffer \ndiscrimination to file their own lawsuits, claiming that they have been \naffected by the discrimination of their relative.\n  I appreciate his concern. What we want, though, is to assure him, and \nI say to my colleagues that his concerns are not valid, that if you \nlook at the legislation, this argument ignores the\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\nplain language of the existing statutes and the actual language in the \nLedbetter bill.\n  I am going to sound like a lawyer for a minute, but bear with me. The \nLedbetter bill amends title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which \noutlaws job discrimination based on race, color, national origin, \ngender, and religion. The Ledbetter bill also amends the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and applies those amendments \nalso to the Americans with Disabilities Act and section 404 of the \nRehabilitation Act.\n  These laws make crystal clear that the only persons who can file \nunder the act are those who have suffered discrimination on the job or \nthe Federal entities charged with enforcing the civil rights laws, not \nthe relatives or friends of these workers.\n  I am going to make it crystal clear, I say unabashedly for \nlegislative intent, that these laws make it crystal clear that the only \npersons who can file a suit under the act of discussion today are those \nwho have suffered discrimination on the job or the Federal entities \ncharged with enforcing these civil rights acts, not the relatives or \nfriends of these workers. The citations are 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f)(1); 29 \nU.S.C. 626(c)(1); 29 U.S.C. 791(g), 794(d); and 42 U.S.C. 12117(a).\n  I also wish to elaborate that the bill amends only the provisions of \nthe respective statutes regarding timeliness of job discrimination \nsuits and leaves unchanged current law regarding who may file a suit.\n  So the only thing we are dealing with is timeliness. Nothing in the \nLedbetter bill would change the basic requirements that job \ndiscrimination suits under title VII, the ADA, the ADEA, or the \nRehabilitation Act must be filed by the workers personally affected by \nworkplace discrimination or by the Federal Government on their behalf.\n  In addition, for further clarification, the House Education and Labor \nCommittee's report on this legislation states that the language in \nsections 3 and 4 of the bill is modeled on the text of section 112 of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991, which was adopted with overwhelming \nsupport in both Chambers of Congress to overturn the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Lorance v. AT I repeat that decision: Lorance v. AT \nTechnologies.\n  The Lorance fix has been around for nearly two decades, and it has \nnot expanded the category of persons who can sue for job \ndiscrimination. Our bill will not change who may file the suit under \nthe civil rights law it amends.\n\n  Finally, the Enzi amendments should be rejected because omitting the \nwords ``affected by'' from the bill might actually lead a court to \nconclude that we intend the fix adopted in this legislation to be more \nnarrow than the Lorance fix. Although the Ledbetter bill uses the term \n``affected by,'' where the Lorance fix used ``injured by,'' the House \nreport makes clear that this is a distinction without a difference. \nThis is a distinction without a difference. Accordingly, if we followed \nthe Enzi amendment, if we remove ``affected by'' from the Ledbetter \nbill, we run the risk that the courts might erroneously read this \nlegislation as less comprehensive than the parallel provision of the \n1991 act.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendments offered by our \ncolleague from Wyoming. In a nutshell, the Enzi amendment only fixes \nhalf the problem, it does not cover discrimination, it has a delayed \nimpact on workers' wages, and we know that anyone would not be able to \nsue even though they were still affected by this job evaluation \nbusiness.\n  I am going to say more about this, but my initial argument is to lay \nto rest the concern that persons other than the one who is actually \ndiscriminated against would have standing to file under this bill, and \nI think I have clarified that.\n  I note that Senator Specter is here and he has his amendments, and I \nalso note that there are other Senators on the other side of the aisle \nwho wish to speak. So for now, I will conclude my arguments, and I \nyield the floor so that we may proceed with other Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nGeorgia needs, but first I wish to make a very brief comment.\n  The Senator from Maryland kind of makes the point I have been trying \nto make through all of this. If there is wording that more clearly \nstates the Senate's intention or Congress's intention, and since there \nis disagreement over how widely this affects people, had we gone \nthrough a committee markup, we would have already covered this and \nwould have found more careful wording that would have done what I think \nboth of us are talking about. So again, that is why we should send them \nto committee.\n  I yield time to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Wyoming for \nyielding me this time, and I rise in opposition to the Lilly Ledbetter \nbill.\n  I oppose, just like everybody else, discrimination in the workplace, \nand I believe any worker who experiences discrimination should have \ntheir claim handled in a fair and timely way. But I would like to \nreiterate what several of my colleagues have already mentioned, which \nis that discrimination in the workplace has been outlawed since 1963.\n  This legislation, S. 181, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, \ndid not go through the normal process. I think the Senator from Wyoming \nhas just said that the issue we are talking about now is that this \namendment might have clarified something that is not clear in the bill \nhad it gone through the regular process.\n  This bill is not about supporting or opposing discrimination. This \ndebate is strictly focused on when the statute of limitations on pay \ndiscrimination suits should begin. As a first-year law student, you \nlearn the critical importance of the statute of limitations in our \njudicial system. Our judicial system is the envy of the free world, and \none of the basic fundamental rights or issues involved in our judicial \nsystem is the accruing of a right and a point in time when that right \ndissipates. That is what we call the statute of limitations, and it \ntruly is fundamental and should not be tinkered with in any way \nwhatsoever.\n  What this bill would do would be to undermine fair and timely \nresolution of employment discrimination allegations.\n  We are facing difficult economic times today. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor, 984 Georgians lost their jobs last week. This \nbill, should it become law, will have a devastating financial impact on \nalready hindered employers and business owners. Businesses around the \ncountry are on the defense. They need more incentives to hire and \nretain employees. What this will do is to create incentives to take \nmoney that would ordinarily be used to either increase pay or to hire \nmore employees and put that money aside because at some point in time \nthey are going to have to defend litigation as a result of this piece \nof legislation. I believe the legislation would undermine the fair and \ntimely resolution of employment discrimination suits.\n  I strongly support the amendment of my colleague, Senator Isakson. \nHis amendment would make the legislation, should it pass, prospective \nonly and would deny any rights on a retroactive basis. If we go to \nmaking bills such as this retroactive, what will we do to the business \ncommunity?\n  I also rise in support of the amendment of Senator Enzi. What it says \nis that an action accrues only to an affected employee.\n  Those two amendments are commonsense amendments. Anybody who has ever \nbeen in the business world and who has hired employees knows and \nunderstands that there are certain guarantees you have to have if you \nare going to be successful in the business world. One of them is to \nknow your exposure to litigation. What we are looking at here, unless \nthe Isakson amendment is adopted, is that people who have been \noperating their businesses for years, in a way that they thought \nlimited their exposure, all of a sudden may be exposed to what will \namount to frivolous lawsuits that can be filed against them.\n  Again, the Enzi amendment makes such common sense that oftentimes \npeople in this town have a difficult time understanding it. As I have \nheard the Senator from Maryland discuss this issue a minute ago, I \nthink we agree\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\nthat only ``affected'' employees are covered by this, and we ought to \nclarify that. I think Senator Enzi's amendment does that, and therefore \nI am in strong support of his amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 13\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining; the Senator from Wyoming has 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I just wanted to say a few words.\n  First of all, let's go to the remarks that were made that, somehow or \nanother, by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, we are going to \nfurther undermine our economy and our ability to hire people. I find it \nsurprising--first puzzling, then surprising--to say that the way we are \ngoing to get out of this economic mess is if we continue the status \nquo--or the stacking quo--which is that if you have discrimination in \nthe workplace, don't pass the law to do greater clarification. I think \nthat is a flawed argument.\n  First of all, women of America already subsidize our economy. And you \nknow what. We are mad as hell, and we don't want to take it anymore. \nEveryone needs to hear that: We, the women of America, are mad as hell, \nand we don't want to take it anymore. Now, why do I say that? We are \nalready paid 77 cents for every dollar that men make, so we are already \nsubsidizing the economy in the workplace. Then when you go into the \nhome, our work is often undervalued and it is certainly not \ncompensated. So somehow or another women's work doesn't quite count in \nthe same way.\n\n  Well, we want to be counted, and we want what we do to be counted. We \nwant the world to know that if we are doing equal work, we want equal \npay. We do not want to subsidize the economy. We don't want any \nsubsidies. We want fairness, we want justice, we want the law on our \nside, and we want the courthouse doors open to us.\n  Now, if business thinks the only way they can succeed is by \ncontinuing these practices, then business has a lot of lessons to \nlearn. And by God, when you look at what the banks did, you can \ncertainly see that. If business doesn't want lawsuits, there is one \nclear, right way of avoiding a lawsuit: don't discriminate. If you are \nan employer and you are paying equal pay for equal or comparable work, \nyou will not be sued, you will not be challenged, and you have no need \nto fear.\n  If you want to have some economic stimulus, give us that 23-cent \nraise--all those single mothers out there; as Senator Lincoln spoke \nabout earlier, all those Norma Rays, all those Lilly Ledbetters, all \nthose people who have lined up through the ages. So 23 cents might not \nsound like a lot, certainly in Washington where we give zillions to \nbanks and they do not even say thank you. They don't even promise they \nwill send out more or promise they will join with our President and \nwork through this.\n  So we are very clear that we want to be paid equal pay for equal \nwork, and we want it in our checkbooks. But we know we have to get to \nthat by having the Ledbetter bill in the Federal lawbooks.\n  I can understand some of the fine points, the concerns raised by \nSenator Enzi. I think I have presented a sound legal argument that \nshows that the only thing we mean by the ``affected party'' is that \nperson who is actually discriminated against, or if a Federal entity \nsues on their behalf. I think we have clarified it. But I believe we \nalso need to be clear why we are doing this legislation. We are \nrighting a wrong, we are addressing a grievance, and we are ensuring \nthose fundamental principles of our society, which are fairness, \nequality, and justice.\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor, and I yield back my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. I have \nalways appreciated working with her on issues. We probably wouldn't \nhave completed the Higher Education Act if it had not been for her \ndiligence and expertise and ability, and this is a bill on which she \nhas expertise and ability. It hasn't gotten all of the viewpoints of \nall of the people on the committee, let alone all the people in this \nChamber, and that is what we are trying to get to.\n  There isn't anybody in this Chamber or probably on the other end of \nthe building who isn't for equal pay. That is the law. If anybody knows \nof a situation where that is not occurring, let any one of us know, and \nI bet you we would help to right the wrong. We are against \ndiscrimination.\n\n  But we are also against discrimination against the small businessmen \nwho have to sometimes interpret our laws, figure out what we are \nsaying, and become some of the precedent setters on some of the fine \npoints that we don't even address. That should not happen. It is very \nexpensive for them. What they are trying to do is put out a product or \nservice and get compensated for it so they can compensate their \nemployees. There are a lot of decisions they have to make to be able to \ndo that. Fairness is one of them.\n  This 23-cent pay differential that keeps coming up--and that is \nwrong--is why we had a fantastic hearing in our committee about why \nthat happens. That is because different jobs--not the same job, \ndifferent jobs--pay different amounts. The ones with more risk \napparently pay more. The ones with more risk are nontraditional jobs \nfor women.\n  One of the people who testified had taken a course to become a mason, \na rock mason, to do rock work. Her first rock work was, of course, at \nground level. Later, she was installing big sheets of marble on the \noutside of skyscrapers. She went through how her compensation changed \nas she did these different jobs. That is a nontraditional job for a \nwoman, but she is being paid more than most men in this country now.\n  That is what we have to do. We have to provide the encouragement, the \nskills, and the training to be able to perhaps do nontraditional jobs. \nI have tried to get this Workforce Investment Act through for the last \n5 years. We passed it through the Senate once unanimously and were \nnever able to get a conference committee on it with the House. Since \nthat time, it has just languished. That would provide skills training \nto 900,000 people a year. It is criminal we do not pass that. That \nwould solve a lot of the 23-cent gap we are talking about. That is not \nequal pay for equal work, that is higher pay for different work. But we \nneed to have people trained to do that work, and we need to provide the \ntraining to do that work. That will solve a lot of the 23-cent gap.\n  But as long as we are encouraging people to do the traditional jobs, \nand we are not providing them with the training, we are relegating them \nto a gap. I guarantee it is bigger than 23 cents. That is the average. \nThat is the way it works out across this country, which means some are \nmaking more and some are making a whole lot less. We do not want that \nto happen. I want everybody to be clear. Nobody wants to have unequal \npay for equal work.\n  What we have tried to do, since we can't, as in a markup, sit down \nwith the people who have the common interests in some of the parts of \nthis that we have questions about and work out something that everybody \nagrees with that, from the perspective of those people in the room, \nsolves the problem we are talking about--we have been doing that in the \nHELP Committee. We have been doing that on a frequent basis. We have \neven been so agreeable in the committee that a lot of times we will \nhave some amendments that people are concerned about, and we haven't \nbeen able to reach an answer by the time we get to markup, but we know \nthat is a problem, and we say we will get that solved by the time it \ngets to the floor, and we do and it doesn't take much floor time.\n  The reason I brought up this amendment is that I think it is far too \nbroad. I have not had a chance to review the\n\n[[Page S753]]\n\nspecific cites that the chairman has brought up. I would like to be \nable to do that, but we are not going to have that time either which we \nwould if we had a normal amendment markup--but S. 181 adds a new \nundefined term to title VII, and that is ``individual''--this \n``affected individual'' will be permitted to sue under S. 181. But we \ndo not know what the term means. Does it include spouses, et cetera? \nWhy didn't the bill's sponsor use a defined term such as ``person.''\n  This bill, as drafted, leaves the door open to lawsuits from people \nother than the employee. My amendment shuts that door. Maybe it is not \nthe most effective way, but we have not had the opportunity to sit down \nand look at these different perspectives, look at these words, make \nsure we have it defined right, make sure we have the right ones in the \nbill.\n  That always disturbs me. We are trying to solve a problem, a problem \nthat is real, and we are trying to do it in a way that is fair to \neverybody. ``Everybody'' means all the employees and the employers and \ndo it in a way that we will get the right information. If this opens \nthe door to other people, even without the permission of the person who \nwas affected in some cases--families take things much more personally \nthan the individuals do usually. I know in campaigns it is the families \nwho get upset when they see one of these terrible ads on television and \nthey hold the grudge longer. They do not understand it the same way the \ncandidate does. The same thing happens in the workplace--and I am sure \nit does. If a person comes home from work, and they are upset and they \ncomplain, the family takes it personally. That is a help to the \nemployee. They need to be able to voice these things and have somebody \nwho acts as a sounding board on it. But the family always continues the \ngrudge longer.\n  I can tell you this bill allows those people to go ahead and open the \ndoor and sue on behalf of the person who came home with the grudge, \neven if that person is not willing to sue because they can be affected. \nThere are ways to fix this, but I contend that just doing it through \nthese votes on the floor probably is not going to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Enzi amendment? \nThe Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Did I yield back my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded back her time, but we know \nhow much time she had remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I said, did I yield back my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator did yield back her time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. At that time I was unaware that Senator McCaskill was \ncoming to the floor. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes for Senator \nMcCaskill to be able to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, there are certain things that just \nreflect common sense. One is the reality of the workplace, who has \npower and who does not. Generally, the people who are being subjected \nto unfair treatment--doesn't it make sense they are not the powerful \nones? Doesn't it make sense they have the least information about what \nis going on in terms of policies and procedures?\n  The thing about the Ledbetter case that just defies common sense is \nthat we are asking the least powerful people in the workplace to be all \nseeing and all knowing. We are asking them to know what clearly they \ncannot know because they are being discriminated against. How unfair is \nit that we are saying to a woman: You must know when they start denying \nyou a promotion. It is not just about equal pay. With all due respect \nto my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania, it is not just about pay. \nIt is about promotions. It is about whether you are considered for the \nbig job not just whether you are making the same amount when you get \nthe big job. We cannot ask those people who have been kept in the dark \nbecause they are not considered as worthy as others to be the ones to \nknow what the policies and procedures have been in the workplace.\n  I think it is important we defeat these amendments. I think it is \nimportant that we restore common sense to allow someone to take action \nwhen they have, in fact, been kicked to the curb in the workplace--not \nbecause of their job but because of who they are, because of whether \nthey are a man or a woman, whether they are old or young, whether they \nare Black or White.\n  The secrecy in the workplace sometimes invades other places. There \nare so many rules around here that I respect, but I tell you, I do not \nget anonymous holds. I do not get anonymous holds. I do not understand \nwhy any Member of the Senate would not be proud to explain why they \nwere willing to hold up someone's nomination.\n  Imagine my frustration when I look at the nominations that are being \nheld now in secret. Do you know what is amazing about it? They are \nwomen, the same women who have suffered in the workplace because they \ndo not get enough information. There are now four women who are \nsecretly being held from doing their jobs: Lisa Jackson at EPA, Nancy \nSutley at White House Environmental Council, Hilda Solis for the \nDepartment of Labor, and Susan Rice for the Ambassador to the U.N. Just \nlike Lilly Ledbetter, they are being kept in the dark as to why they \nare not being allowed to step up to service.\n  I implore the Senators who are secretly holding these women--by the \nway, those are almost all the women who have been nominated. \nProportionally, almost every woman who is being nominated is being \nsecretly held, compared to the men who are nominated.\n  I urge everyone to defeat the amendments on Lilly Ledbetter. I urge \nits passage.\n\n\n              unanimous consent request--executive session\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the nominations of Lisa Jackson, Nancy \nSutley, Hilda Solis, and Susan Rice be moved forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. On behalf of those women, I am disappointed at the \nobjection. I look forward to the passage of Ledbetter and the \nconfirmation of those women so they can serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute remains for each side in debate.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield back my time. I know Senator \nSpecter is waiting. He is also dealing with the nomination of Mr. \nHolder. We would like to move Mr. Specter along.\n  I yield my 1 minute back, if the Republicans yield back their minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is yielded back. The Senate will now \ndebate the Specter amendment.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 26.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides that:\n\n       Nothing in this Act or any amendment by the act shall be \n     construed to prohibit a party from asserting a defense based \n     on waiver of a right, or an estoppel or laches doctrine.\n\n  This amendment goes to the issue of giving the employers a fair \nopportunity for offering a defense. I have long supported equal pay for \nwomen. I have long supported breaking the glass ceiling as a matter of \nequitable fairness. In my book, ``Passion For Truth,'' I wrote almost a \ndecade ago:\n\n       The majority in a democracy can take care of itself while \n     individuals and minorities often cannot. Moreover, our \n     history has demonstrated that the majority benefits when \n     equality helps minorities become part of the majority.\n\n  Last Congress I cosponsored two bills dealing with equal pay. I \ncosponsored the Fair Pay Restoration Act with Senator Kennedy and the \ntitle VII Fairness Act with Senator Hutchison. Earlier today I voted \nwith Senator Hutchison, which would have started the tolling of the \nstatute of limitations when the employee knew or should have known.\n  The availability of the defense is very important. What the amendment\n\n[[Page S754]]\n\ndoes is to incorporate the language in the dissent of Justice Ginsburg \nin the Ledbetter case, where Justice Ginsburg pointed out that:\n\n       Allowing employees to challenge discrimination that extends \n     over long periods of time into the charge-filing period . . . \n     does not leave employers defenseless against unreasonable or \n     prejudicial delay. Employers disadvantaged by such delay may \n     raise various defenses. Doctrines such as waiver, estoppel \n     and equitable tolling allow us to honor title VII's remedial \n     purpose without negating the particular purpose of the filing \n     requirement, to give prompt notice to the employer.\n\n  So what we have, essentially, are equitable defenses. If you have \nwaiver, where there is an affirmative act to give up a right, or where \nyou have estoppel or laches, that means the party has waited an \nunreasonable period of time, so those defenses may be asserted.\n  Now, it is my legal judgment that these defenses would be available \nwithout this amendment, but you never can tell what a court will do. \nOne of the objectives of legislation is to cure any potential \nambiguity, so it is plain what will happen in court. That is what this \namendment does.\n  If I may have the attention of the distinguished senior Senator from \nMaryland, we had discussed first, if it is agreeable to the Senator \nfrom Maryland, who is managing the bill, I compliment her on her \noutstanding work and again repeat, I cosponsored her bill in the last \nCongress. I did not do so this year, not that I am opposed to the \nprinciple of equal pay, but I tried to work out these matters to make \nwhat I consider to be improvements.\n  The question I would ask of the Senator from Maryland, is: Do you \nbelieve that the defenses of waiver, estoppel, laches, and equitable \ntolling are available now or would be available if this bill were \nenacted, even without such a specific amendment such as I have offered?\n  I raise that question because there has been some discussion that we \ncould have a colloquy. I think it is preferable to having it firmly in \nthe statute. But I begin with the form of a colloquy. Do you agree the \ndefenses of laches, waiver, equitable tolling----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, let me say to my good friend from Pennsylvania, \none, I wish to thank you for your cooperation on this bill. I wish to \nthank you for your cosponsorship in a previous Congress. We hope we do \nhave the Senator's support at the conclusion of the amendment process.\n  I wish to say to my friend the bill does not change the law on the \ntopics he has raised. But in all fairness, he is a superior lawyer. I \nam not a lawyer. Rather than me responding, kind of shooting from the \nlip, I would like to have a proper colloquy with the Senator at such \ntime that I know we are on firm ground so we can clearly establish the \nlegislative intent.\n  Could I suggest the absence of a quorum while the Senator and I \ndiscuss this and see how we can proceed?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Certainly.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after a brief discussion with the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland and the distinguished majority \nleader, we decided to go ahead with the debate and a vote on the \namendment.\n  At this time, I call up amendment No. 27.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. SPECTER. This amendment would strike the language of ``other \npractices.'' In the statute, the language reads: ``pay or other \npractices.'' And this amendment would strike the language ``other \npractices,'' focusing on the pay.\n  As I said before, I believe there ought to be equal pay for women. \nThe glass ceiling ought to be broken and they ought to be treated \nfairly and equally.\n  But I am concerned about the language of ``other practices,'' which \nmight well engage and promote an enormous amount of litigation, as to \nwhether ``other practices'' included such items as promotion, hiring, \nfiring, training, tenure, demotion, reassignment, discipline, temporary \nreassignment or transfer and all those items.\n  That is not intended to be a dispositive list. There could be more \nitems that someone might say ``other practices'' encompass. There have \nbeen objections to this legislation, that it is going to promote \nextensive litigation. I think the best way to approach this issue is to \nprovide equal pay. If somebody wants to include one of those other \nitems, such as promotion or hiring or firing or any of them, I would \ncertainly be willing to consider them in the legislation.\n  But what I would like not to see is the language ``other practices'' \nwith the vagueness and the ambiguity that is present in that kind of \nlanguage. That is the essence of the argument.\n  In an extensive floor statement, I have set forth my general approach \nand my reasons for offering these two amendments. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it appear at the conclusion of my extemporaneous remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009\n\n       Mr. Specter. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to \n     discuss a very important issue facing American workers--pay \n     discrimination.\n       I have long been an ardent supporter of civil rights and \n     have consistently supported legislation aimed at rooting out \n     discrimination based on race, gender, disability, and \n     economic disadvantage. ``The majority in a democracy can take \n     care of itself, while individuals and minorities often \n     cannot. Moreover, our history has demonstrated that the \n     majority benefits when equality helps minorities become a \n     part of the majority.''\n       We all agree that pay discrimination is insidious and \n     unacceptable. Last Congress, I cosponsored two bills dealing \n     with the Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear \n     Tire & Rubber Co., 127 S. Ct. 2162 (2007)--the ``Fair Pay \n     Restoration Act'' with Senator Kennedy and the ``Title VII \n     Fairness Act'' with Senator Hutchison. I cosponsored both of \n     these bills because I believed that the only way for a \n     substantively fair bill to pass was to find a bipartisan \n     compromise. I still believe that, and so in this Congress, I \n     have declined to cosponsor any legislation on this issue in \n     an effort to foster a compromise.\n       I agree with Senators Mikulski and Hutchison that women \n     should not be expected to challenge pay practices that they \n     do not know about. I also agree with Senator Hutchison that \n     no one--regardless of sex, race, age, or disability should be \n     expected to challenge a decision or practice they do not know \n     about. However, it was Congress' intent in passing Title VII \n     and other anti-discrimination statutes that if employees know \n     about such practices, they should file suit within a \n     reasonable time; they should not sit on their rights. This is \n     what Justice Ginsburg noted in her dissent in Ledbetter--that \n     Title VII has a remedial purpose. Moreover, the notion that a \n     statute of limitations begins to run from the time a person \n     knows that they have been harmed is consistent with every \n     other area of the law and is the reason for statutes of \n     limitations.\n       This is not an easy issue, and there is no doubt this \n     statute will lead to more litigation--some of which will have \n     merit, and some of which will not. For small employers in \n     particular, more litigation can cause serious economic \n     hardship. But my view has always been that we should give \n     maximum protection to women in the workplace. We all know the \n     proverbial ``glass ceiling'' is more than just a catch \n     phrase. It exists. And where there is discrimination, we must \n     ensure that a technicality on an especially short statute of \n     limitations does not preclude ending a discriminatory \n     practice or recovery. A 180-day deadline may be a reasonable \n     time period for filing claims challenging overt acts of \n     discrimination, such as a termination or denial of \n     promotion based on gender. Pay discrimination, however, is \n     more subtle, and often goes unnoticed by an employee for a \n     long time.\n       I voted for cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill. \n     But that does not mean I believe that we as Senators should \n     rubberstamp legislation, especially legislation that has \n     bypassed the committee process. There is a great deal to be \n     said for regular order, where we have the text of a bill, \n     amendments are proposed, there is debate, there are votes, \n     and the process moves ahead through the committee system. I \n     believe that the bypassing of the committee process has, in \n     the past, contributed to the ultimate failure of legislation.\n       It is imperative that, as the world's greatest deliberative \n     body, we have an open debate on every issue that comes before \n     us. Each Member should have the opportunity to offer \n     amendments. Before today, it had been over 120 days since \n     Republicans had an opportunity to offer an amendment to any \n     bill on the floor. I am pleased that the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders have reached an agreement to permit Members \n     to offer amendments to this bill.\n       As Senator Hutchison said on the floor this week, a bill \n     should be carefully drafted so that it does what the sponsors \n     intend for it to do and so courts are not left trying to sort\n\n[[Page S755]]\n\n     things out in a way that may contravene Congressional intent. \n     That is my reason for offering amendments to this bill. My \n     amendments will not alter the legislation significantly, but \n     rather will clarify what I perceive to be two ambiguous \n     aspects of the bill.\n       My first amendment would strike the phrase ``or other \n     practices'' where it appears in the bill. The bill does not \n     define the phrase and thus could be interpreted to mean that \n     an employee is excused from filing a timely challenge to any \n     employment decision that ultimately affects compensation, not \n     simply pay decisions. This could include promotions that the \n     employee knows he or she did not receive, transfers, work \n     assignments, or training. Such an interpretation would \n     arguably expand the definition of liability under Title VII \n     in a way that the authors of this bill did not intend. It \n     could also potentially embrace employment decisions with no \n     discriminatory intent or effect.\n       This phrase could also be interpreted as effectively \n     vitiating the statute of limitations. An unfair employment \n     decision, such as a failure to promote, could still affect an \n     employee's pay decades later. Thus, an employee could \n     potentially sit on his or her claim for years, regardless of \n     the fact that he or she was on notice when the unfair \n     employment decision was made. We want employees to challenge \n     those decisions when they are aware of the unfair decision. \n     And we want employers to have the opportunity to take prompt \n     remedial action.\n       My second amendment would add a rule of construction to \n     provide that nothing in the Act shall be construed to \n     prohibit any party from asserting waiver, estoppel, or \n     laches. These equitable doctrines allow courts to consider \n     whether an employee had notice of discriminatory treatment \n     but chose to do nothing for a long period of time. In her \n     dissent in Ledbetter, Justice Ginsburg reasoned that \n     ``[a]llowing employees to challenge discrimination that \n     extends over long periods of time .  . . does not leave \n     employers defenseless against unreasonable or prejudicial \n     delay. Employers disadvantaged by such delay may raise \n     various defenses. Doctrines such as waiver, estoppel, and \n     equitable tolling allow us to honor Title VII's remedial \n     purpose without negating the particular purpose of the filing \n     requirement, to give prompt notice to the employer.'' \n     Ledbetter, 127 S. Ct. at 2186 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) \n     (internal quotations and citations omitted). This amendment \n     makes clear that, under this bill, employers retain their \n     right to assert those affirmative defenses.\n       I have voted against cloture in the past as a matter of \n     principle. I do not think we ought to end a debate before a \n     debate has even begun or before Members have had an \n     opportunity to offer amendments. That has resulted, as I see \n     it, in gridlock on the Senate floor and dysfunction. I am \n     hopeful that this practice has ended with the new Congress.\n       I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the \n     Chair and yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share a few thoughts \nabout this subject. The need to ensure that women are not discriminated \nagainst in the workplace is very real. Congress has acted on that more \nthan once.\n  In fact, this litigation and legislation has arisen from statutory \nactions to make sure discrimination does not occur. The Supreme Court \nheld that one woman lost her suit because she brought it too late. \nBecause of this her allies, friends and others have promoted the idea \nthat we should change the statute of limitations in a historic way; in \nways we should not in order to deal with this problem.\n  I think that is a mistake. I practiced law for a lot of years. I have \nseen the power of the statute of limitations. Clarity in that issue is \nimportant to me in the practice of law and for every American citizen.\n  For example, I was a federal prosecutor for many years. A lot of \nAmericans may not know that a burglar, a robber or a thief can get away \nwith his crime if, after 5 years, they are not arrested or charged. \nThey are home free and cannot be prosecuted because of a statute of \nlimitation.\n  There are only a few crimes, such as treason and murder, that have \nextended statutes of limitations. The entire legal system we have \ninherited, this magnificent legal system that began in England and we \nhave worked with here serving us so well, has always recognized, as a \nmatter of policy, that people ought not to sit on their claims.\n  If someone has a claim they have a responsibility to come forward and \nmake it. Sometimes that makes for difficult choices. There was a case \nrecently in Alabama where an individual who had a claim went to the \nlocal probate judge. In Alabama, the probate judge is more of a \nministerial office. Some are not lawyers; most are. I am not sure if \nthis probate was a lawyer. He told the individual they could file a \nlawsuit next Wednesday. He filed it next Wednesday, and the person who \nwas sued went to court and moved to dismiss it, saying the man filing \nthe suit waited too late. In truth, he was 1 day late. The Alabama \nSupreme Court said: The law says this much time. You file it late, you \nare out.\n  This is the nub of the matter. The statute of limitations means \nsomething. Before the Ledbetter case arose I had on more than one \noccasion objected to a special piece of legislation in this Senate. I \nthink they finally got it passed through the House, but not the Senate. \nI was the only one who objected. It would give a law firm in one of the \nNation's big cities a special law, a bailout, that would excuse them \nfor missing the statute of limitations on a big, expensive matter. They \nsaid: ``Well, you know, this is a lot of money. It is millions of \ndollars. We only missed it by 1 day.'' I think it was a 1-day thing. \n``Give us a new law that allows us to get in there and get around our \nmistake.''\n  One time I suggested, well, would that law firm from hereafter commit \nto every client they have in their law firm, that if somebody files a \nlawsuit too late they will waive the statute of limitations defense; \nthey won't raise that defense, and let the other party go ahead and \nfile a case? Of course not.\n  A statute of limitations is a part of the law. Every lawyer knows the \nbest way to get sued for malpractice is to miss a deadline, which is \nwhat I said of this big law firm and its mistake. That is why you have \nmalpractice insurance and why it exists in the first place. If you miss \na statute of limitations or you advise your client wrong on the statute \nof limitations and filing deadlines, your client can sue you for \nmalpractice. You better have insurance or a lot of money to pay for \nyour mistake.\n  I want to say to my colleagues how deeply embedded in our legal \nsystem is the concept of the statute of limitations, the length of time \nin which you are entitled before you sue somebody.\n  Then there came another situation that is more difficult. Courts have \nworked their way through it, which is how these issues are resolved. \nWell, what if you are an average American citizen working and somebody \ncheats you or somebody mistreats you in the workplace and discriminates \nagainst you in the workplace. What if you are unaware? What if you had \nno evidence, you didn't know the true facts and you didn't know they \nhad cheated you? What about that? Well, basically the courts have had \nan equitable relief that says you have a certain amount of time from \nthe time you discover you have been mistreated in order to file a \nlawsuit. In other words, the statute of limitation is extended from the \npoint of discovery to allow you to seek relief.\n  In the Ledbetter case the Supreme Court concluded that the person \ncomplaining about the mistreatment, the discrimination in the \nworkplace, had known about it for years, several years, 4 or 5 years. \nThey said: You can't wait that long. One of the key witnesses involved \nin the alleged discrimination had died. So the argument was: Well, I \nget a percentage of my wages in pension benefits from the company. And \nbecause I didn't get promoted, my pension benefits are not as much as \nthey should be. And every time I get a check from the company I worked \nfor, it is somewhat less than what I would have otherwise been entitled \nto and, therefore, that is a new cause of action that begins to run \nevery time I get a new check.\n  This is not the way the law has been interpreted. Let me say with \nmore clarity, the philosophy and the history of limitations on actions \nhas never operated in this proposed fashion. If you head down that path \nof dealing with the issue there is virtually no limit on the statute of \nlimitations. For this class of cases--and it goes beyond employment \ncases--a very broad piece of legislation here today, it provides an \nextension of the statute of limitations, a tolling of the statute of \nlimitations to an almost indefinite time. That is not good.\n\n[[Page S756]]\n\n  We need to understand what we are doing. I know politically this has \nbeen ginned up into a big issue. It is complex and technical in some \nsenses. A lot of people haven't taken the time to grasp what we are \ndoing. But I urge my colleagues to consider the legislation moving \nforward and some of these amendments; that there are sound reasons that \nlimit the time for which a party can file a lawsuit against you. And \nthey are legitimate reasons. It has been a part of every action since \nthe founding of the Republic, to my knowledge, unless it was an \noversight. They all provide for a statute of limitations, even criminal \ncases. Criminals can walk free totally, if they cannot be charged for 5 \nyears, usually. I say 5. Alabama and most States still have 5 years for \nburglary and larceny and assaults.\n  I support equal pay for equal work. I urge my colleagues to recognize \nthat this evisceration of an historic principle of limitation of \nactions is not a way to fix it. It has ramifications far beyond these \ncases that have been discussed.\n  I urge my colleagues to spend some time in reviewing this, making \nsure that we realize what kind of hole we are knocking through the \nhistoric principle of the Anglo-American rule of law. If we do that, \nthis legislation will not become law in its final form.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland may proceed.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, earlier, I asked for a quorum call while \nthe distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and I had a discussion on \nwhat is the best way forward to clarify some of his questions on \nwaivers, estoppels, and laches in this bill. We were looking, trying to \nhave colloquies or amendments and so on. What we concluded was that the \nclearest way to do this so legislative intent is firmly established in \nthe Record is for him to offer his amendments, present his arguments, \nand I would offer rebuttal to that on that matter.\n  He also raised another issue on striking the phrase ``other \npractices.'' I would like to now talk about both of those amendments, \nbut sequence them.\n  First, I will discuss the Specter amendment on adding a rule of \nconstruction on the equitable defense of waiver, estoppel, and laches.\n  Mr. President, I strongly oppose Senator Specter's amendment to add a \nrule of construction to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act regarding \nemployers' equitable defenses on just what I said--waivers, estoppels, \nand laches. This amendment is unnecessary and unfair. These are \ntechnical legal terms, and I am going to be very clear that the \nlanguage is unnecessary because nothing in the bill changes the \navailability of these longstanding equitable defenses. Parties have \nbeen able to raise equitable claims in employment discrimination cases, \nand nothing in the pending legislation would change that. Courts will \nbe able to decide equitable claims under the same circumstances as they \ndo now. I am going to repeat that. Courts will be able to decide \nequitable claims under the same circumstances as they do now, \nregardless of whether this legislation is passed. The bill does not \nmention equitable doctrines, and nothing in its language could fairly \nbe implied to suggest that parties may not raise equitable claims.\n  In enacting legislation, Congress does not normally list all the \nthings the bill does or does not or could or could not do. Doing so \nhere could give courts the mistaken impression that Congress intended \ncourts to look more favorably on equitable defenses than they currently \ndo, thereby putting a thumb on the scale in favor of employers who \nraise such arguments.\n  Adopting the Specter rule of construction could also lead courts to \nconclude that Congress wanted to prevent assertions of equitable claims \nin other contexts not addressed in the bill, such as challenges to \npromotion, termination, or other benefits decisions. That result would \nhurt both employers and employees.\n  Neither of those interpretations is intended in this bill. The \npurpose of this legislation is not to upset the longstanding balance \nthat courts have established regarding these equitable defenses. As \nexplained in the findings, the bill's purpose is to overturn the \nLedbetter Court decision--a decision that had nothing to do with \nequitable defenses.\n  This amendment is also unfair because it is one-sided. It mentions \nonly equitable doctrines raised as defenses by employers, but ignores \nthe arguments workers may raise based on equitable doctrines. \nPlaintiffs have always had the ability to raise equitable claims such \nas waiver, equitable tolling, and estoppel. The Supreme Court ruled \nlong ago that the time limit in job discrimination cases is subject to \nequitable doctrines, and this legislation does not upset that ruling. \nSee Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 398, 1982. \nCourts have ruled that employees may raise claims of equitable tolling \nwhen they were excusably ignorant of their duty to file a \ndiscrimination claim by a particular date.\n  In addition, courts have held that employers are estopped from \nasserting that a worker's job discrimination claim is untimely if the \nemployer's conduct reasonably can be concluded to have induced the \nemployee to miss the filing deadline. For instance, when workers fail \nto timely file a charge of discrimination because their employer's \nmisrepresentations caused them to believe they had waived their claims, \nthe employer is estopped from arguing the charge was untimely. See \nTyler v. Unocal Oil Co. of California, 304 F.3d 379, 5th Cir. 2002. \nLikewise, if the employer induces a worker to delay filing a charge by \nfalsely stating that the employee was fired because his or her position \nwould be eliminated, the employer may be estopped from complaining that \nthe worker missed the filing deadline. See Rhodes v. Guiberson Oil \nTools Div., 927 F.2d 876, 5th Cir. 1991, holding that employer was \nestopped from arguing that worker's ADEA charge was untimely, where \nemployer concealed facts and misled employee into believing he had been \ndischarged because his position was being eliminated or combined with \nanother position, and that he might be rehired.\n  Yet the Specter amendment ignores this history and does not say that \nequitable claims also may be raised by plaintiffs alleging \ndiscrimination. This could lead to the perverse result that courts \nwould look less favorably on workers' equitable claims in pay \ndiscrimination cases than they do now. This legislation intends to \nrestore workers' ability to fight unfair pay discrimination, and we \nmust avoid erecting new hurdles by adopting an amendment that could \nundermine workers' arguments based on equitable doctrines.\n  For decades, the courts have been considering these and other \nequitable claims by plaintiffs in job discrimination cases, as well as \nequitable claims raised by defendants. We should do nothing in this \nlegislation to upset the balance courts have established in this area.\n  So when we do have our votes, I will urge my colleagues to join me in \ndefeating the amendment by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  Now, Mr. President, he also raises another issue related to ``other \npractices.'' I also strongly oppose that. I strongly oppose the \namendment offered by Senator Specter to strike the words ``other \npractices'' from section 3 of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This \namendment is unnecessary and would seriously undermine the bill's goal \nof protecting employees who, like Lilly Ledbetter, were denied a fair \nchance to challenge pay discrimination in the workplace.\n  This issue, too, involves a rather complex and detailed legal \nargument, complete with references and citations.\n  To summarize in somewhat plain English--because this issue is \ncomplicated, and the Senator from Pennsylvania has raised very \nimportant and solid questions, and I want to further clarify why we \noppose the amendment--Senator Specter's proposal to eliminate the term \n``other practices'' from section 3 of the bill would defeat our \nlegislation's purpose of overturning the Supreme Court's decision in \nLedbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 2007. Lilly \nLedbetter, the\n\n[[Page S757]]\n\nplaintiff in that case, was paid significantly less than her male \ncolleagues. This difference in pay came about because Lilly's employer \nbased her pay on a bad evaluation they gave her because she was a \nwoman. Now, I am going to repeat that. The difference in pay came about \nbecause her employer based her pay on a bad evaluation, but the bad \nevaluation they gave her was because she was a woman. And this has been \nestablished. The discrimination continued every time Ms. Ledbetter \nreceived a paycheck, and the difference in pay between her and her male \ncoworkers grew more severe over time. If you listen to her speak, you \ncan see how it affected her pay, her pension, her 410(k), and her \nSocial Security.\n\n  If we adopt the Specter amendment, this legislation will no longer \ncover situations like Ms. Ledbetter's, where a discriminatory \ndifference in pay is tied to a practice like job evaluations that \ncontributes to the employer's decision to set a worker's pay at a \ncertain level. That result is simply unacceptable.\n  The rule we enact in this bill must be workable and it must \naccurately reflect how job discrimination occurs in the workplace. Ms. \nLedbetter's case--and many others--show that salary determinations \noften rely on other discriminatory actions.\n  Unfair differences in pay may be brought about not only be \ndiscriminatory job evaluations, but also by discriminatory decisions to \nclassify a job in a particular way, or by discriminatory assignments to \na particular location. See, e.g., Parra v. Basha's, Inc., 536 F. 3d \n975, 9th Cir. 2008, Latino workers were paid up to $6,000 less annually \nthan other employees performing the same duties based on their \nassignment to a store location with a predominately Latino workforce; \nMoorehead v. UPS, 2008 WL 4951407, employer claimed that differences in \nstarting salaries for men and women were due to its evaluation system.\n\n  Because the factors that contribute to pay scales are solely within \nemployers' discretion, we must not adopt a rule that encourages \nemployers to link pay setting decisions to other personnel actions, \nsuch as evaluations, in order to avoid the civil rights laws. That \nwould create an unacceptable loophole in what is intended to be a \ncomprehensive solution of the problems created by the Ledbetter case.\n  If we adopt the Specter amendment, we would only help some victims of \npay discrimination--and leave countless workers such as Lilly Ledbetter \nwithout justice.\n  Senator Specter has said that his amendment is necessary because the \nbill, as drafted, is overbroad and could apply to discrete personnel \ndecisions, like promotions and discharges. That's not true. The bill \nspecifically says that it is addressing ``discrimination in \ncompensation.'' That limiting language means that it already only \ncovers such claims--nothing more, nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor in order to recognize \nour colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland for her \nleadership. It has been a long struggle and she continues that struggle \non the floor of the Senate today. I was thinking that the struggle for \nwomen's rights has been ongoing for a long time. It was 150 years in \nthis country before women had the right to vote. Think of it. This has \nbeen a long and tortured struggle.\n  I say to my colleagues that I think this is the easiest vote to cast. \nWe come to this floor sometimes to cast wrenching, difficult, \ncontroversial votes. This is not one of them. This cannot be one of \nthem. Requiring women who have been discriminated against to bring a \nlawsuit against their employer before they knew they were discriminated \nagainst is absurd, and yet that is what the Supreme Court said. It \nseems to me it is time to correct that Supreme Court decision.\n  Women have been fighting for equality and especially equal pay for a \nlong time. In this Ledbetter case, she was discriminated against by \nbeing paid substantially less than a coworker working right beside her, \ndoing exactly the same thing, and they underpaid her for years and \nyears and years. Finally, in the disposition of the Supreme Court, she \nwas told that her case didn't stand because she didn't file that claim \nwithin 180 days. She didn't know for 20-some years, let alone 180 days. \nWhy should she not have been able to have the right to continue \nredressing that wrong? So we must, it seems to me, do the work of the \ncommittee here today and pass this legislation.\n  This struggle, as I said, has gone on for so long. Abigail Adams was \nurging her husband John Adams to protect the rights of women as early \nas 1776. This struggle has gone on since before the Constitution was \nwritten in this country. I was reading some while ago about the \nstruggle of the woman's right to vote. This is about equal pay, but the \nso-called ``night of terror'' happened in Occoquan Prison. On November \n15, 1917, 33 women were severely beaten by over 40 guards in Occoquan \nPrison. Why? What had they done? They were arrested for obstructing \nsidewalk traffic in front of the White House. Why were they there? \nBecause they believed that women ought to have the right to vote in \nthis country. So they were arrested and hauled off to prison. Lucy \nBurn, one of the 33, they say was shackled around both arms and the \nchain between the shackles was hung on the top of a cell door and that \nwas her position throughout the night as blood ran down her arms. Alice \nPaul finally went on a hunger strike and they shoved a tube down her \nthroat and her vomit nearly killed her.\n  These women were tortured during the night of terror in Occoquan \nPrison because they obstructed traffic on a sidewalk? Why did they do \nthat? They demanded, after 150 years, the right to vote. That is what \nthey risked. They nearly died, some of them, to get this right to vote. \nThink of that struggle and how unbelievable that struggle was, and what \nheroes they were. But as always, there was push-back, people saying no.\n  My colleague from Maryland brings to us today an issue of fair play--\nanother long struggle, and it is not even nearly over--but at least \ntoday we can take a step in the right direction with respect to the \nLilly Ledbetter case. A Supreme Court that says a woman has no right to \nbring a pay discrimination case before the Court because she didn't \nknow she was being discriminated against? That is an absurdity and one \nthat must be corrected.\n  This long struggle for fairness for American women will not end on \nthe floor of the Senate today, but this should not be a difficult vote \nat all. I can't conceive of someone who would say the Supreme Court \ndecision has any sort of fairness attached to it. A woman who is \nworking for 25 years or more, beside someone who is doing the same job \nbut paid much more because of that person's gender, that woman doesn't \nhave a right to seek redress? What an unbelievable injustice.\n  Lilly Ledbetter, by the way, was here this week attending the \ninaugural of a new President. We have tried to solve this problem \nbefore in the last Congress, but couldn't. We will solve it now, \nbecause it is right, it is fair, it is just, and this struggle ought to \ncontinue until we win. This is one right step in the direction of this \nstruggle of fair pay, and it is a step we ought to take today.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Maryland for being such a leader on \nthis issue. My hope is at the end of this day--this day--we will have \npassed this legislation and taken a very large step in the direction of \njustice for women.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, \nfirst, he certainly knows his women's history and today he is going to \nhelp us write new history. We thank him for recalling--although it is a \nmelancholy thing to recall--how brutal the retaliation was against \nwomen. Every time we have had to stand up, whether to exercise our \nright to vote or as is the case now--the brutal retaliation that occurs \nin the workplace, often sexual harassment, further discrimination and \nso on, simply because we pursue being paid equal pay for equal work. So \nwe thank the Senator from North Dakota for his eloquence.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment, \nthis issue is about discrimination, but it goes far beyond this case or \ndiscrimination in these circumstances. It goes to the fair pay issue \nwhich the Senator from Maryland has been fighting for here in this \nChamber for months and years. Obviously, we are going to do\n\n[[Page S758]]\n\nmuch more, but today is the first step in the direction of justice for \nwomen, and I think it will be a good day today if we are able to pass \nthis legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment strikes the language ``or \nother practices.'' I believe there ought to be equal pay, and the \nlegislation would provide for equality of pay for women, break the \nglass ceiling, but would eliminate the surplusage language of ``or \nother practices'' because it is vague and ambiguous. It could include \npromotion, demotion, hiring, transfer, tenure, training, layoffs, or \nmany other items. It may be some of these other items ought to be \nincluded, and I, for one, would be glad to consider them, but they \nought to be specified so we do not have the vague and ambiguous term, \n``other practices,'' which would lead to tremendous litigation. Let's \nbe specific, what we are looking for. We are looking for pay. If \nsomebody wants to add something, fine, but ``other practices'' ought \nnot to be part of the legislation which would just stimulate \nlitigation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's minute has expired. The Senator \nfrom Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is a great \nlawyer, but his amendment is not. It only fixes half the problem. It \ndoes not cover personnel actions that still result in discriminatory \nwages. It strikes other practices which include job evaluations and \nclassifications.\n  If we drop ``other practices,'' we leave out Lilly Ledbetter from \ngetting the justice she deserves and all like her. I understand the \nSpecter amendment is now pending.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I have made this point a number of times, \nthat bills that go through committees have a markup and the amendments \ngive us direction. We often get them worked\n\n[[Page S759]]\n\nout. That did not happen on this bill. So we are trying to get some \nclarification done.\n  I appreciate that the Senator from Maryland put some things in the \nRecord that show legislative intent. I prefer to have it in the bill. \nThat is why my amendment is in here. It is an attempt to remove some of \nthe legal uncertainty this bill will create. It will clarify who is \nable to sue under title VII.\n  Under my amendment, only the person who has experienced \ndiscrimination can bring a lawsuit. Without my amendment the door is \nleft open to any affected individual. This is an undefined term in the \nstatute.\n  Senator Mikulski and I have had some back and forth about what the \nlanguage means. The truth is, without my amendment the courts will be \nable to define the term any way they want to. If you want to ensure \nthat only the person affected has standing to sue, then support my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Enzi amendment is unnecessary. The \n``affected by'' language is not vague. Our bill only applies to workers \nand their employers.\n  Other parts of title VII that our bill does not change make this \nclear. The ``affected'' language is patterned after the Civil Rights \nAct of 1991. It has been around for 17 years and no one has tried to \ninterpret it to apply to grandparents, spouses, or children, or anyone \nelse other than the worker.\n  I understand the Enzi amendment No. 28 is now pending.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I will yield the floor to Senator \nReed. I\n\n[[Page S760]]\n\nfirst thank Senator Harkin for managing the bill during the Lilly \nLedbetter press conference. His devotion to this issue is well known.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Madam President. And I thank Senator Mikulski.\n  First, let me commend Senator Mikulski for her extraordinary \nleadership on this legislation, along with Senator Harkin and also \nSenator Kennedy, who have been a driving force to ensure this \nlegislation came to the floor and is ready for passage.\n  I strongly support the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. This \nbill is about ensuring that all Americans are protected from pay \ndiscrimination and treated fairly in the workplace, particularly during \nthese tough economic times. After 8 years of enduring an economy rigged \nto benefit only the wealthy few, it is about time we reached out to try \nto help those struggling paycheck to paycheck, and this legislation \nwill do that.\n  As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I am pleased this bill \nseeks to address and correct the Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter \nv. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. It is a decision from 2007 that required \nemployees to file a pay discrimination claim within 180 days of when \ntheir employer first began to discriminate, even if the discrimination \ncontinued after that 180-day period.\n  Under the Ledbetter ruling, a worker could face longstanding pay \ndiscrimination and yet be shortchanged of a remedy simply because they \ndid not discover the discrimination within 180 days of their initial \ndiscriminatory paycheck.\n  The Ledbetter decision overturned established precedent in courts of \nappeals across the country and the policy of the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission under both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. In fact, it almost defies common sense and logic. Most \nemployees, if they have a pay dispute, hope it will be resolved \ninternally, and they will give their employer the benefit of the doubt \nprobably for more than 180 days until it becomes readily apparent that \nthis is systematic and discriminatory.\n  The legislation we are considering today reverses this erroneous \nfinding but also restores a sense of common sense into the workplace. \nIt returns the law to the pre-Ledbetter precedent by clarifying that \neach discriminatory paycheck restarts that 180-day period. As such, \nthis bill does not modify the time limit for filing a claim or the 2-\nyear limit on back pay but reestablishes when the statute of \nlimitations begins to run.\n  This allows workers to demonstrate and detect a pattern or cumulative \nseries of employer decisions or acts showing ongoing pay discrimination \nrather than simply reacting to any perceived notion of discrimination \nto fall within this 180-day period. As Justice Ginsburg noted in her \nLedbetter dissent, such a law is ``more in tune with the realities of \nthe workplace.'' I entirely agree.\n  The Supreme Court majority failed to recognize these commonsense \nrealities, including that pay disparities typically occur incrementally \nand develop slowly over time, and they are not easily identifiable and \nare often kept hidden by employers. Many employees generally do not \nhave knowledge of their fellow coworkers' salaries or how decisions on \npay are made.\n  Our Nation has certainly made progress on ensuring fairness, justice, \nand equality in the workplace. However, we know there are still \nsignificant barriers to overcome in closing the pay gap and making \ncertain that an individual's gender, race, religion, national origin, \ndisability, and age are not an impediment to their economic and \nemployment growth and prosperity. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of \n2009 is one important step toward achieving this goal.\n  Again, let me thank Senator Mikulski for leading the charge on this \nbill and, again, acknowledge the longstanding efforts of Chairman \nKennedy to seek passage of this and other legislative efforts to help \nworkers. One of the great dilemmas we face today ensuring that \nAmericans who are working--particularly wage earners--have sufficient \nincome so they can provide for their families and for their future.\n  Because of the flat and, in some cases, the receding income of \nworking Americans over the last 8 years, we have seen a situation where \nthey have to resort to their credit cards, where they have to put off \nimportant purchases, deny themselves opportunities, scale down access \nto colleges for their children because their income has not grown.\n  The great challenge--and it is not just an economic challenge but, I \nbelieve, it is a moral challenge--is to ensure that the income of every \nlevel of America grows; not just the very wealthy, but every level of \nAmericans has a chance to use their talents and see those talents \nrewarded by increasing income, we hope, each year. This legislation is \npart of that effort. But much more must be done.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill and to oppose any \namendments that seek to dilute its intent.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, is the distinguished chairman prepared \nto move forward?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 37\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSaxby Chambliss be added as an original cosponsor of amendment No. 37.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I grew up in the South when the civil \nrights era came and the civil rights laws were passed. After the \npassage of the Civil Rights Act, I ran a real estate brokerage company \nand saw the transition to fair housing from housing discrimination. I \nunderstand the ramifications of the Civil Rights Act, and I am proud \nand appreciative of what it has helped us to accomplish.\n  The 180 days in the statute of limitations applies to every facet of \nthat act. It applies to housing discrimination and, obviously, in this \ncase it applied to employment and pay discrimination. Obviously, with \nthe votes that have taken place and the failure of the Hutchison \namendment, it is pretty obvious which direction the bill is going.\n  So it is time we ask ourselves one question: Is it fair to reach back \nto the 1960s, repeal a statute of limitations that applied for over 45 \nyears, and open the possibility of a plethora of cases that have not \nbeen filed to now being filed or, asked another way: Is it fair, after \na game has been played, to change the rules in order to change the \noutcome?\n  Practically speaking, I would submit to you that this bill should be \nprospective and not reach back. It should say in the future that all \nthe provisions apply to any case that may be filed on a future incident \nof discrimination. But to reach back without limitation and repeal the \n180 days changes the rules of the game, changes the law under which \npeople were trying to operate in running their business.\n  But, most importantly of all, let me tell you what it specifically \ndoes. I ran a company for 22 years. I am very familiar with what \nlawyers can do in terms of bringing in an alleged case, filing a case, \ntaking you into depositions, and then saying: We can put a stop to all \nthis if you will settle for $5,000 or $10,000 or $15,000. It is using \nan opportunity open to them to intimidate or, in some cases, extort, in \nmy judgment, a fee out of an unwitting and unwilling business.\n  So I ask the fairness question: Is it right to go back to the \ninception of the civil rights laws, take an established principle that \napplied to housing, pay, and employment of 180 days, and change the \nrules so people can reach back after the passage of this legislation \nand create new litigation under changed rules?\n  In the interest of fairness, I would submit it should be prospective, \nthat all the applications of law should begin with the passage of the \nlaw and its enactment.\n  Madam President, I will be glad to yield the floor to the \ndistinguished chairman who is managing the bill and urge the adoption \nof the Isakson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I oppose the Isakson amendment because \nit would create an arbitrary and unfair cutoff for who gets the benefit \nof this fair pay bill.\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\n  The Isakson amendment No. 37 would limit application of the bill to \nonly claims that arise out of discrimination that takes place after the \nbill passes.\n  There is no principled reason for applying the bill only to future \ncases. The point of this bill is to correct a terrible wrong done to \nvictims of pay discrimination. We should be seeking justice for as many \npeople as possible.\n  Applying this bill to pending cases would not be an unfair surprise \nfor employers. This bill restores the law to where it was the day \nbefore the Supreme Court decided the Ledbetter case. There is nothing \nnew in this bill.\n  If this amendment passes, it would create a 20-month gap in the law. \nLet me repeat: If the Isakson amendment passes, it would create a 20-\nmonth gap in the law. Those workers who were unfortunate enough to have \nbeen discriminated against during that 20-month period would be treated \nworse than those who came before them and those who came after them. \nThat is arbitrary, and it is unfair.\n  As we work on this wage discrimination bill, we cannot fix only part \nof the problem. We have not come this far to leave some victims out in \nthe cold. Yet that is what I am concerned the Isakson amendment would \ndo.\n  Madam President, I will urge the rejection of the Isakson amendment, \nand when it comes time to call up the vote, I will be making a motion \nto table. But I am not making that motion now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator, you have 1 minute 50 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, with deference and respect for the \nchairman, this amendment would do nothing to a pending case. This \namendment will only apply to a case that has not been filed and could \nhave reached back all the way to the civil rights era of the \n1960s. Please be aware it would not in any way obliterate anybody's \nrights on any pending case that has been filed since May of 2007. It \nwould only affect those cases that haven't been filed all the way back \nto the Civil Rights Act.\n\n  So, again, I think it is a matter of fairness and equity. I \nappreciate the time that has been allotted. At the appropriate time I \nwill ask my colleagues to vote against tabling if that is the motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, first I wish to say to my colleague \nfrom Georgia that I appreciate the tone of civility in which he has \noffered his amendment, and that has been characteristic of the whole \nday. I hope it signals a new tone.\n  Although I appreciate the tone, I still disagree with the amendment. \nThe Lilly Ledbetter Act does not go back to the inception of the Civil \nRights Act. It goes back only to the Supreme Court decision of May 28, \n2007. So I continue to disagree with the Isakson amendment because I do \nbelieve it would create an arbitrary and unfair cutoff for those who \nwould benefit from this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back their time on the \npending amendment?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 1 minute 45 \nseconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. And how much time does the Senator from Georgia have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 10 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would just inquire if the Senator from Georgia wishes \nto yield back his time. I would be happy to cooperate and we could move \nto the DeMint amendment.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank him. I yield back the remainder of my time, and \nwe can proceed to the DeMint amendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 31\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The DeMint amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I am afraid the Ledbetter bill is \nanother example that the majority in the Senate doesn't understand the \nAmerican economy or how businesses create jobs or how freedom works for \nall of us to create a better quality of life. Recessions are caused by \nuncertainty. This bill creates more uncertainty for the very businesses \nwe need to create the jobs and to keep the jobs we have in our country \ntoday.\n  Why would we pass a bill, or even be talking about it, in the middle \nof a recession, that many have said is the worst we have ever seen in \nour lifetime? This bill will also create a lot of unintended \nconsequences that will do the exact opposite of what it is intended to \ndo.\n  I was in business for well over 20 years before I came to Congress. \nOnce you create more liability for hiring a woman or know that \nliability is going to exist for years, employers are going to figure \nout a way to get around that. This is more likely to discourage the \nemployment and the promotion of women because it creates an indefinite \nliability.\n  It seems that a lot of my colleagues have never been in business \nthemselves. I remember being in the advertising business, and I was 1 \nof 15 account executives. I was about in the middle as far as salary. \nThere were men and women who made less than I did. There were men and \nwomen who made more than I did. Some who made more than I did had less \nexperience, but because of clients or some other factor--some other \nintangible--it made them worth more than I was, they were paid more. It \nwas the same with those who made less. I was younger and in some cases \nless experienced than some of the men and women who made less, but I \nhad demonstrated that I could help our company make a profit more than \nthey had. The market was deciding our salaries. There is no way that \nanyone in this Senate or any government bureaucrat or Federal judge \ncould come in and say that there was discrimination because I was paid \nless than someone who was making more money or the same with someone \nwho was making less than I was.\n  For us to intervene and create a permanent liability is only going to \ncreate more uncertainty. This is not what we need to do with our \nbusinesses. So this whole bill should not even be considered now.\n  I have an amendment that gets at some of the issues that have been \ntalked about with this bill, about fairness and about discrimination. \nOne of the biggest forms of discrimination in this country today is \nwhen we force an American worker to join a union. My amendment is a \nright-to-work amendment. Right now in this country, we have a Federal \nlaw that forces American workers to join a union. States can pass a \nright-to-work law, as my State, South Carolina, has to protect their \nworkers, but this has proved very difficult for many States with \npowerful union bosses and union lobbies. My amendment, which is a \nnational right-to-work amendment, would restore the right of every \nAmerican not to join a union. It would eliminate the Federal \nrequirement that workers pay union dues.\n  We are getting ready to hear from some opponents of this amendment \nthat will use some very convoluted logic to defend their position. The \nsame people who support Federal labor laws, including wage requirements \nthat supersede State laws, will argue that my amendment violates States \nrights. Removing a Federal mandate on States could only violate States \nrights in the minds of politicians who have lost touch with our \nconstitutional moorings. My amendment is not about States rights. It is \nnot about Federal rights. It is not about business rights. My amendment \nrestores basic unalienable, individual rights.\n  No law--Federal or State--should force an American to join a union in \norder to get a job in this country. No law--State or Federal--should \nallow an American worker to be fired because he or she does not want to \njoin a union. This is about individual rights. There should not be a \nFederal law that discriminates against workers who choose not to join a \nunion. This is about fairness and about stopping basic discrimination \nthat is sponsored by this Federal Government.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this right-to-work amendment. It is \nvery consistent with the theme of this Ledbetter bill. It is more \nlikely to eliminate discrimination than the Ledbetter bill itself. I \nurge my colleagues to support it. I will reserve the remainder of my \ntime and ask for a vote.\n\n[[Page S762]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Under the consent agreement, the Senator from Tennessee \nhas 5 minutes of his own time, and then I will have 5 minutes of mine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I would appreciate being reminded \nwhen 4 minutes is up so that I may reserve the last 30 seconds of my \ntime.\n  The DeMint amendment would take away from States the right to decide \nwhether they want to be a right-to-work State or a State that allows \nfor an agency shop or a union shop. Now, on this very Senate floor, in \n1947, after World War II, Mr. Conservative, Robert A. Taft, the leader \nof the Republicans, stood before the American people and said the law \nthat was passed in 1935--the National Labor Relations Act--was wrong \nbecause it took away from States the right to make that decision, and \nthere was a tumultuous argument on the Senate floor.\n  Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act was passed, and it gave the \nStates the right to decide whether an employee would have to pay union \ndues or join a union in order to have a job. Since then, 22 States, \nincluding the State of Tennessee, have decided, yes; we want to be a \nright-to-work State under the principles supported by the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, but he wants to make that a national law.\n  I don't trust Washington on this issue. What do you suppose would \nhappen in the Senate if today we voted about whether to have a national \nright-to-work law or a national agency shop or a union shop? I think I \nknow what the result would be, and I know what would happen.\n  Thirty years ago I was the Governor of Tennessee and we were the \nthird poorest State and we had no auto jobs. Nissan wanted to come \nsomewhere in the United States, and they chose Tennessee because we had \na right-to-work law. Tennessee had the right to make that decision, \neven though other States chose not to have a right-to-work law. Then \nSaturn built a plant, and the Saturn employees chose to belong to the \nUAW and the Nissan employees said, no; we don't want to be in a union. \nSince that time, 13 major companies have come to the States that have \nright-to-work laws, including South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, \nAlabama, and Mississippi.\n  If we let the prevailing Washington view decide whether a State \nshould have a right-to-work, union shop, open shop, or agency shop law, \nwe wouldn't have had that advantage, and we might not even have had an \nauto industry in the United States today. That competition between the \nStates brought the companies that came here, hired American workers, \nbuilt cars in our country, and now build half of our cars. These \ncompanies are providing the competition that will help the Detroit part \nof our industry survive, I think, more so than Government bailouts.\n  So I say to my Republican colleagues especially, be careful what you \nask for. Do you want to ask the Congress to vote on whether States have \nthe right to choose a right-to-work law? I do not. I don't think you \nget any smarter about that issue by coming to Washington, DC. \nDemocratic and Republican Governors and legislatures in Tennessee for a \nlong time have thought we were perfectly capable of making that \ndecision.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to say Robert Taft was right in 1947 \nand 1948. We don't want Washington telling Tennessee, North Carolina, \nMinnesota, or Maryland what their labor laws ought to be. Let Tennessee \ndecide whether it wants a right-to-work law. I can think of nothing \nmore fundamental to the prosperity of my State than preserving the \nprinciple that States have the option to decide whether or not to have \na right-to-work law. So I respectfully oppose the DeMint amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I have a question for the Senator from \nGeorgia. I just wish to clarify the sequence after we conclude our \ndebate. Does the Isakson amendment come after the DeMint amendment? Is \nthat his understanding?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. It was my understanding of the UC agreement that the \nIsakson amendment will follow the DeMint amendment in terms of a vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator. That clarifies it. I have a \nquestion of Senator DeMint. Is the DeMint amendment to Lilly Ledbetter \nor are you amending another piece of legislation? Could you clarify \nwhat your amendment amends?\n  Mr. DeMINT. The Ledbetter bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the DeMint amendment amend the Ledbetter bill or \nthe National Labor Relations Act and the Railroad Act? The Ledbetter \nAct is the pending one.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Right.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. But the consequences are--aren't you amending the \nNational Labor Relations Act? The Ledbetter Act is strictly a wage \ndiscrimination bill.\n  Mr. DeMINT. It is a discrimination and fairness bill, and my bill \nwould change the National Labor Relations Act to remove a mandate on \nStates.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I still have the floor. Madam President, I have the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I had a question for Senator DeMint, and if the Senator \nwill withhold, after I make my remarks, he can address the Chair.\n  The consequence of the DeMint amendment is that it amends the \nNational Labor Relations Act. Let me tell my colleagues the \nconsequences. First of all, let's go to the facts.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is about pay discrimination, about \nwage discrimination. That is what we have been debating on both sides \nof the aisle. The debate has been focused, it has been targeted, it has \nbeen precise and, I might add, quite civil. It has nothing to do with \nright-to-work laws. This is not the time nor the place to debate \nwhether we should have a Federal right-to-work law. We need to restore \nthe ability of victims of pay discrimination to pursue justice. If we \nwant to have a debate on a Federal right-to-work law, then I suggest to \nthe Senator from South Carolina that he offer his own bill, let's put \nit through the committee, and let's vote on it, but let's not bring \nright-to-work laws into the wage discrimination focus of the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  So let's go now to the facts or the merits of the amendment being \noffered by Senator DeMint.\n  No. 1, it reverses decades of established labor law and addresses the \nissues that have nothing to do with the Fair Pay Act. The DeMint \namendment undermines States abilities to choose what labor laws work \nbest for them. That is the point made by the Senator from Tennessee. It \nwould also impose right-to-work laws on workers who do not want them. \nFederal labor policy has been neutral on right-to-work issues for over \n60 years. That means States are free to decide whether they want to \nimpose right-to-work laws. The amendment would impose right-to-work \nlaws on States that do not want them, and it would even impose such \nlaws in the railroad and aviation industry, which has never been \nsubjected to them.\n  We have debated this issue before. A bipartisan majority of Congress \nrejected this approach in the 104th Congress, which was in 1996. We had \na vote on a similar amendment, and it was defeated 31 to 68. I hope we \ndefeat the DeMint amendment today.\n  Let's stick strictly to the Lilly Ledbetter discussion. We have been \nhaving an excellent discussion all day long.\n  Again, I urge defeat of the DeMint amendment.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining, and, of course, \nanswer the questions of our colleagues as to time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 36 seconds \nremaining. The other side has 4 minutes 36 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining? I \nam supposed to have 30 seconds left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 1 minute 45 \nseconds.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I think I mentioned some convoluted \nlogic. I appreciate my colleague's civil discussion on this issue, but \nit is interesting to hear that removing a Federal\n\n[[Page S763]]\n\nmandate on States somehow violates States rights.\n  My colleague from Tennessee described a situation they have in their \nState--the same situation in South Carolina--where you can have a \nnonunion shop. People can choose to be in unions or unionize an \norganization. Workers can decide whether they belong to a union. What \nthat is called is freedom. Those are basic rights of Americans. What my \namendment would do is restore that freedom for people who live in every \nState, not just in States where State legislators have been able to \novercome union pressure and reestablish that freedom.\n  This is not about States rights, and this is not about the rights of \nthe Federal Government. It is not about some Federal bureaucrats or \nwhat judges decide. Every American should have a right to decide \nwhether they are going to join a union. For us to have a law at the \nFederal level imposed on people around the country that they have to \njoin a union, they have to pay union dues, that employers have a right \nto fire them if they don't join a union--this is not good for \nindividuals, but it is not good for our country.\n  A few weeks ago, we had a debate about the American auto industry. \nJust about every expert recognizes that forced unionization has \nessentially run them out of business. There is a reason companies are \nleaving the forced compulsory union States and moving to Tennessee and \nSouth Carolina. It is because there is more freedom there. That is what \nthis amendment is about. It is removing a Federal mandate that imposes \non the freedom of every American.\n  It is very relevant to the discussion today. We are talking about \nfairness. We are talking about discrimination. We are talking about \nwages. But when we force an American to join a union, take part of \ntheir wages and give it to a union, that is not freedom. I cannot \nimagine anyone here who thinks through this issue saying it does not \nhave something to do with fairness and discrimination and what we are \nabout as a country. We should have a right to unionize, we should have \na right not to unionize, but we should not force an American to join a \nunion and make their job contingent on it. This is much greater \ndiscrimination than we are dealing with in this Ledbetter bill, and it \nis very appropriate, if we are going to talk about fairness in \neliminating discrimination, that we include this amendment that would \nrestore a basic freedom to every American. That is what this amendment \nis about, is doing exactly what my colleague from Tennessee said they \nenjoy there. Why shouldn't they enjoy those same freedoms in Michigan \nand other States?\n  I encourage my colleagues to set aside old ways of thinking and \npartisan politics, payback to unions. This is not about us. It is not \nabout States. It is about people. It is about basic American rights. No \nAmerican should be forced to join a union.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if I were speaking in Tennessee, I \nwould give the Senator from South Carolina an A-plus for his statement \nbecause it is exactly the law I want Tennessee to have. But what we are \ntalking about here today is whether we want Washington to tell each \nState whether it can have a right-to-work law or agency shop or a union \nshop law. If Washington were to do that, Tennessee would not have a \nright-to-work law. We would not have permission to do that. We would \nnot have an auto industry which is one-third of all of our \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  So I want my Republican colleagues, if I may say so, to be very \ncareful here. Do we really want Washington telling us that the \nprinciple is they are going to say whether we can have a right-to-work \nlaw? I don't want them telling me that.\n  Does that mean 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. When I was Governor of Tennessee--and I see the former \nGovernor of Missouri here--nothing used to make me madder, to be blunt \nabout it, than some Washington Congressman or Senator holding a press \nconference and telling me what to do because usually they would tell me \nwhat to do and not send the money, and then I would have to send the \nmoney on to the mayor, raise taxes, lower taxes. I would have to do \nsomething myself. We are perfectly capable of deciding whether we need \na right-to-work law.\n  Last year, the Senator from New Jersey was trying to ship New \nJersey's laws to Tennessee with a national law. I cannot stand up and \nsay we want a national right-to-work law and then argue against having \nNew Jersey's laws in Tennessee, for States and counties that don't want \nthose laws. So we want to fit those to our own circumstances.\n  I greatly respect my colleague and friend, the Senator from South \nCarolina. On principle, he is right. There is another principle--\nfederalism--that we can decide for ourselves. We would undermine that \nprinciple.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the DeMint amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 38 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from South Carolina has how much time \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 12 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I don't know whether the Senator wants to yield back \nhis time or use the time for further debate.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, if I may continue, I will use the rest \nof my time. I want to make sure we are clear.\n  Again, my good friend from Tennessee has said that somehow this \namendment is going to take away the rights of States to have a right-\nto-work law. This is a right-to-work law. Every State in the country \nwould have a right to work, a right to choose to be union or not to be \nunion. This is not to restrict a State in any way at all.\n  Right now, if a State wants to be right-to-work, it has to override \nFederal legislation. Most of us continuously talk about protecting \nsecret ballots of workers. It is Federal legislation, it imposes a law \non everyone, but it is protecting the rights of individuals because it \nis not about unions and it is not about the businesses for which they \nwork. The Secret Ballot Protection Act would protect the individual and \ntheir rights. That is what this amendment is about. It is respecting \nthe rights of individuals not to join a union. It does not take away \nany right from a State; it actually removes a Federal mandate on \nStates.\n  I appreciate all the time that was given to this discussion. I, \nagain, urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, this amendment reverses decades of \nestablished labor law and addresses issues that have nothing to do with \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. While the Senator from South Carolina \ndebated right to work, I want to keep on fighting for the right to get \nequal pay for equal work.\n  I understand the DeMint amendment No. 31 is now the pending business. \nI move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 11, I voted ``aye.'' \nI ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my vote to \n``nay'' since it will not affect the outcome of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 37\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on amendment No. \n37, offered by the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson.\n  The Senator will be in order.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, the bill as it is written applies to any \nclaim back to May 28. But the way it is worded, it appears to me it is \na claim filed and leaves it open for any past claim to be brought up \nthat wasn't previously filed. The amendment simply ensures that the act \ncouldn't be used for new claims to be filed retroactively all the way \nback to the passage of title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It is a mere \nmatter of being clear that it doesn't retroactively open the \nopportunity to file new cases all the way back to the inception of the \nact.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would also like to speak in support of \nSenator Isakson's amendment No. 37. This amendment is about basic \nfairness. We have been talking a lot about fairness during \nconsideration of this bill--fairness for employees who suffer \ndiscrimination and don't realize it before a legal deadline passes, and \nfairness for an employer who may have done nothing wrong but becomes a \ntarget of an ambitious trial lawyer eager to test new legal theories.\n  The question many people ask when looking at what the underlying bill \nwould do is how is it fair to sue a businessperson over something that \nmay or may not have happened in his or her company decades earlier? \nWhat is a businessperson to do if the person who is alleged to have \ncommitted the discriminatory act no longer works there or, perhaps, is \ndeceased? Anyone can recognize the difficult position this creates. How \ndo you prove something didn't happen years ago when the only witness \nother than the accuser is absent?\n  Senator Isakson has come up with a very equitable solution to this \nriddle. He recognizes that, if this bill is enacted, employers will \nhave to keep a far more detailed record of every employment decision, \nevery performance review, every personnel action, and more. The bill \nretroactively re-opens liability for dozens of years of employment \ndecisions. Upon enactment of this bill, employers will be on notice \nthat the statute of limitations for title VII cases virtually never \nexpires. But it simply isn't fair to apply this new open-ended statute \nof limitations to employment decisions that occurred decades ago.\n  Senator Isakson's amendment resolves this inequity by applying the \nnew law on a prospective basis. As a former small business person \nmyself, I believe this is the only fair way to apply a new and \nburdensome standard.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I object to the Isakson amendment. It \nwould create an arbitrary and unfair cutoff for those who get the \nbenefits of this bill. If the Isakson amendment is agreed to, it would \ncreate a 20-month gap in the law. Those workers who were unfortunate \nenough to have been discriminated against during that 20-month period \nwould be treated worse than those who came before them or after them. \nIt is arbitrary and it is unfair.\n  I understand that the Isakson amendment is now the pending business.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Vitter \namendment is offered, which will be very quickly, there be 15 minutes \nfor debate, 10 minutes for Senator Vitter, 5 minutes for Senator \nMikulski; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the amendment; that no amendment be in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote; that upon disposition of the \nVitter amendment, no further amendments be in order, the bill be read a \nthird time, and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that \nthe vote on passage would be as if it were a cloture vote, and that if \nthe threshold is achieved, the bill is passed, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, on behalf of all Senate leadership, \nappreciate the way we have moved through this legislation. Now, were \nall of these votes easy? No, they were not easy. Some of them were \ndifficult votes for a number of my Senators, I am sure on the other \nside of the aisle as well. But this is the way we need to operate as a \nSenate.\n  Were all of these amendments offered germane? No. But the people have \na right to offer amendments. So I appreciate everyone's cooperation to \nthis point. We are going to move forward, we hope, to work out, and we \nare going to clear, some of the nominations of President Obama tonight \nor tomorrow.\n  We also hope we can arrange to have, Monday night, a vote on Treasury \nSecretary-designee Geithner. We will try to do that at a time \nconvenient. It has been suggested to me that time would be about 6 \no'clock. We will probably come in sometime in the afternoon. It is my \nunderstanding that people who are for and against him want 2 hours of \ndebate equally divided. But if people want to talk more, we can come in \nearlier in the afternoon and do some morning business, and people can \ntalk about whatever they want during that time.\n\n[[Page S765]]\n\n  We also understand we are going to be able to move to the SCHIP bill \nwithout filing cloture. I was going to file cloture on that tonight, \nbut it is my understanding that we can start that Monday night and work \nthrough the amendments on that next week. We are going to finish that \nnext week. I understand there will be a lot of amendments. I am sure \nthat is the case.\n  The reason we have to complete work on it next week is that we must \nmove to the economic recovery package. We only have 2 weeks to finish \nthat. I want to spend a good, long, hard week finishing what we are \ndoing before we send our product to the House because we need that \nfinal week to make sure we do conferences and messages and work out \nwhatever differences we have between the two bills.\n  We are not going to be able to take our recess for Presidents Day \nunless we finish that legislation. I think everyone agrees, Democrats \nand Republicans agree, we need to get this done. The imperative of \ndoing this every day becomes more pronounced, in my mind. We had our \nDemocratic policy committee today where we had Alan Blinder, who is a \nDemocrat; Martin Feldstein is a Republican; and Mark Zandi, who I think \nis a Republican. I am pretty sure he is. He was one of Senator McCain's \nchief advisers. They all agreed and, in fact, Mark Zandi said to me \nbefore the presentation: You are going to be hearing from dark, darker, \nto darkest. We have economic problems that have never been seen in this \ncountry or the world before and we have to work to see what we can do \nto help alleviate the problems that exist out in that difficult \nfinancial world in which we find ourselves.\n  So that is why people should not plan on next weekend going home. You \nshould plan on being here. If there is a way we can work our way around \nthat, I will be happy to do that. But I think the chances are quite \nslim that we would be able to do that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today we get a second chance to do the \nright thing.\n  Millions of American women and men understand that it is wrong for a \nwoman to work, year after year, alongside a man and make less money \nsimply because she is a woman.\n  Millions of American women understand--unfortunately many know first \nhand--that you don't always know when you are being discriminated \nagainst. Proof that you have been a victim of discrimination rarely \nboils down to one magic moment where the curtain is raised and it is \nall made clear. And of course, the curtain hardly ever comes up within \n180 days of the actual ``act'' of discrimination.\n  All too often, discrimination based on gender happens exactly the way \nit happened to Lilly Ledbetter. Paycheck after paycheck, a woman \nreceives lower pay than her male colleagues. But only after years does \nshe discover that this was even happening. Only after years does she \ndiscover that it has been the result of discrimination.\n  It is just as demeaning, and in many ways even more frustrating, than \na single, concrete episode of bias.\n  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who took the unusual step of reading her \ndissent in Lilly Ledbetter's case from the bench, was outraged by her \ncompatriots on the Supreme Court who held the passage of time against \nLilly Ledbetter. You see, Justice Ginsburg understands what so many \nAmericans also understand--that it is often a series of small and \nhidden decisions that add up to a lifetime of unequal pay. This kind of \ndiscrimination can't be tied to one definitive act. Instead, it comes \nfrom the cumulative effect of weeks, months, and sometimes years of \nbigotry and injustice.\n  Many of us have daughters and granddaughters who need us to vote for \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. What will you say if your daughter or \ngranddaughter calls you tonight and said, ``Hey, I need some advice. I \nhave had this job for 5 years. I have been working really hard and I \nhave always had good reviews, my colleagues like me, and I love my job. \nI need this job to support my family. But I just found out that all \nalong, I have been getting paid about 75 percent of what the guys here \nget paid for doing the same thing. I have been asking around and it \nturns out our supervisors have been doing this for a while--paying men \nmore, and saying things about women that are negative. One guy even \nsaid that our workplace doesn't need women. What should I do?''\n  Do you want to tell your daughter or granddaughter, ``Well, if the \ndecision to discriminate against you was made more than 180 days ago, \nthat is too bad, you should have complained earlier''?\n  I don't want to do that, and I don't intend to. I want to be able to \nsay to my daughter, and all American daughters, wives, sisters, and \ngranddaughters: There is something you can do about this. This behavior \nis wrong, and Congress gave you a way to make it right. Plain and \nsimple.\n  It is un-American to work your whole life for a fraction of what your \ncolleagues make, solely because you are a woman. It is un-American to \ntell a woman who just wants a fair shake in exchange for 20 years of \nwork that she should have known what was going on, and now it is too \nlate--that she should have filed a new claim after every paycheck.\n  Congress did not pass Title VII, not to mention the Equal Pay Act, 46 \nyears ago only to lace it with traps and trip wires for the unwary \nworker.\n  Some critics of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act have said that it \nwill lead to an onslaught of lawsuits. But the Congressional Budget \nOffice has said that this isn't true. I believe that is based on the \nobvious proposition that most women don't want to sue their employers. \nThey don't go out of their way to ruin their own lives with lawsuits. \nThey didn't do it before the Ledbetter decision, and there is no reason \nto believe that they will do it after we restore the import of the law.\n  Lilly Ledbetter didn't want to sue. In fact she has said that she \nwouldn't have bothered if she thought the case was close, or the result \nof an oversight, or based on poor reviews. But, as all of the evidence \nshowed, it wasn't. Lilly Ledbetter said: ``It wasn't even close to \nbeing fair. I had no choice. I had to go to court. I had to stand up \nfor what was right.''\n  This bill isn't some windfall for women to sit on their hands without \nbringing claims during years of discrimination. All of an employer's \nnormal defenses are untouched by this bill. We have discussed the legal \ndefenses and the operation of various parts of this bill ad nauseum, \nbut overlawyering this isn't going to change the fact that women make \n78 cents on the dollar compared to similarly situated men.\n  The right to make a fair wage to support your family, regardless of \ngender, is not something that should be doubted in America. The right \nto equal paychecks is something that Congress thought it guaranteed 46 \nyears ago, and which was not in doubt until Lilly Ledbetter's case \nreached the Supreme Court.\n  We must take the very simple step of restoring this right so that \nwomen in America can be assured that their hard work for their families \nand their country will be compensated on the same basis as men.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  As we begin our work this Congress to address the greatest economic \nchallenge our nation has faced in a generation, the solutions we \nconsider must focus on strengthening the middle class.\n  Last month the economy lost 524,000 jobs, and in 2008, 2.6 million \njobs were lost--the most in one year since 1945.\n  Unemployment continues to climb--in some areas of my State of \nCalifornia, the unemployment rate is over twelve percent. Wages for \nmany in the middle class have actually decreased over the last 8 years.\n  And 46 years after passage of the Equal Pay Act, workers throughout \nthe nation still suffer pay discrimination based on gender, race, \nreligion, national origin, disability and age.\n  When it comes to achieving the principle of equal pay for equal work, \nwe still have a long way to go.\n  Women workers today earn only 78 cents for every dollar men earn. The \npay disparity is still so great that it takes a woman 16 months to earn \nwhat a man earns in 12 months.\n  In 2006, an average college-educated woman working full time earned \n$15,000 less than a college-educated male.\n  According to the American Association of University Women, working \nfamilies lose $200 billion in income per\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\nyear due to the wage gap between men and women.\n  To put it simply, pay discrimination is hurting our middle class \nfamilies and hurting our economy.\n  Unfortunately there is no easy solution that will eliminate all pay \ndiscrimination.\n  But what this bill will do is ensure that when an employer \ndiscriminates based on gender or race or other factors, the employee \ncan have his or her day in court.\n  With its 2007 Ledbetter v. Goodyear decision, the Supreme Court \nreversed decades of legal precedent in the courts of appeals and long-\nstanding Equal Employment Opportunity Commission policies, and \neffectively undercut a commonsense, fundamental protection against pay \ndiscrimination.\n  With its decision, the Court imposed significant obstacles for \nworkers by requiring them to file a pay discrimination claim within 180 \ndays of when their employer FIRST starts discriminating--an almost \nimpossible standard.\n  This bill simply restores the law to what it was prior to the Court's \ndecision in a workable and fair way that will protect people like Lilly \nLedbetter from discrimination.\n  Mr. President, the story of Lilly Ledbetter makes it clear why this \nlegislation is necessary.\n  The discrimination she suffered is not unfamiliar to many female and \nminority employees in manufacturing plants and office parks across the \ncountry.\n  Ms. Ledbetter was a female manager at an Alabama Goodyear Tire plant \nwhen she discovered after 19 years of service that she was earning 20 \nto 40 percent less than her male counterparts for doing the exact same \njob.\n  As Justice Ginsburg noted in her dissenting opinion, ``the pay \ndiscrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts was stark.''\n  In 1997, her last year of employment at Goodyear, after 19 years of \nservice, Ms. Ledbetter earned $5,608 less than her lowest-paid male \ncoworker. She earned over $18,000 less than her highest-paid male \ncoworker.\n  Evidence submitted in her trial showed that Ms. Ledbetter was denied \nraises despite receiving performance awards, her supervisors were \nbiased against female employees, and that in some cases, female \nsupervisors at the plant were paid less than the male employees they \nsupervised.\n  When Ms. Ledbetter discovered this, she took Goodyear to court and a \njury awarded her full damages.\n  But Goodyear appealed the jury's decision, and in 2007, the Supreme \nCourt overturned the verdict and said that Ms. Ledbetter could not sue \nfor back pay despite overwhelming evidence that her employer had \nintentionally discriminated against her because of her gender.\n  The Supreme Court threw out the case because it took her longer than \nsix months to determine that she had been the victim of years of pay \ndiscrimination.\n  This is an unfair standard.\n  In most situations, if an employee suspects pay discrimination, it \ntakes significant time to determine the facts.\n  As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, ``compensation disparities are often \nhidden from sight for a number of reasons.''\n  Ginsburg's point underscores the unreasonableness of the standard \ncreated by the Supreme Court.\n  Many employers do not publish employee salaries and employees are \noften not eager to discuss their wages with other employees.\n  Earlier this month the New York Times reported that ``in the last 19 \nmonths, Federal judges have cited the Ledbetter decision in more than \n300 cases . . .''\n  This decision has had significant impacts on the employees alleging \npay discrimination, severely limiting their rights to equal pay. Some \ncourts are also using the decision to limit rights in other areas of \nthe law, like equal housing, equal education, and civil rights cases.\n  The Ledbetter decision was a giant step backward in the fight for \nequal opportunities and equal rights.\n  Goodyear engaged in chronic discrimination against female employees, \nbut because of this decision, the courts must treat intentional, \nongoing pay discrimination as lawful conduct.\n  Employers who can conceal their pay discrimination for 180 days are \nfree to continue to discriminate with no redress for the employee.\n  We must ask ourselves: Is this a standard that Congress should \nsupport?\n  This bill simply restores the law to what it was in almost every \nstate in the country before the Ledbetter case was decided. That law \nbasically said you had 180 days to seek justice on equal pay for equal \nwork each time that you were discriminated against.\n  It does so by eliminating the unreasonable barrier created by the \nSupreme Court and allows workers to file a pay discrimination claim \nwithin 180 days of each discriminatory paycheck.\n  For the Nation's working families and middle class to succeed and \ngrow, the principle of equal pay for equal work must have teeth, it \nmust have meaning, and this bill restores meaning to the equal pay \nprinciple.\n  Justice Ginsburg told us, ``Congress, the ball is in your court.''\n  The time is now to restore decades of legal precedent and prevent the \nnarrow Ledbetter decision from impacting more Americans facing \ndiscrimination.\n  We must restore this important protection and return the law to its \nintended meaning.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue of \nfundamental economic fairness--an issue that affects the dignity and \nthe security of millions of Americans: the right to equal pay for equal \nwork.\n  Before I begin, let me thank Senator Kennedy, the chairman of the \nHELP Committee, and Senator Mikulski, for their tireless work on this \nimportant issue.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act goes a long way toward ensuring that \nright to equal pay. In a perfect world, of course, we could take that \nright for granted--we could take it for granted that the value of work \nlies not in the race or gender of the person who is doing it but in a \njob well done.\n  Unfortunately, we don't live in that world. We know that, even now, \nsome employers cheat their employees out of equal pay for equal work.\n  That's what happened to Lilly Ledbetter. For almost two decades, from \n1979 to 1998, she was a hardworking supervisor at a Goodyear tire plant \nin Gadsden, AL.\n  And it is telling that she suffered from two types of discrimination \nat the same time. On the one hand, there was sexual harassment, from \nthe manager who said to her face that women shouldn't work in a tire \nfactory, to the supervisor who tried to use performance evaluations to \nextort sex.\n  And on the other hand, there was pay discrimination: by the end of \nher career, as the salaries of her male coworkers were raised higher \nand faster than hers, she was making some $6,700 less per year than the \nlowest paid man in the same position.\n  Now, the two kinds of discrimination faced by Ms. Ledbetter have a \ngood deal in common. Morally, each amounts to a kind of theft--the \ntheft of dignity in work and the theft of the wages fairly earned.\n  Both send a clear message as well--that women don't belong in the \nworkplace.\n  But there is a clear difference between sexual harassment and pay \ndiscrimination. The former is blatant. The latter far too often stays \ninsidiously hidden.\n  In fact, Lilly Ledbetter didn't even know she was being paid unfairly \nuntil long after the discrimination began. Absent an anonymous coworker \ngiving her proof, she might be in the dark to this very day.\n  And that is hardly surprising. How many Americans know exactly how \nmuch their coworkers make? What would happen if they asked? At some \ncompanies, you could be fired.\n  Armed with proof of pay discrimination, Ms. Ledbetter asked the \ncourts for her fair share. And they agreed with her: she had been \ndiscriminated against.\n  She had been cheated.\n  And she was entitled to her back pay.\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court ruled against her, and took it all \naway. Yes, she had been discriminated against--but she had missed a \nvery important technicality.\n  She only had 180 days--6 months--to file her lawsuit--and the clock \nstarted running on the day Goodyear chose to discriminate against her.\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\n  Never mind that she had no idea she was even the victim of pay \ndiscrimination until years later. Figure it out in 180 days, the Court \nsaid or you are out of luck for a lifetime.\n  It is not hard to see how this ruling harms so many Americans beyond \nMs. Ledbetter. In setting an extremely difficult, arbitrary, and unfair \nhurdle, it stands in the way of many, many Americans fighting against \ndiscrimination.\n  It also flatly contradicts what had been the standard practice of the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, flies in the face of decades \nof legal precedent, and ignores clear congressional intent.\n  As Justice Ginsburg put it in her vehement dissent, the Court's \nLedbetter ruling ignores the facts of discrimination in the real world. \nShe writes:\n\n       Pay disparities often occur . . . in small increments; \n     cause to suspect that discrimination is at work develops only \n     over time. Comparative pay information, moreover, is often \n     hidden from the employee's view . . . Small initial \n     discrepancies may not be seen as meet for a federal case, \n     particularly when the employee, trying to succeed in a \n     nontraditional environment, is averse to making waves.\n\n  ``The ball,'' Ginsburg concluded, ``is in Congress's court . . . The \nlegislature may act to correct this Court's parsimonious reading.''\n  That is precisely what we are here to do today. With today's passage \nof the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, employees will have a fair time \nlimit to sue for pay discrimination. They will still have 180 days, but \nthe clock will start with each discriminatory paycheck, not with the \noriginal decision to discriminate. After all, each unfair paycheck is \nin itself a decision to discriminate--it is ongoing discrimination. \nEmployees like Ms. Ledbetter will no longer be blocked from seeking \nredress, through no fault of their own, except a failure to be more \nsuspicious.\n  This is an important moment and important bill. I do wish we were \nalso strengthening the remedies available to victims of pay \ndiscrimination under the Equal Pay Act.\n  For this reason we must also pass into law the Paycheck Fairness Act, \nauthored by my friend and colleague in the Connecticut delegation, \nCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro, and championed in the Senate by Senator \nHillary Clinton. Had paycheck fairness been law when Lilly Ledbetter \ndecided to go to court, she may well have received just compensation \nfor the discriminatory practices she endured. She certainly would have \nhad a stronger case to make and a greater array of tools. So, as \ncritical as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is, we certainly have more \nwork to do.\n  Millions of Americans depend on the right to equal pay for equal \nwork: to earn a livelihood, to feed their families, and to uphold their \nbasic dignity. We ought to make it easier for Americans to exercise \nthat right, not harder. We ought to get unfair roadblocks, hurdles, and \ntechnicalities out of their way. With passage of the Lilly Ledbetter \nFair Pay Act, we take an important step toward eliminating these \ndiscriminatory roadblocks once and for all.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about my vote on final \npassage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  I want to first reiterate a most important statement of the entire \ndebate on this bill, with which we all agree. As I said yesterday, \nduring debate on Senator Hutchison's substitute amendment, \ndiscrimination because of an individual's gender, ethnicity, religion, \nage, or disability cannot be tolerated. No Americans should be subject \nto discrimination, and if they are, they have the right to the law's \nfull protection.\n  Having said that, I am pleased that we have had the opportunity to \noffer and vote on amendments that Members of the Senate believe would \nhave perfected this legislation. I would also note that this \nopportunity is a welcome reversal from last year, when we did not have \nan opportunity to offer amendments, and it was for that reason that I \nvoted against cloture last year.\n  As you know, I have had concerns about the Fair Pay Act's deletion of \nthe statute of limitations. In my view, once an employee knows, or has \na reasonable suspicion, that he or she has been the subject of \ndiscrimination, the employee has the responsibility to file a complaint \nwithin a reasonable amount of time. That responsibility benefits the \nemployee first of all, but also benefits the employer, if a claim is \npursued while records are available and memories are fresh. In \naddition, the employee is more likely to be able to recover the full \namount of his or her lost wages rather than just the previous 2 years' \nwages.\n  For these reasons, I supported Senator Hutchison's substitute \namendment. Her amendment recognized the important point that many \nemployees do not know that their rate of pay is discriminatory. It \nwould also have restored beneficial timeliness to the process once the \nemployee suspected or knew of discrimination. I am disappointed that \nthis amendment failed.\n  At the end of the day, however, after the amendment process has \nconcluded--a process that was not available to us last year--I believe \nit is more important to vote for legislation that will improve every \nAmerican's ability to access full redress for any act of wage \ndiscrimination.\n  The Fair Pay Act provides that vital protection. For that reason, I \nwill vote for this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. \nThis legislation is important to ensure that Americans from all walks \nof life have a realistic opportunity for recourse if they are victims \nof pay discrimination. We are considering this bill because of the \nSupreme Court's interpretation, in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire & Rubber \nCo., of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Court's 5 to 4 \nruling makes it almost impossible for many victims of pay \ndiscrimination to find an adequate legal remedy under the Civil Rights \nAct. The legislation we are considering today will correct that.\n  The Civil Rights Act established the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, EEOC, to enforce title VII. The EEOC is empowered to \nprotect against employment discrimination based on sex, race, national \norigin, religion and disability by receiving complaints of \ndiscrimination, investigating discrimination, conducting mediations to \nsettle complaints and filing law suits on behalf of employees.\n  Despite the efforts of the EEOC, the United States still suffers from \nsignificant pay iniquities. Numerous studies using census data and \ncontrolling for work patterns and socioeconomic factors found that half \nor more of the wage gap between males and females is due to gender \nalone, demonstrating that discrimination based on gender is all too \ncommon in American work places. Over the past decade, the EEOC has \naveraged more than 24,400 complaints of sex-based discrimination each \nyear.\n  One of those complaints was filed in 1998 by a woman named Lilly \nLedbetter. She alleged that she was the victim of a sex-based pay \ndisparity during her nearly 20-year career at Goodyear. Ledbetter sued \nGoodyear, and a jury awarded her back pay and damages after finding, \namong other things, that Ledbetter was being paid $550 to $1550 less \nper month than her male counterparts who were doing the same work. For \nalmost her entire tenure at Goodyear, Letbetter was not aware that she \nwas being discriminated against because the pay levels of her coworkers \nwere kept strictly confidential. In fact, she only learned that she was \nmaking less than males doing the same job as her because of an \nanonymous tip that she received shortly before her retirement.\n  Congress's intent in passing the Civil Rights Act and in passing \nsubsequent updates to the Civil Rights Act in 1991 a bill which I \nsupported was to help remedy the sort of discrimination that Lilly \nLedbetter fell victim to. Although the validity of claims of pay \ndiscrimination filed within 180 days of receiving a paycheck reflecting \ndiscriminatory policies has been recognized by countless lower courts \nand was explicitly accepted under EEOC guidelines and by previous EEOC \nadministrative decisions, the Supreme Court ruled that Ledbetter's \nclaim of discrimination was not actionable under title VII. Their \nopinion stated that Ledbetter's claim was not filed within 180 days of \nthe discriminatory act against her.\n  In ruling against Ledbetter, the majority's opinion stated that ``it \nis not [the Supreme Court's] prerogative to change the way in which \ntitle VII balances the interests of the aggrieved\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\nemployees against the interest in encouraging the prompt processing of \nall charges of employment discrimination.''' The majority concluded \nthat ``Ledbetter's policy arguments for giving special treatment to pay \nclaims find no support in the statute'' and that the Supreme Court must \napply ``the statute as written, and this means that any unlawful \nemployment practice including those involving compensation, must be \npresented to the EEOC within the period prescribed in the statute.''\n  The dissenters rightly characterize the majority opinion as \n``parsimonious.'' I believe that the majority put forth a misguided \ninterpretation of unlawful employment practices, and in doing so \nincorrectly found that Lilly Ledbetter's claim did not fall within \ntitle VII of the Civil Rights Act. I also believe that the opinion of \nthe Court required an unreasonable interpretation of Congress's intent \nin title VII. Their finding would make it next to impossible to file a \nsuccessful claim of discriminatory pay, given the challenges in \ndetecting such discrimination. The Supreme Court interpreted \nCongressional intent in a civil rights law in a way that is restrictive \nof peoples' civil rights and available remedies.\n  But the issue for us to decide is not what a previous Congress \nintended. We are to decide what the law should be, and what is right. \nThis legislation determines that each discriminatory paycheck will \nqualify as an unlawful employment practice under title VII. Equitable \nremedies defendants can raise, including laches, are not disturbed by \nthis bill.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act will restore the protections against \ndiscriminatory pay that Congress and the courts have previously \nendorsed, and provide a reasonable route through the EEOC and the court \nsystem for people like Lilly Ledbetter to have pay discrimination \ncorrected and remedied.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.\n  This bill is about equality, and it is about fairness. Although our \ncountry has made many important strides toward equality, when it comes \nto the week-to-week question of paychecks, or the day-to-day issue of \nfinancial security, women continue to lag behind.\n  Women simply are not paid as much as men, even when they do the exact \nsame job.\n  Last summer, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that women who work full \ntime earn, on average, only 78 cents for every dollar that men earn.\n  This is not an insignificant difference. It means that when a man is \npaid $50,000 a year for a certain kind of work, a woman may receive \nonly $39,000. That is $11,000, or 22 percent less.\n  But when women go to pay their bills, to buy groceries, or to try to \nfind health care, they are not charged 22 percent less. They are \ncharged the same and must stretch their finances as best they can to \nmake ends meet.\n  Women's financial struggles do not affect them alone. They affect \ncountless families across the country. According to the U.S. Census, as \nof 2007, approximately 20 percent of American households were headed by \nwomen, and other surveys of households have revealed that a majority of \nwomen report providing more than half of their household incomes, with \nover a third totally responsible for paying the bills.\n  Ensuring equality in pay is absolutely essential right now. While all \nAmericans are concerned about downturns, layoffs, stagnant wages, and \npay cuts, it is also true that in an economic downturn, women suffer \ndisproportionately under almost every economic measure. Women lose \ntheir jobs more quickly than men, and in December 2008, 9.5 percent of \nwomen who were the heads of their households were unemployed. Women's \nwages fall more rapidly. Women are disproportionately at risk for \nforeclosure, and as of last year, 32 percent more likely to receive \nsubprime mortgages than men. And women have fewer savings on average.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act takes an important step forward in \nprotecting working American women's financial well-being. The bill \nreverses the Supreme Court's parsimonious reading of pay discrimination \nlaw in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. so that women will not \nbe turned away twice--first by their employers when they seek equal pay \nfor equal work, and second by the courts when they go to file claims of \nunfair treatment.\n  The bill is a necessary correction to a Supreme Court decision that \nwas incorrect. The bill ensures that when employers unlawfully pay \nwomen less for performing the same job, they can seek recourse in the \nFederal courts.\n  I also want to say a word about the amendments offered today. The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act does not change the substance of title VII \ndiscrimination law. What it does is make sure that women who have \nmeritorious discrimination claims under that law are not unfairly \ndenied the right to go to Federal court and recover compensation.\n  The bill says that women can file their claims within 180 days of \ntheir last discriminatory paycheck and can recover up to 2 years' back \npay from that date. Any stricter timing requirement is simply out of \ntouch with the realities of the workplace.\n  As Justice Ginsburg explained in her dissent in the Ledbetter case:\n\n       [I]nsistence on immediate contest overlooks common \n     characteristics of pay discrimination. . . . Pay disparities \n     often occur, as they did in Ledbetter's case, in small \n     increments; cause to suspect that discrimination is at work \n     develops only over time. . . . [A worker's] initial readiness \n     to give her employer the benefit of the doubt should not \n     preclude her from later challenging the then current and \n     continuing payment of a wage depressed on account of her sex.\n\n  When women work the same jobs as men with the same skill, they should \nbe paid the same amount. If they are not paid the same amount because \nof discrimination, they should be able to seek recourse in Federal \ncourts. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and restore American \nfair pay law.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, soon we will be voting on the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act, S. 181. The House of Representatives has \nalready passed this legislation by a vote of 247 to 171. Passing this \nbill today will send a clear message that our country will not tolerate \nunequal pay for equal work.\n  As astonishing as it is, in the year 2009, women earn, on average, \nonly 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in comparable jobs. What a \ntruly unthinkable, and frankly disgraceful, circumstance--one that we \nmust do everything within our power to change. Today we have the \nopportunity to take a small but very significant step in making sure \nthat Americans have the legal opportunity to challenge pay \ndiscrimination.\n  Lilly Ledbetter was a loyal employee at Goodyear Tire and Rubber \nCompany for 19 years. At first, her salary was in line with that of her \nmale colleagues, but over time she got smaller raises creating a \nsignificant pay gap. Ms. Ledbetter was not aware of this pay \ndiscrimination until she received an anonymous note detailing the \nsalaries of three male coworkers. After filing a complaint with the \nEqual Employment and Opportunity Commission, her case went to trial and \nthe jury awarded her $3.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages \ndue to the extreme pay discrimination she endured.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed this verdict, \narguing that Ms. Ledbetter filed her complaint too late. If you asked \nanyone on the street, they would tell you that this decision goes \nagainst the citizens of this country's sense of right and wrong. How \nwas she to know that this discrimination was happening? Ms. Ledbetter \nwas already facing sexual harassment at Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. \nand told by her boss that he didn't think a woman should be working \nthere. To argue that Ms. Ledbetter should have asked her male \ncounterparts what their salaries were at the moment she suspected \ndiscrimination defies common sense. This topic was off limits, as it is \nin most work places. It is clearly not her fault she didn't discover \nthis inequity sooner.\n  In 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the Eleventh Circuit ruling in \nLedbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. and, as a result, took us a \nstep back in time. It gutted a key part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nthat has protected hardworking Americans from pay discrimination for 45 \nyears by making it extraordinarily difficult for victims of pay \ndiscrimination to sue their employers.\n\n[[Page S769]]\n\n  The bill before us overturns the Court's 5-4 decision and reinstates \nprior law. It ensures that victims of pay discrimination will not be \npenalized if they are unaware of wage disparities. I am happy to say \nthat we will have the opportunity today to protect millions of \nhardworking Americans and reverse the unreasonable and unfair Ledbetter \ndecision. I call on all of my Senate colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis bill, which will send a clear signal that pay discrimination is \nunacceptable and will not be tolerated.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to thank my \nSenate colleagues--particularly the persistent efforts of Senator \nMikulski, but also to commend Senators Kennedy and Specter for their \nwillingness to address a controversial Supreme Court decision head-on. \nI am proud to see the Senate taking up an issue that is so fundamental \nto America--to the way we see ourselves, to the way we are perceived \naround the world, to the core principles by which our country abides. \nEquality. Fairness. Justice.\n  I believe everyone in this body is familiar with the story of Lilly \nLedbetter. She spent 20 years diligently working at the same company, \nat the same facility in suburban Alabama, striving alongside her \ncoworkers, both male and female. Unknown to her at the time, from her \nearliest days at the facility she had become a victim of gender \ndiscrimination. How? Over time, those male colleagues who rose through \nthe ranks at the same rate as Ms. Ledbetter were receiving considerably \nmore compensation.\n  Then, one day in June of 1998, her eyes were opened by an anonymous \nindividual who provided her with documentation finally alerting her to \nthe discrepancy in wages. From there, her legal odyssey began. She \nfiled a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, \nEEOC, in July, filed a discrimination lawsuit 4 months later and found \nherself at what she expected to be the end of her journey, the U.S. \nSupreme Court, 8 years later. But this was not the end of the journey.\n  As Justice Ginsburg indicated in her dissenting opinion, the majority \ndid not sufficiently consider the broad array of case law that would \nhave resulted in a decision in favor of Ms. Ledbetter. Yet we are here \ntoday not to argue the validity of the May 2007 Supreme Court decision. \nRather, we are here to address the root of the problem, a role Congress \nmust fulfill when the law clearly is lacking. In fact, in that same \ndissent, Justice Ginsburg urged Congress to act expeditiously to repair \nthis inequity. Today, we are one step closer to doing just that.\n  The existing statute plainly indicates the discrimination must have \noccurred within 180 days of filing the complaint in order for the \ncomplaint to be considered timely. But as Ms. Ledbetter's case proves, \nthis provision, now codified in title VII of U.S. law, is fundamentally \nflawed. With respect to a situation like that experienced by Ms. \nLedbetter, and thousands of American women every day, the statute is \nnot tailored in such a way to recognize long-term workplace \ndiscrimination. If a woman is terminated solely because of her gender--\nor perhaps passed over for promotions or increased compensation \nirrespective of merit, but instead based solely on the fact she is a \nwoman, she typically would have the ability to meet the 180-day \nrequirement.\n  But the kind of mistreatment we are attempting to rectify with this \nlegislation is both subtle and longstanding, it is almost impossible to \ncomply with the statute as written. Generally, women like Ms. Ledbetter \nenter a company on a lower pay scale than their peers, and starting \nwith such a handicap continues to plague them throughout their careers. \nOver time, that gulf between her compensation and that of her male \ncolleagues only widens. But why should they be penalized in law simply \nbecause they didn't have the information necessary to know they were \nbeing discriminated against? Do we really wish to say that justice \nshould be arbitrarily decided merely by a date and time?\n  Now, opponents of the legislation have indicated the Ledbetter bill \nbefore us today will cost jobs, that it is a radical departure from the \nintent of the law, that it will impose massive costs on employers, and \nencourage a deluge of lawsuits. But nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n  This bipartisan bill would simply restore the law of the land prior \nto the Supreme Court's 2007 decision. Nine courts of appeals followed \nthe approach we endorse in this bill, and the EEOC used the same \nunderpinnings included in the Ledbetter bill under both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations. In fact, the legislation mimics language \nthat Congress employed in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to mitigate a \nSupreme Court decision that all but eliminated employees' opportunity \nto challenge seniority systems in the workplace.\n  Indeed, after 17 years, this language has not resulted in even a \nminimal spike in claims through the kind of broad interpretation we \nwere warned against. That's why the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, CBO, has specifically stated it will not significantly increase \nthe number of pay discrimination claims. What it will do is give \nworkers who have reasonable claims a fair chance to have them heard.\n  In addition, this legislation does nothing to alter current limits on \nthe amount employers owe. Under Senator Mikulski's bill, employers \nwould not have to make up for salary differences that occurred decades \nago. Current law limits back pay awards to 2 years before the worker \nfiled a job discrimination claim under title VII of the Civil Right Act \nof 1964. The bill would do nothing to change this 2-year limit on back \npay.\n  Some view this as a unique circumstance specific to Ms. Ledbetter. I \nwholeheartedly disagree. According to a Government Accountability \nOffice presentation based on the 2000 Census data, 7 of the 10 \nindustries that hire the majority of women in this country experienced \na widening of the wage gap between male and female managers. In 1963, \nwhen Congress passed the Equal Pay Act, a woman working full-time was \npaid 59 cents on average for every dollar paid to male employees, while \nin 2005 women were paid 77 cents for every dollar received by men. Over \nthe last 42 years, despite our best efforts, the wage gap has only \nnarrowed by less than half of a penny per year.\n  In my home State of Maine, the situation is even harsher for women in \nthe workplace. For women in Maine, the concern about equal pay is \nespecially acute. In 2007, on average, women in my State working full-\ntime year-round earned only 76 percent of what men working full-time, \nyear-round earned. This is 2 percentage points below the nationwide \naverage of 78 percent. Over recent years, the gender wage gap has \nplateaued--we are not making progress. The following point is \nparticularly illustrative--the wage gap in Maine persists, like it does \nacross America, at all levels of education. Women in the State with a \nhigh school diploma earned only 62 percent of what men with a high \nschool diploma earned. In fact, as is true nationwide, the average \nwoman in Maine must receive a bachelor's degree before she earns as \nmuch as the average male high school graduate.\n  So, today, we have come here only to ensure that women who have been \ntreated unfairly in the workplace have the opportunity to seek redress. \nIn conclusion, Lilly Ledbetter's journey--indeed, the journey of all \nworking women--continues. Like Ms. Ledbetter, many of us who followed \nthe case all the way to the chambers of the Supreme Court considered it \nthe final step. We were wrong--but now we have the opportunity to right \nthat injustice. I urge my colleagues to support final passage for this \nlegislation, and guarantee that the Senate's support for this \nlegislation is indeed her final step on a decade-long journey.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, legislation that I have cosponsored for \nthe past 2 years. This legislation simply seeks to protect American \nworkers from pay discrimination based on factors such as race, gender, \nreligion, and national origin. I am pleased that the Senate is on the \nverge of finally passing this important bill after we came so close to \npassing it last year. For over 2 years, Lilly Ledbetter, the victim of \ndiscriminatory pay based on gender, has worked tirelessly to move this \nlegislation forward and today's Senate passage of the Ledbetter bill \nmarks an important victory for her and the many advocates\n\n[[Page S770]]\n\naround the country who joined with her.\n  These are challenging economic times for many families in Wisconsin \nand around the country. Too many workers are struggling to hang onto \ntheir jobs, their homes, and provide for their children. We in Congress \nneed to do all we can this year to help create solid family-supporting \njobs, but we also need to make sure that people who already have jobs \ncan support their families. We need to pass legislation like the \nLedbetter bill to help ensure that workers are treated fairly and earn \nwhat they deserve.\n  I know many of my colleagues in the Senate share my disappointment \nand frustration that, despite all the gains women have made since \ngaining the right to vote 100 years ago, they still make 77 cents on \nthe dollar compared to their male counterparts. It is hard to believe \nthat this pay disparity continues to exist in the 21st century. \nUnfortunately, the pay disparity not only exists but is even larger in \nmy State of Wisconsin. According to data gathered by the Institute for \nWomen's Policy Research, IPWR, women's salaries were only approximately \n72 percent of men's salaries in Wisconsin. The wage gap gets even \nlarger when you look at the earnings of minority women throughout \nWisconsin. In 1999, African-American women's salaries were only around \n63 percent of White men's salaries; while Hispanic women's salaries \nwere only 59 percent of White men's salaries according to an analysis \nof Wisconsinites' wages by IWPR.\n  These troubling wage gaps exist throughout the country and, thanks to \nthe flawed Supreme Court decision in Ms. Ledbetter's case, it is now \neven more difficult for hard-working Americans to seek legal redress \nfor this inequity in the workplace.\n  As we heard in testimony before the Judiciary Committee last year, \nLilly Ledbetter's experience ``typifies the uphill battle that American \nworkers face'' in efforts to ``right the wrong of pay discrimination.'' \nAfter she found out that she was being paid less than her male \ncounterparts, she filed a complaint with the EEOC and then brought a \nlawsuit in Federal court in Alabama. The Federal district court ruled \nin her favor, but 2 years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that Ms. \nLedbetter had filed her lawsuit too long after her employer originally \ndecided to give her unequal pay. Under title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, an individual must file a complaint of wage discrimination \nwithin 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice. Before the \nLedbetter decision, the courts had held that each time an employee \nreceived a new paycheck, the 180-day clock was restarted because every \npaycheck was considered a new unlawful practice.\n  The Supreme Court changed this longstanding rule. It held that an \nemployee must file a complaint within 180 days from when the original \npay decision was made. Ms. Ledbetter found out about the decision to \npay her less than her male colleagues well after 180 days from when the \ncompany had made the decision. Under the Supreme Court's decision, it \nwas just too late for Ms. Ledbetter to get back what she had worked \nfor. It did not matter that she only discovered that she was being paid \nless than her male counterparts many years after the inequality in pay \nhad begun. And it did not matter that there was no way for her to find \nout she was being paid less until someone told her that was the case.\n  In Ms. Ledbetter's case, to put it simply, the Supreme Court got it \nwrong. It ignored the position of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission and the decisions of the vast majority of lower courts that \nthe issuance of each new paycheck constitutes a new act of \ndiscrimination. It ignored the fact that Congress had not sought to \nchange this longstanding interpretation of the law.\n  The Court's decision also ignores realities of the American \nworkplace. Perhaps we lose sight of this in Congress, since our own \nsalaries are a matter of public record, but the average American has no \nway of knowing the salary of his or her peers. As Ms. Ledbetter noted, \nthere are many places across the country where even asking your \ncoworkers about their salary would be grounds for dismissal.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which has been pending in the \nSenate since shortly after the Supreme Court's erroneous decision, \nreestablishes a reasonable timeframe for filing pay discrimination \nclaims. It returns the law to where it was before the Court's decision, \nwith the time limit for filing pay discrimination claims beginning when \na new paycheck is received, rather than when an employer first decides \nto discriminate. Under this legislation, as long as workers file their \nclaims within 180 days of a discriminatory paycheck, their complaints \nwill be considered.\n  This bill also maintains the current limits on the amount employers \nowe once they have been found to have committed a discriminatory act. \nCurrent law limits back pay awards to 2 years before the worker filed a \njob discrimination claim. This bill retains this 2-year limit, and \ntherefore does not make employers pay for salary inequalities that \noccurred many years ago. Workers thus have no reason to delay filing a \nclaim. Doing so would only make proving their cases harder, especially \nbecause the burden of proof is on the employee, not the employer.\n  Opponents say that this bill will burden employers by requiring them \nto defend themselves in costly litigation. This is simply not the case. \nMost employers want to do right by their employees and most employers \npay their employees fair and equal wages. This legislation is targeted \nat those employers who underpay and discriminate against their workers, \nhoping that employees, like Ms. Ledbetter, won't find out in time. The \nCongressional Budget Office has also reported that restoring the law to \nwhere it was before the Ledbetter decision will not significantly \naffect the number of filings made with the EEOC, nor will it \nsignificantly increase the costs to the Commission or to the Federal \ncourts.\n  The impact of pay discrimination continues throughout a person's \nlife, lowering not only wages, but also Social Security and other wage-\nbased retirement benefits. This places a heavy burden on spouses and \nchildren who rely on these wages and benefits for life's basic \nnecessities like housing, education, healthcare, and food. This \ndiscrimination can add up to thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of \ndollars in lost income and retirement benefits. In these challenging \neconomic times, Congress must do all it can to ensure that the wages \nand retirement savings of American men and women are protected and not \nsubject to attack by flawed court decisions or legislative inaction.\n  On matters of pay discrimination, this bill simply returns the law to \nwhere it was before the Supreme Court issued its misguided decision in \n2007. We need to do more than just correct past mistakes, however we \nalso need to examine the challenges facing working Americans and \naddress those challenges in a constructive and thoughtful way. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to strengthen and improve laws \nthat help working families, including creating jobs, expanding access \nto health care, and improving educational opportunities for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate was finally able to \nprevent a filibuster of this important legislation and that we are now \non the verge of passing this bill. I am a proud cosponsor of the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act, and I was disappointed when it failed in the \nSenate by just four votes last year. This is a significant victory for \nworking families in Wisconsin and around the country. Of course, pay \ndiscrimination is not the only issue that women, minorities, people \nwith disabilities, and other protected groups of workers confront, and \nwe need to do more to strengthen and improve other employment \nconditions, like worker safety, as well. As this new Congress gets \nunderway, I stand ready to work with my colleagues in the Senate to \nadvance legislation that protects employment rights and strengthens job \nopportunities for all Americans.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let me first say, I adamantly oppose and \nabhor discrimination of any kind, whether it is based on gender, age, \nreligion, disability or race. I am a father to two daughters. I have \nfive granddaughters and two great-granddaughters. I want all of my \ngranddaughters to know that their goals and achievements will only be \nlimited by their own ambition rather than a despicable act of gender \ndiscrimination. There is no place for discrimination in\n\n[[Page S771]]\n\nour country, and all of my colleagues share this belief. No side in \nthis debate is in favor of gender discrimination.\n  The matter before the Senate is the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act seeks to overturn a Supreme Court decision \nthat the sponsors contend has removed statutory protections against \ndiscrimination, in this case, pay discrimination. The Court's decision \nin Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire held that a plaintiff alleging pay \ndiscrimination under title VII must file a claim within the statutory \nfiling period of the alleged discrimination.\n  It is unfair to individuals who were unknowingly discriminated \nagainst to have a strict statute of limitations that prevent them from \nbringing suit once they discover the discrimination. I could not agree \nmore. An individual should not be precluded from seeking justice simply \nbecause they were not aware of the discrimination. This is the \nsituation that the proponents of the Ledbetter bill seek to address.\n  However, we must also ensure that the remedy to this injustice does \nnot lead to allegations of discrimination that are years and, perhaps, \ndecades old. A reasonable statute of limitations ensures that the \ndiscrimination is identified and reported and the employee receives a \ntimely resolution if there is discrimination. Statutes of limitation \nhave been part of our legal history for hundreds of years and further \nthe interest of justice by ensuring claims are brought in a timely \nmanner while evidence is still available. These limitations have long \nbeen recognized by courts as a way to balance the rights of plaintiffs \nagainst the rights of defendants. In the case of employment \ndiscrimination suits, the statute of limitations provides employers \nprotection from having to defend allegations where records no longer \nexist or employees have moved on or passed away.\n  Statutes of limitations have always stood in some tension, and it is \nour job as the elected representatives of plaintiffs and defendants \nacross this country to strike the necessary balance. We need to ensure \nthat law does not sanction hidden discrimination nor effectively \neliminate the statute of limitations.\n  The supporters of this bill have offered their version of a solution \nto this problem. The underlying bill would essentially reset the clock \non the statute of limitations every time a new paycheck was received by \nan individual who was discriminated against in the past. They believe \nthis is necessary regardless of how long in the past the claim of \ndiscrimination occurred. It would effectively eliminate the statute of \nlimitations for discrimination claims.\n  The underlying bill also goes far beyond the stated objective of \nproviding justice to those who have been subject to concealed \ndiscrimination. Instead, it could have the exact opposite effect of \nhindering efforts to quickly resolve discrimination claims. By pushing \nclaims off indefinitely into the future, the bill creates a separation \nbetween the discriminatory act and the filing of a claim making cases \nharder to prove and more costly to defend. Simply put, the bill offered \nby Senator Mikulski greatly expands the existing statute further than \nit was before the Supreme Court decided the Ledbetter case.\n  While I believe the Mikulski bill goes too far, I do believe Congress \nshould act to ensure discrimination claims are not simply ignored. As I \nsaid before, we need to find the right balance. I believe that balance \nis found with the alternative bill offered by my colleague, Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison. Her amendment essentially codifies a discretionary \napproach that courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \nhave applied in these cases for years.\n  The fact is, the Supreme Court and the EEOC have long recognized that \nstatutes of limitation or charge-filing periods can be extended or \n``tolled'' in circumstances where the discrimination is hidden or \nconcealed. Simply put, defendants shouldn't be able to run out the \nclock just because they hide the discrimination or it is unknown to the \nvictim.\n  The Hutchison alternative simply codifies this doctrine of equitable \ntolling. The Hutchison amendment provides that the clock on the charge-\nfiling deadline does not start running until an employee discovers the \ndiscrimination or should have discovered the discrimination. This \nthoughtful, balanced approach protects the rights of the employee if \nthe discrimination was concealed, but also ensures that the claim can \nbe resolved timely. The Hutchison amendment codifies the flexibility of \nthe claim-filing deadline when the discrimination is concealed, rather \nthan effectively eliminating the deadline outright. It is the type of \nbalanced, measured approach we as legislators are elected to find.\n  While it is my sincere hope that in this day and age no employer \ntreats individuals differently based on gender, I am a cosponsor and \nstrongly support the Hutchison amendment and believe it is the best \npossible way to ensure that the rights of all individuals are protected \nfrom discrimination.\n  Unfortunately, this balanced amendment was rejected by the majority, \nas were a number of other thoughtful, balanced, and needed amendments \noffered by colleagues on my side of the aisle. Because those efforts to \nimprove the bill and minimize unintended consequences were rejected, I \nmust vote against the bill. I regret that the Senate was unable to work \nin a more bipartisan manner to address the serious issue of gender \ndiscrimination.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, lawyers have a saying: ``Bad facts make \nbad law.'' In my opinion, bad facts make even worse legislation. The \nproposal before the Senate, S. 181, assumes a number of erroneous facts \ndirectly related to the case of Ms. Lilly Ledbetter and how current law \ntreats those wishing to file discrimination claims. I believe \nimprovements are in order to the current law, but S. 181 goes well \nbeyond what is reasonable and equitable.\n  Ms. Ledbetter was not prevented from asserting claims because she \nwasn't aware of her employer's alleged discrimination. She was \nprevented from asserting her claims because, as Ms. Ledbetter testified \nunder oath in the case, she knew about the alleged discrimination for \nnearly 6 years before bringing her lawsuit.\n  While it is essential that employees be given an adequate period of \ntime to press a discrimination claim, employers must also be protected \nfrom endless litigation.\n  Statutes of limitation serve an important function in our judicial \nsystem. By effectively eliminating the statute of limitation in \nemployment discrimination cases, S. 181 would make it very difficult \nfor an employer to mount a credible defense to a discrimination claim. \nBoth small business owners and employees deserve a fair process. \nAlthough I support fair pay for equal work and oppose workplace \ndiscrimination of any kind, I oppose S. 181 and I am hopeful a balance \ncan be reached before it becomes law.\n  (At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, equal pay for equal work is a \nfundamental civil right. This principle is at the heart of our Nation's \ncommitment to fairness. When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act \nin 1963, he reminded us that protection against pay discrimination is \n``basic to democracy.'' Those words ring even truer today. When we \ninaugurated Barack Obama as our new President this week, our country \nstrongly reaffirmed its commitment to a fairer, more just American \nsociety.\n  My good friend Senator Mikulski has taken an important step toward \nachieving this fairer, more just society by leading the debate in the \nSenate on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and I thank her for her \ninspired leadership. She has truly been a passionate advocate for women \nand others who have suffered the injustice of discrimination. I also \ncommend Senator Harkin for the work he has done on this bill and on the \nFair Pay Act. Senator Clinton has also been a champion for pay equity, \nand we pledge to continue her good work.\n  We must pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It will give American \nworkers who are victims of pay discrimination based on race, age, \ngender, national origin, religion, or disability a fair chance to \nenforce their rights.\n  As a nation, we have often acted in recent years to expand and \nstrengthen our civil rights laws in order to end discrimination, and we \nhave always done so with bipartisan support. The\n\n[[Page S772]]\n\nresult has been great progress towards increasing equal opportunity and \nequal justice for all our people, and we will never abandon this basic \ngoal.\n  Despite our past efforts to end pay discrimination, too many of our \ncitizens still put in a fair day's work, but go home with less than a \nfair day's pay. Women, for example, bring home only 78 cents for each \ndollar earned by men. African American workers make only 80 percent of \nwhat White workers make and Latino workers make only 68 percent. Many \nqualified older workers and workers with disabilities also bear the \nburden of an unlawful pay gap. They are paid less than their coworkers \nfor reasons that have nothing to do with their performance on the job.\n  Confronting pay discrimination is about addressing the real \nchallenges faced by real Americans to make ends meet. These challenges \nhave been mounting in recent months, as millions of American workers \nstruggle even harder each day to provide for their families in this \ntroubled economy.\n  Pay discrimination makes their struggle even harder. In these dire \neconomic times, workers and their families can't afford to lose more \neconomic ground--but that is just what is happening to thousands of \nAmericans who still face pay discrimination.\n  With the economy in a severe recession, we cannot afford to wait to \nfix this problem. With women and minorities still making less than \nWhite men for the same work, we can't be complacent. With thousands of \nworkers facing discrimination because of their race, their sex, their \nnational origin, their age, their religion, and their disability every \nyear, we must continue the battle to end this national disgrace.\n  Lilly Ledbetter's own case demonstrates the financial toll that pay \ndiscrimination can take. Lilly made 20 percent less than her lowest \npaid, least experienced male colleague and almost 40 percent less than \nher highest paid male colleague. For Lilly and other victims like her, \nthe cost of pay discrimination over time is large. A recent study \nestimates that women lose an average of $434,000 over the course of \ntheir career because of the pay gap. Not only that, but their lower \nwages also mean their pension benefits and their Social Security \nbenefits are lower as well. Unless we act, thousands of American \nworkers will continue to face the same injustice that Lilly Ledbetter \nhas endured.\n  It is our common responsibility to attack this problem with every \ntool at our disposal. Unfortunately, the challenge has been made more \ndifficult because of the Supreme Court's decision last May that pulled \nthe rug out from under victims of pay discrimination by making it \nharder for them to stand up for their rights.\n  In Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, the Supreme Court \nreversed decades of established law by reinterpreting existing law on \nequal pay and ruling that workers must file claims of pay \ndiscrimination within 180 days after an employer first acts to \ndiscriminate. Never mind that many workers, such as Ms. Ledbetter, do \nnot know at first that they are being discriminated against. Never mind \nthat workers often have no way to learn of the discrimination against \nthem or gather evidence to support their suspicions because employers \nkeep salary information confidential. Never mind that the \ndiscrimination continues each and every time an employee receives an \nunfair paycheck.\n  The Ledbetter decision means that many workers across our country \nwill be forced to live without any reasonable way to hold employers \naccountable when they violate the law. Employers will have free rein to \ncontinue their illegal activity, and the workers who are unfairly \ndiscriminated against will have no remedy. This result defies both \njustice and common sense.\n  The American people have made clear that they are yearning for a \ngovernment that promotes, not defies, justice and common sense. We can \nanswer this call for change by quickly passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Act and restoring a clear and reasonable rule addressing how pay \ndiscrimination actually occurs in the workplace. The 180-day time \nperiod for filing a pay discrimination claim begins again on each date \nwhen a worker receives a discriminatory paycheck.\n  By doing so, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act ensures that employers \ncan actually be held accountable when they break the law. Under this \nbill, workers can challenge ongoing discrimination as long as it \ncontinues. As long as the injustice and the damage of the \ndiscrimination continue, the right to challenge it should continue too.\n  The bill before us restores the rules that employers and workers had \nlived with for decades, until the Supreme Court upended the law in the \nLedbetter case. We know these rules are fair and workable. They were \nthe law in most of the land and had the support of the EEOC under both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations until the Ledbetter decision. \nThere won't be any surprises after this bill passes. As the \nCongressional Budget Office has stated, the bill will not increase \nlitigation costs.\n  Congress must stand with American workers to reverse the Supreme \nCourt's Ledbetter decision. Civil rights groups, labor unions, \ndisability advocates, and religious groups from across the country \nsupport this legislation. Many responsible business owners also support \nit, especially, the members of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce. \nThe American people want us to act.\n  In her stirring dissent in the Ledbetter case, Justice Ruth Bader \nGinsburg wrote that ``Once again, the ball is in Congress's court.'' \nNearly 2 years after she wrote those words, the ball is still in \nCongress's court. The House passed this important legislation last \nyear, but the Senate dropped the ball. Now we have a new Congress and a \nnew opportunity to master the challenge that Justice Ginsburg put to \nus, and we have a new President who is strongly committed to equal pay \nand to ending pay discrimination. I ask my colleagues to enable the \nmarch of progress on civil rights to continue. Together, let us stand \nwith working people. Let us pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 34\n\n  Mr. VITTER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To preserve open competition and Federal Government \n     neutrality towards the labor relations of Federal Government \n   contractors on Federal and federally funded construction projects)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. GOVERNMENT NEUTRALITY IN CONTRACTING.\n\n       (a) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this section to--\n       (1) promote and ensure open competition on Federal and \n     federally funded or assisted construction projects;\n       (2) maintain Federal Government neutrality towards the \n     labor relations of Federal Government contractors on Federal \n     and federally funded or assisted construction projects;\n       (3) reduce construction costs to the Federal Government and \n     to the taxpayers;\n       (4) expand job opportunities, especially for small and \n     disadvantaged businesses; and\n       (5) prevent discrimination against Federal Government \n     contractors or their employees based upon labor affiliation \n     or the lack thereof, thereby promoting the economical, \n     nondiscriminatory, and efficient administration and \n     completion of Federal and federally funded or assisted \n     construction projects.\n       (b) Preservation of Open Competition and Federal Government \n     Neutrality.--\n       (1) Prohibition.--\n       (A) General rule.--The head of each executive agency that \n     awards any construction contract after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, or that obligates funds pursuant to such a \n     contract, shall ensure that the agency, and any construction \n     manager acting on behalf of the Federal Government with \n     respect to such contract, in its bid specifications, project \n     agreements, or other controlling documents does not--\n       (i) require or prohibit a bidder, offeror, contractor, or \n     subcontractor from entering into, or adhering to, agreements \n     with 1 or more labor organization, with respect to that \n     construction project or another related construction project; \n     or\n       (ii) otherwise discriminate against a bidder, offeror, \n     contractor, or subcontractor because such bidder, offeror, \n     contractor, or subcontractor--\n\n       (I) became a signatory, or otherwise adhered to, an \n     agreement with 1 or more labor\n\n[[Page S773]]\n\n     organization with respect to that construction project or \n     another related construction project;

Mr. President, this is my amendment, No. 34 the \nGovernment neutrality in contracting amendment. It is very simple; it \nis very straight forward. It would provide true equal opportunity and \nopen competition in national contracting.\n  Congress has a duty to ensure that infrastructure projects paid for \nby taxpayers are free from favoritism, and these interests would not be \nserved if Congress were to require union-only Project Labor Agreements \nor PLAs for construction projects in the 111th Congress.\n  According to a January 2008 report issued by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, only 13.9 percent of America's private construction work \nforce belongs to a labor union. So this means that union-only PLAs \ndiscriminate against well over 8 out of 10 construction workers in \nAmerica who would otherwise be able to work on those projects.\n  Given the debate on the current legislation, I believe this amendment \nis particularly important for the following reasons: Minorities are \nparticularly negatively impacted by union-only PLAs. This \ndiscrimination is harmful to women and minority-owned construction \nbusinesses whose workers have traditionally been underrepresented in \nunions, mainly due to artificial and societal barriers to union \napprenticeship and training programs.\n  Requirements under a PLA can be so burdensome that many women and \nminority-owned businesses are deterred from even bidding on \nconstruction projects. A PLA could force these employers to have to \nabandon their own employees in favor of union workers, to pay into \nunion and pension health plans, even if they already have their own \nplans.\n  Not being able to bid on a public project because of a PLA is very \ndetrimental to small disadvantaged companies who rely on these \ncontracts for much of their growth.\n  Again, this amendment would provide equal opportunity and open \ncompetition in Federal contracting. It would codify the status quo \nright now, which is to bar Federal agencies from requiring union-only \nPLAs on Federal construction projects. This sort of equal opportunity \nnondiscrimination is important and certainly is consistent with the \nspirit of this underlying bill.\n  Let me also mention in closing that this amendment has the full \nsupport of many national groups such as Associated Builders and \nContractors, The Associated General Contractors of America, the \nNational Association of Minority Contractors, Independent Electrical \nContractors, the National Association of Disadvantaged Businesses, the \nNational Black Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, Women Construction Owners and Executives, and \nothers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter making \nclear that support from a broad-based group of organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 21, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations call on you to \n     support an amendment offered today by Senator David Vitter \n     (S.A. 34) to the ``Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009'' (S. 181) \n     that eliminates discrimination and ensures fairness in \n     federal procurement by forbidding union-only project labor \n     agreements (PLAs) on federal and federally funded \n     construction projects. In addition, this amendment protects \n     taxpayers and ensures fair and open competition on contracts \n     for all federal infrastructure projects. We urge you to \n     support the Vitter Amendment to the ``Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \n     of 2009'' (S.181) when it comes up for a vote in the U.S. \n     Senate.\n       Equal opportunity and open competition in federal \n     contracting are critical issues to consider as the federal \n     government explores various solutions, including significant \n     infrastructure spending, to stimulate our ailing economy. \n     Congress must ensure federal and federally funded \n     infrastructure projects paid for by taxpayers are \n     administered in a manner that is free from favoritism and \n     discrimination while efficiently spending federal tax \n     dollars. These interests would not be served if Congress were \n     to require union-only requirements, commonly known as union-\n     only PLAs, on federal construction projects. The Vitter \n     Amendment would protect taxpayers from costly and \n     discriminatory union-only PLA requirements on federal \n     construction contracts.\n       A union-only PLA is a contract that requires a construction \n     project to be awarded to contractors and subcontractors that \n     agree to: recognize unions as the representatives of their \n     employees on that jobsite; use the union hiring hall to \n     obtain workers; pay union wages and benefits; obtain \n     apprentices\n\n[[Page S774]]\n\n     through union apprenticeship programs; and obey the union's \n     restrictive work rules, job classifications and arbitration \n     procedures.\n       Construction contracts subject to union-only PLAs almost \n     always are awarded exclusively to unionized contractors and \n     their all-union workforces. According to the most recent data \n     from the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics, only 13.9 percent of America's construction \n     workforce belongs to a union. This means union-only PLAs \n     would discriminate against almost nine out of 10 construction \n     workers who would otherwise work on construction projects if \n     not for a union-only PLA.\n       This discrimination is particularly harmful to women and \n     minority-owned construction businesses whose workers \n     traditionally have been under-represented in unions, mainly \n     due to artificial and societal barriers in union membership \n     and union apprenticeship and training programs.\n       In closing, we strongly urge you to eliminate \n     discrimination and guarantee equal opportunity and open \n     competition in federal construction procurement by supporting \n     the Vitter Amendment (S.A. 34) to the ``Ledbetter Fair Pay \n     Act of 2009' (S. 181).\n           Sincerely,\n       Associated Builders and Contractors; Independent Electrical \n     Contractors; National Association of Minority Contractors--\n     Northeast Region; National Association of Small Disadvantaged \n     Businesses; National Black Chamber of Commerce; National \n     Federation of Independent Business; Women Construction Owners \n     and Executives, USA.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to be clear that I object to the \nVitter amendment. I do it on both policy and procedural grounds.\n  First, on procedure, this amendment has nothing to do with the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act focuses on \nwage discrimination. The Vitter amendment focuses on project labor \nagreements by Federal agencies. It deals with contracting. It deals \nwith construction work. It does not deal with wages in that category.\n  The great thing about today is that we have not become locked in a \ndebate on process. I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nfor the amendments they offered. They were focused. They were clear. It \nwas primarily about wage discrimination.\n  When we look at the Vitter amendment, it would prohibit Federal \ndollars from being used for something called project labor agreements. \nThese agreements, which contractors and labor organizations establish \nto set the terms of employment for large construction projects, benefit \nboth the Government and workers. History has shown they produce high-\nquality jobs, high-quality work that is completed efficiently and \neffectively, on time, and meeting the bottom line of the bid.\n  When we talk about project labor agreements, it is not true that PLAs \nrequire union-only labor. Project labor agreements have been used for \nyears to help construction companies run effectively and efficiently. \nState and local governments often use these agreements because they \nknow they are going to get a good job at the price that has been bid. \nThese agreements help keep costs predictable and under control. That is \ncritical for large Federal projects.\n  It is also a preventive strategy. Often, they prevent labor disputes \nand assure a steady supply of high-quality workers.\n  Project labor agreements benefit workers and communities. Now more \nthan ever, we need to be creating high-quality jobs. Project labor \nagreements ensure that wages and benefits and working conditions are \nsimply fair. Instead of embracing these benefits, the Vitter amendment \nwould prohibit the use of it.\n  Then there is another issue--executive authority. This would take \naway longstanding executive authority. It would tie the hands of a \nPresident. I certainly don't want to tie the hands of our new \nPresident, but I don't want to tie the hands of any President under the \nExecutive authority to do PLAs. Our Nation's Executive has always had \nthe authority over Federal contracting. There is no reason to shift the \nbalance of power. That could result in all kinds of lawsuits, et \ncetera.\n  Senator Vitter says that project labor agreements restrict \ncompetition, but that is not true. Under President Clinton, both union \nand nonunion contractors were able to win bids. Nonunion workers were \nnot excluded. All construction workers could work on projects governed \nby project labor agreements. That is what I am going to repeat: Project \nlabor agreements do not require union-only labor. That is a myth. It \nhas no basis in reality. It has no basis in statute.\n  I know the time is growing late. I also thank the Senator from \nLouisiana for agreeing to a time agreement. I think I have made the \nessence of our argument. I will reserve the remainder of my time for a \nwrap-up statement and some individuals I would like to acknowledge, \nsome of the people who have worked so hard on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has just under 6\\1/\n2\\ minutes. The Senator from Maryland has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, let me again underscore that it has been \nclearly demonstrated that project labor agreements, union-only project \nlabor agreements, do hurt women and minorities and also hurt women- and \nminority-owned businesses. They are often shut out or disadvantaged \nthrough those agreements because of historical factors. That is one \nreason, among many, why all of those organizations I cited, including \norganizations representing minority- and women-owned businesses, \nstrongly support my stand-alone bill and strongly support my amendment.\n  In addition, the distinguished Senator from Maryland talked about \ncost. PLAs do impact cost. They push up cost. If they make cost \nreliable, they only make them reliably high. A good example is the $2.4 \nbillion project right here to replace the Wilson Bridge between \nsuburban Maryland and Virginia. When a union-only PLA requirement was \npushed by former Maryland Governor Glendening, that threw a wrench into \nthe project and drove costs up 78 percent. After that, President Bush \nissued an Executive order to do away with those PLAs, and phase 1 of \nthe bridge project was rebid. Multiple bids were received, and the \nwinning bids came in significantly below engineering estimates. Today, \nwith that rule against the PLA requirement, the project is almost \ncomplete and substantially under budget. I have example after example \nsuch as that, where union-only PLAs do jack up the cost to the \ntaxpayer.\n  In addition, since we are talking about discrimination issues, PLAs \ndo cut out and harm and put at a disadvantage many women and \nminorities, certainly including women- and minority-owned businesses.\n  With that, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks \nbe extended by 1 minute for the purpose of acknowledgment and thanking \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank someone who is not with us \ntonight for his steadfast work on this bill, our beloved Senator \nKennedy. We can't wait to have him back. I thank the distinguished \nranking member, Senator Enzi, for his wonderful cooperation in enabling \nus to move this bill and to proceed with civility and focus and, I \nmight add, timeliness. I thank all of my colleagues, Judiciary \nCommittee as well as HELP Committee members. I thank the Kennedy staff \nwho worked with me on doing this--Sharon Block, Portia Wu, and \nCharlotte Burrows--and my own staff: Ben Gruenbaum and Priya Ghosh \nAhola.\n  I want to, then, proceed to the first bill the Senate will actually \nvote on since the inauguration of our new President. I think this \ndebate shows we can change the tone. Let's keep that up.\n  I move to table the Vitter amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 34. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Supreme Court in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \n     Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007), significantly impairs \n     statutory protections against discrimination in compensation \n     that Congress established and that have been bedrock \n     principles of American law for decades. The Ledbetter \n     decision undermines those statutory protections by unduly \n     restricting the time period in which victims of \n     discrimination can challenge and recover for discriminatory \n     compensation decisions or other practices, contrary to the \n     intent of Congress.\n       (2) The limitation imposed by the Court on the filing of \n     discriminatory compensation claims ignores the reality of \n     wage discrimination and is at odds with the robust \n     application of the civil rights laws that Congress intended.\n       (3) With regard to any charge of discrimination under any \n     law, nothing in this Act is intended to preclude or limit an \n     aggrieved person's right to introduce evidence of an unlawful \n     employment practice that has occurred outside the time for \n     filing a charge of discrimination.\n       (4) Nothing in this Act is intended to change current law \n     treatment of when pension distributions are considered paid.\n\n     SEC. 3. DISCRIMINATION IN COMPENSATION BECAUSE OF RACE, \n                   COLOR, RELIGION, SEX, OR NATIONAL ORIGIN.\n\n       Section 706(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \n     2000e-5(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3)(A) For purposes of this section, an unlawful \n     employment practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in \n     compensation in violation of this title, when a \n     discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is \n     adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a \n     discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or \n     when an individual is affected by application of a \n     discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, \n     including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is \n     paid, resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or \n     other practice.\n       ``(B) In addition to any relief authorized by section 1977A \n     of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981a), liability may \n     accrue and an aggrieved person may obtain relief as provided \n     in subsection (g)(1), including recovery of back pay for up \n     to two years preceding the filing of the charge, where the \n     unlawful employment practices that have occurred during the \n     charge filing period are similar or related to unlawful \n     employment practices with regard to discrimination in \n     compensation that occurred outside the time for filing a \n     charge.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, today is a great day in the Senate. We \nhave now overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill to correct an \ninjustice that has been prevailing among people--women, minorities, and \npeople with disabilities--in the area of wage discrimination.\n  What is so great about today is not only our overwhelming legislative \nvictory, but we showed, No. 1, that we can change the tone. I thank \nLeader Reid for the leadership he provided in creating the legislative \nframework where we can move ahead with open debate.\n  Notice that we did this bill in a well-measured, well-modulated, \nwell-paced way. There was no need for cloture motions. There was no \nneed for parliamentary quagmires. What it showed, though, is there is a \nneed for civility and cooperation. We, as Americans, have to know, \ngiven this economic situation, that we are all in it together. When we \nwork together, we now know each and every one of us makes a difference. \nBut when we truly work together, we can make change.\n  Today we changed the law, we changed direction, we change history, \nand I thank all my colleagues and all the staff who have made this \npossible.\n  I also wish to say a special thanks to Senator Ted Kennedy. I hope he \nis watching tonight because, Ted, we miss you. We know you are not on \nthe floor; you are with us in spirit. There is more to be done. We \ncannot wait for you to be back. Let's go and get the job done.\n  America is counting on us to do the kinds of things we have done \ntoday and act the way we did, the way we got the business done.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, while I was necessarily absent for \nrollcall vote No. 7 on amendment No. 25, had I been present I would \nhave voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, sometime this week letters will be \nmailed from the U.S. Army Human Resources Command in St. Louis, MO, to \n25 elderly Alaskans. Those letters will tell these 25 elderly Alaskans \nthat the Army has changed its mind--it has changed its mind--about \nwhether their service in the Alaska Territorial Guard during World War \nII counts toward military retirement. The effect of this abrupt \nreversal in position is to reduce the monthly retirement payments to \neach of these 25 elderly Alaskans. These retirement payments will be \nreduced by an average of $386 a month. Six will lose more than $500 a \nmonth in retirement pay. These reductions will take effect on February \n1.\n  So in less than 10 days, these individuals who have been receiving \nthese payments--these elderly Alaskans who served us during World War \nII--will be receiving a letter, maybe before their benefits are cut \noff, but they will be receiving a letter saying: Sorry, your service \ndoesn't count toward military retirement.\n  Mr. President, I state again: None of these 25 elderly Alaskans knows \nthis is coming. It will come as a complete surprise to them, possibly, \nwhen they receive that letter. Whether they are tuning in to C-SPAN and \nhear my comments tonight, we don't know.\n  It is going to take a while for these letters coming out of St. \nLouis, MO, to reach their destinations because these letters are being \nsent to some of the remotest parts of our State, of rural Alaska. Four \nof these letters are destined for the village of Noatak. This is an \nInupiat Eskimo village of 489 people in northwest Alaska. I would \nsuggest, Mr. President, that outside of you and I, there is probably \nnobody in Washington, DC, who could identify Noatak on a map. Four of \nthese letters are destined for the village of Kwigillingok. We call it \nKwig because it is so difficult to pronounce. This is a Yupik Eskimo \ncommunity of 361 people.\n  All told, these letters are being sent to elders in 15 Alaska Native \ncommunities in interior and western Alaska. The poster board that I \nhave behind me indicates some of the elderly gentlemen who may be \nreceiving these letters in the next several weeks.\n  This decision is tragic. It is tragic because it affects veterans who \ndefended Alaska and who defended the United States from the Japanese \nduring World War II. It is a tragedy because these people were led to \nbelieve they would be compensated for their service to our Nation. It \nis a tragedy because most of the people I am talking about, most of \nthese gentlemen, are Eskimos--among the first people of the United \nStates, members of a class of people to whom the United States \nGovernment has broken its promises time and time again. It is a tragedy \nbecause they were misled into believing their retirement pay was \nincreasing. It is a further tragedy because this bad news is going to \nbe communicated in a letter signed by a branch chief in the Army Human \nResources Command. These people deserve an apology from the Secretary \nof Defense. They do not need to be receiving this news about this error \nfrom a branch chief in the Army Human Resources Command.\n  It is also a tragedy because some of these people in the Department \nof Defense chose to implement this decision in the dead of an Alaska \nwinter, when we know that our Native elders in rural Alaska are most \nvulnerable. Right now, in the village of Kwig and in Noatak and in the \nother communities, it is dark, it is cold, and resources are scarce. \nThe increase in retirement pay, which was implemented just this last \nJune, was very welcome news to those who were receiving it. It came at \na time when the cost of fuel was rising to levels in our rural \ncommunities that people simply could not pay.\n  If you will recall, back home in June and July, in the cities, we \nwere paying $4.50, $5 a gallon for our fuel. But out in the villages \nthey were paying $7, $8 a gallon, and in some areas even higher than \nthat. Throughout the State, but particularly in rural Alaska last \nsummer, folks were anxious about whether they were going to be able to \nafford to heat their homes this winter.\n  Last week, in the Indian Affairs Committee, the Presiding Officer had \nan opportunity to join us, and I was able to put on the record the \nplight of some of the Native people in the community of Emmonak who \nhave literally had to choose between buying stove oil to heat their \nhomes or whether they should buy food for their families.\n  I guess some of the good news we have learned is that none of these \nletters informing these elders that they will see a reduction in \nbenefits is going to the village of Emmonak, but I would suspect many \nof the villages to which these letters are going are no better off. You \njust have to ask the question: How can our government be so \ninsensitive--taking money, taking retirement benefits out of the \npockets of our elders, of our seniors, at a time of the year when they \nare absolutely the most vulnerable?\n  I hope I have gained the attention of some, and with the indulgence \nof my colleagues, I would like to fill in a little bit of the \nbackground. I will not be\n\n[[Page S777]]\n\ntalking too long--I know one of our Senators is waiting--but it is an \ninteresting story, and I think he will appreciate it.\n  The Alaska Territorial Guard was created in June of 1942 in response \nto increasing Japanese activity and attacks on and around Alaska. At \nthe time, the U.S. Army was reassigning our Alaska National Guard \nsoldiers away from the State, and so there were no ground troops left \nto protect Alaska. So Earnest Gruening, who was the territorial \ngovernor at the time, called for volunteers to defend our great land up \nthere in the north. Some 6,389 Alaskans answered the call. These \nvolunteers came to be known as the Eskimo Scouts, but they were \nrepresentative of all of Alaska. They were Inupiat Eskimos, Yupik \nEskimos, Aleut people, Athabascan and Tlingit Indians, and there were \nCaucasians.\n  With no pay and very little equipment, these volunteers--these Eskimo \nScouts--patrolled 5,400 miles of coastline to fend off a possible \nJapanese invasion. They shot down Japanese air balloons carrying bombs \nand eavesdropping radios. They rescued downed airmen, they transported \nequipment and supplies, they constructed airstrips and support \nfacilities, they manned the field hospital outpost, and they engaged \nthe enemy in combat.\n  You see the picture behind me of the Eskimo Scout in his snowshoes \nstanding guard, standing ready. These men answered the call of our \ncountry and they defended our homeland. The Territorial Guard stood as \nthe first line of defense for the terrain around the Lend-Lease area, \nthe route from America to Russia, and it was this vital lifeline that \nallowed the United States to supply our Russian ally with essential \nmilitary aircraft and proved essentially crucial to Russia's defense \nagainst Hitler's Germany.\n\n  In March of 1947, the Eskimo Scouts were disbanded, but many of them \nwent on to continue to serve our Nation in the Army and the Alaska \nNational Guard. For more than half a century after the Territorial \nGuard was disbanded, these brave and truly dedicated volunteers \nreceived not one ounce of recognition from our Federal Government for \nthe service they had performed. It wasn't until the year 2000 that \nSenator Stevens succeeded in adding language to the Defense \nappropriations bill to recognize the Territorial Guard, and that \nlegislation required the Secretary of Defense to treat the Alaska \nTerritorial Guard just like any other soldiers and to require them to \nissue discharge certificates to those who remain alive.\n  I was privileged to be at a couple of ceremonies where some of these \nelders received their official discharge certificates, and it was \nincredibly moving to be with them when, after decades, their Government \nfinally recognized their service. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs was \nalso directed to treat these people as any other veteran of the Armed \nForces of the United States.\n  I do understand and we are told that the Department of Defense was \nslow to implement the mandate of this legislation. I can tell you from \nmy own experience in dealing with many of the veterans and their \nfamilies, the efforts to get these discharge certificates in a timely \nfashion has been very frustrating--frustrating for the families, \nfrustrating for those who have served, most certainly, and frustrating \nfor those of us who have been trying to make it happen. Some former \nmembers of the Territorial Guard are still waiting to get their \ndischarge certificates. We have been assisted by a wonderful volunteer, \nBob Goodman, who lives in Anchorage. He helps the former members of the \nTerritorial Guard document their service, and he tells me that unless \nwe can get this turned around, unless we can kind of move through this \nroadblock, we are going to see more of these fine Americans who will \npass on before they get their long-awaited recognition.\n  I just don't understand. I can't understand why it took nearly 8 \nyears--8 years--for the Defense Department to recognize the Alaska \nTerritorial Guard's service for military retirement benefits. But, as I \nmentioned, back in June of 2008, they did it. Apparently, that decision \ndid not please some at the Defense Department. Between Thanksgiving and \nChristmas, we learned they made a case that the members of the \nTerritorial Guard are not eligible for retirement benefits. This was \nall happening over there at the Department under the radar of Secretary \nGeren here in Washington. The Secretary says there is nothing we can do \nat this point in time; the retirement benefits have been reduced on the \ncomputers of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the \npayments are going to go down effective February 1.\n  I am not going to stand here and blame the lawyers for telling their \nclients that the policy of crediting Alaska Territorial Guard service \ntoward retirement pay doesn't comport with the law. But at the same \ntime, the Defense Department hasn't released that legal opinion, so I \ncan't judge--the presiding officer can't judge--whether this conclusion \nis really compelled by the law. If the conclusion was compelled by the \nlaw, I suppose we can't call out the lawyers for saying so. But I do \nfault their clients, the leaders who knew this was coming. They knew it \nwas coming, but they didn't bother to tell any of the members of the \nAlaska Congressional Delegation.\n  I was not notified; you were not notified, Mr. President; our Member \nin the House of Representatives--nobody came to us late last year and \nsaid: Hey, we have a problem. We have a problem, and it requires a \nlegislative fix. Can we work together, can we do something either at \nthe end of the 110th Congress or immediately at the outset of this new \nCongress?\n  The senior leaders in the Army and DOD didn't even acknowledge that \nthere was a problem until you and I contacted the Secretary of the Army \nand asked: Is there a problem? We hear there is stuff floating around. \nWhat is going on?\n  As far as I was concerned, the reason we suspected there was a \nproblem was because the adjutant general of Alaska, after trying to \nwork through this problem at his level and through the chain of \ncommand, told us something was coming and it was going to be coming \nimminently.\n  Then just last week, Army Secretary Geren confirmed those fears, the \nfear that it will be real, that the retirement pay will be cut \neffective February 1. He says there is nothing he can do about it.\n  This afternoon, the members of the Alaska Congressional Delegation \nare writing to the administration, asking that he intervene to ensure \nthat those Native elders who are affected by this tragic series of \nevents do not lose this safety net.\n  Senator Begich and I are also preparing legislation that clarifies \nthat service in the Alaska Territorial Guard is to be regarded as \nActive-Duty service for purposes of calculating retirement pay. We need \nto clear up that vagueness in the statutes.\n  I would just say, as I am able to speak here on the floor of the \nSenate, to Secretary Gates, if you are within the sound of my voice, I \nbelieve you owe an apology to these people. It was just a month ago \nthat the Army Chief of Staff sent a letter of apology to 7,000 \nsurviving families of the global war on terror who received letters \naddressed to John Doe. The blunder I speak of today affects far fewer \npeople, but it is certainly no less of a blunder. I think we recognize \nwe have just gone through a transition, moving from one administration \nto the other. Things happen during a transition period--things just \nhappen. Sometimes policy blunders can occur. These things do happen, \nand then it falls upon Congress and the administration to come back and \nfix things.\n  I pledge to the Alaskans, and I know the Presiding Officer and our \ncolleague in the House, Representative Young--I think we all make the \ncommitment to do everything we can to clean up what we are dealing with \nhere. But I am left to wonder, what kind of a government, what kind of \na Cruella, could cut retirement benefits to a group of Eskimos in their \neighties, in the dead of an Alaskan winter, and say: Sorry, there is \nnothing we can do.\n  It is time for some soul searching at the Pentagon. I am looking for \nanswers. I know you are looking for answers. We are looking for \nsolutions, and there is really very little time left.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. Know that we will find positive \nsolutions for those who have served us honorably.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, after listening to the Senator from \nAlaska, I\n\n[[Page S778]]\n\ncertainly would love to have her advocating on my behalf, and I know \nyou two will make a great team in advocating on behalf of the people in \nAlaska, certainly seeing that they have been sent an injustice. I thank \nyou for the opportunity to listen to that. Again, it is great to be \nhere with the two Senators from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S778-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FAMILY PLANNING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today many of our constituents are in town \nfor the annual March for Life. They are expressing their strong \nconcerns about an issue that has divided our Nation for decades: \nabortion.\n  This issue divides legislatures. It divides churches and communities. \nIt even divides families. Parents often disagree with their children. \nTwo sisters or two brothers may see the issue differently. Even \nhusbands and wives may not see eye to eye.\n  And yet, the American people look to their elected leaders to come \ntogether and address the issue.\n  My position on the fundamental issue is clear: abortion should be \nsafe and legal, consistent with Roe v. Wade. A decision this personal \nis best left to a woman, her family, her doctor, and her conscience.\n  But I don't think the issue ends there. We may never reach a \nconsensus on abortion itself, but we can go beyond the divisions, \nacknowledge that women have a right to an abortion in America, and \nstill work together to reduce the number of abortions.\n  So I would like to take a step back and talk about some of the things \nwe can do to prevent unwanted pregnancies, which is a goal I think all \nof us in this chamber share.\n  Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned \nthat is almost 3 million times a year that a woman and a man are \nconfronted with the news that, contrary to their intentions, the woman \nis pregnant.\n  We can make a greater effort to ensure that couples have access to \nthe information and services they need to prevent unwanted pregnancies.\n  First, we need to invest in comprehensive evidence-based teen \npregnancy prevention programs. Nearly 1 million teen girls become \npregnant each year, and it's time we focus on helping them prevent \nthose pregnancies.\n  Next, we need to ensure that women can afford contraception by \nexpanding funding for the Title X family planning program, which \nprovides a critical safety net that both improves women's health and \nsaves taxpayers money.\n  Low-income women are four times more likely to have unintended \npregnancies than their higher-income peers. Democrats have proposed \nthat women who are entitled to Medicaid-funded labor and delivery also \nbe given access to family planning services through the Medicaid \nprogram. If we will cover the childbirth, why would we not cover the \nprevention services that would help avoid the unintended pregnancy?\n  And for women with private health insurance, we must ensure that FDA-\napproved prescription contraceptives are covered to the same extent as \nother prescription drugs and devices. If we want women and men to take \nthe responsible steps to avoid unintended pregnancies, we must give \nthem access to the family planning options that will empower them to do \nso. Ensuring that contraceptive coverage is a covered service in our \nhealth plans is a commonsense way to address that issue.\n  It is also time to restore common sense in other areas.\n  Women must have timely and medically accurate information about \nanother alternative: emergency contraception.\n  This product is FDA approved, and can prevent pregnancy and thus the \nneed for abortion. Greater awareness of it could substantially reduce \nthe staggering number of unintended pregnancies.\n  The facts are also on the side of lifting the so-called ``Mexico \nCity'' policy that controls how family planning organizations in other \ncountries may use their own funds. The global gag rule requires that, \nas a condition for receipt of U.S. funding, private and international \norganizations must agree not to use their own non-American funds to \nperform abortions, provide abortion counseling, or even lobby to make \nor keep abortion legal in their countries.\n  By law, Federal funds cannot be used for abortions. Audits have \ndemonstrated that, in the years when the Mexico City policy has been \nlifted, Federal funds have not been used for abortions. So this is not \nabout abortion.\n  This is about whether international family planning programs will be \nallowed the same rights of freedom of speech and action that domestic \nprograms have. We should not be dictating what groups do with their own \nindependent funds as a condition of receiving U.S. family planning \nfunding.\n  So often, the battle over abortion has been extended into unnecessary \nbattles over contraception. But there are other policy areas where \npeople who disagree over abortion should be able to come together.\n  First, we need to support pregnant women when they find themselves in \na difficult situation.\n  We must work to ensure that they have access to health care both \nbefore and after the child is born; parenting programs; income support; \nnutrition assistance; and caring adoption alternatives.\n  Finally, we must look beyond the immediate crises and work to address \nthe underlying conditions that can affect a couple's response to an \nunplanned pregnancy. Affordable health care, secure jobs with good \nwages, expanded child care options, and improved educational assistance \ncan make it easier for a couple to welcome a child into the family. \nThese, again, are areas where we should be able to come together and \nmake progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S778-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S778-S779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                         Hillary Rodham Clinton\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak today regarding the \ndeparture of my esteemed colleague from New York, Senator Hillary \nRodham Clinton. I have known Senator Clinton for many years now, and I \nhave worked closely with her since the time she served as First Lady of \nthe United States and then as she so aptly served the people of New \nYork in the Senate. Today, I am sure that I am joined by many of my \ncolleagues in saying that her compassion, her skill, and her example in \nthis institution will be missed.\n  As a former First Lady of the United States, I was very impressed \nwith the work Senator Clinton did to increase the level of care for \nwomen and children from around the world. You may recall that her \nservice in this capacity knew no boundaries or borders as millions of \nlives were touched both here in the United States and abroad by her \ncare, by her understanding, and by her tenacity in helping people \nreceive the level of care and attention they so justly deserved. \nIndeed, Senator Clinton reminded us all that women's rights are not to \nbe separated from human rights and that through this empowerment we \nhave the potential to improve relations, eradicate violence, and \nincrease prosperity. This is the vision and compassion that served her \nso well as a former First Lady of the United States, and this is the \nsame compassion that continued to highlight her time here in the \nSenate.\n  Although her time in this legislative body has been relatively brief, \nthe accomplishments of Senator Clinton have been many. If I may, let me \nhighlight just two contrasting examples. The first example comes from \n2007 when I worked closely with Senator Clinton on the Biologics Price \nand Protection Innovation Act. It was through these tough negotiations, \nnumerous committee meetings, and candid discussions that I again was \nprivileged to witness Senator Clinton's skill in bringing large groups \nof affected parties together in the spirit of compromise. With so many \ncompeting interests and so much attention being drawn to this \nlegislation, I was appreciative of Senator Clinton's skills in \nnegotiation, in understanding competing interests, and in listening to \nall of the parties involved in passing this important legislation out \nof the Senate.\n  The second example I would like to mention comes from 2008 with \nlittle fanfare. It is a simple resolution and one that probably did not \nreceive much attention, but it was a resolution that meant something to \nme and it meant something to Senator Clinton. I speak\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\nof a Senate resolution designating a week in May as National Substitute \nTeacher Recognition Week. For helping me to pass this simple \nresolution, I am grateful to Senator Clinton. More importantly, \nhowever, I am grateful that Senator Clinton was more interested in \ndoing what was right for substitute teachers across our Nation. Even \nthough this resolution probably never made a headline, Senator Clinton \nwas one of the first in line to sign on as a cosponsor because she knew \nit was the least we could do for men and women across our country who \ngive so much to our children through their education.\n  In closing, I share these two examples simply to illustrate the skill \nand compassion that defined Senator Clinton's service while she was \nhere in the Senate. From the large legislative issues to the small acts \nof kindness and recognition, I know that Senator Clinton strived to do \nwhat she thought was right and what was best for our country. It is \nthis example that we will all miss in the Senate as she begins the next \nchapter of her service at the State Department. Truly, their gain is \nour loss, yet it is without hesitation that I extend my deepest \ngratitude to Senator Clinton for her countless hours of service, her \nincredible example of compassion, and the years of friendship that she \nhas extended to me, my colleagues, and the people of the United States. \nI am excited for what the future holds for Senator Clinton. I am \ncertain that many great things still lie ahead in this next chapter of \nher life, and it is to Senator Clinton that I extend my congratulations \nas she begins her journey at the State Department.\n\n\n                              ken salazar\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the resignation of the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar in order to undertake the duties and \nresponsibilities of Secretary of the Interior, has left us with a sense \nof pride and loss. We are very pleased the Department of the Interior \nwill have the benefit of his leadership, but we regret that he will not \nbe able to continue his excellent record of distinguished service in \nthis body.\n  It has been a personal pleasure to serve with my friend from \nColorado. His warm personality and his seriousness of purpose as a \nSenator have enabled him to serve as a very successful U.S. Senator.\n  I wish my friend well as he undertakes his new duties. I am sure we \nwill see him often in the Senate working with us as we support him and \nthe Department in carrying out their important responsibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S779-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EXECUTIVE ORDER CLOSING DETENTION FACILITIES\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I once again come to the floor to discuss an \nissue that goes directly to who we are as a country and what we stand \nfor.\n  Specifically, I want to comment on the executive orders President \nObama signed today to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility \nwithin a year, close secret prisons operated by the CIA, and review the \nprocedures for detaining and trying accused terrorists. In so doing, he \nsends a long-overdue message not only to the world, but also to the \nAmerican people here at home, reaffirming our values as Americans and \nour commitment to the rule of law.\n  As we speak, some 245 individuals are still being held as enemy \ncombatants at Guantanamo Bay, and about 100 in secret prisons around \nthe world, though we do not even know for sure. Several independent \nsources have alleged that these detainees have suffered from abuse.\n  All of the information we have indicates that most, if not all, of \nthese people have engaged in a host of violent actions directed at the \nUnited States. They are not misguided innocents, but rather men \ncommitted to harming us. I rise today not to defend them and their \nactions in any way; they must be punished to the full extent of the \nlaw.\n  Rather, I rise to urge exactly that, the application of our great \nbody of law for dealing with dangerous people intent on harming us. \nIndeed, some in our Government have failed to apply the law and failed \nto obey it.\n  According to a Red Cross report, prisoners in Guantanamo Bay were \nsubjected to ``cruel, inhumane and degrading'' treatment that is \n``tantamount to torture.'' FBI agents have reported that many of those \nheld at Guantnamo Bay were chained to the floor in a fetal \nposition for 18 hours or more, and were subject to 100-degree heat and \nfreezing cold. The CIA's secret facilities have never been inspected, \nso we don't know how prisoners have been treated in them.\n  These abuses are not just morally wrong, they are violations of \nAmerican and international law. They weaken respect for the rule of law \nabroad and subject American citizens to greater risks of unlawful \ndetention and torture in foreign countries. And they weaken our \nsecurity even as they undermine our democratic ideals.\n  Guantanamo and the CIA's secret prisons has been an international \nembarrassment, a symbol of abuse and the breakdown of law, which is why \nI and others have come to this floor so often to discuss our moral \nresponsibility to close them.\n  To be absolutely clear, I repeat that those who are a threat to \nAmerica, who are guilty of crimes, must and will be punished to the \nfullest extent of the law. They must be tried and prosecuted. This \ndecision is not about protecting those who wish to harm us.\n  Rather, this decision says, as President Obama did in his inaugural \naddress this week, that the choice between security and liberty is a \nfalse choice, and we reject it.\n  As General George Washington answered when his soldiers asked him for \npermission to beat their prisoners, ``Treat them with humanity. Let \nthem have no reason to complain of our copying the brutal example'' of \nour enemies.\n  And so, I am grateful and relieved that President Obama has acted so \nquickly to remedy this very damaging policy.\n  This is, of course, only the first step. We must remain vigilant in \nworking with the administration to implement these orders. And there \nremain many issues to be decided, from when and how Guantanamo and \nother detention facilities are closed to ensuring the interrogation \nmethods employed by U.S. personnel never again cross the line into \ntorture.\n  But this is a critical first step toward restoring not only the rule \nof law and our Constitution but also our moral authority. Today, we \nremind the world and ourselves that everyone is subject to the law and \nno one, not you, not I, stands above it.\n  I am convinced that today's orders will better secure our Nation and \nallow us to more effectively prevent, detain, and prosecute those who \nwould seek to harm us.\n  I applaud President Obama for his decision to act without delay on \nthese most important issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S779-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S779-S780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, from the start of his transition to the \nWhite House, I have urged President Obama to make a clear commitment to \nopen government. By issuing his directive to strengthen one of our \nNation's most important open government laws, the Freedom of \nInformation Act, FOIA, the President is turning the page and moving \naway from the overreaching secrecy of the last administration. I \ncommend President Obama for recognizing that our Government is \naccountable to the people it represents. I also commend the President \nfor taking immediate steps during his first full days in office to send \nthis important message to the American people.\n  I was delighted with the answer of the President's nominee to be the \nnext Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, when I asked \nhim at his confirmation hearing last week about how he intended to \nimplement the Freedom of Information Act. He, too, believes that the \npresumption should be toward disclosure and openness. In fact, that was \nthe policy before Attorney General Ashcroft reversed it.\n  Today, our Government is more open and accountable to the American \npeople than it was just a few weeks ago. With the President's new FOIA \nmemorandum, the implementation of the first major reforms to FOIA in \nmore than a decade in the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act, and the \nnomination of Eric H. Holder Jr., to be the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, the American people have more openness and \naccountability regarding the activities of the executive branch. I am \npleased that the President also issued a\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\nPresidential Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government that will \npromote accountability and transparency in government and an Executive \nOrder on Presidential records that will provide the American people \nwith greater access to Presidential records.\n  The right to know is a cornerstone of our democracy. Without it, \ncitizens are kept in the dark about key policy decisions that directly \naffect their lives. Without open government, citizens cannot make \ninformed choices at the ballot box. Without access to public documents \nand a vibrant free press, officials can make decisions in the shadows, \noften in collusion with special interests, escaping accountability for \ntheir actions. And once eroded, these rights are hard to win back.\n  The Sunshine in Government Initiative has been vigilant and steadfast \non behalf of open government. I have been pleased to work with this \ncoalition of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the Associated \nPress, Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, National Association of \nBroadcasters, National Newspaper Association, Newspaper Association of \nAmerica, Radio-Television News Directors Association, Reporters \nCommittee for Freedom of the Press, and Society of Professional \nJournalists in connection with these initiatives and correcting the \ngovernment's presumption toward openness.\n  As we celebrate the inauguration of our new President and the start \nof a new administration, we are reminded that a free, open, and \naccountable democracy is what our forefathers envisioned and fought to \ncreate. I believe that it is the duty of each new generation to protect \nthis vital heritage and inheritance. In this new year, at this new and \nhistoric time for our Nation, I am pleased that we have once again \nreaffirmed a commitment to an open and transparent government on behalf \nof all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S780-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING MARGARET TYLER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, the Committee on Armed Services \nunanimously passed a committee resolution to express its appreciation \nto Margaret Tyler and to commend her for her many years of faithful and \noutstanding service to the men and women of the U.S. Army, to their \nfamilies, and to the Senate of the United States.\n  Margaret Tyler has worked for the Federal Government for 57 years. \nShe has served 45 of those 57 years in the Army Liaison Office--38 of \nthose years in the Army Senate Liaison Office.\n  Through all those years, Mrs. Tyler has dedicated herself to helping \nthose in need and in solving problems affecting the U.S. Army. She has \nalways been professional, efficient, and effective in her work. Over \nthe years, Senators and staff have learned that when they have a \nproblem involving the Army the first step in solving the problem is \ncalling Margaret Tyler. To many in the Senate family, she is \naffectionately known as the Army's Angel.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces deserve the best support and \nassistance we in Congress can give them. Day in and day out, for the \npast 45 years, Margaret has helped us support the men and women of the \nU.S. Army and their families to the best of her ability. Thousands of \nsoldiers and their families have been touched by her dedicated, \nprofessional, and personal care.\n  On behalf of all the members of the Committee on Armed Services, I \nask unanimous consent that our committee's resolution commending \nMargaret Tyler on her service to the men and women of the U.S. Army, to \ntheir families, and to the Senate of the United States be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Committee on Armed Services Resolution 1\n\n\n COMMENDING MARGARET TYLER ON HER SERVICE TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE \n UNITED STATES ARMY, TO THEIR FAMILIES AND TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED \n                                 STATES\n\n       Whereas Margaret Tyler, a native of England who became a \n     United States citizen on February 24, 1954, has worked for \n     the federal Government for 57 years;\n       Whereas Margaret Tyler worked in the Army Liaison Office in \n     the House of Representatives from 1964 to 1970, and in the \n     Army Liaison Office in the United States Senate from 1971 to \n     the present day, a total of 45 years of dedicated service;\n       Whereas Margaret Tyler has demonstrated an unwavering \n     commitment to meeting the needs of members of the United \n     States Army, their families, and the members and staff of the \n     United States Senate for the past 38 years;\n       Whereas Margaret Tyler has earned the respect and gratitude \n     of the Senators and their staffs for her dedication, her \n     professionalism, her service and her good humor;\n       Resolved, That the Committee on Armed Services expresses \n     its appreciation to Margaret Tyler and commends her for her \n     lengthy, faithful and outstanding service to the men and \n     women of the United States Army, to their families, and to \n     the Senate of the United States.\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Committee shall transmit a \n     copy of this resolution to Margaret Tyler.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S780-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S780-S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EXECUTIVE ORDERS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today is a very significant day for the \nrule of law in the United States of America, and a powerful statement \nthat the United States again stands for the time-honored principles and \nvalues that have made us a beacon to the world.\n  This morning, the President of the United States signed Executive \norders ordering the closure of Guantanamo Bay prison within a year; \nsuspending all military commissions at Guantanamo Bay; closing secret \nthird-country prisons; and placing interrogation in all American \nfacilities for all U.S. personnel under the guidelines of the Army \nField Manual.\n  In a season of transformational changes, these are among the most \nprofoundly meaningful because they will sustain the long-term health of \nthe most cherished ideals of our Republic: respect for the rule of law, \nindividual rights, and American moral leadership.\n  The threat our Nation faces from terrorism is all too real. And we \nshould all agree that sometimes, in the name of national security, it \nis necessary to make difficult ethical decisions to protect the \nAmerican people.\n  However, I believe that the use of torture and indefinite detention \nhave not only tarnished our honor but also diminished our security. In \nthis global counterinsurgency effort against al Qaida and its allies, \ntoo often our means have undercut our efforts against extremism. In \nthis struggle, the people are the center of gravity. And too often we \nhave wasted one of the best weapons we have in our arsenal: the \nlegitimacy we wield when we exercise our moral authority.\n  Efforts to justify, explain away, or endorse the use of torture have \nplayed directly into a central tenet of al Qaida's recruiting pitch: \nthat everyday Muslims across the world have something to fear from the \nUnited States of America. From Morocco to Malaysia, people regularly \nhear stories of torture and suicide at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and \nother overseas prisons. The result has been a major blow to our \ncredibility worldwide, particularly where we need it most: in the \nMuslim world.\n  Torture and lawlessness are not easily contained. Once the strictures \nare loosened, the corner-cutting practices spread. The Pentagon used \nhigh-level Guantanamo detainees to test coercive interrogation \ntechniques, but such techniques eventually found their way to low-level \ndetainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. While images of Abu Ghraib have \nlong faded from American minds and media, they remain fixtures, years \nlater, across the Arab and Muslim world.\n  As Senator McCain has argued, the use of techniques like \nwaterboarding--invented in the Spanish Inquisition and prosecuted by \nthe American Government as a Japanese war crime after World War II--\nleaves its scars on a democratic society as well. Torture, which \nflourishes in the shadows, depends on lies--not just from those who \nseek to avoid torture, but from those who seek to conceal it. After \nyears of Orwellian denials and legalistic parsing, what a relief it was \nto hear our new Attorney General-designee Eric Holder finally \nacknowledge on behalf of the United States Government what we all know \nto be true: that yes, ``waterboarding is torture.''\n  As we move forward, President Obama is wise to ``reject as false the \nchoice between our safety and our ideals''--but moving beyond this \nframework does not mean that this administration will not face real and \ndifficult choices about how best to keep Americans safe while honoring \nour values.\n  The American people should know that closing Guantanamo will not be \neasy. Conceived to be outside law, reclaiming the prison and its \ninhabitants\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\ninto our legal system from what Vice President Cheney called ``the dark \nside'' will be an enormous challenge and a thicket of thorny legal and \npolicy issues.\n  However, we are already seeing the international system reorganize \nitself around an America that is willing to be a moral leader. \nCountries such as Portugal and Ireland have made welcome offers to join \nAlbania in resettling detainees who cannot be returned to their home \ncountries. Already we are seeing the fruits of a good-faith effort with \nour allies.\n  Still, it will take time and effort to overcome numerous hurdles. The \nnew administration faces tough challenges handed over from the previous \nadministration. Looming questions must be addressed about the \ninadmissibility of evidence improperly coerced. It is difficult or \nimpossible in some cases to return detainees--including many cleared \nfor departure--who would face torture or worse in their home countries; \nand we already know that some released from Guantanamo have returned to \nthe battlefield. In some cases we simply lack evidence to charge men we \nknow to be extremely dangerous and threatening to the American people. \nAnd we owe it to those we believe made grave mistakes to acknowledge \nthe urgency of the moment they inherited, the sacred responsibility to \nprotect American lives, which they strove to honor, and the humbling \nreality that there are no easy answers when it comes to such life-and-\ndeath matters.\n  But the American story is one of perfectibility and striving for \never-greater fidelity to our ideals--it is a journey from Colony to \nRepublic, from slavery to freedom, from sexism to suffrage, from stark \npoverty to shared prosperity. The President himself famously said, \n``the union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has \nshown that it can always be perfected.''\n  It is true that today we face unprecedented, unorthodox, and vastly \ndestructive enemies that respect neither borders nor rules of war. But \nit is equally true that we have done so before. This is not the first \nnew challenge America has evolved to meet. Sometimes that evolution \nrequires us to admit mistakes, learn from them and grow as a nation. \nOur progress in response to new threats and new fears has been halting \nbut real, and our setbacks have always been followed by a strong \ncorrective impulse. The desire to do better has always been a core part \nof America's greatness.\n  Today Barack Obama and his administration wrote a new chapter in that \nold story. I commend them and look forward to helping them make good on \ntheir goals, keep Americans safe, and usher in a new era of America's \nmoral leadership.\n  Today's Executive orders were a promising sign of things to come--\nAmerica will again honor the values that make us strong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S781-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    36TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today, January 22, 2009, marks the 36th \nanniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision.\n  Today, concerned Americans, including many North Carolinians, are \ngathering on the National Mall to March for Life, and I would like to \ntake this opportunity to welcome them to Washington, DC.\n  On January 17, 2009, in anticipation of today's events, North \nCarolinians gathered for their annual Rally and March for Life in \nRaleigh.\n  I congratulate them on their successful event, and I would like to \nthank them for their efforts to promote a culture of life in America.\n  In recent years we have made great strides in protecting the unborn \nthrough various measures, such as passage of the partial birth abortion \nban, Lacey and Connor's Law, and tax incentives to enable more families \nto adopt.\n  These achievements are a testament to the advocates who work \ntirelessly every day to remind us of the value of life.\n  With these achievements and others, it is my sincere hope that my \ncolleagues in the Senate will continue to work together to protect our \nchildren.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today marks the 36th year since the \nSupreme Court issued its decision in the case of Roe v. Wade, a court \ndecision that evokes strong emotions all across America. Today, \nthousands of Americans who support life have taken time out of their \nbusy schedules to travel to Washington to take part in the ``March for \nLife,'' an annual event on the National Mall. I share their hope for \nseeing the day where the sanctity of life is cherished, valued, and \naffirmed under the law.\n  This morning, I had the opportunity to meet with some of these \nindividuals, students from Cardinal Newman High School in West Palm \nBeach, and I expressed my gratitude for their steadfast commitment to \nprotecting innocent human life.\n  As a Nation, we have made significant progress in creating a culture \nthat respects life in recent years. As someone who believes that every \nlife is sacred, I encourage President Obama to follow the lead of his \npredecessor, and continue to restrict the use of taxpayer funding for \norganizations that perform abortion services or refer patients to \nabortion providers.\n  This policy, known as the Mexico City Agreement, was first signed \ninto order by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Over the years, the \npolicy has been wrongly attacked and falsely characterized as a \nrestriction on foreign aid for family planning. The truth is that the \npolicy has not reduced aid at all.\n  Instead, it has ensured that family planning funds are given to \norganizations dedicated to reducing abortions instead of promoting \nthem. If the policy were to be reversed, it would blur the line that \nhas been drawn between funding organizations that aim to reduce \nabortions, and those that promote abortion as a means of contraception. \nPresident Obama should make the right choice in keeping the Mexico City \nAgreement in place.\n  In conclusion, on this 36th year since the Supreme Court handed down \nits decision, I commend the leaders of ``March for Life.'' Supporters \nare in Washington today, marching down Pennsylvania Avenue, reminding \nlawmakers of the importance of preserving and protecting life. Their \nvoices are heard. They are heard year after year. I hope there is a day \nwhen their voices are heard in celebration that life is preserved and \nprotected by the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S781-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S781-S782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    U.S. AIRWAYS FLIGHT 1549 HEROES\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the heroic efforts \nof the pilots, crew, passengers, emergency responders, and volunteer \norganizations that led to the extraordinary outcome of U.S. Airways \nflight 1549, which was bound for Charlotte, NC, on January 15, 2009.\n  U.S. Airways flight 1549 departed New York's LaGuardia Airport on the \nafternoon of January 15 with 150 passengers and 5 crew, including 2 \npilots and 3 flight attendants, aboard. Charlotte was the final \ndestination of 104 of the passengers, many of whom are my constituents.\n  Within minutes of take-off, the aircraft experienced engine trouble \nforcing the pilot, Captain Chesley B. ``Sully'' Sullenberger, to \nperform an emergency landing on the Hudson River.\n  I understand that a water landing of this sort is rare and \ntechnically challenging, making it extremely dangerous for all aboard. \nBut Captain Sullenberger executed the difficult landing expertly. His \nskill and decisiveness has been heralded with saving the lives of all \non board.\n  As passengers emerged from the plane onto emergency life rafts and \nthe wings of the still buoyant aircraft, boats were on the scene to \nassist with the rescue in minutes. Vessels were dispatched from the New \nYork police and fire departments, the Port Authority of New York and \nNew Jersey, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the New York Waterway, which \nreportedly sent all 14 of its boats to the scene.\n  Without the immediate assistance of these boats, I am certain the \npassengers and crew on board would not have fared as well as they did, \ngiven the extreme temperatures in New York City on the day of the \nincident. All participating rescue parties are to be commended for \ntheir swift and professional response.\n  In fact, the tales of heroism emerging from this event are numerous. \nFor example, I was moved by the story of Josh Peltz, a Charlotte \nresident, husband, and father of two. Flying home\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\nto Charlotte from a business meeting, Josh was seated in the emergency \nrow's window seat. Not only was Josh integral in opening the emergency \nhatch after impact, but he was also helpful in reassuring passengers \nand assisting others, including a mother and her 9-month-old baby, up \nthe ladder and onto the awaiting ferry. And as rescuers assisted \npassengers, I understand that Captain Sullenberger continued to \ndemonstrate true heroism as he refused to deplane until all others \nonboard had been safely evacuated.\n  I again commend all who contributed to making this disastrous event a \ntrue miracle, including the first responders; volunteer organizations, \nsuch as the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army; and most of all \nthe crew and passengers of 1549. The acts of heroism and the stories of \nselflessness that have emerged from this event are truly inspiring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S782-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S782-S783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MELVIN DUBEE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, Melvin Dubee, one of the Senate's \nmost highly valued staff members and one to whom I am personally \ngrateful, will soon conclude two decades of government service in order \nto apply his considerable talents in the private sector. While I do \nnot, for a moment, believe that this is the end of Melvin's public \nduties--one day a wise official will certainly summon him back to \npublic service--it is fitting to note his accomplishments to date.\n  As evident to even casual observers, particularly around key Longhorn \nor Cowboy games, Melvin has roots in Texas, where he received at the \nUniversity of Texas at Arlington a Bachelor of Business Administration \ndegree in finance. His path to public service then included a Masters \ndegree in international affairs from George Washington University in \n1988 and two years as a Presidential management intern between 1987 and \n1989.\n  The Presidential Management Intern Program was established by \nPresident Carter to attract to Federal service, through a national \ncompetition, outstanding individuals from a variety of disciplines who \nare interested in a career in Federal service. During the internship \nMelvin worked in the Office of the Inspector General in the Department \nof Defense, where he began to build expertise in defense issues that \ncarried into his Senate work. During that time he received a \ncongressional fellowship, which introduced him to the Senate in the \noffice of the Senate's master teacher, my senior Senator, Robert Byrd, \nwhere Melvin continued to work on defense management issues.\n  It doesn't take long for those with whom Melvin works to be impressed \nby his considerable skills and calm demeanor. His audition as a \nCongressional Fellow led to 5 years of service as national security \nassistant to Senator Byrd, between 1989 and 1994. In that capacity, he \nadvised Senator Byrd, who was then in the midst of his distinguished \nleadership of the Senate Appropriations Committee, on foreign policy \nand defense issues. This included serving as Senator Byrd's staff \nrepresentative to the Armed Services Committee, during which Melvin \ncomplemented his growing knowledge of defense issues with his \nimpressive legislative process skills concerning hearings, markups, \nfloor action, conference committee negotiations, and negotiations with \nother congressional offices and with the Executive Branch.\n  In 1994, Melvin began his service on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. This service continued until now with brief interruptions, \nincluding a year during President Clinton's administration in the \nOffice of National Drug Policy where he advised Director Barry \nMcCaffrey on that office's interaction with Congress.\n  Melvin has contributed to the committee in a variety of positions.\n  As a professional staff member, which is the general entry point for \nour staff, Melvin developed expertise in a number of key intelligence \ncommunity oversight issues, including counter-drug, counterterrorism, \ninternational organized crime issues, as well as area expertise \nconcerning Latin America and Southeast Asia. As a professional staff \nmember, he also served as an adviser and liaison to Senator John Kerry \nand then to me, during the early part of my service on the committee in \n2001.\n  One of Melvin's particular contributions during that time was \nleadership of the committee's investigation of the tragic April 2001 \nshoot-down of a U.S. missionary plane in Peru. Our report, entitled \n``Report on a Review of United States Assistance to Peruvian Counter-\nDrug Air Interdiction Efforts and the Shootdown of a Civilian Aircraft \non April 20, 2001,'' S. Prt. 107-64, bears witness to a number of his \nskills. They include an ability to gather and carefully analyze facts, \nwrite accurately and clearly, help the Committee draw sound conclusions \nand make needed recommendations, and do so in a manner that draws \nbipartisan support. And, I should add, also to do all that \nexpeditiously so that the committee was able to report publicly within \n6 months of the incident.\n  The skills that Melvin amply demonstrated as a professional staff \nmember led to his selection to fill two key staff management positions.\n  From mid-2001 through 2002, Melvin served as the committee's budget \ndirector. Our budget director post is an immensely important \nresponsibility. The total national intelligence budget when Melvin was \nbudget director is classified. But we have declassified the top line \nfor the last 2 fiscal years. The most recent figure, $47.5 billion in \nfiscal year 2008, conveys the importance of the task of reviewing, \nmaking recommendations about, and monitoring implementation of the \nNation's intelligence budget. As budget director, Melvin led the \ncommittee's budget monitors for each of the individual intelligence \ncommunity elements in scouring the President's budget numbers and \nevaluating the broad span of human and technical collection, \nanalytical, acquisition, and management issues they involve. The budget \ndirector arranges for the presentation of these issues at classified \nhearings of the committee, their consideration at committee markups, \ncoordination with the Senate Armed Services and Appropriations \nCommittees, and negotiation with the House and also with the Executive \nBranch. This work is at the heart of the committee's responsibilities.\n  Confidence in Melvin, starting with former Vice Chairman Richard \nBryan in 2000 and then myself from 2003 through the 110th Congress, \nalso led to Melvin's designation as deputy staff director, initially on \nthe minority side and then beginning in 2007 as the committee's deputy \nstaff director. There are two aspects of that responsibility. One is \nleadership within the staff, helping it to maintain the high level of \nprofessionalism and effectiveness that has been the hallmark of our \nIntelligence Committee staffs. The other is being a close adviser to \nthe chairman or vice chairman, as the case may be, on the full breadth \nof issues relating to the oversight of the U.S. intelligence community.\n  In both respects, as a partner with the staff director in managing \nthe committee and as a close adviser to me, Melvin performed \nmagnificently. On a daily basis, I most often saw Melvin as a trusted \nadviser. In that role, Melvin combines key capabilities and attributes.\n  Melvin knows his material. This includes current intelligence and \nhistorical background. It includes detailed knowledge of the elements \nof the intelligence community, from the CIA, to components of the \nDefense Department, to intelligence elements in the State, Treasury, \nand Energy Departments, as well as the FBI. And it includes knowledge \nof the functioning of the Senate, with respect not only to the \nIntelligence Committee, but also to the committees with which we work, \nand its leadership and floor proceedings.\n  Melvin has an admirable ability to express his considerable knowledge \nsuccinctly and clearly. He has no hesitation in expressing disagreement \nor dissent, respectfully but clearly, particularly when a matter of \nprinciple is involved, as is often the case when addressing sensitive \nmatters. When a decision is made, he has an uncanny ability to find and \nrecommend the right words for remarks in committee, on the floor, in \nletters or press releases, or in speeches outside the Senate. And, in \nall of our endeavors, Melvin has been forever guided by a deep \ncommitment to the protection of our Nation and our values.\n  It would be incomplete, however, to talk only about Melvin at work. A\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\nglance at his wall of photographs, an opportunity to hear him talk \nabout his family, and the chance to meet his wife and two daughters, \nmake it clear that Melvin and his wife Kristine Johnson are loving and \nimaginative parents, and that Melvin's priorities have always been \nright on the mark. As may often be the case when someone leaves the \nSenate for the private sector, daughters Katrina and Eliza may find \nthat Dad is able to get home a little earlier to join them at dinner.\n  With gratitude for his service to the Senate and the Nation, for \nmyself and the many others who have benefited from it, I wish Melvin \nthe best in the time ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S783-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF H.

James Saxton, on the occasion of his \nretirement from the U.S. House of Representatives after 24 years of \nremarkable service to our country.\n  As a Representative for New Jersey's diverse Third District, Mr. \nSaxton was truly an advocate not only for his constituents but for New \nJersey's interests, as well. Throughout his tenure, he remained an \nexceptional voice for environmental protection and conservation, and \nwas a fervent advocate for our service men and women and the military \nbases situated in his district.\n  Encompassing the Jersey Shore, Pinelands Preservation, suburban \ncommunities, and countless areas of open space, the landscape of the \nThird District is special and complex. Mr. Saxton was a tireless \nfighter for protecting our waterways, preserving our open spaces, and \nmaintaining the health of our oceans.\n  While New Jersey is now home to the Nation's first Mega Base, \nincluding Fort Dix, McGuire Air Force Base, and Lakehurst Naval Air \nEngineering Station, such an installation would not be possible without \nthe contributions of Mr. Saxton. Twice the Defense Base Closure and \nRealignment Commission chose to close down one of our bases and twice \nMr. Saxton defended and defeated the measure. With the many jobs that \nwere saved as a result of this reversal, the new Mega Base will \nreenergize our communities by adding even more opportunities to the \narea.\n  In addition to these and many more accomplishments, Mr. Saxton \nhonorably served on the Armed Services Committee, the Air and Land \nForces Subcommittee, the Terrorism and Unconventional Threats and \nCapabilities Subcommittee, the Natural Resources Committee, the \nSubcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans, and the Joint Economic \nCommittee. His dedication and commitment on behalf of his constituents \nhas earned him the respect and admiration of his peers and colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize, commend, and applaud Mr. \nSaxton in light of his extraordinary service to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and his unwavering dedication to the people of New \nJersey's Third District.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S783-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S783-S785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Why are we still paying foreign aid to the oil-rich \n     [countries]? First, cut off all foreign aid, then charge them \n     $136 a bushel for the grain we sell them at the present price \n     of $7. One fact is for certain--when the food starts \n     disappearing from our supermarket shelves, the politicians \n     will see just how fed up we the people really are. I predict \n     that this will the year of the lowest voter turn-out in the \n     history of this country, as we have no one to choose from for \n     the office of President. Why anyone would want to lead this \n     country into disaster is beyond me. Our government is far too \n     big and corrupt to be changed by a mere vote. Big oil money \n     under the table, personal agendas and the Golden Fleece \n     retirement plan for politicians rule this country. The \n     average citizen has been led to believe that his or her vote \n     matters when it does not. As a sixty-year-old male who has no \n     vision of retirement, and will surely lose my home due to \n     foreclosure, and who will never see Social Security, I, for \n     one, am fed up with this country and [those who seem not to \n     care] about their voters.\n     Gary, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       The idea of exploring and using our own energy resources is \n     a fantastic idea and should have been done long ago. If we \n     use our own resources, in which we have many (capped oil \n     wells all over Texas, drilling in Alaska, Shale oil (which, \n     by the way, is not as expensive as the oil companies claim; \n     they just do not want to lose the revenue they are getting \n     from the failing and antiquated system they are now using, a \n     better Idea would be to reinstitute government control over \n     energy and utility sectors.) I, for one, would feel a great \n     deal better by keeping American dollars at home instead of \n     paying billions to the oil-rich sheiks of the Mideast (in \n     which I have no doubt what so ever that some of those funds \n     end up in terrorists hands.) It is far past the time for \n     American and Americans to take control of our economic and \n     energy future. We have the reserves and resources to do this. \n     The big oil companies have made billions in profit the past \n     couple of years and yet we have not seen nor have we heard \n     anything about refitting the system so the devastation that \n     happened with Katrina does not happen again. Our economy is \n     driven by fuel. Fuel prices go up and the manufacturer pass \n     that cost to the consumer, the consumer is then left with the \n     burden of paying $3.50 for a gallon of milk, $2 for a dozen \n     eggs. It was not too long ago that a gallon of gas was $1.20. \n     Regrettably we will never see that price again. It seems that \n     gas prices do go down but never lower that what it was a year \n     ago.\n       The big oil companies are making billions while we sit by \n     and ``watch'' our economy crumble. If measures are not taken \n     to stop this, and I mean measures in the very very very near \n     future (not five years down the road as Sen. McCain is \n     suggesting) I fear that we will find ourselves in the midst \n     of another great depression. Mark my words, sir, the writing \n     is on the wall, but this time we , and by we, I mean the \n     American people, the Senate, and Congress can do something \n     about it. We can start using our resources and support our \n     economy rather than stuffing the linings of those that \n     already have more money that God. When and where does it \n     stop. Foreign countries already own more of America the \n     America does. We are about to have a rude awakening and it \n     will not be a pretty one if steps are not taken to prevent a \n     hostile takeover of American commerce by foreign companies. \n     All driven by the ridiculous and unnecessarily high price of \n     fuel. I believe that it is only 14 percent of all imported \n     fuel is turned into gas and heating oil. If that is true, why \n     is not the cost of plastics and other petroleum-based \n     products not skyrocketing at all? Natural gas is plentiful \n     yet the energy companies say it costs too much to transport \n     it. Solar power is abundant and never-ending, and the \n     technology is fairly inexpensive, yet people do not use it. \n     Idaho has great expanses to set up solar and wind farms. A \n     nuclear energy company is willing to build a plant in Elmore \n     or Owyhee County (I cannot remember which). The nuclear power \n     plant would supply as much as 75 percent of the states, mind \n     you, the state, not a couple of counties but the entire State \n     of Idaho, power needs. Yet no one wants it because of all the \n     disinformation and propaganda. The French had found a way to \n     recycle the spent fuel rods years ago; yet, we still bury \n     ours. The technology is out there and available. We just need \n     to get the big oil companies hands out of the cookie jar so \n     to speak.\n       I am sorry if it sounds like I am rambling on. I am just a \n     frustrated citizen who is tired of getting the run around \n     from the government as well as big business. Then time for \n     talk has been over for a long time. Now is the time for \n     action.\n       Thank you and God bless,\n     Jose.\n                                  ____\n\n       I work out of my home/office and not as directly impacted \n     as 99 percent of the folks in America who commute, but our \n     food prices are going up due to the ethanol failed policies \n     as it do not make sense to appease mid-west farmers when more \n     efficient Idaho sugar is better (less votes though for \n     liberals). Here is a good summary from Center for individual \n     freedom: (Please be a Fighter.)\n       When it comes to the price Americans are paying for \n     gasoline at the pump, will conservative in Congress fight \n     tooth and nail to increase domestic production or will they \n     allow liberals to choke off your supply of oil and increase \n     gas prices even higher?\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\n       That is the question that hangs like a storm cloud over \n     each of us . . . over our children . . . and over our \n     grandchildren. Some in Congress have already tried repeatedly \n     to increase the price we pay at the pump, even as the price \n     of a gallon of gasoline rose to more than $4.00!\n       As you know, Harry Reid and others in the Senate tried to \n     sneak the Boxer Climate Bill past the American people. That \n     legislation, according to Senate Minority Leader Mitch \n     McConnell would have raised the price at the pump as much as \n     $1.40 a gallon--that is on top of the more than $4 you are \n     already paying!\n       When the Boxer Climate bill failed, liberals tried again \n     last Tuesday to ram through additional taxes on gasoline. On \n     Thursday, Representative John Peterson proposed a measure \n     that would have lifted the ban on oil exploration in areas \n     between 50 to 200 miles off the United Sates coast, a \n     restriction that had been in place since 1981! On a straight \n     party-line vote, Democrats on the House Appropriations \n     Subcommittee killed the measure dead!\n       Then, on Saturday, Senator Barack Obama joined with other \n     Democrats and called for a ``windfall profits tax'' on \n     gasoline--a tax for which consumers will undoubtedly end up \n     footing the bill!\n       And make no mistake--some in Congress, bowing to the \n     radical environmental groups that openly support higher gas \n     prices will not quit! They will not stop until they have \n     raised the price of gasoline even more!\n       But what about conservatives? And what about the American \n     people for that matter? As prices continue to rise at the \n     pump, will they cave to the opposition that is simply using \n     this situation as an excuse to tax us even more? Or will they \n     finally fight?\n                                                            Bruce.\n       I live in rural eastern Idaho. I work a fulltime job to \n     which I commute and I also operate a small cattle ranch. The \n     energy crisis is greatly reducing my expendable income as \n     travel costs have more than doubled and is putting me out of \n     the agricultural business.\n       The oil prices have increased my operating costs in several \n     aspects. The cost of fertilizer has tripled since last year, \n     so this year I could not afford to put fertilizer on my \n     pasture. The cost of electricity is up 50 percent due to the \n     loss of the BPA credits and increased power generation costs \n     and the cost of gasoline for the trucks and tractors has more \n     than doubled.\n       Then to make things worse, the nation's efforts to turn \n     corn into fuel have resulted in a reduction in the amount of \n     hay being grown with the result being that the cost of hay to \n     feed my cattle through the winter has more than doubled in \n     the last year to over $200 dollars a ton.\n       With the cost of feed up, the cost of cattle has dropped. \n     When all this is added up, there is no profit in my \n     operation. I am at the point where I have to decide if I can \n     subsidize my operation from my salary in hopes that things \n     will even out or I will be forced out of business entirely. I \n     have been in the livestock business for over 30 years, \n     producing food for this nation, and this is the first time I \n     have been faced with going completely out of business.\n       I saw this crisis coming several years ago and I wonder why \n     my government did not. This country has let the environmental \n     extremists and political expediency push us into the current \n     situation. We have not built a nuclear reactor for decades. \n     We have not built enough refineries, we have not developed \n     our oil and coal deposits. Now we are in a crisis that will \n     continue to get worse because it will take a decade or more \n     to develop the resources and build the infrastructure if we \n     started today. Projects of this magnitude take forward \n     planning and anticipation, they aren't done over night.\n       We cannot survive a decade unless something is done \n     quickly, because the costs will continue to go up and bring \n     the economy to a standstill!\n       The menial efforts at alternative sources of energy are \n     doing very little and are not the solution. Ethanol is \n     reducing our food production, driving food costs up and still \n     has to be subsidized to make it worth doing. Wind power is \n     noble in the view of some, but will not make a large enough \n     difference to reduce the cost of power.\n       The oil companies, U.S. and foreign, fertilizer companies \n     and ethanol producers are posting record profits as they rape \n     the income of U.S. citizens. CEOs across the nation are \n     receiving record income, while the average people are lining \n     up at soup kitchens just to stay alive. What is wrong with \n     that picture?\n       The spineless Congress needs to take on the \n     environmentalists, get past the global warming scare and \n     start drilling off shore and in ANWAR instead of worrying \n     about future elections. An aggressive effort also needs to be \n     taken to build nuclear reactors and coal fired plants with \n     clean coal technologies. The technology exists to develop \n     these resources without significant environmental impact. \n     Doing so would help us take control of our destiny instead of \n     being held hostage forever.\n       Science knows that the volcanic eruptions across the planet \n     are spewing much more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere \n     than is being produced by people. I am also amazed that \n     legislators are actually listening to studies about cattle \n     belching.\n       I am just one small operator in the agricultural world, but \n     the economics are the same for the large operators. No one \n     will miss me when I go out of business this year, but a flood \n     starts with a few drops of rain, and the flood is coming if \n     something is not done soon! If this nation does not act soon, \n     the U.S. will be at the mercy of other countries for food \n     just as we are for oil and life as we know it will never be \n     the same.\n       It is time that Congress gets off their posteriors and \n     shows some leadership! Take definitive action and do it now, \n     while we have a chance to salvage this situation!\n       Congress apparently has no effective influence over the \n     ever increasing cost of oil or gasoline at the pump. As a \n     Senior Companion, I am compelled to drive as far as necessary \n     to visit the elderly clients. The Public Health Service \n     attempts to reimburse us for fuel mileage driven at a \n     reasonable rate to compensate us for the fuel used. We \n     understand that the reimbursement rate is going to have to be \n     reduced because of budgetary constraints. Well, if it is as \n     impossible as it appears to be to control fuel costs, perhaps \n     it would be possible to find the funds to increase the \n     mileage rate to compensate those of us who have to provide \n     service to our clients despite high fuel prices.\n                                                           George.\n       As the wife of a farmer, the economy is strong in the sense \n     of commodity prices, but yet they are at their weakest when \n     it comes to our fuel prices. Several of our neighbors have \n     had to sell their semis that they used to use to haul grain \n     for themselves and others in the community, just to pay their \n     fuel bills for those trucks. With the price of fuel as well, \n     my husband is not able to take as much income off from the \n     farm, because there is not much left. There are 3 families \n     that depend upon the farm to support them.\n       On the home front, I have had to make the choice for a \n     while now, whether to buy groceries, or put gas in our \n     vehicles. I drive a minivan that averages 23-25 miles to the \n     gallon. At the current cost of gas right now, it costs me on \n     average $90 to fill it up. That is one week's worth of \n     groceries at our house. There are four of us in the home, 2 \n     adults and 2 children with another due in November. We have a \n     limited income right now, because of the weather our growing \n     season has been affected. So for the last few months, we have \n     lived off of about $1800 a month. We do not drive the newest \n     vehicles, our newest vehicle is my 1998 minivan that we \n     purchased in 2007 after our other vehicle was totaled in a \n     car accident. My husband has his 1995 farm truck which is \n     gas, and the family truck which is diesel. We are only paying \n     on one of these vehicles. Sad to say, but the 1995 diesel \n     truck is the one we are paying on, even though with the price \n     of diesel, it sits in the driveway, unless we have to haul \n     hay or cattle. We have our mortgage payment which is not \n     outrageous, $646 a month. With me expecting, my doctor's \n     appointments are over an hour away, about 100 miles plus \n     roundtrip once a month for right now. I am also the parts \n     pickup person for our farming operation. In the last week, I \n     have made 3 trips out of town for parts to different stores, \n     because not all of them carried the same parts. My brother \n     has been in and out of the hospital for cancer treatments to \n     get rid of a tumor that is otherwise inoperable. I have had \n     to help my mother out with his care as well, as he needs \n     someone with him 24/7. Living in a rural community as I do, \n     our grocery prices have been affected by fuel costs as well. \n     I pay $4 a gallon for milk, where elsewhere it is about \n     $3.00. Bread is about $3.00 a loaf, whereas elsewhere I have \n     purchased the same bread for $1.59 a loaf. Cheese is \n     currently a want and not a need at our house, with a 2 pound \n     loaf of cheese costing $10 where a year ago, it was $6.99. \n     Those are our main staples in our home, especially the milk \n     with two young kids at home ages 4 and 5. We could apply for \n     WIC, but then someone else has to foot the bill to feed our \n     family, and I was not raised that way. There is no money \n     leftover at the end of the month for savings for just in case \n     circumstances, which is very unsettling for me and my \n     husband.\n       The best thing that Congress can do is to allow more \n     options for drilling in the U.S., and quit depending on the \n     foreign oil. There are numerous opportunities in the United \n     States, which would create jobs, instead of sending them \n     across the border to Mexico, as well as force the price of \n     oil down. The other thing too, is if Congress would put the \n     control of prices back into the oil companies' hands, I feel \n     they would do a much better job at forcing the prices lower. \n     Our country is rich in abundance of oil, if Congress would \n     allow it. Why do you think that in Saudi Arabia, and Iraq \n     fuel prices have not affected their country! They have an \n     over abundance of oil. We have more than them, but yet we \n     aren't allowed to utilize it because of such ridiculous \n     restrictions Congress has imposed on companies. Which is \n     fueled by environmentalists who are still using more \n     energy than the average American family (Al Gore and his \n     followers). We would not be destroying anything by \n     drilling in these locations, obviously if we weren't meant \n     to have the oil that is there, the good Lord would not \n     have put it there for our responsible use!\n                                                     Tansy, Malad.\n       Because of the huge rise in gas prices it now costs me $90 \n     to fill up my gas tank not to mention my husband's van. We \n     now have no money for emergencies or any extras because of \n     the huge increase in the price of gas. It has hurt our income \n     a lot more than we had anticipated. I would suggest having \n     incentives for gas preservation and I appreciate everything \n     you plan on doing to help keep the cost of gas prices down. \n     You have my vote this year because you really care\n\n[[Page S785]]\n\n     What happens to the people of Idaho including finding ways to \n     keep gas prices from continuing to rise.\n       Keep up the good work, Senator.\n     Carla.\n                                  ____\n\n       I appreciate you asking for thoughts on energy. I believe \n     we need to embrace and pursue alternatives to oil. Honda \n     today unveiled a hydrogen powered car. What does Detroit \n     offer? Something that really galls me is that the U.S. gives \n     billions to countries that hate us, why? I am not a fan of \n     welfare, but every dollar going to the poor in this country \n     is spent here, how much of the money given to foreign \n     countries is spent here? I know it is not that simple.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the men and \nwomen of the Air Force Judge Advocate General's Corps on the occasion \nof its 60th anniversary. On January 25, 1949, under the authority of \nthe Air Force Military Justice Act, the Air Force issued General Order \n7 creating the Air Force Judge Advocate General's Department, later \nchanged to Judge Advocate General's Corps.\n  Since that time, the men and women of the Judge Advocate General's \nCorps have become the living embodiment of their guiding principles of \nwisdom, valor, and justice. They have provided countless commanders, \npolicymakers, and clients with the benefit of invaluable professional, \ncandid, and independent counsel. Further, they have done so while \nliving the core values of the Air Force: integrity, service before self \nand excellence in all they do.\n  The hallmark of their service to this great country is a profound \nrespect for, and adherence to, the rule of law. Their steadfast \ndedication to the rule of law allows the U.S. Air Force to conduct \nitself in the best traditions of America and retain the highest moral \nground.\n  The men and women who currently serve in the Judge Advocate General's \nCorps, and those that came before them, can be exceptionally proud of \ntheir service and the contributions they have made to our national \nsecurity. As a former active duty Judge Advocate and current reserve \nJudge Advocate, I am intensely proud of my association with the Judge \nAdvocate General's Corps. I am pleased to acknowledge this great \nachievement and congratulate the Corps for their service to this \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S785-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING SIVAD PRODUCTIONS, INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this week, our country celebrated \ntwo historic events. On Monday, we commemorated the life and \naccomplishments of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on what would have been \nhis 80th birthday. The following day, January 20, our Nation's first \nAfrican-American President, Barack Obama, was inaugurated on the west \nfront of the U.S. Capitol. During this special and remarkable week, I \nrise to celebrate an African-American owned small business in my home \nState of Maine that has consistently sought to make a difference in \npeople's lives, and has succeeded every step of the way.\n  Sivad Productions, Inc., located in Portland, offers its clients a \nwide variety of general contracting services. From administrative \nservices and video production, to real estate and information \ntechnology, Sivad provides customers with superior quality and years of \nknowledge and experience. In March of 2008, Sivad Productions was named \na Small Business Administration certified 8(a) firm. The 8(a) program \nis a business development tool that assists small disadvantaged \nbusinesses to compete in the Federal marketplace by helping them gain a \nmyriad of procurement opportunities.\n  One of the most innovative projects that Sivad Productions' \npresident, Dudley Davis, has been a part of is the Youth News & \nEntertainment Television, or YNETV. YNETV produces youth programming, \nand involves young adults in the process of producing, directing, and \ncreating the shows. In nearly a decade and a half, students of high \nschool and college age have created over 600 television episodes seen \non many of the Maine affiliate stations of major networks.\n  Of YNETV's television shows, its most popular is Youth in Politics. \nArea high school and college students from across Maine debate the \npressing issues facing Maine and America by engaging in thoughtful and \nsubstantive discussions and hosting candidate forums. The show's goal \nis the civic education and wider political participation of Maine's \nyoung adults. YNETV frequently features an equal number of college \nDemocrats and college Republicans to provide balance, and deals with \nissues as varied as the war in Iraq to academic freedom.\n  Mr. Davis has forged a reputation as someone who has contributed \nimmensely to the betterment of the community in southern Maine. He has \nlong been associated with the YES! Summer Basketball League and The \nBasketball Academy, which seek to provide young athletes with an outlet \nto participate in sports in a positive environment. Parents and \nstudents alike have praised Mr. Davis's ``exceptional ability to \ninspire, motivate and teach,'' and commended his admirable \ncontributions to Maine's children. Mr. Davis has also been honored by \nthe Maine Commission for Community Service for his motivated and \nexceptional service to Maine youth programs.\n  President Obama has made a passionate and eloquent plea for increased \ncommunity service on the part of all Americans. It is a call that \nDudley Davis heard long ago.

Mr. Kohl, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 301. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for transparency in the relationship between physicians and \nmanufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies for \nwhich payment is made under Medicare, Medicaid, or SCHIP; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill today. Over \nthe past several years, I have worked to establish greater transparency \nin the financial relationships and financial disclosure requirements \nbetween physicians and manufacturers of drugs, of biologics, and \nmedical devices.\n  In the last Congress, the 110th, Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin and I \nintroduced what is entitled the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which \nis intended to bring some much-needed transparency to these \nrelationships between physicians and manufacturers.\n  To explain why this bill is so important, let me point to a number of \ninvestigations I have conducted in the depth and scope of these \nrelationships between physicians on the one hand, and manufacturers of \ndrugs, biologics, and medical devices on the other hand.\n  My findings to date are troubling and reveal significant undisclosed \nfinancial ties between physicians and industry. Some examples: These \nrelationships, at times, resulted in annual incomes of over $1 million \nto individual physicians from just one company.\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\n  Another example. My investigations determined that several prominent \nphysicians at major universities had failed to disclose large sums of \nmoney to their research institutions. That was despite institutional as \nwell as Federal requirements that these reportings take place.\n  This was also despite these physicians' involvement with Federal \nresearch study products made by the various drugmakers with whom they \nhave financial relationships.\n  This Federal research has involved billions of dollars in taxpayers' \nmoney to fund this research.\n  My oversight has confirmed the need for a consistent, easy-to-\nunderstand national system of disclosure, as opposed to a patchwork of \ndisclosure requirements at State and institutional levels, although I \ncompliment States that have such laws on the books.\n  Today I am here to introduce, along with Senator Kohl, the Physician \nPayment Sunshine Act of 2009. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act would \nrequire that manufacturers of drugs, biologics, and medical devices \ndisclose, on an annual basis, any financial relationships that they \nhave with physicians. That information would be posted online by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services in a format that is searchable, \nthat would be clear and easy for the public to understand.\n  Whether the relationship is as simple as buying a doctor's dinner or \nas complex as a multimillion-dollar consulting arrangement, these \nrelationships may affect prescribing practices and may influence \nresearch.\n  More importantly, they can obscure the most important issue existing \nbetween doctors and patients, and that is a question every doctor and \npatient has to consider: What is best for the patient?\n  This legislation Senator Kohl and I are introducing today closely \nparallels the version I circulated last year and follows some recent \nMedPAC recommendations.\n  MedPAC recommended a lower annual reporting threshold of $100--in the \nprevious bill, it was higher--no de minimis exceptions for payments and \na tighter preemption provision.\n  MedPAC will publish their final recommendations in their March report \nto Congress. I will take those recommendations into consideration and \nintend to continue pursuing policies that go beyond the transparency in \nhealth care than even the existing bill does.\n  There is a greater need for this legislation, and that greater need \nis demonstrated by a witness testifying at the Finance Committee \nhearing on health reform last year that industry and physician \nrelationships are pervasive.\n  Drug and device companies spend billions and billions every year on \nmarketing, product development, and research, and much of this money \ngoes directly to doctors.\n  Last year, the Des Moines Register wrote:\n\n       Your doctor's hand may be in the till of a drug company. So \n     how can you know whether the prescription he or she writes is \n     in your interest or the best interest of a drug company?\n\n  That is a pretty good question that we all ought to be looking at.\n  Many of these relationships are beneficial and appropriate. That is \nwhy we don't outlaw any of these relationships. What we do is make them \nbe reported. And some of these should be reported on a more regular \nbasis than they are even without this legislation.\n  Physicians play important roles in inventing and refining new devices \nor in conducting medical research. They are hired to educate other \ndoctors. We don't do anything in this legislation to end those \nprofessional relationships.\n  But as is often the case, a few bad apples can spoil the whole \nbarrel. It is clear Congress needs to act now to pass disclosure \nlegislation.\n  Currently, drug and device makers have to comply with a number of \nState requirements, each State giving its own definition and own rules.\n  Patients as well as other doctors have no way to learn about these \nimportant relationships. This information should not only be available \nto those few Americans lucky enough to live in a State already \nrequiring some level of disclosure.\n  Even in the States currently requiring disclosure, most do not apply \nthat law to medical device companies. Some States do not even make \npublic the information they collect, which is of little value to \npatients who might want to know if their doctors have a relationship \nwith a drug company or a medical device company about which they ought \nto know.\n  Now, this bill isn't adding new burdens to the industry. By creating \na central reporting system, the legislation actually relieves burdens. \nIn addition, I am hopeful that this bill will enjoy the same wide-\nranging support as the prior legislation that Senator Kohl and I put in \nduring the 110th Congress.\n  I want to be clear--and this is the second time I am being clear on \nthis point--this legislation does not regulate the business of drug and \ndevice companies. Let the people in industry do their business since \nthey have the training and the skills to get the job done. But keep the \nAmerican people apprised of the business you are doing and how you are \ndoing it. After all, what is at risk isn't merely private interest but \nthe health and well-being of all Americans who depend upon the drugs \nand medical devices to sustain and to improve their lives.\n  In this process of what we call transparency, in this process that we \ncall sunshine legislation, I often quote from an opinion of Justice \nBrandeis, I think in 1914, where he said: ``Sunlight is the best \ndisinfectant.'' And that is what Senator Kohl and I are aiming to \naccomplish with this Physician Payment Sunshine Act, just a little \nsunlight so the public is better informed.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Physician \nPayments Sunshine Act, along with my colleague Senator Grassley. This \nlegislation will be a great step forward in increasing transparency of \nthe relationships between pharmaceutical and medical device companies \nand our Nation's physicians, for the benefit of their patients.\n  I want to begin by underscoring the fact that industry payments to \nphysicians for research purposes or products they have helped develop \nare completely legitimate. Medical breakthroughs as a result of \nresearch have saved countless lives and could not have been achieved \nwithout the diligence of these me cal professionals. We must \nacknowledge, however, that conflicts of interest do exist in some \ncases. Transparency will help to illuminate the difference between \nlegitimate and questionable relationships.\n  It has been estimated that the drug industry spends $19 billion \nannually on marketing to physicians in the form of gifts, lunches, drug \nsamples and sponsorship of education programs. Americans pay the price \nas through unnecessarily high drug costs and skyrocketing health \ninsurance premiums. Rising drug prices hurt us all by undermining our \nprivate and public health systems, including Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Even more alarming is the notion that these gifts and payments can \ncompromise physicians' medical judgment by putting their financial \ninterest ahead of the welfare of their patients. Recent studies show \nthat the more doctors interact with drug marketers, the more likely \ndoctors are to prescribe the expensive new drug that is being marketed \nto them.\n  As a businessman, I understand that companies have the right to spend \nas much as they choose to promote their products. But as the largest \npayer of prescription drug costs, the Federal Government has an \nobligation to examine and take action when companies attempt to \nmanipulate the market.\n  I believe the Physician Payments Sunshine Act presents a long overdue \nsolution to combat this potentially harmful influence. The legislation \nwould require manufacturers of pharmaceutical drugs, devices and \nbiologics to disclose the amount of money they give to doctors through \npayments, gifts, honoraria, travel and other means. These disclosures \nwould be registered in a national, publicly accessible online database, \nmanaged by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Those \ncompanies who fail to report will be subject to financial penalty.\n  In the year and a half since the Sunshine bill was first introduced, \nseveral States have passed their own laws forcing disclosure, and \nseveral leading pharmaceutical companies have voluntarily implemented \ndisclosure guidelines. A comprehensive national bill would create a \none-stop information\n\n[[Page S789]]\n\nvault, here patients could easily gain access to data about these \nrelationships. It is my hope that this online database will encourage \npatients to discuss any concerns they may have with their doctors.\n  A great deal of money changes hands in the health care field, and a \ngood percentage of it is helping Americans live healthier lives. The \nPhysician Payments Sunshine Act will provide the transparency necessary \nto raise that percentage. We deserve nothing less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 303. A bill to reauthorize and improve the Federal Financial \nAssistance Management Improvement Act of 1999; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nFinancial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 2009 with Senator \nLieberman and Senator Carper.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1999, I introduced the Federal Financial \nAssistance Management Improvement Act of 1999 with Senators Lieberman, \nThompson and Durbin because as a former mayor and governor, I had seen \nfirst-hand the problems and complications that existed in the federal \ngrant making process.\n  Congress enacted our legislation to improve the effectiveness and \nperformance of Federal financial assistance programs, simplify Federal \nfinancial assistance application and reporting requirements, improve \nthe delivery of services to the public and coordinate the delivery of \nthose services, and progress was made under the law, which is commonly \nknown as ``P.L. 106-107.'' A 2005 Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, report noted that ``[m]ore than 5 years after passage of P.L. 106-\n107, cross-agency work groups have made some progress in streamlining \naspects of the early phases of the grants life cycle and in some \nspecific \naspects of overall grants management . . . .'' However, GAO also noted \nthat work remained to be done and in 2006 suggested that Congress \nconsider reauthorizing the Federal Financial Assistance Management \nImprovement Act of 1999, which expired in 2007.\n  I believe that Congress should heed GAO's advice and reauthorize this \nimportant law, so last year I introduced S. 3341 with Senator Lieberman \nto reauthorize the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement \nAct and make improvements to that Act based on the 2005 and 2006 \nrecommendations of GAO. The bill passed the Senate in September 2008.\n  Today we are reintroducing that legislation, which requires the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, to improve the \ngrants.gov website or develop another public website that allows grant \napplicants to search and apply for grants, report on the use of grants, \nand provide required certifications and assurances for grants. I \nbelieve such a website will enhance the transparency required by the \nFederal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act that Congress \nenacted in 2007.\n  The bill also requires the Director of OMB to develop a strategic \nplan for an end-to-end electronic capability for non-Federal entities \nto manage the Federal financial assistance they receive and requires \neach Federal agency to plan actions to implement that strategic plan. \nEach federal agency would be required to report to OMB on progress made \nin achieving its objectives under the OMB strategic plan, and the \nDirector of OMB would be required to report to Congress biennially on \nprogress made in implementing the Federal Financial Assistance \nManagement Improvement Act.\n  In 1999 I said the Federal Financial Assistance Management \nImprovement Act was an important step toward detangling the web of \nduplicative Federal grants available to States, localities and \ncommunity organizations. Last year I said that while some progress was \nmade under that law to detangle the web, work remained to be done. I \nhope that Congress will quickly reauthorize this law so that OMB and \nFederal agencies continue their efforts to simplify and streamline the \nFederal grant process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 303\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Financial Assistance \n     Management Improvement Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nstimulate business investment, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation called \nthe Main Street Recovery Act to boost business investment and help \njumpstart the ailing U.S. economy. We are facing our most serious \nfinancial challenge since the Great Depression and we must respond \naggressively. Our financial services sector is in shambles and other \nbusiness sectors are suffering.\n  Employers have been slashing jobs at an alarming rate--including 2.6 \nmillion jobs last year--to reduce operating costs. Some economists are \npredicting that the unemployment rate could jump to 10-percent or more \nthis year in many parts of the country.\n  The manufacturing and construction sectors have been particularly \nhard hit during this downturn. The manufacturing sector laid off \n791,000 workers in 2008. The unemployment rate among construction \nworkers in December was 15.3 percent, eight percentage points higher \nthan for the economy as a whole. More than 1.4 million experienced \nconstruction workers are currently unemployed.\n  I believe immediate action is needed to prevent our economy from \nsliding into a deeper recession that would lead to more bankrupt \nbusinesses and massive layoffs of workers across the country. That is \nwhy I will support a stimulus program that will create jobs by \ninvesting in infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, water \nprojects and more.\n  But I also think we need to provide some targeted tax incentives to \nencourage the business community to consider making capital investments \neven during the economic slowdown. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday includes the following tax incentives that I believe can \nstimulate business investment: a temporary 15-percent investment tax \ncredit. To encourage manufacturers and producers not to wait on making \ncrucial equipment and machinery purchases, we should give them every \nincentive to make these purchases now or in the near future when these \ninvestments will most benefit the economy.\n  We can accomplish this by offering a temporary, 15-percent tax credit \nthrough June 30, 2010 for businesses that purchase new equipment and \nmachinery that is used as an integral part of manufacturing or \nproduction. Investment tax credits have been proven to work and will \nhelp generate growth and jobs in the nation's manufacturing and \nconstruction sectors.\n  Enhanced 50-percent bonus depreciation. To promote business \ninvestment now, when the economy needs it most,\n\n[[Page S791]]\n\nwe should extend the expiring 50-percent bonus depreciation for \neligible assets placed in service over the next 18 months. This will \nhelp businesses make capital investments during the economic downturn \nby allowing businesses to write-off a larger share of their eligible \nbusiness investments more quickly from their federal income taxes.\n  Increased $250,000 small business expensing. To help small businesses \nbuy the equipment and machinery they need to weather this economic \nstorm and begin to grow again, we should extend the expiring expensing \nprovision that allows small businesses to expense, i.e. immediately \ndeduct, up to $250,000 of their equipment and machinery purchases over \nthe next year and a half.\n  In addition, there are many business owners that do not require new \nequipment or machinery but instead want to build a new business--maybe \na restaurant, perhaps a retail shop or make interior and other \nimprovements to such properties. Expanding the bonus depreciation and \nsmall business expensing provisions outlined above to cover investments \nin commercial real property will help provide business owners with the \nfinancial assistance they need to build that building or make long \noverdue improvements.\n  I am very pleased to have the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nand the National Restaurant Association for my proposals as part of a \nrobust economic stimulus package.\n  The Senate is working on a large economic recovery package and I am \noptimistic that the package will include these important provisions. I \nam told that the Senate Finance Committee plans to mark up the tax \nportion of this package next week, and I am pleased that Chairman \nBaucus has recognized the need to help our Main Street businesses. In \nmy judgment, including the tax incentives I have proposed will help \nstimulate much-needed economic activity and get our economy growing and \ncreating jobs once again.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 307. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide flexibility in the manner in which beds are counted for \npurposes of determining whether a hospital may be designated as a \ncritical access hospital under the Medicare program and to exempt from \nthe critical access hospital inpatient bed limitation the number of \nbeds provided for certain veterans; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleague Senator Mike Crapo, to introduce this important piece of \nlegislation for America's rural hospitals. I first introduced this \nlegislation in 2007 with Senator Smith, and I am proud to continue our \nfight for rural hospitals in this Congress. Today, my fellow Oregonian, \nRepresentative Greg Walden, is introducing this same bill in the House \nof Representatives.\n  The Medicare program is turning rural communities into ``health care \nsacrifice'' zones. Under current law, critical access hospitals either \nhave to risk their financial viability or their patient's health if a \n26th patient walks in their door. Rural hospitals need greater \nflexibility from the Medicare program to fulfill their obligations to \ntheir communities--especially, but not limited to, their veterans--in \ntimes of public health emergencies.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 merged a Montana initiative, the \nmedical assistance facility demonstration, and the Rural Primary Care \nHospital program into a new category of hospitals called critical \naccess hospitals CAH. By design, the Critical Access Hospital program \nin Medicare ensures that rural communities have access to acute care \nand emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  In order to obtain this designation, hospitals must meet certain \nrequirements, such as being located more than 35 miles from any other \nhospital, or receiving certification by the state to be a ``necessary \nprovider.'' Critical access hospitals must also provide 24-hour \nemergency care services.\n  As a designated critical access hospital, Medicare pays these \nhospitals based on its reported costs. Each critical access hospital \nreceives 101 percent of its costs for outpatient, inpatient, \nlaboratory, and therapy services. There are nearly 1,300 hospitals \nacross the United States in 47 states that operate under a critical \naccess hospital designation. Twenty-five of them are in Oregon.\n  One requirement of this program is that there be no more than 25 beds \noccupied by patients at any one time. This requirement has proven to be \ntoo constricting for facilities during times of unexpected need, such \nas during an influenza outbreak or an influx of tourism to the \ncommunity.\n  Critical access hospital administrators in Oregon, especially Dennis \nBurke from Good Shepherd Medical Center in Hermiston and Jim Mattes at \nGrande Ronde Hospital in LaGrande, have expressed to me how this \nrestriction has lead to unnecessary risks to patient safety and health. \nHospital administrators have been forced to divert the 26th and 27th \npatient in their hospitals to a hospital much farther from their homes \nand families.\n  This legislation makes two important changes to the Medicare Critical \nAccess Hospital Program. First, this bill will provide the flexibility \nnecessary for a critical access hospital to either choose to meet \neither the 25-bed-per-day limit or work with a limit of 20-beds-per-day \naveraged throughout the year. During times of spikes in public health \nneed, these hospitals would be able to care for more patients even if \nthe hospital would exceed the use of 25 beds.\n  Second, this bill exempts beds used by veterans whose care is paid \nfor or coordinated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, from \ncounting against the 25-bed limit or 20-bed yearly average. This change \ngives CAHs the flexibility they need to treat America's military \nveterans at a time when the VA has divested in hospital care for our \nrural veterans, forcing them into these already tightly restricted \ncommunity hospitals.\n  This bill also ensures that these hospitals are meeting the \nrequirements under the law without breaking the bank. This new yearly \naverage of 20 beds is set lower than the daily limit, 25 beds, to \nensure that Medicare does not inappropriately expand this program. For \nexample, Grande Ronde Hospital would save Medicare an average of \n$100,000 each year for ambulance transfers of Medicare/Medicaid \npatients, all of whom could be treated within their facility had it \nbeen able to be flexible on counting bed days.\n  I believe that these simple changes in the current law are critically \nimportant to keeping our rural hospitals open and their communities' \nhealth care needs served. As we look to expand access to health \ncoverage, this bill will ensure that the nearly 1,300 critical access \nhospitals in the country have the flexibility they need to remain open \nfor the millions of Americans who depend on them.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill, and I look \nforward to working with Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley and \nother members of the Finance Committee to secure passage of this \nimportant bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 307\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today we are considering the nomination of \nMr. Shaun Donovan, Commissioner of the New York City Department of \nHousing Preservation and Development to become the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, HUD.\n  Mr. Donovan, has been nominated for a job fraught with significant \nchallenges yet, for that very reason, imbued with great opportunities.\n  For the past 3 or 4 years, the country has been facing a growing \nhousing\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\nproblem that had its origins in the scourge of predatory lending that \nhas resulted in record high foreclosure rates.\n  This housing crisis has been a primary cause of the deepening \nrecession to which none of us are immune. Across the country, between \n9,000 and 10,000 homeowners face foreclosure every day. Foreclosures in \nmy State were up over 71 percent since last year, and it is expected \nthat we will have more than 13,000 subprime foreclosures in the next \ntwo years. Nationwide, cities such as Bridgeport, which had \ninordinately high rates of subprime loans, are struggling to keep \nthemselves afloat as those loans reset one-by-one and families find \nthemselves with nowhere to turn.\n  I recently met with leaders in my State where I heard about the toll \nthis crisis is taking on our minority communities. Some say this crisis \nwill result in a net loss in homeownership rates for African Americans, \nwiping out a generation of wealth, gains and opportunities.\n  But let there be no doubt that this crisis today affects every \nAmerican in one way or another. In all, by some counts, we can expect \nsome 8 million homes to go into foreclosure absent some form of \nadditional action.\n  Unfortunately, the previous administration was slow to acknowledge \nthe housing problem, and when it finally did, timid in its response. \nEven as we witnessed foreclosures tear apart neighborhoods and wreak \nhavoc upon our economy, the Administration refused to use the authority \nor funds we gave it in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act to \ntackle the foreclosure crisis head on--despite the Congress's crystal \nclear intent in writing that law.\n  Surprisingly--and unfortunately, in my opinion--HUD has not played a \ncentral role in addressing the housing crisis. Frankly, it has been, to \nquote National Journal, ``at best, a second string player . . .'' \nfollowing in the wake of other government departments with far less \nexpertise in housing than the professionals at HUD (January 10, 2009).\n  Indeed, as the cover page of CQ Weekly says, ``The housing crisis \nremains at the core of the economy's woes . . .'' (January 12, 2009).\n  Put simply, we cannot address our economic crisis until we address \nthe underlying housing crisis.\n  And to do that, we need an active, aggressive, and well-run HUD with \nleadership that is confident in its mission and unafraid to act. As \nPresident Obama has himself said, ``HUD's role has never been more \nimportant.''\n  Unfortunately, HUD has been mismanaged and ridden with scandal in the \nlast several years. Let me be clear that these problems did not arise \nunder the able leadership of our colleague, then-Secretary Martinez. I \nwould also say that in recent weeks, Secretary Preston has made some \nimprovements.\n  But fundamentally, HUD has been left adrift at a time when bold \nleadership and a clear direction were never more important.\n  Just a week or two ago, we learned about the Wrights--a middle-class \nfamily in Windsor, Connecticut in danger of losing their home. Like \nthousands of families across the country, the Wrights were lured into a \nmortgage they were assured they could afford but couldn't--not because \nthey acted irresponsibly but because they became pregnant with their \nsecond child, and Mrs. Wright ran out of the paid sick time she was \nafforded as a teacher.\n  This is the kind of story being repeated in every community across \nAmerica today. With the right leadership, I believe HUD can be an \neffective partner in helping families like the Wrights. That is the \nopportunity Mr. Donovan has--to restore HUD as a leading voice in \naddressing the crisis facing our country today.\n  I would say to my colleagues that Mr. Donovan is the most experienced \nnominee for HUD secretary that Senate has considered in my long \nexperience. In addition to his degrees in architecture and public \nadministration from Harvard, Mr. Donovan has run the multifamily \nprogram at the Federal Housing Administration and was, for a time, the \nActing Housing Commissioner. He has worked in the private nonprofit \nsector as a housing developer and he has worked as a managing director \nof a large, multi-family mortgage company.\n  Since 2004, Mr. Donovan has been the commissioner of New York City's \nDepartment of Housing Preservation and Development. In that role, he \nmanaged 2,800 employees and helped develop and manage Mayor Bloomberg's \n``New Housing Marketplace Plan,'' one of the most ambitious local \nhousing plans in the nation. The $7.5 billion plan calls for the \ncreation or preservation of 165,000 units of affordable housing, about \nhalf of which has been accomplished to date.\n  Beyond the statistics and the numbers that so dramatically underscore \nMr. Donovan's accomplishments, I want to welcome him for the kind of \nleadership and vision I am confident he will bring to the Department at \na time when such leadership is needed so desperately.\n  For example, as early as 2004, long before most of the rest of the \ncountry was focused on the subprime crisis and the foreclosures they \nwould lead to, Mr. Donovan told a Newsday reporter that he was worried \nabout the coming ``flood of foreclosures'' and the impact it would have \non homeowners and neighborhoods.\n  Mr. Donovan sees the role of HUD as being more than a caretaker for \nphysical housing structures, or as a mortgage insurance company. He \nunderstands the danger of stove-piping within this arena, and sees HUD \nas the Federal Government's primary tool to help build communities--an \nagency that helps to provide housing opportunities for homeowners and \nfor renters along a spectrum of incomes and ages. He understands the \nneed to coordinate housing with transportation, including public \ntransportation and transit, to improve access to jobs and other \neconomic opportunities--and we need someone with that vision at the \nhelm.\n  Finally, Mr. Donovan is a man of the utmost integrity who has shown a \nproven ability to work constructively with all interested parties. His \nnomination is being supported, enthusiastically, I want to add, by a \nwide variety of housing groups, from the Realtors, to the Homebuilders, \nto the Low Income Housing Coalition, to many nonprofit organizations \nand many, many others.\n  I want to express my thanks to Mr. Donovan for the leadership he will \nbring to this critically important department and, more importantly, \nthe hope he will offer to millions of families at this uncertain \nmoment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Mr. Donovan to be \nSecretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n\n                     CONFIRMATION OF RAYMOND LAHOOD\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I come to the Floor today as the \nranking member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation \nCommittee in support of the nomination of Raymond LaHood to be the 16th \nSecretary of Transportation.\n  As a former 7-term Member of Congress representing the 18th District \nof Illinois, and a former member of the House committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, Congressman LaHood is well-qualified \nfor this position.\n  This week, the Commerce Committee held a full committee hearing to \nconsider his nomination. To Congressman LaHood's credit, and with the \ncooperation of Chairman Rockefeller, our committee quickly discharged \nhis nomination in order to fill this important Cabinet position.\n  I am pleased that our committee moved expeditiously on Congressman \nLaHood's nomination and I am hopeful the full Senate will move just as \nquickly.\n  As my colleagues know, the range of problems confronting the new \nSecretary of Transportation are amongst the most difficult that any new \ndepartment leader has faced in quite some time.\n  In a few short months, important policy, budgetary and regulatory \ndecisions will need to be made on several transportation and \ninfrastructure issues. I am confident that Congressman LaHood is up to \nthe task and will hit the ground running.\n  As my colleagues know, the existing highway program expires at the \nend of September. Until then, Congress and the new administration will \nhave to work very hard on a reauthorization. This will be a very \ndifficult process due\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\nto the current fiscal state of the highway trust fund and because of \nthe current formula's disparate treatment between the States.\n  In addition, we desperately need to create stability in our aviation \ninfrastructure programs by passing a full fiscal year 2009 FAA \nextension, along with completing a multiyear FAA Authorization bill. I \nhave encouraged Representative LaHood to support a full fiscal year \nextension of the current FAA Reauthorization bill, through September \n30, 2009, along with committing to work with him on a new FAA \nAuthorization bill.\n  Without congressional and administration cooperation, the FAA's plan \nto modernize our air traffic control system--known as NextGen--could \nsquander precious time and resources. Our Nation's skies and airports \nare severely congested; we need a Secretary in place immediately to \noversee and manage the funding, implementation, and transition to \nNextGen.\n  I am also confident the DOT will have a renewed focus and \nappreciation for our Nation's Amtrak and high speed rail system. This \nis an area we have neglected too long. While the Amtrak reauthorization \nthat was just signed into law was an important step, we need strong \nleadership at the Department to ensure that we have a national \npassenger rail system that works. Congressman LaHood is a strong \nadvocate for Amtrak and I look forward to working with him to implement \nthe priorities of that important legislation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support Representative Hood's \nnomination.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the nominations just confirmed was \nthat of Ray LaHood, former Congressman from the State of Illinois who, \nby this action, will become our next Secretary of Transportation in the \nObama Cabinet. It was my great honor to introduce Congressman LaHood to \nthe Senate Commerce Committee yesterday, along with former House \nRepublican Leader Bob Michel. I had asked President Obama to consider \nthis nomination because of my high regard for Ray LaHood, both \npersonally and politically.\n  We served together for many years. He has represented my hometown of \nSpringfield. Despite our clear partisan differences, we have become not \nonly fast friends but real allies. Ray LaHood is an extraordinary \nperson. Born and raised in Peoria, IL, he served as a schoolteacher \nbefore coming to work for Bob Michel in Washington, where he served as \nhis chief of staff. He then succeeded Bob Michel as a Congressman from \nthe district which had Peoria as its major city and proceeded to \nrepresent large portions of north central Illinois and most of the \nformer congressional district of former Congressman Abraham Lincoln.\n  Ray LaHood is a person whom I not only respect but like very much. \nHis word is good. He is a hard worker. He has the right values and \npolitics. When politics in Washington became so corrosive and divisive, \nRay LaHood led an effort in the House to establish dialogue between \nDemocrats and Republicans. When I have worked with him on issues such \nas the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, the future \nof the 183rd Air National Guard unit in Springfield's capital airport, \nand a variety of other issues, I have found him to be hardworking, \ndiligent, and committed to the public good.\n  I believe President Obama has made an extraordinarily good choice for \nSecretary of Transportation. It is a department which will be very busy \nbecause the new Recovery and Reinvestment Act understands that we need \nnew bridges, roads, airports, and mass transit so that America's \neconomy can get back on track and grow. Ray LaHood is a great person to \nbe heading up that department.\n  His wife Kathy and family were with him yesterday before the Commerce \nCommittee. They are a great group. He is very proud of his children and \nshould be. They have done extraordinarily good things in their lives as \nwell. I am glad we moved quickly on this nomination for Ray LaHood as \nSecretary of Transportation. I know he is probably following this \nproceeding, and I wish him the very best. I know he is going to be \nexceptional in his service not only to President Obama in the Cabinet \nbut also to the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/22/senate-section/article/S794-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S.
