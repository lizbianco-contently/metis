Mr. President, every Wednesday in a first floor office \nmeeting room there is a Prayer Breakfast. Members of the Jewish faith \nand Christian faith appear there and talk about their life experiences. \nToday was a tremendously stimulating day. Senator Ted Kaufman, from \nDelaware, made the presentation.\n  I bring that to the attention of the Senate for a number of reasons. \nOne is that Ted Kaufman has a stunning life story, not the least of \nwhich is starting in 1972, with a 29-year-old man named Joe Biden, who \nstood no chance of being elected in the State of Delaware, running \nagainst a man who had served in many different positions, including \nMember of the House of Representatives, Governor, and was a sitting \nSenator. But this young 29-year-old, with Ted Kaufman helping run his \ncampaign, was elected, surprising everyone.\n  As we know, Senator Biden, who had been recently elected--on top of \nthe world, barely old enough to serve constitutionally--after having \nbeen in the Senate for a little over a month, his wife and daughter \nwere killed and his two boys were badly injured. Ted Kaufman served \nwith him as a staffer until, I think, about 1995, when he went into the \nprivate sector and then came back as a Senator, appointed when Senator \nBiden was elevated to become Vice President.\n  But the most important part I wish to relate to the Senate is that he \nsaid, from the time he left here in 1995 until the day when he came \nback as a Senator, the civility that is now here was not in the Senate \nin 1995. He said the atmosphere here is so much better now than it was \nin 1995.\n  Everyone should appreciate what Ted Kaufman said. We have tried--\nPresident Obama has tried, I have tried--and I hope that has helped \ncivility here. We all have to understand, as Senator Kaufman indicated \nto the Members assembled there today, that there is a difference \nbetween Democrats and Republicans philosophically, but that doesn't \nmean they cannot work together as friends. He gave a couple examples of \nSenators on the floor debating and then walking off shaking hands.\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7218-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last month, I stood here and told everyone \nabout a young woman from Nevada named Alysia. She was born with a \nkidney disease, one she fought bravely her entire life. But lately \nthings have gotten worse. Similar to far too many Americans in recent \nmonths, Alysia lost her job. That has happened to far too many \nAmericans. When you lose your job, as we have learned, your health care \noften disappears also.\n  Alysia did what any of us would do in the same situation, she tried \nto get independent coverage so she could afford the surgery she needs \nto get better. Her doctors say surgery is imperative, but insurance \ncompanies say: No, you can't get insurance. They refused to cover her. \nThey call her kidney disease a preexisting condition--everyone else, \nincluding Alysia, calls it a tragedy.\n  She is not the only Nevadan who has written me about injustice. Caleb \nWolz is a high school student from Sparks, NV. Similar to so many kids, \nhe used to play, when he was younger, all kinds of games. But now he \njust sticks to skiing and rock climbing. You can forgive him for not \nplaying some of the games he doesn't play anymore. He was born without \nany legs. Caleb was born without legs.\n  As kids grow, they grow out of their shoes. A lot of kids probably \nget a new pair every year. But Caleb, who is now 17, has needed a new \npair of prosthetic legs every year since he was 5 years old.\n  You can probably guess what the story is now, and you have it right. \nHis insurance company has decided it knows better than his physicians \nand has decided that Caleb does not need legs that work and fit. Even \nafter looking at pictures of the bruises and abrasions Caleb suffered \nfrom the prosthetics that didn't fit, his insurance company decided, \nonce again, his preexisting condition is too expensive to deal with.\n\n  These stories are hard to hear, but they are not hard to come by. \nThey are extraordinary, but they are not unique. This happens to women \nall over southern Nevada just like Alysia and boys across northern \nNevada just like Caleb. It happens to people on the east coast and the \nwest coast. It happens to Americans in small towns and big cities. \nEvery day, insurance companies look at a patient's medical history and \nthe prescriptions they have filled. Then they deny them coverage or \ncharge them exorbitant rates because of the patient's age or a specific \nillness. For every 10 patients who try to get health care, 9 of them \nnever buy a plan because insurance companies deny them or make it too \nexpensive.\n  Most of us were not born with a kidney disease such as Alysia's or, \nunlike Caleb, we are born with both our legs. But unless you are in \nabsolutely perfect health, without a history of anything from heart \ndisease to high cholesterol or hay fever, in the insurance world you \nare out of luck. Some insurance companies even treat Caesarean sections \nas a preexisting condition, and some accuse women of scheduling \nunnecessary C-sections when they give birth. More than half of all \nAmericans live with at least one chronic condition, and those \nconditions cause 70 percent of the deaths in America. Yet right now, \ninsurance companies that care more about profits than about people are \nin complete control of their well-being. They are holding Americans \nhostage, and far too many of us cannot afford that ransom.\n  Reforming health care is a complex endeavor, but one part of the \nDemocrats' vision for health care is simple. We are going to give \npeople control over their own health. We are no longer going to let \ngreedy insurance companies use a patient's preexisting condition as an \nexcuse to deny them the care they need.\n  We will lower the high cost of health care. We will lower the cost of \nhealth care generally. We will make sure every American has access to \nthat quality, affordable care, and we will do our very best to make \nsure people still have the power to choose their own doctors, \nhospitals, and health plans.\n  If we leave it to private insurance companies that are more \ninterested in keeping their profits up than keeping us healthy, that \nwill not happen, nor will it happen if our Republican colleagues \ncontinue to defend the status quo. A few weeks ago, the Republican \nleader in the House of Representatives said the following:\n\n       I think we all understand that we have the best health care \n     system in the world.\n\n  How can one defend a health care system that goes out of its way not \nto care for people's health? And how can anyone celebrate such a system \nwith a straight face? That health care system told Alysia she can't get \nthe kidney surgery she needs. That health care system told Caleb he \ncan't get the legs he needs. I think they would respectfully disagree \nwith the Republican leader.\n  Insurance companies and most of our Republican colleagues seem to \nshare a common philosophy. They both reflexively and recklessly say no \nfor no good reason. That is a philosophy we cannot afford in America. \nIf you are fortunate enough to have coverage you like, you can keep it. \nBut if you don't like the fact that the insurance company can deny you \ncoverage when they feel like it, you will agree we need to change the \nway things are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7218-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I heard the majority leader talk about \ndenying care, and that is the issue before us--one of the major issues. \nThe vision of the Republicans is that there will not be someone in \nbetween a patient and a doctor who would get in the way of a treatment \nyou need or the care you need or have you stand in line or wait too \nlong. Our great fear is the Democratic proposal so far, in which we \nhave not had a chance to participate, would put the government between \nyou and the doctor and the government doing the rationing.\n  Republican proposals, such as those of Senator Gregg and Senator Burr \nand Senator Coburn and even the bipartisan proposal by Senator Wyden, a \nDemocrat, and Senator Bennett, a Republican--of which I am a cosponsor \nof all--envision a system where those of us, the 250 million of us who \nalready have health care insurance, would be permitted to keep it and \nthat we would find a way to reform the Tax Code to give to individuals \nwho do not have good health care the money they need to buy the health \ncare and to choose it for themselves. Our concern is, the Government \nmight become too much involved, and we might create a program that is \nfilled with more debt, on top of the debt we already have, that our \nchildren and grandchildren simply couldn't afford it.\n  Mr. McCain, the Senator from Arizona, has been, I guess, in more town \nmeetings about health care than any other American, at least any other \nAmerican who serves today in the Senate. He was in Texas last week and \nhome last week in Phoenix, at some of our leading institutions, to hear \nwhat people had to say about it.\n  I wonder if I could ask the Senator from Arizona if he heard concern \nfrom those in his home State of Arizona, or those at M.D. Anderson in \nTexas, about\n\n[[Page S7219]]\n\nthe government getting in between the patient and the doctor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if I could say, first of all, I would like \nto thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership on this issue. \nIt is a privilege to serve on the HELP Committee with him, and his \ncontinued involvement in the ongoing discussion and debate about one-\nsixth of America's gross national product has been vital.\n  I thank my friend from Tennessee. Could I also pick up on what the \nSenator was just saying, that the majority leader criticized the \nRepublican leader in the House who said America has the best health \ncare system in the world. What the Republican leader in the House was \nsaying was the obvious: America has the highest quality health care in \nthe world. And as the Senator from Tennessee just mentioned, I was in \nHouston at M.D. Anderson with Republican leaders, the Senator from \nKentucky and Senator Cornyn from Texas. There were people there from 90 \ncountries around the world--90 countries, most of them wealthy people \nwho could have gone anywhere in the world for health care.\n  But they went to the best place in the world, M.D. Anderson--one of \nthe best, I would argue. We have some facilities in Arizona and \nprobably in Tennessee that are of equal quality.\n  But is there any doubt, when people come from all over the world to \nthe United States of America, that the highest quality health care is \nnot in America? It is. The problem is, and I am afraid some of my \ncolleagues do not get it, it is not the quality of health care, it is \nthe affordability and the availability of health care.\n  Our effort has been to try to make health care affordable and \navailable. The latest proposal of the Democrats is that it only covers \n40 percent of the uninsured and costs trillions of dollars. So why not, \nI would ask my friend from Tennessee, why not let people go across \nState lines to get the insurance policy they want? Why could not a \ncitizen of Arizona who does not like the insurance policies that are \navailable there find one in Tennessee? Why not have meaningful \nmalpractice reform? We all know where 10, 15, 20 percent, sometimes, of \nhealth care costs come from. They come from the practice of defensive \nmedicine.\n  Everybody knows it. It is one of the elephants in the room. So, \ntherefore, we do not have--and consistently in the HELP Committee, \namendments that have been proposed by the Senator from Tennessee and me \nand others to reform medical malpractice have been voted down.\n  The State of California some years ago enacted meaningful and \nsignificant medical malpractice reform. Guess what. It has decreased \nhealth care costs. So we are not getting--and I say to my friend from \nTennessee, I hope he agrees that we are going at the wrong problem. The \nproblem is not the quality of health care. We want to keep the quality \nof health care. It is the cost and affordability of health care.\n  We have not gotten affordable and available health care for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I agree with my friend from Arizona. I think of the \npregnant women in rural counties in Tennessee who have to drive all the \nway to Memphis, or all the way to Nashville to get prenatal health care \nbecause there are no OB-GYN doctors after their medical malpractice \ncases have driven up their insurance. So there is no way for them to \nget health care.\n  If I am not mistaken, I listened to the majority leader talking about \nthe tragic case in Nevada of someone unable to get health care because \nof a preexisting condition. The Senator from Arizona knows all of the \nproposals. I believe all of the Republican proposals would say, \neveryone would be covered, that preexisting conditions would not \ndisqualify you.\n  The issue before us is whether we are going to address trillions to \nthe debt or put the government in between the patient and the doctor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I totally agree. Could I mention, since the Senator from \nTennessee and I are going up to another meeting in the HELP Committee, \nthe Roll Call article this morning says:\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday strongly urged \n     Finance Chairman Max Baucus to drop a proposal to tax health \n     benefits and stop chasing Republican votes on a massive \n     health care reform bill. Reid, whose leadership is considered \n     crucial if President Barack Obama is to deliver on his \n     promise of enacting health care reform this year, offered the \n     directive to Baucus through an intermediary after consulting \n     with Senate Democratic leaders during Tuesday morning's \n     regularly scheduled leadership meeting.\n\n  In other words, according to this article, any shred or semblance of \nbipartisanship is now out the window. So I think the Senator from \nTennessee would agree with me. One of the very disappointing aspects of \nthis whole debate is we have not changed the climate in Washington. Has \nthere ever been, to the Senator's knowledge, a call to sit down at a \ntable in a room with leading Republicans and Democrats and say: Hey, \ncan't we work this out? What is your proposal? Here is ours. Can't we \nsit down and agree to save health care in America and preserve its \nquality and make it affordable and available? Way back in the 1980s \nwhen Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill sat down together, they saved Social \nSecurity.\n  This is unfortunate that even the last shreds of attempts at \nbipartisanship are now gone. Now maybe it is because the 60th \nDemocratic vote was sworn in yesterday. Maybe they figured they had the \nvotes. Maybe they do. But anybody who alleges that this administration \nand the other side of the aisle are changing the climate in Washington, \nthat is simply false.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. There is probably no one in the Senate who has been in \nthe midst of bipartisan negotiations more times than the Senator from \nArizona. This is not just for the purpose of feeling good, it is the \nway to actually get a broad base of support for an energy bill or an \nimmigration bill or a Supreme Court nominee. Usually it involves, if I \nam not mistaken, sitting down with several members of each side and \ncoming to a consensus, sharing insurance ideas, fighting off the left \nand right and producing 60 or 70 votes. If I am not mistaken, that is \nthe way we do bipartisan bills around here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend, indeed. One of the issues I think we \nought to continue to understand is one of the key elements of this \ndebate is whether we will have the so-called government option. I know \nthe Senator from Tennessee is going to talk about that. I think it is \nimportant for us to look overseas at other countries that are highly \nindustrialized, highly sophisticated, strong economies, countries that \nhave government-run health care.\n  To say the government option would be just another competitor clearly \nis not the case; otherwise, we would just have 1,501 new insurance \ncompanies in America. If you had the government option, it will lead to \na government takeover of health care, and we ought to look at what \nother countries do.\n  I am sure the Senator from Tennessee knows this, but it is health \ncare rationing and a level of health care that will not be acceptable \nin the United States of America. I say that with great respect to our \nfriends in Canada, the British, and other countries that have \ngovernment-run health care systems. I think that is going to be one of \nthe two major issues: the government-run health care and the employee \nmandate. Those are what this health care debate will come down to.\n  It is of great concern, I know, to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona. I know he is on his \nway to work on the health care bill, to take the leadership, to the \nextent we can, in making it a better bill. I thank him for coming to \nthe floor to discuss that today, and to help us reemphasize that we do \nnot have any disagreement with our friends on the other side about the \nneed to reform health care. I do not think we have any disagreement. At \nleast we want to make sure our principal goal is to make health care \naffordable for every American. We want your family and you to be able \nto buy health insurance at a price you can afford and to take care of \ntragic cases such as the one the majority leader talked about. I think \nthere is a consensus on both sides of the aisle to make sure if you \nhave a preexisting condition you can be insured, and it will not matter \nwhere you live.\n  The Wyden-Bennett proposal, for example, and others, actually also \nsay that you may carry your insurance from one job to the other, so \nthat if you lose your job, or if you change\n\n[[Page S7220]]\n\nyour job, you still have your insurance because it is your insurance, \nand it does not just depend upon your employer.\n  What we are concerned about is the fact that President Obama's \nadministration has already proposed adding, over the next 10 years, \nmore new debt, three times as much new debt actually as was spent in \nall of World War II in today's dollars. That is the first thing.\n  The second thing is this idea of the so-called government option. \nSomeone says: What is so bad about that? Think of it this way. Let's \nsay you put some elephants and some mice in one room. You say: OK, \nfellows, compete. What do you think will happen? Pretty soon there are \nno mice left; they are all squished. You have a big elephant left. That \nis your only choice.\n  We have an example of that in the current Medicaid Program, which is \none of the worst government programs imaginable. There are 60 million \nAmericans stuffed in it, primarily because they are low income or \ndisabled. It is run jointly by the Federal Government and by the State \ngovernment. Every Governor--and this has been true for 25 years, from \nthe time I was Governor--has struggled with finding money to both fund \nthe State's share of it and still have money for higher education and \nfor other State needs.\n  It is filled with waste. The Congressional Budget Office says 1 out \nof every 10 taxpayer dollars that are spent for Medicaid is fraud, \nwaste, or abuse. That is $32 billion a year. That is $320 billion over \n10 years, enough to make a real dent in whatever we decide to do on \nhealth care.\n  Yet the Democratic proposals that we are seeing involve putting more \npeople into that government program. The problem for the taxpayer is \nhow expensive that is. I have a letter from the Congressional Budget \nOffice dated July 7 to Senator Gregg, the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: In response to your request, the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has considered the likely \n     effects on federal spending and health insurance coverage of \n     adding a substantial expansion of eligibility for Medicaid to \n     the Affordable Health Choices Act, a draft of which was \n     recently released by the Senate Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP). CBO's preliminary \n     analysis of that draft legislation was provided to Senator \n     Edward M. Kennedy on July 2, 2009; that analysis is available \n     on CBO's web site, www.cbo.gov.\n       The draft legislation would make a number of changes \n     regarding the financing and provision of health insurance, \n     including establishing insurance exchanges through which \n     coverage could be purchased and providing new federal \n     subsidies to help individuals and families with income \n     between 150 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty \n     level (FPL) pay for that coverage. Although the draft \n     legislation envisions that Medicaid would be expanded to \n     cover individuals and families with income below 150 percent \n     of the FPL, it does not include provisions to accomplish that \n     goal, and our preliminary analysis (conducted jointly with \n     the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation) did not reflect \n     such an expansion.\n       The precise effects on federal costs and insurance coverage \n     of adding an expansion of eligibility for Medicaid up to 150 \n     percent of the FPL would depend importantly on the specific \n     features of that expansion. For example, the effects would \n     depend on how eligibility for the program was determined and \n     on whether the expansion started immediately or only as the \n     proposed insurance exchanges went into operation. The effects \n     would also depend what share of the costs for newly eligible \n     people was borne by the federal government and what share was \n     borne by the states (which would be determined by the average \n     FMAP, or Federal Medical Assistance Percentage). In addition, \n     the effects would depend on whether states faced a \n     maintenance-of-effort requirement regarding their current \n     Medicaid programs.\n       CBO has not yet had time to produce a full estimate of the \n     cost of incorporating any specific Medicaid expansion in the \n     HELP committee's legislation. However, our preliminary \n     analysis indicates that such an expansion could increase \n     federal spending for Medicaid by an amount that could vary in \n     a broad range around $500 billion over 10 years, Along with \n     that increase in federal spending would come a substantial \n     increase in Medicaid enrollment, amounting to perhaps 15 \n     million to 20 million people. Such an expansion of Medicaid \n     would also have some impact on the number of people who \n     obtain coverage from other sources (including employers). All \n     told, the number of non-elderly people who would remain \n     uninsured would probably decline to somewhere between 15 \n     million and 20 million. (For comparison, CBO's analysis of \n     the draft legislation that was released by the HELP committee \n     found that, absent any expansion of Medicaid or other change \n     in the legislation, about 33 million people would ultimately \n     remain uninsured if it were to be enacted.)\n       Such an expansion of Medicaid would have some impact on \n     other aspects of the federal budget beyond Medicaid itself \n     (including tax revenues and the proposed payments to the \n     government by employers who do not offer coverage to their \n     workers, which the legislation labels ``equity \n     assessments''). Those additional effects might increase or \n     decrease the effect of the proposal on the federal deficit by \n     as much as $100 billion. It bears emphasizing that this \n     analysis is preliminary and the figures cited are approximate \n     because they do not reflect specific legislative language nor \n     do they incorporate, in detail, a variety of interactions and \n     other effects that changes in Medicaid would cause.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any \n     questions, please contact me or CBO's primary staff contacts \n     for this analysis, Philip Ellis and Holly Harvey.\n           Yours truly,\n                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That letter was from Douglas W. Elmendorf, the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office, with whom I am about to \nmeet, along with other members of the HELP Committee.\n  It says: The proposal envisions that Medicaid--that is the Democratic \nproposal--would be expanded to cover individuals and families with an \nincome below 150 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  That sounds good, but the draft legislation does not include \nprovisions to accomplish the goal. About three-quarters of the people \nwho would remain uninsured under this version of the legislation would \nhave income--in other words, even though we are spending trillions more \nunder this proposal, a lot of people are uninsured and three-quarters \nof them are going to be dumped into Medicaid. For the Federal \nGovernment, that is hundreds of billions of new dollars we would have \nto borrow, and the thought is over time it would be shifted to the \nStates. In the State of Tennessee, based upon conversations we have had \nwith the State Medicaid director, it might add an amount of money to \nthe State's annual budget that would be equal to the amount that a new \n10-percent State income tax would take.\n  That is not even the worst thing about it. The worst thing about it \nis what it would do to the low-income Americans who are stuffed into \nthe proposal. Some 40 percent of doctors will not see Medicaid patients \nfor all their services--40 percent of doctors. So we say: \nCongratulations, we are going to run up the Federal debt and add a big \nState tax, in order to stuff you into a proposal where 40 percent of \nthe doctors today will not see you. It is like giving out a ticket to a \nbus system that does not have any buses.\n  What is the alternative? The Republican proposals are completely \ndifferent. They focus first on the 250 million of us who already have \nhealth insurance to try to make sure it is affordable to us, that we \ncan afford it. Then we say let's take the money that is available and \ngive it to the low-income Americans and let them buy, choose, a private \nhealth insurance policy more like the policies most of us have. We \noffer this instead of stuffing them into the Medicaid proposals which \nare filled with inefficiencies, cannot be managed, and which many \ndoctors will not work with.\n  That is a better course forward. But, unfortunately, our voices are \nnot being heard on that subject. But we are going to continue to make \nour case. We have the Burr proposal, the Gregg proposal, the Coburn \nproposal, the Wyden-Bennett proposal. All are different from the \ngovernment option, and all do not run up the debt.\n  In fact, the Wyden-Bennett proposal, which is the only bipartisan \nproposal before this body today, with several Republican Senators and \nseveral Democratic Senators, adds zero to the debt according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Maybe as we go through, if we were seriously considering it, we would \nfind a need to add some costs. But at least we start with the idea that \ninstead of adding $1, $2, or $3 trillion over the next 10 years to the \nFederal deficit and\n\n[[Page S7221]]\n\ndumping a new program onto the States after a few years, which the \nStates in their bankrupt condition, in some cases, cannot afford, at \nleast we would start out with an increased deficit of zero.\n  We are almost working at the wrong end. Our biggest problem facing \nthe country is the cost of health insurance to every American, not just \nthe uninsured Americans but the 250 million who already have insurance. \nThe other big issue is the cost of government, caused by rising health \ncare costs, and we have gotten away from thinking of ways to bring that \nunder control. There are even proposals floating around to take \nsavings, to cut Medicare and Medicaid and use those dollars to help pay \nfor the Democratic plan.\n  If we reduce the growth of spending in Medicaid, we should spend it \non Medicare, which is increasing at a rate that is going to cause our \nchildren and grandchildren never to be able to pay off the national \ndebt.\n  Republicans stand ready to work with Democrats to produce health care \nreform this year, despite the majority leader's statement that it is \ntime for Senator Baucus to stop chasing Republican votes. We are glad \nhe is chasing Republican votes, and we hope he gets some. But the way \nwe do things around here usually is a group of 15 or 20 Senators, such \nas Senator McCain and others, sit around and say: OK, let's put our \nideas together and come up with a consensus bill, not to operate from a \nprocedure that we won the election, we have 60 votes, and we will write \nthe bill. It is more complicated than that. It needs a broad base of \nsupport in the Senate to have a broad base of support in the country. \nWithout that base of support, it will not be successful.\n  We have made our proposals--the Burr proposal, the Gregg proposal, \nthe Coburn proposal, the Wyden-Bennett proposal. Senator Hatch and \nSenator Cornyn have a slightly different idea that would give the money \nto the Governors and let them find a way to cover low-income \nindividuals. As a former Governor, I like that idea. We have an \nimaginative Democratic Governor in Tennessee who has brought the \nMedicaid Program there under some control and has come up with several \ninnovative ideas. The difficulty he and other Governors have is that it \ntakes them a year to get permission from Washington to try their \ninnovative ideas to offer the kind of health care to low-income \nindividuals they might need which could be different in Tennessee and \ndifferent in California.\n  This is the biggest issue before our country today. It is certainly \nthe biggest issue before Congress. Republicans have our proposals on \nthe table. We are ready to go to work. We want to make sure there are \nno preexisting conditions left out that disqualify people. We want to \nmake sure that everyone is covered and that we have access to health \ncare at a cost the family budget can afford. We are resolute in our \ndetermination not to add trillions more to the national debt and not to \ndump new debt on the States. We are resolute in our determination not \nto dump low-income people into a failing government program called \nMedicaid when a much better alternative is to give them the credits and \nthe vouchers and the cash so they can purchase private health insurance \nand have coverage more like the rest of Americans have.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the issues before the Senate are sometimes \nweighty and complex, historic. I don't think there is any greater \nchallenge this Senate has faced in modern times than our current debate \nover health care. This is such a major part of not only the American \neconomy but of our everyday lives that it is hard to think of another \nissue we have tackled which will be so far-reaching.\n  The American people understand the need for change when it comes to \nhealth care. Even if they have a health insurance policy today they \nvalue and trust, they are worried about tomorrow. The cost, the \navailability, being denied coverage for a preexisting condition, losing \na job and losing health insurance, a child who turns age 23 and all of \na sudden is on their own in the health insurance market--there is a lot \nof uncertainty we need to be serious about.\n  When we think about these issues, many times we put them in the \ncontext of Washington. In Washington, the issues are about the people \none might see in the corridors. They are lobbyists representing special \ninterest groups who can afford to send people to talk to Senators and \nCongressmen. They represent doctors and hospitals, health insurance \ncompanies, pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies. They all \nhave an interest in this debate because, quite honestly, it goes to the \nbottom line--whether or not they will be profitable. They, of course, \nwant to maximize their profits if they can.\n  But the people who are not in the corridors are the ones we ought to \nbe thinking about as well. These are average Americans who got up this \nmorning, and, if they were lucky enough, went to work. They will work \nhard all day, come home bone weary, trying to keep their family \ntogether, and get ready for another day tomorrow.\n  I think of a mother like Karen Gulva in my home State of Illinois. \nShe is a single mom with a 12-year-old boy with asthma.\n  I visited, about 10 years ago, the University of Chicago Children's \nHospital. The head physician there, the admitting physician at the \nhospital in the emergency room, said to me: Senator, what would you \nguess is the No. 1 diagnosis of kids going into emergency rooms in \nAmerica? And I said: Trauma? They fall off their bicycles and things \nlike that? He said: No. Asthma. Asthma is the No. 1 reason children are \nseen at emergency rooms across America.\n  Well, it surprised me because my family has been spared from that \nproblem. I started thinking a lot more about it. I came to the Senate \nhere and started talking to my colleagues. I went to Ted Kennedy--he \nsat back there in the back row--and I said: I am thinking about an \nasthma awareness effort. He said: Count me in. My son has asthma. Then \nI went across the aisle, at the time, and talked to Spencer Abraham, \nwho was a Republican Senator from Michigan. I said: Spencer, I was \nsurprised to learn about this asthma being the No. 1 reason kids go to \nemergency rooms. He said: I know all about it. I grew up with asthma. \nPat Moynihan, who sat in the back row here: Same story.\n  It dawned on me, even though it had not touched my life personally, \nit touched the lives of many people in this Chamber and a lot of \nAmerican families.\n  Karen Gulva has one of those families. The primary care physician for \nher 12-year-old son has prescribed daily doses of a lot of medications: \nSingulair, Allegra, and two different kinds of inhalers. Add these \nmedications to the Strattera he is already taking to regulate his ADD, \nand you can see that access to medication is essential in the day-to-\nday life of this typical active 12-year-old boy in my home State of \nIllinois.\n  There is more to Karen's story. Karen has a stable full-time job \nearning a salary of $31,000 a year plus benefits. She falls right into \nthe range of what we call middle-class working Americans. At first, \nKaren's health insurance premiums were affordable. They reduced her \npaycheck by $52.50 twice a month--$105 a month. However, costs for that \nhealth care have risen dramatically over the last few years. Karen is \nnow paying over $300 a month for her premiums alone.\n  Remember, she makes $31,000 a year gross. This does not include the \n$500 deductible or her share of the cost for office visits and \nprescriptions. The yearly cost of health care for Karen and her son is \nnow so great that it is hard for her to keep up with other payments she \nhas to make--just the basic necessities: food, gas for the car, and car\n\n[[Page S7222]]\n\npayments. She is barely scraping by. She refinanced her condo twice \nthis year to stay out of credit card debt.\n  She has tried everything to bring down her health care costs. She has \nlooked for other health insurance options in the private market, but \nbecause her son has what we call a preexisting condition, in this case \nasthma, she has been denied coverage.\n  Karen Gulva is not looking for a handout from this government. She \njust wants some help from the country she supports as a loyal tax-\npaying American citizen. All she wants is affordable health insurance. \nAll she wants is some peace of mind as a mom that her kid is going to \nhave what he needs to lead a normal life.\n  That is what the debate is about. It is about the uninsured--50 \nmillion people who do not have insurance--but it is also about Karen, a \nhard-working mom who has watched the cost of health insurance triple in \na short period of time and who worries about whether she can keep up \nwith it.\n  I have listened to a lot of debate coming from the other side of the \naisle, and I hope I am not misinterpreting it. But it seems for some on \nthe other side of the aisle they do not view this as a matter of \nurgency. They do not see this as an issue that requires our immediate, \nfull-scale attention.\n  I see it differently. I think this gets to the heart of why we are \nhere in the Senate. We are not here to stand on the floor and make \nspeeches. We are here to pass laws that make life better for America \nand give us a chance for a stronger Nation with stronger families in \nthe years to come. Sometimes we have to tackle some of the issues that \nare the hardest.\n  President Obama has told many of us privately and said publicly many \ntimes: If health care reform were easy, they would have done it a long \ntime ago. It is not easy. It is not easy because the current expensive \nsystem is rewarding people, unfortunately, for the wrong things.\n  I have referred on the floor before to an article in the New Yorker \nfrom June 1 by a doctor, Atul Gawande. It is titled ``The Cost \nConundrum.'' Dr. Gawande went to McAllen, TX, to figure out why in the \nworld in that small town the average spent on Medicare recipients was \n$15,000 a year--one of the highest in the Nation. He could not find a \nreason. This is not the situation where there is a disease there or \nelderly people are sicker.\n  What he found out was the doctors in that town were billing \neverything imaginable. They were throwing in tests and procedures, \npiling one on top of the other because they get paid more. The more \nthey do, the more they bill, the more they get paid.\n  One of the doctors said: Well, you know, it is defensive medicine. We \ncan get sued. And another doctor said: That is not the case at all. \nTexas has one of the tightest med mal laws in the Nation. It limits the \namount anybody could recover for a medical malpractice lawsuit, and \nthere are not many suits that are filed. No. The bottom line is, these \ndoctors have an incentive to bill more to the Medicare system because \nthey get paid more when that happens.\n  If you go to a place such as Rochester, MN, and the Mayo Clinic, \nwhere the doctors are on salary, and their goal is not to pile up the \nprocedures but to get the patient well, you will find the cost of \ntreating Medicare patients is dramatically less in Rochester, MN, than \nit is in McAllen, TX.\n  How do you create an incentive in our system for the right outcomes--\nhealthy people with quality care available to them--and reduce the \noverall cost? Our health care system spends twice as much per person \nthan any other nation on Earth. Our results do not show why that money \nis being spent. They do not prove that is working to make us a safer, \nhealthier nation.\n  So now the argument on the other side is that we have to be careful \nbecause we might end up with a public option; that is, a health \ninsurance plan as an option that Americans can choose that might be \ngovernment sponsored. I do not think that is wrong. In fact, I think \nthat is healthy. It is important the private health insurance companies \nwho now rule the roost have competition--somebody keeping an eye on \nthem to make sure they treat people fairly. I think a public plan that \ndoes not have a profit motive, that does not worry about marketing, and \ndoes not have high administrative costs could be that plan, that \ncompetitive option that keeps the private health insurance companies \nhonest.\n  Many on the other side have stood up and said: Government health \ninsurance plans are a bad idea. Really? Forty-five million Americans \nare under Medicare today--elderly, disabled Americans covered by \nMedicare. I have not heard a single person on the other side of the \naisle say: Let's get rid of Medicare. It is a bad idea. And you will \nnot hear that because it is a good idea, and it works. There are \nanother 60 million who are covered by Medicaid, our health insurance \nfor the poor. I have not heard any suggestions from the other side of \nthe aisle of eliminating Medicaid.\n  So 105 million Americans, one-third of our population, are currently \ninsured through a government plan. I think it is a healthy thing. As \nlong as the government plan we are talking about is trying to bring \ncosts down and expand coverage so everybody has the benefit of health \ninsurance, then I think it is a good thing to build into this system.\n  So the debate will continue, as it should, at the highest levels now. \nBut there is one option we cannot accept, and that is the option of \nstalemate and the option of failure. I do not know I will ever have \nanother moment in time in my public career to seriously take on the \nhealth care reform issue. The last time was 15 years ago under \nPresident Clinton.\n  We have to seize this opportunity. We are lucky to have a President \nwho has stated to many of us and many of the leaders in Congress that \nthis is a priority he is willing to fight for. Even at the expense of \nhis political popularity he wants to get this job done. That is the \nkind of leadership this country needs on an issue that is critically \nimportant to every single person, every family, every business, and, \nfrankly, to the economic future of our Nation.\n  I encourage my colleagues: Try to find that common ground, try to \nbring together a bipartisan approach here, some compromise on both \nsides that comes up with the best approach. Let's bring in those \nmedical professionals who can help us get to a good place. Let's give \npeace of mind to Karen Gulva and so many others around America who \nworry every single day about coverage for their kids and for the people \nthey love.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7222-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7222-S7224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss, \nfirst of all, the pending nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  Judge Sotomayor comes to this nomination with impeccable credentials: \nsumma cum laude at Princeton; Yale Law School; was on the Yale Law \nJournal; had a distinguished career in private practice; an assistant \ndistrict attorney with DA Morgenthau in Manhattan; service on a U.S. \nDistrict court, a trial court; and now serves on the Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit.\n  The conventional wisdom is that Judge Sotomayor will be confirmed. \nBut notwithstanding the conventional wisdom, under the Constitution it \nis the responsibility of the Senate, on its advice and consent \nfunction, to question the nominee to determine how she would approach \nimportant issues. It also presents a good opportunity to shed some \nlight on the operations of the Supreme Court of the United States in an \neffort to improve those operations.\n  It has been my practice recently to write letters to the nominees in \nadvance, as I discussed it with Judge Sotomayor during the so-called \ncourtesy visit I had with her, and she graciously consented to respond \nor to receive the letters and was appreciative of the opportunity to \nknow in advance the issues which would be raised.\n  Sometimes if an issue comes up fresh, the nominee does not know the \ncase or does not know the issue and may be compelled to say: Well, let \nme consider that, and I will get back to you. So this enables us at the \nhearings\n\n[[Page S7223]]\n\nto move right ahead into the substantive materials.\n  The first letter I wrote involved congressional power and the \nadoption by the Supreme Court of a test on congruence and \nproportionality, which Justice Scalia called the ``flabby test,'' which \nenables the Court to, in effect, legislate.\n  The second letter involved the prospect of televising the Supreme \nCourt to grant greater access to the public to understand what the \nSupreme Court does.\n  And the third letter, which I sent to Judge Sotomayor yesterday, \ninvolves the issue of the Court's backlog and the opportunities for the \nCourt to take on more work.\n  Chief Justice Roberts, in his confirmation hearings, noted that the \nCourt ``could contribute more to the clarity and uniformity of the law \nby taking more cases.''\n  The number of cases the Supreme Court decided in the 19th century \nshows it is possible to take up more cases. In 1870, the Court had 636 \ncases on the docket, decided 280; in 1880, the Court had 1,202 cases on \nthe docket, decided 365; in 1886, the Court had 1,396 cases on the \ndocket, decided 451.\n  Notwithstanding what Chief Justice Roberts said in his confirmation \nhearing, during his tenure the number of cases has continued to \ndecline. In the 1985 term, there were 161 signed opinions. In the 2007 \nterm, with Chief Justice Roberts in charge, there were only 67 decided \ncases.\n  The Court has what is called a ``cert. pool,'' where seven of the \nnine Justices--excluding only Justice Stevens and Justice Alito--have \ntheir clerks do the work, suggesting that the Justices spend little \ntime if any on the cert. petitions except to examine a memo in this \nsort of a pool, raising questions as to whether that is adequate on \nindividualized justice with the individual Justices considering these \nissues. The Justices can't consider the thousands of cases which are \nfiled, but there may be a better system, as Justice Stevens and Justice \nAlito have it, with their taking their own individual responsibility.\n\n  There is another major problem in the Court and that is its failure \nto take on cases where the courts of appeals for the circuits are \nsplit. There are many such cases. In my letter to Judge Sotomayor, I \nhave identified some. Illustrative of the cases are important issues \nsuch as mandatory minimums for the use of a gun in drug trafficking or \nthe propriety of a jury consulting the Bible during its deliberations. \nJustice Scalia, in dissenting on one of the refusals to take up a case \nwith a circuit split, said this--dissenting, Justice Scalia wrote:\n\n       In light of the conflicts among the circuits, I would grant \n     the petition for certiorari and squarely confront both the \n     meaning and the constitutionality of the section involved.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Indeed, it seems to me quite irresponsible to let the \n     current chaos prevail.\n\n  Well, that is the kind of chaos which prevails when two circuits \nsplit. The case may come up in another circuit where the precedents are \ndivided, and it seems to me that the Court ought to take up the issues. \nThat could be ameliorated by a change in the rules. Four Justices must \nagree to hear a case, and I intend to ask Judge Sotomayor her views on \nthis subject and on her willingness, perhaps, to be interested in \ntaking cases with only three Justices or perhaps two Justices.\n  The refusal of the Court to take up these major cases is very \nserious, illustrated by its denial of consideration of perhaps the \nmajor--or at least a major--conflict between the power of Congress \nunder article I of the Constitution to enact the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, which provided for the exclusive means to have \nwiretap warrants issued, contrasted with President Bush's warrantless \nwiretap procedures under the terrorist surveillance program. The \nDetroit District Court found the terrorist surveillance program \nunconstitutional. The Sixth Circuit decided it would not decide the \ncase by finding a lack of standing. In the letter to Judge Sotomayor, I \ncite the reasoning of the dissenting judge, showing the flexibility of \nthe standing doctrine. Then the Supreme Court of the United States \ndecides not to decide the case. It so happens, in so many matters, what \nthe Court decides not to decide may well be more important than what \nthe Court actually does decide.\n  These are issues which I intend to take up with Judge Sotomayor. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of my letter to Judge Sotomayor be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Sonia Sotomayor,\n     c/o The Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Sotomayor: As noted in my letters of June 15 and \n     June 25, I am writing to alert you to subjects which I intend \n     to cover at your hearing. During our courtesy meeting you \n     noted your appreciation of this advance notice. This is the \n     third and final letter in this series.\n       The decisions by the Supreme Court not to hear cases may be \n     more important than the decisions actually deciding cases. \n     There are certainly more of them. They are hidden in single \n     sentence denials with no indication of what they involve or \n     why they are rejected. In some high profile cases, it is \n     apparent that there is good reason to challenge the Court's \n     refusal to decide.\n       The rejection of significant cases occurs at the same time \n     the Court's caseload has dramatically decreased, the number \n     of law clerks has quadrupled, and justices are observed \n     lecturing around the world during the traditional three-month \n     break from the end of June until the first Monday in October \n     while other Federal employees work 11 months a year.\n       During his Senate confirmation hearing, Chief Justice John \n     G. Roberts, Jr. said the Court ``could contribute more to the \n     clarity and uniformity of the law by taking more cases.'' \n     i The number of cases decided by the Supreme Court \n     in the 19th century shows the capacity of the nine Justices \n     to decide more cases. According to Professor Edward A. \n     Hartnett: ``. . . in 1870, the Court had 636 cases on its \n     docket and decided 280; in 1880, the Court had 1,202 cases on \n     its docket and decided 365; and in 1886, the Court had 1,396 \n     cases on its docket and decided 451.'' ii The \n     downward trend of decided case is noteworthy since 1985 and \n     has continued under Chief Justice Roberts' leadership. The \n     number of signed opinions decreased from 161 in the 1985 term \n     to 67 in the 2007 term.iii\n       It has been reported that seven of the nine justices, \n     excluding Justices Stevens and Alito, assign their clerks to \n     what is called a ``cert. pool'' to review the thousands of \n     petitions for certiorari. The clerk then writes and \n     circulates a summary of the case and its issues suggesting \n     justices' reading of cert. petitions is, at most, limited.\n       At a time of this declining caseload, the Supreme Court has \n     left undecided circuit court splits of authority on many \n     important cases such as: 1) The necessity for an agency head \n     to personally assert the deliberative process privilege; \n     iv\n       2) Mandatory minimums for use of a gun in drug \n     trafficking;v\n       3) Equitable tolling of the Federal Tort Claims Act's \n     statute of limitations period,vi\n       4) The standard for deciding whether a Chapter 11 \n     bankruptcy may benefit from executory \n     contracts;vii\n       5) Construing the honest services provisions of fraud \n     law;viii and\n       6) The propriety of a jury consulting the Bible during \n     deliberations.ix\n       One procedural change for the Court to take more of these \n     cases would be to lower the number of justices required for \n     cert. from four to three or perhaps even to two.\n       Of perhaps greater significance are the high-profile, major \n     constitutional issues which the court refuses to decide \n     involving executive authority, congressional authority and \n     civil rights. A noteworthy denial of cert. occurred in the \n     Court's refusal to decide the constitutionality of the \n     Terrorist Surveillance Program which brought into sharp \n     conflict Congress' authority under Article I to establish the \n     exclusive basis for wiretaps under the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act with the President's authority under Article \n     II as Commander in Chief to order warrantless wiretaps.\n       That program operated secretly from shortly after 9/11 \n     until a New York Times article in December 2005. In August \n     2006, the United States District Court for the Eastern \n     District of Michigan found the program \n     unconstitutional.x In July 2007, the Sixth Circuit \n     reversed 2-1, finding lack of standing.xi The \n     Supreme Court then denied certiorari.xii\n       The dissenting opinion in the Sixth Circuit demonstrated \n     the flexibility of the standing requirement to provide the \n     basis for a decision on the merits. Judge Gilman noted, ``the \n     attorney-plaintiffs in the present case allege that the \n     government is listening in on private person-to-person \n     communications that are not open to the public. These are \n     communications that any reasonable person would understand to \n     be private.'' xiii After analyzing the standing \n     inquiry under a recent Supreme Court decision, Judge Gilman \n     would have held that, ``[t]he attorney-plaintiffs have thus \n     identified concrete harms to themselves flowing from their \n     reasonable fear that the TSP will intercept privileged \n     communications between themselves and their clients.'' \n     xiv On a matter of such importance, the Supreme \n     Court could at least have granted certiorari and decided that \n     standing was a legitimate basis on which to reject the \n     decision on the merits.\n\n[[Page S7224]]\n\n       On June 29, 2009, the Supreme Court refused to consider the \n     case captioned In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, \n     2001,xv in which the families of the 9/11 victims \n     sought damages from Saudi Arabian princes personally, not as \n     government actors, for financing Muslim charities knowing \n     those funds would be used to carry out Al Qaeda jihads \n     against the United States.xvi The plaintiffs \n     sought an exception to the sovereign immunity specified in \n     the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. Plaintiffs' \n     counsel had developed considerable evidence showing Saudi \n     complicity. Had the case gone forward, discovery proceedings \n     had the prospect of developing additional incriminating \n     evidence.\n       My questions are:\n       1) Do you agree with the testimony of Chief Justice Roberts \n     at his confirmation hearing that the Court ``could contribute \n     more to clarity and uniformity of the law by taking more \n     cases?''\n       2) If confirmed, would you favor reducing the number of \n     justices required to grant petitions for certiorari in \n     circuit split cases from four to three or even two?\n       3) If confirmed, would you join the cert. pool or follow \n     the practice of Justices Stevens and Alito in reviewing \n     petitions for cert. with the assistance of your clerks?\n       4) Would you have voted to grant certiorari in the case \n     captioned In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001?\n       5) Would you have voted to grant certiorari in A.C.L.U. v. \n     N.S.A.--the case challenging the constitutionality of the \n     Terrorist Surveillance Program?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n\n                                ENDNOTES\n\n       i Confirmation Hearing on the Nomination of John \n     G.

Mr. President, moving on to a second subject, The New \nYork Times today has an analysis of health care which bears directly \nupon the legislation which will soon be considered by the Congress on \ncomprehensive health care. The article focuses on prostate cancer, for \nillustrative purposes, to raise the issue that the key factor of \nholding down costs is not being attended to under the current system \nbecause there are no determinations as to what is affected.\n  The article points out that the obvious first step is figuring out \nwhat actually works. It cites a number of approaches for dealing with \nprostate cancer, varying from a few thousand dollars to $23,000, to \n$50,000 to $100,000. It notes that drug and device makers have no \nreason to finance such trials because insurers now pay for expensive \ntreatments, even if they aren't effective. The article notes that the \nselection customarily made is the one which is the most effective.\n  I have talked to Senator Baucus and Senator Dodd and have written to \nthem concerning my suggestion in this field. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the New York Times article be printed in the Record, \ntogether with my letters to Senator Baucus, Senator Dodd, and Senator \nKennedy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 8, 2009]\n\n             In Health Reform, a Cancer Offers an Acid Test\n\n                          (By David Leonhardt)\n\n       It's become popular to pick your own personal litmus test \n     for health care reform.\n       For some liberals, reform will be a success only if it \n     includes a new government-run insurance plan to compete with \n     private insurers. For many conservatives, a bill must exclude \n     such a public plan. For others, the crucial issue is how much \n     money Congress spends covering the uninsured.\n\n[[Page S7225]]\n\n       My litmus test is different. It's the prostate cancer test.\n       The prostate cancer test will determine whether President \n     Obama and Congress put together a bill that begins to fix the \n     fundamental problem with our medical system: the combination \n     of soaring costs and mediocre results. If they don't, the \n     medical system will remain deeply troubled, no matter what \n     other improvements they make.\n       The legislative process is still in the early stages, and \n     Washington is likely to squeeze some costs out of the medical \n     system. But the signals coming from Capitol Hill are still \n     worrisome, because Congress has not seemed willing to change \n     the basic economics of health care.\n       So let's talk about prostate cancer. Right now, men with \n     the most common form--slow-growing, early-stage prostate \n     cancer--can choose from at least five different courses of \n     treatment. The simplest is known as watchful waiting, which \n     means doing nothing unless later tests show the cancer is \n     worsening. More aggressive options include removing the \n     prostate gland or receiving one of several forms of \n     radiation. The latest treatment--proton radiation therapy--\n     involves a proton accelerator that can be as big as a \n     football field.\n       Some doctors swear by one treatment, others by another. But \n     no one really knows which is best. Rigorous research has been \n     scant. Above all, no serious study has found that the high-\n     technology treatments do better at keeping men healthy and \n     alive. Most die of something else before prostate cancer \n     becomes a problem.\n       ``No therapy has been shown superior to another,'' an \n     analysis by the RAND Corporation found. Dr. Michael Rawlins, \n     the chairman of a British medical research institute, told \n     me, ``We're not sure how good any of these treatments are.'' \n     When I asked Dr. Danielle Perlroth of Stanford University, \n     who has studied the data, what she would recommend to a \n     family member, she paused. Then she said, ``Watchful \n     waiting.''\n       But if the treatments have roughly similar benefits, they \n     have very different prices. Watchful waiting costs just a few \n     thousand dollars, in follow-up doctor visits and tests. \n     Surgery to remove the prostate gland costs about $23,000. A \n     targeted form of radiation, known as I.M.R.T., runs $50,000. \n     Proton radiation therapy often exceeds $100,000.\n       And in our current fee-for-service medical system--in which \n     doctors and hospitals are paid for how much care they \n     provide, rather than how well they care for their patients--\n     you can probably guess which treatments are becoming more \n     popular: the ones that cost a lot of money.\n       Use of I.M.R.T. rose tenfold from 2002 to 2006, according \n     to unpublished RAND data. A new proton treatment center will \n     open Wednesday in Oklahoma City, and others are being planned \n     in Chicago, South Florida and elsewhere. The country is \n     paying at least several billion more dollars for prostate \n     treatment than is medically justified--and the bill is rising \n     rapidly.\n       You may never see this bill, but you're paying it. It has \n     raised your health insurance premiums and left your employer \n     with less money to give you a decent raise. The cost of \n     prostate cancer care is one small reason that some companies \n     have stopped offering health insurance. It is also one reason \n     that medical costs are on a pace to make the federal \n     government insolvent.\n       These costs are the single most important thing to keep in \n     mind during the health care debate. Making sure that everyone \n     has insurance, important as that is, will not solve the cost \n     problem. Neither will a new public insurance plan. We already \n     have a big public plan, Medicare, and it has not altered the \n     economics of prostate care.\n       The first step to passing the prostate cancer test is \n     laying the groundwork to figure out what actually works. \n     Incredibly, the only recent randomized trial comparing \n     treatments is a 2005 study from Sweden. (It suggested that \n     removing the prostate might benefit men under 65, which is \n     consistent with the sensible notion that younger men are \n     better candidates for some aggressive treatments.)\n       ``There is no reason in the world we have to be this \n     uncertain about the relative risks and benefits,'' says Dr. \n     Sean Tunis, a former chief medical officer of Medicare.\n       Drug and device makers have no reason to finance such \n     trials, because insurers now pay for expensive treatments \n     even if they aren't more effective. So the job has to fall to \n     the government--which, after all, is the country's largest \n     health insurer.\n       Obama administration officials understand this, and the \n     stimulus bill included money for such research. But stimulus \n     is temporary. The current House version of the health bill \n     does not provide enough long-term financing.\n       The next step involves giving more solid information to \n     patients. A fascinating series of pilot programs, including \n     for prostate cancer, has shown that when patients have \n     clinical information about treatments, they often choose a \n     less invasive one. Some come to see that the risks and side \n     effects of more invasive care are not worth the small--or \n     nonexistent--benefits. ``We want the thing that makes us \n     better,'' says Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonary specialist at \n     Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, ``not the thing that \n     is niftier.''\n       The current Senate bill would encourage doctors to give \n     patients more information. But that won't be nearly enough to \n     begin solving the cost problem.\n       To do that, health care reform will have to start to change \n     the incentives in the medical system. We'll have to start \n     paying for quality, not volume.\n       On this score, health care economists tell me that they are \n     troubled by Congress's early work. They are hoping that the \n     Senate Finance Committee will soon release a bill that does \n     better. But as Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the \n     committee, says, ``There has not been adequate attention to \n     changing the incentives that drive behavior.'' One big reason \n     is that the health care industry is lobbying hard for the \n     status quo.\n       Plenty of good alternatives exist. Hospitals can be \n     financially punished for making costly errors. Consumers can \n     be given more choice of insurers, creating an incentive for \n     them to sign up for a plan that doesn't cover wasteful care. \n     Doctors can be paid a set fee for some conditions, adequate \n     to cover the least expensive most effective treatment. (This \n     is similar to what happens in other countries, where doctors \n     are on salary rather than paid piecemeal--and medical care is \n     much less expensive.)\n       Even if Congress did all this, we would still face tough \n     decisions. Imagine if further prostate research showed that a \n     $50,000 dose of targeted radiation did not extend life but \n     did bring fewer side effects, like diarrhea, than other forms \n     of radiation. Should Medicare spend billions to pay for \n     targeted radiation? Or should it help prostate patients \n     manage their diarrhea and then spend the billions on other \n     kinds of care?\n       The answer isn't obvious. But this much is: The current \n     health care system is hard-wired to be bloated and \n     inefficient. Doesn't that seem like a problem that a once-in-\n     a-generation effort to reform health care should address?\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2009.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, it is my view that this is a critical and \narguably indispensable item to be taken up in this comprehensive health \ncare reform--and certainly weighs heavily on my mind--and that is to \nfund the National Institutes of Health at the $30 billion currently as \nthe base, plus the $10 billion in the stimulus package, for a base of \n$40 billion. The results from medical research have been phenomenal, \nwith decreases in fatality to stroke, breast cancer, and many other of \nthe health maladies. Then, to combine that with legislation which I \nhave introduced, S. 914, the Cures Acceleration Network, which \naddresses the issue taken up by The New York Times, and that is to make \na determination of what actually works.\n  There has been identified a so-called ``valley of death'' between the \nbench and clinical research and the bedside and application of the \nresearch. The pharmaceutical companies do not take up this issue \nbecause of the cost. This is something which ought to be taken up by \nthe Federal Government as the dominant funder for the National \nInstitutes of Health. So should the comprehensive health care include \nthis issue to address, in a meaningful way, the very high costs of \nmedical care? Certainly, if the tests make a determination that the \nless-expensive items are the ones which ought to be followed, that \ncould meet the Federal standard and that could prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7226-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7226-S7227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HOLOCAUST LOOTED ART RETRIEVAL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, moving to yet another subject, there is a \nmajor miscarriage of justice currently being perpetrated on the victims \nof the Holocaust and their survivors. The Washington Post, 2 weeks ago \nSunday, on June 28, pointed out that Holocaust survivors and their \nheirs are battling museums and governments for the return of thousands \nof pieces of looted art, despite pledges made by dozens of countries \nand Washington a decade ago to resolve the claims.\n  At a major conference underway in Prague, delegates from 49 countries \nacknowledged that Jews continue to be stymied in their efforts to \nreclaim art that was stolen by the Nazis and later transferred to \nmuseums and galleries around the world, especially in Europe. An \nestimated 100,000 artworks, from invaluable masterpieces to items of \nmostly sentimental value, remain lost or beyond legal research of their \nvictimized owners and descendants.\n  Stuart Eizenstat, head of the U.S. delegation to the conference said:\n\n       This is one of our last chances to inject a new sense of \n     justice into this issue before it's too late for Holocaust \n     victims.\n\n  The article goes on to point out that:\n\n       In December 1998, after many world-famous museums were \n     found to have Nazi-tainted art in their collections, \n     representatives from 44 countries met in Washington and \n     endorsed guidelines for investigating claims of stolen items \n     and returning them to their rightful owners.\n\n  Notwithstanding that international determination, the program has not \nbeen carried out.\n  The article goes on to cite the case involving Mr. Michael Klepetar, \na real estate project manager from Prague, who has been trying for 9 \nyears to persuade the Czech National Gallery to relinquish 43 paintings \nthat once belonged to his great uncle, Richard Popper, a prominent \ncollector who was deported to Poland and perished in the Jewish ghetto \nin the city of Lodz. Popper's wife and daughter also died in the Nazi \ncamps. The National Gallery in Czechoslovakia has refused to part with \nthe paintings, citing a law adopted in 2000 by the Czech Government \nthat entitles only Holocaust victims or their ``direct descendants'' to \nfile claims for the property. The Ministry of Culture in Czechoslovakia \nhas classified 13 of the looted artworks as ``cultural treasures,'' a \ndesignation that prevents them from being taken out of the country.\n  Mr. Klepetar went on to point out the salient underlying factor:\n\n       This country--\n\n  Referring to Czechoslovakia--\n\n     like most of the region, has always been anti-semitic through \n     the centuries. The only difference now is that it's not \n     politically correct. That's the root of the whole problem.\n\n  I am writing today to Secretary of State Clinton asking her to use \nthe persuasive power of the Department of State to rectify this \nproblem. I am also writing to the State Department legal counselor, \ninquiring about what enforcement action might be taken in international \nlegal tribunals to rectify this situation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Post article, and the \ncopies of my letters to Secretary Clinton and the State Department \nlegal adviser be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 28, 2009]\n\n     Jews Remain Stymied in Efforts To Reclaim Art Looted by Nazis\n\n                          (By Craig Whitlock)\n\n       Holocaust survivors and their heirs are still battling \n     museums and governments for the return of thousands of pieces \n     of looted art, despite pledges made by dozens of countries in \n     Washington a decade ago to resolve the claims.\n       At a major conference underway here in Prague, delegates \n     from 49 countries acknowledged that Jews continue to be \n     stymied in their efforts to reclaim art that was stolen by \n     the Nazis and later transferred to museums and galleries \n     around the world, especially in Europe. An estimated 100,000 \n     artworks, from invaluable masterpieces to items of mostly \n     sentimental value, remain lost or beyond legal reach of their \n     victimized owners and descendants.\n       ``This is one of our last chances to inject a new sense of \n     justice into this issue before it's too late for Holocaust \n     victims,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, head of the U.S. delegation \n     to the conference and a former ambassador and deputy Treasury \n     secretary during the Clinton administration.\n       The Holocaust Era Assets Conference, hosted by the Czech \n     Republic, is an attempt to revive a global campaign that \n     began 11 years ago to track down long-lost art collections \n     that were confiscated or acquired under dubious circumstances \n     during the Holocaust.\n       In December 1998, after many world-famous museums were \n     found to have Nazi-tainted art in their collections, \n     representatives from 44 countries met in Washington and \n     endorsed guidelines for investigating claims of stolen items \n     and returning them to their rightful owners.\n       The guidelines, known in the art world as the Washington \n     Principles, have eased the return of looted art in many \n     cases. Despite their endorsement by most European countries \n     and the United States, however, the guidelines are legally \n     nonbinding. They are also often ignored in practice by \n     museums and governments that profess in public to abide by \n     them, according to art experts.\n       Michel Klepetar, a real-estate project manager from Prague, \n     has been trying for nine years to persuade the Czech National \n     Gallery to relinquish 43 paintings that once belonged to his \n     great-uncle, Richard Popper, a prominent collector who was \n     deported to Poland and perished in the Jewish ghetto in the \n     city of Lodz.\n       Popper's wife and daughter also died in Nazi camps. \n     Klepetar, 62, and his brother are their closest living \n     relatives. But the National Gallery has refused to part with \n     the paintings, citing a law adopted in 2000 by the Czech \n     government that entitles only Holocaust victims or their \n     ``direct descendants'' to file claims for stolen property.\n       In an interview, Klepetar argued that the Czech law was \n     unconstitutional, unethical and particularly unfair to Jews. \n     An estimated 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust; \n     many families were survived only by distant relatives.\n       ``This country, like most of the region, had always been \n     anti-Semitic through the centuries,'' he said. ``The only \n     difference now is that it's not politically correct. That's \n     the root of the whole problem.''\n       Klepetar's great-uncle had amassed a collection of 127 \n     artworks--mostly Flemish and\n\n[[Page S7227]]\n\n     Dutch paintings from the 17th and 18th centuries--which \n     vanished after the war. In 2000, however, Klepetar said \n     someone leaked him part of a confidential Czech government \n     report on looted art that indicated 43 of the paintings had \n     been in the National Gallery's possession since the early \n     1950s.\n       The National Gallery later acknowledged it had the \n     paintings but refused to divulge any details, such as how \n     they were acquired, their condition or their precise \n     location. Klepetar has pressed his claim in the Czech courts \n     for several years but has lost repeatedly because he is not \n     considered a direct descendant under the law.\n       Tomas Jelinek, vice president of the Czech Committee for \n     Nazi Victims, said the government's decision to pass the 2000 \n     law that limits who can file claims for Holocaust assets was \n     designed to protect public galleries and government \n     institutions.\n       ``You have all these people in charge of the museums, and \n     they don't want to lose their assets,'' he said. ``There are \n     always people who say, `Why should we give these valuable \n     objects from our collections away?' ''\n       Tomas Wiesner, director of galleries and museums for the \n     Czech Ministry of Culture, did not respond to requests for \n     comment.\n       Art experts credited the Czech government with taking steps \n     to make it easier to find and return looted art. In 2001, for \n     instance, it established the Documentation Center for \n     Property Transfers of Cultural Assets of World War II \n     Victims, which maintains a public online database of artworks \n     in Czech museums that once may have been owned by Holocaust \n     victims.\n       The database, however, offers limited information and is \n     hampered by spotty recordkeeping. For example, it lists only \n     eight of the 43 paintings in the National Gallery that were \n     part of Klepetar's family collection, even though the museum \n     has acknowledged it has the others as well.\n       The Documentation Center also does not publish statistics \n     on how many claims have been filed on behalf of Holocaust \n     victims, or how many artworks have been returned. Helena \n     Krajcova, director of the center and co-chair of the looted-\n     art panel for the Holocaust Era Assets Conference, did not \n     respond to requests for an interview.\n       Czech officials have sometimes taken extraordinary legal \n     measures to prevent the return of looted art.\n       In December, the American heirs of Emil Freund, a Prague \n     lawyer and collector who was killed during the Holocaust, \n     reacquired 32 paintings and drawings that had been in the \n     custody of the National Gallery for decades. But the Ministry \n     of Culture classified 13 of the looted artworks as cultural \n     treasures, a designation that prevents them from being taken \n     out of the country.\n       Michaela Sidenberg, curator for visual art at the Jewish \n     Museum in Prague, a private institution, said Holocaust \n     survivors and their families are repeatedly stonewalled in \n     the Czech Republic, despite official policy to make it simple \n     for them to file claims for artwork taken by the Nazis.\n       ``It's like a hot potato being thrown around,'' she said. \n     ``The claimants are kicked around from one bureaucracy to \n     another. Everybody is just looking for some alibi and to \n     avoid taking responsibility.''\n       Asked about such criticism, Stefan Fule, the Czech \n     Republic's minister for European Union affairs, said his \n     government's hosting of the conference on Holocaust-era \n     assets demonstrates its dedication to resolving such claims \n     fairly.\n       ``These are serious questions that need to be seriously \n     addressed,'' he said at a news briefing Friday. He declined \n     to say, however, whether the Czech government would consider \n     changing its laws so that distant relatives would be allowed \n     to inherit property stolen by the Nazis.\n       In the meantime, Klepetar said he will keep pressing his \n     case for the return of his great-uncle's collection, even \n     though he predicted that there was ``almost zero'' chance \n     that the Czech government would change its laws or policies.\n       ``No, no, I'm not going to give up,'' he said. ``It's the \n     principle. Like they say, a Jew should never let anyone \n     [defecate] on his head. And you can quote that.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2009.\n     Hon.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2892, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2892) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2010, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Byrd-Inouye) amendment No. 1373, in the nature of \n     a substitute.\n       Sessions amendment No. 1371 (to amendment No. 1373), to \n     make the pilot program for employment eligibility \n     confirmation for aliens permanent and to improve verification \n     of immigration status of employees.\n       DeMint amendment No. 1399 (to amendment No. 1373), to \n     require the completion of at least 700 miles of reinforced \n     fencing along the southwest border by December 31, 2010.\n       Feingold amendment No. 1402 (to amendment No. 1373), to \n     require grants for Emergency Operations Centers and financial \n     assistance for the predisaster mitigation program to be \n     awarded without regard to earmarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1399\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about an amendment \nthat will be up second, I believe, this morning. It is about our \nsouthern border in this United States.\n  I think we have made some propositions to the American people to \nsecure our southern border. We have\n\n[[Page S7228]]\n\npassed laws that are currently not being followed, and I think we see \nthe result of that in Mexico as well as in the United States. Our \nsouthern border has become a battleground. It is a place not only where \nillegal immigrants and workers come into our country, but drug \ntrafficking and weapons trafficking are real security issues. We are \ndestabilizing Mexico with all that is going on because we refuse to \ncarry out our promise to the American people to secure that border. We \ncannot have security in the United States unless we have a secure \nborder.\n  We passed a law that says we have to have 700 miles of reinforced, \ndouble-layer fencing along the southern border of the United States. Of \nthe 700 miles, 370 miles were required to be built by December 31 of \nlast year, and we have not met that requirement.\n  In fact, there are only 330 miles of the single-layered fencing and \nonly 34 miles of the double-layered fencing that was required by law to \nbe built.\n  So far they claim 661 miles of fencing are completed, but that \nincludes both vehicle barriers and single-layered fencing.\n  They continue to speak of virtual fencing, which is basically just \ndetectors if someone is going across. All the evidence is that doesn't \nwork well, if at all.\n  The point of my amendment is to keep our promise to the American \npeople. Let's move ahead with securing the border. I don't like a \nfence. I don't like the way a fence looks. But in this world today, \nwhere we are threatened in many ways, it is critically important that \nwe are able to determine who comes and goes and what comes and goes on \nthe borders of the United States.\n  My amendment does two things. It requires that 700 miles of physical \npedestrian fencing be completed, and it sets a deadline of December 31, \n2010. We can do this if we just make that commitment and fund it in \nthis bill.\n  A physical fence is effective, compared to the untested hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of virtual fencing they are trying to substitute, \neven though we passed a law that says we need to secure the borders.\n  I remind my colleagues we made a promise to the American people. We \npassed a law. This country is based on the rule of law, and we need to \nfollow it in the Congress. We need to fund this and set a deadline so \nthis promise will be fulfilled.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to vote for the DeMint amendment this \nmorning. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1371\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, recently the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nreported that the unemployment rate in June of this year had jumped to \n9.5 percent; 467,000 jobs were lost in June alone. This is the highest \nunemployment rate in 25 years.\n  The Congress passed, earlier this year, a stimulus bill. The purpose \nof it was to create jobs and reduce unemployment. We were told if we \npass that bill, unemployment would top out at 8.4 percent. Well, it \njust hit 9.5 percent. A report released by the Heritage Foundation and \nthe Center for Immigration studies has estimated that 15 percent of the \nconstruction jobs created by the Senate stimulus bill would go to \nillegal immigrants--about 300,000 jobs.\n  The question is, is there anything we can do about it? The answer is \nyes. We have an E-Verify system where employers voluntarily, all over \nthe country, are using a computer verification system to determine \nwhether the job applicant who appears before them is here legally and \nentitled to work. The Federal Government uses that same system for \nevery employee it hires, but we did not require that for employers who \nget government contracts under the stimulus package. Contractors who \nget money under the stimulus package are not required to use E-Verify.\n  The system is pretty successful. It is not foolproof, but Secretary \nNapolitano of Homeland Security recently said:\n\n       The administration strongly supports E-Verify as a \n     cornerstone of worksite enforcement and will work to \n     continually improve the program to ensure it is the best tool \n     available to deter the hiring of persons not authorized to \n     work in the United States.\n\n  That was a good statement from Homeland Security. But the reality is \nthat President Bush's Executive order that was to take place in \nJanuary, which would have required all government contractors to use E-\nVerify, has been pushed back four times. So that is why I offered this \nlegislation.\n  It is perfectly appropriate for Congress to pass legislation to \nrequire this. I have been advised today, though, of some good news. \nSecretary Napolitano apparently will issue a statement later today \nsaying that after three or four extensions and putting off the E-Verify \nmandate for government contractors she will issue that order. So that \nis good news.\n  What would my amendment do? No. 1, it would make that not just a \nPresidential policy subject to delay or implementation or withdrawal \nwhenever they wanted; it would make it a permanent rule that people who \nhave contracts with the government would have to use the E-Verify \nsystem. Instead of a 3-year extension of the E-Verify system, as \nprovided for in this bill, it would go on and make it permanent. It is \na cornerstone today of a system that will work to a considerable degree \nto reduce the number of illegal workers who are getting jobs--taking \njobs from American workers at this particularly difficult time. I think \nit is a good step. I am glad the Secretary is moving forward finally on \nmaking that a reality.\n  I hope my colleagues will step forward now and let's make this a \npermanent system. It is certainly contemplated to be permanent. But for \nodd reasons, to me, there seems to be a reluctance to make it so. The \nsystem is up and running. It can handle millions more than the millions \nit is already handling today. It is designed for a much larger use. It \nwill make a difference, and it will identify quite a number of people \nwho are here illegally seeking to work. In fact, I think the system \nshould be made to apply to all businesses in America. I believe we can \ndo that and should move in that direction. But the first step, it seems \nto me, would be to say if we are going to create a stimulus package, if \nthis government is going to give contracts to private contractors who \ndo work for the government, they ought to at least ask them to verify \nwhether the person is legally in the country.\n  Yes, there are some good things additionally that need to be done, \nsuch as a biometric identification system, which Senator Schumer \nreferred to last night. I would heartily support that, but I believe \nthis is the initial step that ought to be taken. The system should be \nmade permanent and the requirement that contractors of the government \nshould be a part of our law today.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for it. I think it would be consistent \nwith the stated policies of the Obama administration and consistent \nwith what the Senate has been working on for some time. I am baffled \nthat Members would not support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 175\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Banking Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. \nRes. 175; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; \nfurther, that an amendment to the resolution, which is at the desk, be \nagreed to; the resolution, as amended, be agreed to; that an amendment \nto the preamble, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the preamble, as \namended, be agreed to; finally, that a title amendment, which is at the \ndesk, be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on behalf of several Senators, I object \nto the distinguished Senator's request. I respect him, but there is an \nobjection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today, I rise asking my colleagues to \ntable the pending amendment filed by my distinguished colleague from \nAlabama to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S7229]]\n\n  His amendment would both make E-Verify permanent and would \nimmediately mandate all Federal contractors and subcontractors to use \nE-Verify.\n  First, I have good news for my colleagues and good news for my \ncolleague from Alabama. The Department of Homeland Security has just \ntaken action--they were planning to do it before. It is coincidental \nbut fortuitous that it occurs right now. It addresses a good part of \nthe issue that my colleague from Alabama has raised.\n  Today, the Department of Homeland Security has issued a statement \nindicating ``the administration's support for a regulation that will \naward Federal contracts only to employers who use E-Verify to check \nemployee work authorization.''\n  As we all know, E-Verify is a voluntary system, not a mandatory \nsystem. For Federal contractors, it will be mandatory, which is half \nand the most operative part of my colleagues' amendment.\n  The administration's Federal contractor rule extends use of the E-\nVerify system to covered Federal contractors and subcontractors, \nincluding those who receive American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nfunds. The administration will push ahead with full implementation of \nthe rule, which will apply to Federal solicitation and contract awards \nstarting on September 8, 2009--within a couple months.\n  Accordingly, I believe Senator Sessions' amendment is moot so far as \nit applies to Federal contractors and doesn't need to be approved by us \nin order for E-Verify to apply in this context.\n  He has another part of the amendment, which is to make E-Verify \npermanent. I remind my colleagues that E-Verify is in effect for the \nnext 3 years. Making it permanent will extend to the outyears, but as \nchair of the immigration subcommittee, and with the support of Chairman \nLeahy, I have been investigating this issue.\n  I say to my colleagues that I don't think we want to make E-Verify \npermanent because it is not tough enough or strong enough. There is a \ngaping loophole in E-Verify. It is the best we have now. We should use \nit for Federal contractors. I support that. But there is a big \nloophole.\n  Let's say an illegal immigrant wants to say they are John Jones from \nSyracuse, and they know John Jones's Social Security number. They can \neasily get a fake ID that has John Jones's address on it, and they can \nsubmit it into the system, and nothing in E-Verify will stop that \nillegal immigrant from getting a job. Once they are in the system, they \nare approved time after time.\n  What is more, nothing about E-Verify stops a citizen from loaning \ntheir identity to friends and family so they can get a job. We need a \nbiometric system, with a picture and a biometric identifier. That is \nthe only way we will stop illegal immigration. E-Verify doesn't do it.\n  I assure my colleagues on our subcommittee on immigration, under \nChairman Leahy's leadership as chairman of the full committee, we are \ninvestigating a biometric system which will once and for all stop \nfuture illegal immigration. To make this system permanent, when there \nis a better system in the offing, is premature.\n  I urge that the amendment be tabled. The first part has been adopted, \nand the second part to make it permanent, when we already have it for 3 \nyears, is wrong when we can do better 3 years from now.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent if I might have \n30 seconds before the vote to make a request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first, if I may respond to Senator \nSchumer, it is my understanding that Secretary Napolitano's executive \norder will be different than the Executive order the Bush \nadministration had, finally, after some delay, approved in that it \nwould say that a government contractor would not have to check the \nemployment history of employees working for them through the E-Verify \nsystem--their validity--but only new hires they bring on, which is \nquite a different thing.\n  I am aware of a businessman in Alabama who has had highway-type work \nwith good employees for many years--decades. He told me he is not now \nable to compete and is losing contract after contract because his \ncompetitor is using illegal labor. This is not an iddy-biddy matter; it \nis real. I hope I am incorrect about what I understand the Secretary's \ndecision to be. If I am correct, I don't think the proposal is what it \nshould be, and it will still be insufficient.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to respond for 1 \nminute, with the permission of both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the Senator, my friend from Alabama, and \nI, in one sense, think alike on this issue--stopping future flow of \nillegal immigration. But he is right in that the order does not require \nthem to check back with previous employers. That is not how E-verify \nworks. They are not capable of doing it.\n  Obviously, we might want to set up 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 people and \nget them to start checking on previous employment, but that is not how \nE-verify works. It is one of the loopholes in the system. To say the \nadministration is not doing it, that is true, but neither does E-verify \nrequire that. It probably should. But if we have a biometric, if we \nhave a picture, it will be a lot better and we will not need it.\n  The Senator is sort of right and sort of wrong but always good-\nhearted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1198\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I \nam here because the Senator from Nebraska made a request to bring up a \nresolution of his a little while ago and an objection was made on my \nbehalf. Out of courtesy to him, I want to explain.\n  The reason is that Senator Bennett and I, indeed, other Senators, \nhave legislation that would give the government stock in General Motors \nand Chrysler back to the taxpayers who paid for it on April 15. We \nprefer that rather than do an expression, a sentiment, which is what \nthe Senator from Nebraska offered.\n  We are prepared to bring our amendment up and to debate his and to \nvote on his. There are other Senators here with similar amendments. We \nsimply want to make sure they are all considered at once.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Banking Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of S. 1198, the Auto Stock Every Taxpayer \nAct, which would give all the government stock in General Motors to the \ntaxpayers who paid for it; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration, the bill be read for a third time and passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, if I might have a second to \nrespond, I think this is something the good Senator from Tennessee and \nI might be able to work out. But until we have the details worked out \nas to how this would be considered in both cases, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1371\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Alabama and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), and the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 53, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 219 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Klobuchar\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Byrd\n     Harkin\n     Kennedy\n  The motion was rejected.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1407 to Amendment No. 1371\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1407 as a second-\ndegree amendment to the amendment that has been proposed by Mr. \nSessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I am not familiar with \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe I have the right to offer the \nsecond degree; do I not?\n  While we are determining that, let me explain what this does. It \nwould create a permanent EB-5 immigrant investor regional center \nprogram. This is a program that has generated billions of dollars of \ncapital investment in American communities. It has created thousands of \ndomestic jobs.\n  There are 24 of these centers now around the country. I mention to \nthe Senator from Alabama that Alabama has a strong track record with it \nstatewide. The problem we have had in the past is we keep reauthorizing \nfor just a few months at a time, and people in this economy don't want \nto put a large investment in it because of that. So I would offer this \nas a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have no objection to the second-degree \namendment offered by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for its acceptance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1407 to amendment No. 1371.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To permanently reauthorize the EB-5 Regional Center Program)\n\n       On page 3, after line 7, add the following:\n       Sec. 549. Section 610 of the Departments of Commerce, \n     Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1993 (8 U.S.C. 1153 note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``pilot'' each place it appears; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``for 15 years''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1407) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1371 is pending, as amended.\n  If there is no further debate on the amendment, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1371), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1399\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1399, \nwith the time equally divided between the Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray, and the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, current law promises the American people \nthat we will secure our southern borders with 700 miles of pedestrian \nfence. Obviously, we have seen violence increase and drug trafficking \nand weapons trafficking. We have destabilized the Mexican government \nbecause of our inability to carry out that promise. At this point there \nare only 34 miles of double-layered pedestrian fences as promised in \nour laws. We are supposed to have 700 miles. My amendment simply \nenforces current law and sets a deadline that we finish a pedestrian \nfence as required by law, finish the fence that is required by law by \nthe end of next year. This is a promise we should keep to the American \npeople.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield my time to the Senator from Ohio, Senator \nVoinovich.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, we oppose this amendment. The amendment \nwould force the Department of Homeland Security to construct hundreds \nof additional miles of pedestrian fencing beyond that which is \ndetermined as necessary. The Department of Homeland Security has \nstudied and analyzed the tactical infrastructure needs, including \npedestrian fencing or vehicle fencing along that border. It has built \nor is in the process of constructing the miles of pedestrian fencing \nthat are needed or that they believe is necessary.\n  The fact is, this body, when we changed the law not to be \nprospective, we did not detail the location and type of fencing. \nInstead, we left it to the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. Not only is this amendment wrong because it overturns the \nU.S. Customs and Border Service determination of tactical \ninfrastructure needs along the border, it would be incredibly costly. \nIt would outstrip the funds provided for this purpose by requiring \nadditional fencing. Some miles of fencing have an average cost of $5 \nbillion per mile.\n  I urge we vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a modification of the amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit amounts made available under this Act from being \nused to amend the final rule to hold employers accountable if they hire \n                illegal aliens, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 77, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 556.  None of the amounts made available under this \n     Act may be used to implement changes to the final rule \n     describing the process for employers to follow after \n     receiving a ``no match'' letter in order to qualify for \n     ``safe harbor'' status (promulgated on August 15, 2007).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, originally my amendment dealt with two E-\nVerify issues: the no-match rule under Social Security, which I am \nabout to talk about, and also ensuring that the E-Verify system is used \nfor employers who operate under Federal contracts.\n  Just a few minutes ago, we passed the Sessions amendment which deals \nwith the second of those issues, Federal contracts, so the modification \nof my amendment simply takes that part of my amendment out and leaves a \ncorrection of the remaining issue, the Social Security no-match rule. \nThat is the only thing the modification did.\n  What is the no-match rule? In August 2007, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity introduced this no-match regulation which clarified the \nresponsibility of employers who receive notice that their employees' \nnames and Social Security numbers don't match the records of the Social \nSecurity Administration. Under the rule, employers receiving this sort \nof notice who did not take corrective action would be deemed to have \nconstructive knowledge that they are employing unauthorized or illegal \naliens. In other words, this rule provided clear guidance on the \nappropriate responsibility of the employer, the appropriate due \ndiligence the employer should undertake if they receive a letter from \nthe Social Security Administration informing them there is not a proper \nmatch under those records. DHS, GAO, and Social Security audits found \nthat such discrepancies often arise when workers use false documents to \nillegally obtain employment in the United States.\n  Going after these no-matches is absolutely imperative to attack the \nissue of illegal aliens in this country. Employers who receive no-match \nletters know they have a problem and a responsibility to do something \nabout it. Either their record keeping needs to be improved or they have \nhired undocumented workers. This no-match rule is reasonable in telling \nthe employers: You have a problem, and you have a responsibility to do \nsomething about it in a circumstance where there is a no-match.\n  This no-match rule has been blocked by litigation filed by organized \nlabor and business groups that have consistently opposed enforcement of \nmany of our Federal immigration laws. But the administration has twice \nasked the court to delay ruling on the government's motion to throw out \nthe lawsuit, thus voluntarily leaving the rule in legal limbo for more \nthan 5 years.\n  My amendment, as modified, would simply prevent any more delays on \nthe no-match rule. It would allow the Social Security Administration \nand DHS to provide employers with notices of the problem in their \nworkforce payroll records. This is not only thoroughly reasonable, but \nit is absolutely necessary--one of many necessary steps we must take to \nmove forward with regard to the illegal immigration problem and \nproductive enforcement. If there are situations where there isn't a \nmatch under Social Security records, we need to do something about it. \nThe employer needs to look into it and do something about it or else \nour illegal immigration laws are going to continue to be made a farce \nand continue to be flagrantly violated in many cases. This is a \nreasonable approach. It puts a reasonable but not undue burden on the \nemployer to do some appropriate due diligence when they get a no-match \nnotice from Social Security.\n  With that, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. I \nhope we will have a vote on it, probably later today. I look forward to \nany continuing debate and urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize employers to voluntarily verify the immigration \n                     status of existing employees)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CHECKING THE IMMIGRATION STATUS OF EMPLOYEES.\n\n       Section 403(a)(3)(A) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208; 8 \n     U.S.C. 1324a note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``The person'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(i) Upon hiring.--The person''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\n       ``(ii) Existing employees.--An employer that elects to \n     verify the employment eligibility of existing employees shall \n     verify the employment eligibility of all such employees not \n     later than 10 days after notifying the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security of such election.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the amendment I offer to the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill deals with the E-Verify Program. This \nmorning, we voted to make the program a permanent part of our \nimmigration laws. This was a vote in favor of the program because it is \na very valuable tool for businesses across the country that want to \nabide by the law.\n  My amendment makes the program an even better tool for businesses. It \nsays that if an employer chooses to verify the status of all their \nworkers, not just new hires, then they should be allowed to do so. \nEmployers want to abide by the law and hire people who are legally in \nthe country. Right now, E-Verify only allows the employer to check \nprospective employees, but we should be allowing them access to this \nfree, online database system to check all of their workers.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree with this approach. I believe it \nwould fit in closely with initiatives by our new President to change \nthe emphasis upon enforcing the laws against employment of people who \ncome here illegally, because the President is emphasizing going after \nemployers who are not abiding by the law. And there are lots of \ninvestigations that are going on in that direction.\n\n  So we are now giving employers, through my amendment, the opportunity \nto check all their employees because that is very important. If a \nperson is a businessperson, and there is a prospect that Federal people \nare going to come into the process and look at all their employment \nrecords, I would think an employer would want this tool to be able to \nuse to see that everybody who has been hired--not just people recently \nhired--is legally able to be here.\n  I urge my colleagues to agree to this amendment and allow their \nbusinesses back home to take steps to be in compliance with their \nimmigration laws.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Thinning Elk Herds\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this morning the New York Times wrote an \neditorial I wanted to commend my colleagues' attention to and take some \nissue with. The editorial in the New York Times this morning is called \n``Elk Hunting in the Badlands'' referring, of course, to the Badlands \nof North Dakota where Theodore Roosevelt went out and lived and \nranched. The Badlands of North Dakota encompass, in large part, the \nTheodore Roosevelt National Park, a wonderful park, and the Badlands \nare about as beautiful as anything you will find in this country.\n  Theodore Roosevelt National Park has elk. In 1985, a number of elk \nwere released in the Badlands in the southern section. There were, I \nthink, around 50 head of elk that were released in the Badlands, and \nthat has now grown to somewhere close to 900 elk, which is about 600 \nmore than can reasonably be handled in that area. So they need to cull \nthe elk herd. They need to thin out the elk herd because we can't allow \nit to grow so large that we don't have the carrying capacity on that \nland.\n  So as is the case with too many Federal agencies, once they started \nthinking about how we will cull the elk herd, how we will take care of \nthis problem, they came up with an idea--actually, a number of ideas. \nAmong them was an idea that they would go hire Federal sharpshooters \nand then cull the herd with Federal sharpshooters, and then have \nhelicopters transport out the carcasses once the sharpshooters had done \ntheir job.\n  It seemed to me to be boneheaded to be thinking in those terms. Much \nbetter, it seemed to me, was to develop an approach that was used in \nthe Grand Tetons, where they deputize hunters as volunteers, and each \nvolunteer can take an elk from the park.\n  Now, we don't allow ``hunting'' in national parks. I understand that, \nand I am not proposing an open hunt. But in cases where you have to \nthin a herd, rather than have the Federal Treasury decide that we are \ngoing to hire Federal sharpshooters and then gas up the helicopters so \nyou can transport the carcasses of the dead animals, a much better \nsolution that you could find in almost any cafe in North Dakota, \ntalking to three people over strong coffee, is what about finding \nqualified hunters, deputizing them, allowing each to take an elk and \ntake the meat home; ergo, you haven't cost the Federal Government \nmoney. Under park supervision, you can have deputized, qualified \nhunters whom you could easily qualify, and you have solved the problem.\n  This is not rocket science or a big, significant, complicated issue. \nIt is not a serious illness for which we don't know a cure. This is a \nvery simple issue of culling an elk herd. So I proposed that. The Park \nService said, well, there is a restriction here and there, so we are \ngoing to hold a series of meetings. They held a series of meetings in \nNorth Dakota. As is always the case with bureaucracy, they hold a lot \nof meetings and come up with multiple alternatives, and they study them \nto death until the alternatives are nothing but carcasses. This is an \nissue in North Dakota in the Theodore Roosevelt National Park that has \ngone on for some years. The Park Service had several different \nalternatives. We were waiting for a long while to see what they were \ngoing to announce. And it became clear to me that they weren't going to \nget to a common-sense decision.\n  So I included a provision in the Interior Appropriations bill in \ncommittee last week that is simple and it does as I have said: simply \ncull the elk herd by deputizing qualified hunters, under the \nsupervision of the Park Service, who would be able to take the \nanimals--the carcasses--and the meat out of the Badlands. So that is in \nthe Interior Appropriations bill.\n  The New York Times today takes great issue with that. It says it is \nnot the right proposal at all, it is a terrible idea, that it would \nlegislate a management issue better left to the Secretary of the \nInterior and the National Park Service. Well, the Secretary of the \nInterior was in North Dakota with me about 5 weeks ago, and we had a \nlong discussion about this issue. And I know our former colleague Ken \nSalazar, and I know he would want to come to a conclusion that \nrepresents a deep reservoir of common sense as well for the taxpayers.\n  I understand that we don't want to open hunting seasons in national \nparks. I propose only in a circumstance where, in this national park, \njust as we have done in the Grand Teton National Park, which is \nembedded in law, when you need to thin the herd, don't spend a pile of \ntaxpayers' money, don't gas up helicopters to haul carcasses around. \nDeputize local qualified hunters and allow that. It is not a hunting \nseason. In this case, you are thinning the herd by using qualified \nhunters, who could be deputized and operating under the supervision of \nthe Park Service, to remove the meat from the park. It is very simple.\n  The New York Times is a fine paper, but I doubt that it has a lot of \nhunters on its staff. I know a bit about hunting, and I know a fair \namount about Theodore Roosevelt National Park and the Badlands. I know \nthe people I represent, who looked at this, and most North Dakotans \nsaid: Why don't you get real and use a deep reservoir of common sense \nand solve this problem the right way. Spare taxpayers the expense of \nspending a lot of money, and do what we have done in the Grand Teton \nNational Parks.\n  That is the reason that last week I included the provision in the \nInterior Appropriations bill. I wanted to describe it to my colleagues. \nOn behalf of the American taxpayer, let's do what is right and use some \ncommon sense. This is not that complicated.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1402\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise today because there is a \nreckless amendment on the floor of the Senate to strip this country of \nan important infrastructure element to protect us against terrorism. \nThis amendment is intended to strip the State of New Jersey of critical \nantiterrorism programs.\n  In poll after poll, the people across our country are still deeply \nconcerned about what might happen in the event of a terrorist attack. \nEveryone knows we have people fighting against terror in other \ncountries, but we also have a huge assignment here. Just today, we saw \nthat an attempt to smuggle bomb parts into some government buildings \nwas successful. My God, what do we have to do to say to people in this \nplace: Our primary function is to protect our citizens, and New Jersey \nis one of the 50 States in this country; that if it is a dangerous \nevent that occurs, whether it is a natural disaster or whether it is a \nterrorist attack, we have an obligation to see that these States have \nthe tools to protect themselves.\n  Eliminating funding for these programs will make families in New \nJersey more vulnerable to terrorist attacks and natural disasters. I \npoint out that this area we are particularly focused on--9/11, the \nlargest catastrophe that happened on American soil--is one area, which \nI will describe in just a minute, that is one of the most densely \npopulated in the country, and the risks are very high.\n  Eliminating funds for these programs makes families in New Jersey \nmore vulnerable, and we are concerned about it. Without these \ninvestments, when a terrorist strikes or a hurricane hits, there is a \ngood chance that emergency generators might not go on, firetrucks will \nnot arrive on time, and medical crews might not know where to go.\n  Let's be absolutely clear. New Jersey is no stranger to terrorism. We \nlost 700 New Jersey residents on 9/11, and dozens more still retain \nillnesses that developed as a result of their attempt to protect the \ncitizens who survived.\n  New Jersey is home to what has been labeled by the FBI as the most \ndangerous 2-mile stretch in America for terrorism--that 2-mile distance \nbetween the Port of Newark and Newark Airport. And New Jersey is the \nmost densely populated State in the Nation. In the area around this 2-\nmile stretch terrorists could injure or kill almost 12 million people.\n  Because of the real possibility of an attack, cities and counties \nthroughout New Jersey have created local emergency operations centers. \nWhat else could we ask for? What have the States where there are \ndroughts or hurricanes or earthquakes or volcanic eruptions in this \ncountry had the right to ask for? They have a right to ask for help. \nBut why only provide the help after something has happened if we can \nprevent things from taking place?\n  Because of the real possibility of an attack, we have these local \nemergency operations centers in New Jersey. These centers coordinate \ninformation during an attack and manage the immediate response to \ncataclysmic emergencies. Both the 9/11 Commission report and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security have identified these centers as \nimperative to people's safety and security when a community crisis \noccurs. In fact, according to the 9/11 Commission's senior counsel, if \nthere had been a functional emergency operations center after the \nterrorist attack on the World Trade Center, lives would have been saved \nthat day.\n  Here is what will happen if the amendment being offered by Senators \nMcCain and Feingold is passed: The emergency operations center in Union \nCounty, in my State, will not have an interoperable communications \nnetwork that connects fire, police, and medical officers. The emergency \noperations center in South Orange--one of our cities--will not have a \nworking emergency generator.\n  We can't afford to be without this infrastructure of emergency \nequipment as well as services. And the emergency operations center in \nHackensack will not be able to properly train police officers and \nfirefighters. Make no mistake, emergency operations centers save lives. \nThat is preventive. That is its purpose.\n  The amendment being offered by Senators McCain and Feingold defies \ncommon sense. By jeopardizing emergency operations centers in my State \nand other States across the country, this amendment would make us less \nsecure, and I hope my colleagues will say: No, we can't permit that. We \ncan't permit it in New Jersey and we can't permit it in other places in \nthe country.\n  We have to, as the Boy Scouts say, be prepared. It is the simplest \nlesson we could learn. Prevention is far better than cure.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment that is \ncurrently before us, which would eliminate funding for the emergency \noperations center projects throughout the country, including one in \nProvidence, RI.\n  First, this issue hinges on several critical factors. One is, \nultimately, public safety. We have experienced, over the last several \nyears, a terrorist threat that could impair all kinds of communities \naround this country. In fact, on the Fourth of July, several aircraft \nin Istanbul were stopped and searched because there was intelligence \ndeveloped by both the German Government and the United States \nindicating that there might be a threat to a commercial aircraft, as we \nwitnessed on 9/11. The bottom line is, these emergency operations \ncenters are critical.\n  There is another aspect, of course, too, and that is that we are in a \nterrible situation economically. In Rhode Island, we are just a tad \nbehind Michigan in terms of unemployment, with 12.1 percent of our \nworkforce out of work--nearly 3 points higher than the national \naverage--and this funding not only will meet a critical need for public \nsafety but also help a little bit in terms of getting our economy \nmoving forward.\n  It will allow the city of Providence and the Providence Emergency \nManagement Agency to move closer to completing needed improvements to \nits emergency operations center. This project will increase the space \nat the Providence EOC to ensure a ready 24-hour presence and \naccommodate a second complement of staff that will be required onsite, \nshould an emergency incident occur. In undertaking this work, at least \n20 construction jobs will be produced. In Rhode Island, that is a good \nproject.\n  In 2004, the city of Providence designated a site within the city to \nserve as the headquarters for the Providence EMA and has worked since \nthen to make improvements to the facility so it can serve the city \nduring a disaster or attack. The Providence EMA completed the first \nphase of the work on the facility this year but must expand its \nexisting building in order to make shortfalls that were identified in a \n2007 Federal Emergency Management Agency Technical Assistance Team \nreview. These shortfalls, as pointed out by the Federal Government, \nincluded inadequate space within the existing facility for \nadministrative and emergency operations and a lack of adequate force \nprotection, physical security, and survivability measures. According to \nProvidence EMA, up to $3 million will be needed to complete this work. \nAgain, this was the result of a study by the Federal authorities as to \nthe adequacy of this facility. While FEMA has committed resources to \nthis project, Providence EMA does not have the funding to carry out all \nthe improvements that are required.\n  But beyond serving the needs of Providence, it plays a leading role \nin our overall State operations. The Greater Providence Metropolitan \nMedical Response System and the Providence Urban Area Security \nInitiative\n\n[[Page S7234]]\n\nregions include Providence and eight surrounding communities, \nrepresenting 60 percent of the State's population. Let me say that \nagain. This EOC, although it is placed in Providence, plays a critical \nrole in coordinating the emergency response for 60 percent of the \npeople of Rhode Island. This is an important facility not just for one \ncommunity but for a significant number of areas. So this will be a \nfacility that is not only necessary but extremely efficient and \nintegral to the protection of a significant number of my constituents.\n  While I understand the administration believes that funding should be \nallocated through a risk management framework, I support the \ncommittee's decision to fund these projects. For my State, we know the \nfacility is needed. We know the improvements are needed. The Federal \nauthorities have pointed that out to us. It will not only protect a \nsmall portion of one city, but it will effectively protect a larger \nportion in terms of population to my State.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from the Mayor \nof Providence and the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency \nregarding the project be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           City of Providence,\n\n                                     Providence, RI, July 7, 2009.\n     Subject: Providence Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Phase \n         II Funding Request.\n\n     Hon. Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Federal Courthouse,\n     Providence, RI.\n       Dear Senator Reed, I write to express my strong support for \n     federal funding necessary to upgrade the functionality of the \n     City of Providence's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and to \n     ask for your assistance in securing this funding.\n       Following a 2007 on-site Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency (FEMA) Technical Assistance Team's review of the EOC, \n     two major shortfalls were identified: (1) inadequate space \n     within the existing facility for administrative and emergency \n     operations and (2) the lack of adequate force protection, \n     physical security, and survivability measures. Federal \n     funding for the facility expansion will allow the City to \n     attain a resilient, modern, efficient and effective regional \n     EOC, capable of coordinating regional emergency response, \n     redundant interoperable communications and rapid public \n     warning.\n       The Providence Emergency Management Agency is responsible \n     for managing major emergencies in the City along with the \n     added responsibility for the Greater Providence Metropolitan \n     Medical Response System (GP-MMRS) and Providence Urban Area \n     Security Initiative (PUASI) regions. With limited EOC \n     interoperability in the eight surrounding communities \n     associated with MMRS and UASI programs, the improved \n     Providence EOC facility will be fully ready and equipped to \n     handle incidents which bisect traditional political \n     boundaries and provide needed incident support and \n     coordination to neighboring communities within the region, \n     thereby providing benefit to an estimated 60% of the State's \n     total population.\n       On 8 April 2009, after competing nationally in the DHS FY09 \n     Emergency Operations Centers Grant Program, Providence was \n     one of the few cities that met and exceeded the strict \n     federal criteria and was awarded the maximum amount of \n     $1,000,000. We are requesting additional funding to fully \n     complete the project.\n       This funding is crucial for improving emergency \n     preparedness, response and recovery by ensuring the City has \n     the most advanced facility and capabilities able to provide \n     time critical flexibility, sustainability, security, \n     survivability and interoperability should a catastrophe occur \n     within or adjacent to our City.\n       I respectfully request your assistance in securing the \n     additional funds necessary for this project. Should you have \n     any questions, please feel free to contact me at (401) 421-\n     7740.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               David N. Cicilline,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Military Staff,\n\n\n                                  Emergency Management Agency,\n\n                                       Cranston, RI, July 7, 2009.\n     Subject: Providence Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Phase \n         II Funding Request.\n\n     Hon. Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Federal Courthouse,\n     Providence, RI.\n       Dear Senator Reed: I am writing in support of Mayor David \n     N. Cicilline's request for federal funding necessary to \n     upgrade the functionality of the City of Providence's \n     Emergency Operations Center (EOC).\n       Two major shortfalls exist for all the Operations Centers \n     in the State of Rhode Island: (1) inadequate space for \n     administrative and emergency operations and (2) the lack of \n     adequate force protection, physical security, and \n     survivability measures. Federal funding for these shortfalls \n     in Rhode Island are essential to ensuring efficient and \n     effective capability for coordinating regional emergency \n     response, redundant interoperable communications and rapid \n     public warning by the state of Rhode Island Emergency \n     Management Agency.\n       Local and Regional EOCs, like the one operated by the \n     Providence Emergency Management Agency, provide a critical \n     link to the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency (RIEMA) \n     and its EOC enhancing RIEMA's ability as the lead \n     coordinating agency for the State.\n       The State of Rhode Island has recognized the need for \n     regional capabilities and this funding proposal meets that \n     standard. While the City of Providence has received the \n     maximum amount of $1,000,000 from the DHS FY09 Emergency \n     Operations Centers Grant Program and continues to receive \n     Port Security and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grant \n     funding; the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency (RIEMA) \n     fully supports the Providence application.\n       This funding will improve emergency preparedness, response \n     and recovery in Providence. Enhancing the EOC in Providence \n     will ensure that Rhode Island continues to have the most \n     advanced facilities and capabilities able to provide time \n     critical flexibility, sustainability, security, survivability \n     and interoperability should a catastrophe occur within the \n     city.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   J. David Smith,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the fiscal \nyear 2010 Homeland Security Appropriations bill and a program within it \nwhich is very important to my home State and also to many other States \nhere in this great Nation. First, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember, and their staffs--the staffs, as we know, do so much great work \naround here--for their leadership and foresight in crafting such an \nimportant piece of legislation. I thank the chairman for taking my \nthoughts and considerations into mind when they drafted this \nlegislation, as well as the thoughts and considerations of many of my \ncolleagues. This has truly been a bipartisan effort and shows the \nSenate can get good results when we work together.\n  The funding in this bill covers a wide range of activities from \nprotecting our Nation from terrorist events to strengthening our local \npreparedness and response activities. Today I rise in response to \nopposition to the Feingold-McCain amendment to strike funding for \nemergency operations centers. The most fundamental responsibility of \ngovernment is protecting the lives and safety of the public. Arkansas \nfinds itself as No. 10 on a list of the 59 States and territories and \ndistricts with the most presidentially declared major disasters. It is \nnot a welcome ranking, but it is a measurement of the risks Arkansans \nface.\n  Since 9/11, State and local governments have faced increased \nemergency preparedness responsibilities and costs for public safety. \nNow, in the midst of continued all-hazard risks, State and local \ngovernments are cutting spending on many critical programs, but \nemergencies and disasters will not wait for our economy to improve. \nReports following Hurricane Katrina's response found multiple flaws in \nsituational awareness, command and control, logistical tracking, and \ncommunications. Fully capable emergency operational centers at the \nState and local level are essential to a comprehensive national \nemergency management system.\n  EOCs require basic resources to operate smoothly and effectively in a \ntime of crisis. Some of the resources funded through EOCs include a \nhardened and safe location for emergency management staff, \ncommunications for reliable and accurate information gathering, and \neffective, usable technology for tracking all resources, including \npersonnel and emergency supplies.\n  For example, the city of North Little Rock, AR's Office of Emergency \nServices will be a recipient of these funds. This office is one of the \nemergency operations centers tasked with providing disaster assistance \nand support to a population of over 500,000 people in the central \nArkansas area--not just North Little Rock but the entire area. Although \nthe office's current personnel work very hard and are very diligent\n\n[[Page S7235]]\n\nabout providing meaningful services to the area, the age and size of \nits location limit its ability to house the needed technologies and \nstaff to adequately serve central Arkansas in the event of emergency.\n  Again, we have lots of emergencies there, as we will talk about. \nThese funds will be used to address these limitations and provide the \nneeded safety assurances.\n  Recently it has become popular to attack so-called earmarks. I agree \nthat congressionally directed spending needs to be transparent. I think \nthe Senate has already taken care of that. Its Members should be \naccountable for the programs they support. I think the Senate has taken \ncare of that as well.\n  I am proud to support funding for emergency operations centers. I \nalso believe the Representatives of the States and the congressional \ndistricts have an in-depth understanding of the needs and priorities in \ntheir States, rather than employees serving in Federal executive \ndepartments and agencies.\n  There is now great accountability in the congressionally directed \nspending in appropriations bills. The public can easily review \ncongressionally directed spending requests and funding on Web sites \nfully accessible to the public. In fact, the Constitution gives this \nauthority to the Congress.\n  The Constitution, article I, section 9, says:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by law.\n\n  That is what we are doing here today and that is what the \nappropriations process is about, this constitutionally required system \nwe have, where Congress controls the purse strings.\n  For all these reasons, I voice my strong support for the funding in \nthe underlying bill that supports emergency operations centers. I ask \nmy colleagues, very respectfully, even though it is well intended, to \noppose the Feingold-McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, we are going to vote, I understand, \nshortly. It is an important discussion. I am glad we had a little \nexchange about it.\n  I first want to respond about what the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nLautenberg, had to say about this. He expressed concern that because of \nmy amendment there would be no funding for emergency operations centers \nif this amendment passes. That is absolutely incorrect. It is the \nopposite.\n  To the contrary, there will be $20 million for emergency operations \ncenters that will be awarded competitively to those most in need. \nSenator Lautenberg cited the 9/11 Commission endorsement for these \ncenters. Yes, they did. What he failed to note is that those at the \nCommission recommended that the Homeland Security grants be awarded on \nthe basis of risk, not earmarks such as the one requested by Senator \nLautenberg.\n  Of course, there may well be a need in New Jersey, and I respect \nthat. I am not saying that program would not qualify under a merit-\nbased analysis. But it is not based on actual risk analysis and that is \nthe problem. If there are worthy projects the Senator has requested, \nthen I hope he would be confident that these communities in New Jersey \nwill be able to compete successfully for the grants.\n  I am sure it was not intentional but it is misleading to make the \nSenate believe that these centers are being taken away by my amendment. \nIt is the opposite. In fact, if you look at the way this currently \noperates, if we do not change this, currently the Senate bill directs \nthat half of all these emergency operations center funds will go to \nonly 10 States. The House earmarks all of these funds, and a fourth of \nthe predisaster mitigation funds. Last year, FEMA only funded a tiny \nfraction of the emergency operations center applications it received \nbecause 64 percent of the funding went to earmarks.\n  On this program the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from \nArkansas were talking about, 10 States get 50 percent of it and 40 \nStates have to share the other 50 percent. What are the odds that that \ncomports with any kind of rational analysis of real risk? Very small. I \nguarantee, because they are earmarks, that analysis was not done. It is \nnot possible, because they were not put in the context of the \ncomparative risk that is involved.\n  To respond to some of the remarks of my good friend from Arkansas, I \nunderstand the Senate has not earmarked any of the predisaster \nmitigation funds. However, if my amendment is not agreed to, FEMA will \nhave to deal with the earmarks in the House report. I do not question \nthat some of these earmarked requests may be legitimate. But if they \nare legitimate, then they should have no trouble in a fair competition \nfor the funds based on merit and risk.\n  I think this is the key, even for those who support earmarks in \nanother context. The problem here is that these are highly technical \nprojects. We are talking about communications equipment, flood \nprevention projects that require engineering studies and the like. We \ndo not have the expertise in Congress to make an objective \ndetermination of which projects are the most worthwhile. So who gets \nthe funding? Those who are somehow able to get an earmark without any \nreal analysis, without any real consideration of the merit as to who is \nat the greatest risk, where in the country we need to think about these \ndisasters more than others.\n\n  That is no way to think about potential earmarks. Earmarks are sent \nto small communities to set up operations centers that do not need them \nwhile State centers remain unfunded. During recent flooding in \nWisconsin----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding that the Senate bill the Senator \nhas described directs half of the emergency operations funds to only 10 \nStates, and there are 50 States in America. But half of these emergency \noperations center funds--it doesn't make much geographic sense, if you \nlook. Funds are directed at Illinois, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, \nMontana, Washington, Rhode Island--East and West, all over the country. \nMaybe my friend from Wisconsin can describe what do they have in \ncommon, 9 of these 10 States have in common?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I can tell you one thing they don't \nhave in common is any analysis of the need or requirement they be done \nin their communities. What they have in common is somebody stuck an \nearmark in this bill.\n  It would be different, I say to my friend from Arizona, if these 10 \nStates had shown on the merits they have the risk in their communities \nand they need to get ahead of these disaster situations. That would be \ngreat. In that case I could support that only 10 States get half the \nmoney. But when there is absolutely no analysis and where this actually \nundercuts the very integrity of the programs they are trying to \nprotect, the lives of the American people, and leaves the other States \nto fend for themselves with regard to 40 States fighting for the other \n50 percent--this is a terrible way to protect the American people from \ndisaster.\n  As an answer to the Senator, I would say there is only one \nexplanation. You and I know what it is. Somebody got an earmark and \nthat is all.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There is an additional question I have to my friend from \nWisconsin. Isn't it true that the administration has requested that \nthis entire program be canceled?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The entire program?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. They want the program merit based. They want the \nprogram to be based on actual need for these emergency operating \nsectors.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true that the Office of Management and Budget \nrecommended this as one of the programs to be eliminated, as the \nPresident announced?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. They want it eliminated, Madam President, because of \nthis practice my friend and I are discussing. Because of the use of \nearmarks, which undercuts the integrity of the program, they want to \nsay this is not worth continuing. By this amendment we will have the \neffect of restoring its legitimacy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In other words, the administration believes we need \nemergency operations center funds because of the requirements of \nhomeland security. But this process is so badly flawed that they want \nto go back to do away with this and go back to the merit and needs-\nbased system, is that correct?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is absolutely right, Madam President, I say to the\n\n[[Page S7236]]\n\nSenator from Arizona. The President of the United States has pressed to \nensure these funds are awarded competitively and on the basis of risk. \nThat failing, which is what will happen if we do not agree to this \namendment, the recommendation is to not go forward.\n  I accept the premise that so many Members have identified here, that \nthis is a worthwhile program, as long as it is based on merit and need. \nSo the Senator from Arizona is correct in that. The President of the \nUnited States is clear on that. We have a chance here to fix this \nprogram, get away from the earmarks, and make sure it can continue; \notherwise, there will be continuing efforts to say this is not what was \nintended.\n  Obviously, it was not what was intended. Yes, it is one thing to get \nan earmark for a museum somewhere in your State and that does take away \nfrom the general funds--and the Senator from Arizona and I have strong \nfeelings about that--but it is another thing to use this in a situation \nwhere a program has specifically been set up to figure out where in the \nUnited States is the most important that people have money to be able \nto do what they need to do to protect the lives of the people in their \ncommunities because of a particular vulnerability to disaster.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator respond to one more question? So the \nSenator is not saying we do not need emergency operations centers in \nAmerica? We would not be eliminating the need for emergency operations \ncenters, let me be perfectly clear. But what he is saying is we need to \neliminate them in this form, which does not give the highest and most \nneeded priority to these emergency operations centers around the \ncountry?\n  In other words, we still have a threat to our Nation's security, but \nthis is not the way to meet it. We can come up with a far better and \nmore efficient way.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. We do need a program for emergency operations centers. \nWhat we do not need is another earmark trough for people to feed at. If \nthe program becomes just that, which I fear it is becoming, then it \ndoes not stand on its own merit. This is truly an opportunity to \nprotect it.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for his questions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I listened with interest to the questions and the \nconversations concerning Senator Feingold's amendment. I rise to \nstrongly support this amendment. You know, one of the fantasies around \nhere--and I yield to the long experience of my two colleagues on \nfighting this battle on earmarks--is this fantasy that the money for \nearmarks is created out of nothing; that somehow the money for earmarks \njust lands on everyone's desk and no programs are hurt by the \nearmarking process; that no money is taken from worthy projects for \nearmarking.\n  Truth be known, I can give example after example in the budget that \nover the years good competitive programs have been cut while earmarking \nhas skyrocketed. The Byrne grants are a good example. Byrne grants are \na competitive process in every State where they can compete for law \nenforcement based on need, decided at the local basis.\n  What has happened to the funding for Byrne grants over the years? It \nhas dwindled, while in that very same budget earmarks have steadily and \ncontinually grown over the last decade.\n  This is a perfect example of robbing Peter to pay Paul. This \namendment will say: You must compete for these dollars based on need. \nIs that not how we should be spending the public money? Last year FEMA \nreceived a total of 675 individual emergency operations center project \napplications; 675 applications they received for this funding last \nyear.\n  They were only able to select 22 of them for funding. You know why? \nBecause 64 percent of the funding went to earmarks. So because of the \nearmarking, there was less money for worthy projects that, maybe on \nmerit and need, were much more important to protect people than the \nearmarking process.\n  This is a textbook example of taking a pot of money and deciding \nthrough some waving of a magic wand that it goes individually to 10 \nStates without any discussion as to whether those are the 10 most needy \nprojects or 10 most needy States--no discussion whatsoever.\n  In my State there have been years where we have been under a constant \nemergency declaration: flooding, ice storms, tornados. We have \nfloodplains. In fact, the National Association of Floodplain Managers \nsupports Senator Feingold's amendment. Do you know why they support \nSenator Feingold's amendment? They say it is causing floodplain \nmanagers around the country to quit planning to mitigate because they \ncan short-circuit the process and just go for an earmark.\n  Why do the work and plan and compete as 1 of 22 out of 675 if you \nknow the easiest way and the best way to do it is to hope and pray your \nMember is on the right committee? Just say it like it is. Just hope and \npray your Member is on the right committee.\n  So this is a great opportunity for everyone who believes we need to \nbe careful with the way we spend our money to be counted. This is a \ngreat opportunity because this is very clear this money is being taken \nfrom projects and being earmarked for projects. As a result, 40 States \nare going to have less than a 50-percent chance to participate in this \nkind of emergency funding.\n  I strongly support Senator Feingold's amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to thank the Senator from Missouri not only \nfor her comments about this particular issue but her dedication to \nreform, transparency, and to making sure the American taxpayers' \ndollars are wisely and appropriately spent. It has been a pleasure \nworking with her on various reform issues. I would argue this may not \nbe the last time the three of us are on the floor of the Senate.\n  When you look at the approval ratings of Congress, not just now but \nfor a long time, we are not held in the highest of esteem, and \nsometimes for good reason. Sometimes for good reason. We have ongoing \nscandals concerning the use of public funds for earmarking and \nporkbarrel projects and rewards to Members of Congress that have caused \nthem to be in Federal court and, indeed, even Members of Congress \nresiding in Federal prison.\n  This is an important amendment because as the votes line up I think \nwe will see--on both sides of the aisle--we will see members of the \nAppropriations Committee probably voting on the theory that if they \nlose one they will lose a number of other efforts to eliminate earmarks \nand porkbarrel spending.\n  I hope that would not be the case because this is particularly \negregious, particularly egregious. This legislation which Senator \nFeingold's amendment is intended to cure is about homeland security, \nand to direct half of the emergency operations center funds to only 10 \nStates obviously is a gross misuse of the taxpayers' dollars and \ncould--and could--conceivably cause us not to fund emergency operations \ncenters that are more badly needed and could then put our homeland \nsecurity perhaps in some jeopardy, or certainly not ensuring our \nhomeland security to the best and wisest expenditure of tax dollars.\n  Could I just remind my colleagues, last year's appropriators provided \n$35 million for the Emergency Operations Center Grant Program but \nearmarked $12.5 million of them. The Department of Homeland Security \nreceived 613 applications asking for $264 million for the purposes of \nthe grant program to construct emergency operations centers.\n  There is clearly a need for this money in the States. It is \nunfortunate that many of the applicants were turned down by the \nDepartment because there was no money left because we had already spent \nhalf of it on earmarked projects which had no competition.\n  Again, I want to emphasize to my colleagues, this is not a matter of \nwhether we need emergency operations centers. It is simply a matter of \nwhether we are going to wisely and appropriately use the taxpayers' \ndollars where it is most needed. There has been no screening, no \nauthorization, no hearing held on this issue, and it was put in, \nobviously, in an appropriations bill in an inappropriate fashion.\n\n[[Page S7237]]\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment by the Senator from \nWisconsin. I congratulate him on proposing this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today in defense of the $1 \nmillion that was allocated in this bill for an emergency operations \ncenter in Mount Vernon, NY. Mount Vernon is the eleventh most densely \npopulated city in the United States of America, the eighth largest city \nin the State of New York, and is located on the immediate border of the \nlargest city in this country, New York City.\n  Mount Vernon has three Metro-North train stations, which could \nprovide a vital route for citizens exiting New York City in the event \nof an emergency. Thus, Mount Vernon is a first line of defense and a \n``safe haven'' for millions who live and work in New York City.\n  In order to facilitate a proper and effective response to any \nemergency incident, Mount Vernon needs an emergency operations center. \nIf, God forbid, another September 11 type incident occurs in New York \nCity, which, as on September 11, compromised the communications system \nand emergency services in the city, it is imperative that we have a \nlocal emergency operations center nearby.\n  New York City is one of the largest terrorist targets in the country, \nand it does not make sense to be cutting emergency operations where we \ncould be the most vulnerable. The threat of terrorism has not \ndiminished, and our preparations should not either.\n  At present, the city of Mount Vernon does not have an emergency \noperations center for the managing and mitigation of a major incident. \nAt best, the Mount Vernon Police Department's Field Command Center \nvehicle could coordinate an incident. However, this would greatly \nhamper police operations and the ability to manage a multiagency \nincident.\n  Utilizing an existing city facility would reduce costs associated \nwith the project. This is an example of good government: repurposing an \nexisting building to fulfill a new need and building important \ninfrastructure to protect our citizens in an emergency.\n  However, if the Federal Government does not fund this emergency \ncenter, the local community will have to raise property taxes in order \nto make the upgrades necessary. Westchester County has some of the \nhighest taxes in the country and should not be forced to pay more in \norder to provide a resource that benefits the entire region.\n  Terrorism is not a local problem, it is a national problem. So it is \nonly right that the National Government makes the kinds of investments \nthat can keep our communities safe.\n  I oppose this amendment. I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  In response to the arguments that were made on the Senate floor, in \nall due respect I think the judgment of a Senator knowing what is best \nfor their State can usually overcome the judgment of any agency that \nmakes that decision in a grant-making process because they know what \nare the most important investment needs for their communities, and our \nvoices should be heard. That is why in this instance, it is very \nimportant that an earmark of this nature that is directed to protect us \nfrom terrorism and create a safe haven for citizens in the judgment and \ndiscretion of the Senator from New York is very much needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the problem with this is the earmarks. It \nis not that New York may not need this. It is that you have taken 50 \npercent of the money for 10 States. The other 40 States will have to \ndivide the remaining portion of this money for those types of emergency \ncenters and the calculation of risk. It ought to be true competition \nbased on real risk. There is no question New York has greater risk than \nOklahoma; that I do not deny. But the fact is, we have taken half the \nmoney away from 40 other States and said: You have to compete on the \nremaining portion, and you may have requirements greater than those \nearmarked in the bill.\n  I support this amendment. I wholeheartedly ask my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. In response to my colleague, with regard to this \nparticular earmark, New York has only received one earmark for $1 \nmillion. In relation to the amount of risk and the necessity for an \nemergency response center, the need is great. Our judgment, as Senators \nfrom New York, as to what is the best investment for all of New York in \nterms of an emergency response investment is helpful to this process. \nIt should not necessarily be left only to a grant process. Much of the \nmoney is still available to a grant-making process which is a great \nprocess because it does have competition and we hopefully get the \ngreatest good for the greatest need. There is a balance where the \njudgment of a Senator or a Congress Member is very important in that \nconversation. The agencies and the administration can make their own \njudgments. That is why a combination of targeted earmarks on the one \nhand and other investments through a grant process on the other hand is \nprobably a better balance and approach, because we are getting the \njudgment of all parts of the three branches of government--at least two \nof them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro temproe. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nFeingold-McCain amendment. I do not believe this amendment serves the \ncountry well as far as it applies to the reality of public safety in \nrural America and the northern border.\n  It is important to start by noting that this is about people, about \npublic safety, about homeland security, about firefighters and other \nfirst responders in our frontier communities and across rural America. \nSpecifically, it is about protecting folks in and around the greater \nFlathead Valley region of northwest Montana.\n  The city of Whitefish is 60 miles from the northern border, nearby to \nareas where smuggling and illegal crossings are known to occur. In \nplaces such as Whitefish, local law enforcement often ends up assisting \nBorder Patrol in response to suspicious activity at or near the border. \nLocal law enforcement also helps out with security around and awareness \nabout wildfires during Montana's fire season. Many of the fires up in \nnorthwestern Montana occur on Federal lands. When the Feds need \nassistance, whether it is the Border Patrol or the Forest Service or \nICE, they depend on resources of local communities such as the \ncommunity of Whitefish. In Whitefish and similar communities, local law \nenforcement works closely not only with those Federal agencies, but \ninteragency cooperation is a fact of life in northwest Montana. That \ncosts local governments money which too often they do not have with an \nunfunded mandate.\n  Special interest groups located right here in Washington on \nConnecticut Avenue have called the Whitefish Emergency Operations \nCenter a pork project. Unfortunately, I question whether they know \nwhere Montana is, much less northwest Montana or the city of Whitefish \nor the conditions that evolve around this project. I do, as a Senator \nfrom Montana. Unfortunately, they use a figure that is off by more than \none-third. I suggest this is further evidence that the folks in \nWashington, DC, simply do not understand the State of Montana as well \nas its congressional delegation.\n  I wish to be clear about what this amendment does and does not do. \nThis amendment would not save the Federal Government a single penny. It \nwould simply give the money back to FEMA to spend as bureaucrats, as \nunelected officials here in Washington see fit.\n  Before 2007, there is no doubt that the Senate appropriations process \nwas abused. Some lawmakers buried their special pet projects deep in \nlarge bills where they had little or no chance to be reviewed by \nCongress or withstand public scrutiny. That is how the taxpayers ended \nup footing a bill for the\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n\ninfamous bridge to nowhere. The very first bill I voted for, back in \n2007, as a Senator was legislation to clean up the system and restore \ntransparency and accountability to the appropriations process. Now \nevery project secured by a Member of Congress has his or her name \nattached to it--no more secret requests made in the dark of night.\n  I am glad my name is next to the Whitefish Emergency Operations \nCenter project. All Senators are now required to post requests we make \non behalf of constituents on our Web sites. Everyone can do it. I \ninvite folks to go to my Web site, tester.senate.gov/\nappropriations.cfm, or they may want to see the distinguished \nRepublican leader's request at mcconnell.senate.gov/approps.cfm.\n  The point is not that the Republican leader has asked for specific \nprojects. The Democratic leader has also. The point is that no Senator \nis above the transparency requirements instituted in the last couple of \nyears. That is a good thing. It is also a good thing that we can have \nthis debate here today.\n  Why is this particular project needed, a project in Whitefish, MT? \nOver the last 10 years, the population of Whitefish has doubled. The \nfire department is transitioning from a volunteer department to a full-\ntime professional department, as the call volume has increased, as has \nthe population, over the last 7 years. The police department has seen \ncall volume increase by over 200 percent in that same time. The current \nbuilding is not big enough to house the growing needs of the city's \nfirst responders. The current building is in a 100-year flood plain and \nan earthquake zone. Why does that matter? It matters because Montana's \nDisaster and Emergency Services office has done a number of scenarios \nof massive disasters in Montana. Most of them revolve around a \ncatastrophic earthquake that disables emergency operations in multiple \ncities. That is one of the most likely disaster scenarios in our State \nand this region of our State.\n  I will fight to make people around this body understand that not \nevery disaster in this country happens in a major population center. \nFolks in rural America deserve to have effective and efficient \nemergency response also.\n  The new Emergency Operations Center in Whitefish will solve several \ndeficiencies identified by a 2006 facility needs assessment. \nInterestingly enough, Whitefish used the Department of Homeland \nSecurity criteria for this study. The center will provide \ninteroperability and improved efficiency for ICE, Border Patrol, FBI, \nSecret Service, DEA, Montana Highway Patrol, and several other regional \nlaw enforcement agencies.\n  The EOC Grant Program is intended to improve emergency management and \npreparedness capabilities by supporting flexible, sustainable, secure, \nand interoperable emergency operations centers with a focus on \naddressing identified deficiencies and needs. That is exactly what this \nproject does.\n  I oppose this amendment for many of the same reasons as the senior \nSenator from Montana. As elected officials from our States, it is our \nobligation to know what the needs are out there much better, I believe, \nthan an appointed bureaucrat.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I speak today about the importance of \nretaining funding for the Providence Emergency Operations Center in the \nfiscal year 2010 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act.\n  The Providence Emergency Operations Center coordinates emergency \nresponse for 60 percent of the population of Rhode Island. I visited \nthis state-of-the-art facility earlier this year and was very impressed \nby the caliber of its technology, its seamless integration of many \ndifferent local law enforcement and emergency response agencies, and \nthose who stand at the ready to protect the people of our state against \ndisaster, terrorism, and other threats.\n  This funding will help make necessary improvements to the facility, \nincluding expanding space and improving security and survivability, \naddressing shortfalls identified in a 2007 review by the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency. These funds are also expected to create \napproximately 20 new construction jobs, which are urgently needed in my \nState, where the unemployment rate has reached a staggering 12.1 \npercent.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Feingold amendment so that we do \nnot deprive Rhode Islanders of the resources needed to meet federal \nrequirements for effective emergency response efforts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that there be 10 minutes of \ndebate prior to a vote in relation to the Feingold amendment No. 1402, \nthat no amendment be in order to the amendment prior to a vote in \nrelation thereto, with the time equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Murray and Feingold or their designees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let's be clear. We just heard two good examples by the \nSenators from New York and Montana. These are not separate programs \nthey have fought for. They are not even separate earmarks. These are \nearmarks carved out of a program for emergency operations centers that \nwere supposed to be based on the merits, a comparative analysis that \ncan be highly technical of where it is most needed and where it is less \nneeded, so there is some kind of opportunity for all of us to compete \nopenly for these dollars for our States to make sure the American \npeople are protected to the maximum extent.\n  We have the Senator from New York talking about Mount Vernon being \nnear New York City, where, of course, the 9/11 attacks were. That is \nunderstandable. But if it is that strong of a case, why can't it be \nmade on the merits? Then we have a completely different kind of place--\nMontana. I will not say for a minute that the Senator from Montana \ndoesn't have a case. He talks about the greater Flathead Valley. Yes, \nhe would know more about that place than anybody else in the Senate, \nbut does that mean his case for that particular location is so \noverwhelming that it should not be reviewed in comparison to those of \nus who have similar concerns?\n  A majority of my State was covered with flooding waters last June. We \ndid not have an adequate emergency operations center. We would like to \nbe able to compete for these dollars in an open and fair manner through \na program that has been designated for that purpose on the merits, not \nbecause somebody happened to sit on a particular committee or was able \nto get an earmark. Whether it is a threat to human lives in New York or \nMontana, if these Senators are confident they can make the case, they \nshould make the case on the merits.\n  I say to the Senator from New York, whom I am thrilled to have in \nthis body, Senators should be able to exercise their judgment. The \nSenators of this body exercised their judgment to help create the \nEmergency Operations Center Program. That program, which Senators help \ncreate, is supposed to be based on merit. That was the judgment of the \nSenators, not that some individual Senator would say: Hey, I heard from \nsomebody in my area that this is important, and that should override \nthe will of the Senate and the government that this be done in this \nway.\n  I remind everybody, the President has suggested that this program \nshould not even continue unless we can get to merit-based consideration \nbecause that is the whole idea behind it. When the lives of American \npeople are threatened by disasters and terrorist threats, our decisions \nshould have something to do with the comparative needs and risks to the \nAmerican people, not whether somebody is able to get an earmark.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment to \neliminate congressionally directed allocations of emergency operations \ncenter construction funding. The committee bill before the Senate today \ncontains emergency operations center funding of about $20 million. This \nemergency operations center construction program is an authorized \nactivity under the Stafford Act. The 9/11 Act which was approved by the \nSenate on a vote of 85 to 8 in July of 2007 reaffirmed this program by \napproving an amendment to the Stafford Act to adjust the Federal cost \nshare for these projects from 50 percent to 75 percent.\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\n  Emergency operations centers are critical to the effective \ncoordination of emergency response, which we all know is necessary to \nsave lives. The State of Texas, for example, has used these Federal \nfunds to improve communications equipment and warning systems for its \nemergency operations center. The Texas EOC was used effectively in \nPresidentially declared disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, \nDean, and others; major flooding in El Paso and Wichita Falls; \nwildfires in 2006, 2008, and 2009; a tornado in Eagle Pass; and, of \ncourse, the recent H1N1 influenza outbreak. The EOC in each one of \nthose cases was the critical node for communication between the layers \nof government.\n  The OMB assertion that the EOC program duplicates other programs is \nreally without merit. While EOC construction is an allowable activity \nunder several grant programs, State and local governments have not \nchosen to use that discretion for this purpose.\n  Since 2004, only $16.6 million out of the $11.5 billion of other DHS \ngrant funds has been used by State and local governments for EOC \nconstruction, only one-tenth of 1 percent. The Emergency Management \nPerformance Grants Program has provided a mere $755,000 to EOC \nconstruction. It is clear that the demands for the funds in these \nprograms is great. In order to effectively administer emergency \nmanagement programs and to equip and train first responders, there is \nnot sufficient funding for EOC construction. In this committee bill, \nover half of the total amount made available for emergency operations \ncenter construction is available for competitive award.\n  I have listened to the Senator make some very persuasive arguments. I \nremind all of us that what we are providing is accountability and \nvisibility for where those dollars are going. It is not being done in \nsome bureaucracy where we cannot see it. It is laid out in this bill, \nand we have heard the arguments of many Senators here on why those \nfunds are being appropriated to where they are. So I urge opposition to \nthe amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair, how much time \nremains on each side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2 minutes 24 seconds to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin and 1 minute 54 seconds to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Washington. I want to be clear because it is very easy for people \nlistening to this debate to think we are trying to eliminate the \nEmergency Operations Center Program. That is the opposite of the case. \nThis cleans it up and makes sure every State can fairly compete for it. \nSo the truth is, this earmarking is the opposite of the accountability \nthe Senator from Washington refers to. It creates the absence of \naccountability. There is no real scientific or needs-based analysis. It \nis just which Senator can get an earmark. It not only harms the \nprogram, it is gutting the program when 10 States, without serious \nanalysis, get 50 percent of the money, and 40 States have to compete \nfor all the rest.\n  The Feingold-McCain amendment would prevent earmarking of FEMA \npredisaster mitigation and emergency operations center grants. It does \nnot eliminate them. While we may not all agree on the appropriateness \nof earmarking in general, I hope we can agree that grants that are \nsupposed to protect Americans from terrorist attacks and natural \ndisasters should be awarded on the basis of merits, not politics.\n  Currently, the Senate bill directs half of the emergency operations \ncenter funds to only 10 States. The House earmarks all of these funds \nand a fourth of the predisaster mitigation funds. Last year, FEMA only \nfunded a tiny fraction of the emergency operations center applications \nit received because 64 percent of the funding went to earmarks. That is \nnot accountability. That is ruining a perfectly legitimate program the \npeople set up to help people face the possibility of disaster.\n  Many past earmarks would not have even qualified for the grants under \nthe established guidelines. Again, President Obama has pressed to \nensure that these funds are awarded competitively and on the basis of \nrisk; and he has said, if not, the program should be canceled. We can \nmake sure this does not happen by adopting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe Feingold amendment, No. 1402, which the Senate will vote on \nshortly.\n  This amendment would restrict Congress's ability to direct spending \nto meritorious projects for emergency operations centers and \npredisaster mitigation projects.\n  The Senate bill includes funding for the North Louisiana Regional \nEmergency Operations Center in Lincoln Parish, which is a project that \nI supported, and I would like to say a few words about it.\n  This EOC will serve 29 parishes in Louisiana that represent 43 \npercent of the State's land mass and 27 percent of its total \npopulation.\n  It will provide north Louisiana with a command center for emergency \nresponse throughout the region and in bordering States. It will also \nserve as a staging area for emergency responders and resources and \noffer training opportunities for firefighting and public safety.\n  Louisiana conducted the largest evacuation in American history last \nyear as Hurricane Gustav approached our shores, and north Louisiana \nsheltered a majority of those evacuees. When Hurricane Ike struck 12 \ndays later, north Louisiana received thousands of additional evacuees \nfrom Texas who fled that storm's path.\n  Mr. President, I have received letters of support from four statewide \nagencies and seven sheriffs for this project, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that those letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         State of Louisiana, Governor's Office of Homeland \n           Security and Emergency Preparedness,\n                                    Baton Rouge, LA, June 6, 2008.\n     Re Lincoln Parish Public Safety Complex\n\n     Sheriff Mike Stone,\n     Lincoln Parish Sheriff's Office,\n     Ruston, LA.\n       Dear Sheriff Stone: On behalf of the Governor's Office of \n     Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, I would like to \n     extend to you my full endorsement and support of the proposed \n     construct of the Lincoln Parish Public Safety Complex. It is \n     my understanding that this complex will be available for \n     regional training opportunities and could be used, upon \n     request, by a number of public safety agencies in support of \n     joint training throughout your region.\n       The concept of regional training is acutely in line with \n     state and federal initiatives and readily supports all levels \n     of regional training objectives. The purpose and goal of this \n     project is an obvious testimony of your dedication towards \n     the betterment of critically needed public safety skills.

But I again remind my colleagues, what we have had is a \nvery passioned debate, and we have had a thoughtful debate about where \nthese funds are going to go, which, to me, means the Senate is thinking \nabout where their Federal dollars they have out there are going to go \nand it brings visibility and light.

Is there objection to setting aside \nthe amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. \n     Menendez, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Mrs. Gillibrand, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1428.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill that will extend, for 3 years, \nthe Special Immigrant Non-Minister Religious Worker Visa Program and \nthe Conrad 30 Program. In addition, my amendment addresses the \nimmigration-related hardships caused by the death of a sponsoring \nrelative.\n  Let me say a few words about the Special Immigrant Non-Minister \nReligious Worker Visa Program. The program provides for up to 5,000 \nspecial immigrant visas per year which religious denominations or \norganizations in the United States can use to sponsor foreign nationals \nto perform religious service in our country. To date, the Special \nImmigrant Non-Minister Religious Worker Visa Program has been extended \nsix times. However, Congress has started a very poor practice of \nextending this program in 6-month\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\nspurts--making it extremely difficult for agency officials to \nadminister the program and for religious groups to make long-term plans \nfor their critical staffing needs.\n  Lest some people think this is not an important program worthy of our \nattention, let me tell you about the services nonminister religious \nworkers perform. These selfless workers provide human services to the \nmost needy, including shelter and nutrition; caring for and ministering \nto the sick, aged, and dying; working with adolescents and young \nadults; assisting religious leaders as they lead their congregations \nand communities in worship; counseling those who have suffered severe \ntrauma and/or hardship; supporting families, particularly when they are \nin crisis; offering religious instruction, especially to new members of \nthe religious denomination; and helping refugees and immigrants in the \nUnited States adjust to a new way of life.\n  I am aware of the concerns that some of my colleagues have about \nfraud within this program, and I am equally concerned. Yet I want to \nmake it clear. The figures used to taint this program are outdated and \nnot reflective of where things stand currently. U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, USCIS, is in the process of completing the \nimplementation of rules and procedures promulgated in November 2008 to \neliminate fraud. This includes regular site visits. Additionally, an \ninspector general report, just issued a few weeks ago, confirms that \nUSCIS has developed a credible process to deter and detect nonminister \npetition fraud.\n  To ensure that we continue to keep on top of this issue, I have \ninsisted that language in the proposed amendment require a report from \nUSCIS, within 90 days of enactment, to identify the risks of fraud and \nnoncompliance by program participants. Additionally, USCIS will be \nrequired to provide a detailed plan that describes the actions taken by \nthe agency against noncompliant program participants and future \nnoncompliant program participants. Three months after providing this \nreport to Congress, USCIS will be required to provide a report on the \nprogress made in reducing the number of noncompliant participants of \nthis program.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that fraud in any government program \nis totally unacceptable to me. And I believe the extra steps included \nin the legislation will further the progress USCIS has made in \neliminating and preventing fraud in this important program.\n  Mr. President, please note that there are several religious \norganizations that support passage of the Special Immigrant Non-\nMinister Religious Worker Visa Program, including The Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints, the American Jewish Committee, the Agudath \nIsrael of America, the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., the \nChurch Communities International, the Conference of Major Superiors of \nMen, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the Lutheran Immigration and \nRefugee Service, the Mennonite Central Committee, the United States \nNational Association of Evangelicals, the National Spiritual Assembly \nof the Bahai of the United States, The Church of Scientology \nInternational, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston, MA, the \nUnited Methodist Church, the General Board of Church and Society, the \nWorld Relief, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n  No doubt our country's religious organizations face sometimes \ninsurmountable obstacles in using traditional employment immigration \ncategories to fit their unique situations.\n  Fortunately, the Non-Minister Religious Worker Visa Program allows \nour country's religious denominations to continue uninterrupted in \ntheir call to serve and provide support to those who are in the \ngreatest need. I commend their service and hope they know how much I \nrespect their work.\n  Let me take a moment to say a few words about the Conrad 30 Program, \nwhich was created in 1994. The Conrad 30 Program allows foreign \ndoctors, who are already in the United States, and who have been \ntrained in the United States, to extend their stay in the country if \nthey agree to practice in medically underserved communities in the U.S. \nfor 3 years. The program, which is run at the State level, has brought \nover 8,500 doctors to underserved areas across the country, and to all \n50 States. However, it expires in September. My amendment also will \nextend the Conrad 30 Program for 3 years.\n  The Immigration and Nationality Act, INA, imposes what has become \nknown as the ``widow penalty,'' requiring the deportation of \nindividuals whose pending applications for green cards are rejected \nbecause their citizen spouse died within the first 2 of marriage. This \namendment remedies this unintended and unjustified administrative \nprocedure.\n  Under current law, when a U.S. citizen marries a noncitizen, the \nnoncitizen is eligible to become a legal permanent resident and receive \na green card. During the first 2 years of marriage, the only way this \ncan be accomplished is through a petition that the citizen files on the \nnoncitizen spouse's behalf. The noncitizen cannot self-petition for \nlegal permanent resident status until the marriage has lasted for 2 \nyears.\n  If, however, the citizen spouse dies while the petition, through no \nfault of the couple, remains pending. This is often unfair; delays are \noften caused by agency workload or issues which are not the fault of \nthe petitioners. The petition automatically is denied. The noncitizen \nis immediately deemed ineligible for legal permanent residence and \ntherefore becomes deportable. This is the case even if ample evidence \nof a bona fide marriage, such as cohabitation, shared finances, exists. \nIt is often the case even if a couple had a U.S. born child.\n  Because of the widow penalty, well-intentioned widows who have played \nby the rules face immediate deportation. During the 110th Congress, \nefforts to persuade the USCIS to address the issue administratively \nwere unsuccessful. In the current administration, Secretary Napolitano \nhas directed that the Department of Homeland Security to review a \nnumber of immigration issues, including the ``widow penalty,'' and has \ndecided to defer action on deporting widows for up to 2 years to allow \ntime for Congress to fix the problem.\n  There have been more than 200 ``widow penalty'' victims, including a \nwoman whose husband died while serving overseas as a contractor in \nIraq; a woman whose husband died trying to rescue people who were \ndrowning in the San Francisco Bay; and a woman who was apprehended by \nFederal agents when she went to meet with immigration authorities to \nplead her case she was placed in shackles, and sent to a detention \nfacility.\n  This amendment will end the harsh and unfair ``widow penalty'' by \nallowing the petition to be adjudicated even though the spouse has \ndied. The proposed legislation affects only a small class of \nindividuals who still would be required to demonstrate that they had a \nbona fide marriage before receiving a green card. Thus, USCIS would \nretain the discretion to deny petitions, but they would no longer deny \nthem automatically in response to the death of the citizen spouse.\n  The amendment also includes provisions to clarify that the government \nshould continue to process the immigration applications of immigrants \nwho are already waiting to receive an immigrant or other visa under \ncertain conditions.\n  Specifically, the bill would protect orphans, parents and spouses of \nUnited States citizens by allowing them to continue their applications \nthrough the family immigration system in cases where the citizen's or \nresident's relative died if the individual self-petitions within 2 \nyears; allow the spouse and minor children of family-sponsored \nimmigrants and derivative beneficiaries of employment-based visas to \nbenefit from a filed visa petition after the death of a relative or \nadjust status on the basis of a petition filed before the death of the \nsponsoring relative if the application is filed within 2 years; allow \nthe spouse and minor children of refugees and asylees to immigrate to \nthe U.S. despite the death of the principal applicant and allow them to \nadjust their status to permanent residence; provide processes to reopen \npreviously denied cases and allow individuals to be paroled into the \nU.S. in cases where the sponsoring relative died after submitting an \nimmigration application, and promote efficient naturalization of widows \nand widowers by\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\nallowing the surviving spouse to continue with a naturalization \napplication as long as the deceased spouse was a citizen of the United \nStates during the 3 years prior to filing.\n  The bill ensures that all widows and orphans would have to comply \nwith affidavit of support requirements to ensure they do not become a \npublic charge. The bill includes provisions to make sure that all \nwidows and orphans who benefit under this act are subject to current \nnumerical limitations on visa issuance. The bill also provides a limit \non issuance of visas for widows where the spouse died over 10 years \nago: only 100 visas would be available for individuals whose spouses \ndied before 1999.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1406 to Amendment No. 1373\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I see it \nas 1404, which is to strike the Loran-C Program. It is at the desk. It \ncould be 1406.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right to object, can we get the correct \nnumber?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Pending me finding the right number, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thanks to my crack staff, that amendment number is 1406. \nI ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1406 to amendment No. 1373.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to the Loran-C signal, as \n                   recommended by the Administration)\n\n       On page 75, line 15, strike all through page 77, line 16.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would imagine that my colleagues \nremember that several months ago the President announced there would be \na number of significant cuts in spending in order to try to bring \nunnecessary and wasteful programs under control. The President \nannounced there would be some $41 billion saved over the next decade, \nand the administration, as part of its budget submission, recommended \nterminating or reducing 121 Federal programs that were estimated to \nsave the taxpayers $41 billion over the next decade.\n  That announcement by the President was greeted with certainly \napplause and appreciation by most Americans since we are amassing \nmultitrillion-dollar deficits. Unfortunately, it seems pretty clear \nthese budget cuts the administration recommended terminating are not \nbeing terminated.\n  We have had votes already on at least two of them, and now we are \nabout to talk about another one that would achieve a savings of some \n$36 million in 2010, and $190 million over 5 years, not a small amount \nof money, at least in the old days before we got into trillion-dollar \nand multitrillion-dollar deficits.\n  So what this amendment does is seek to strike the Loran-C Program. In \nthe interest of full disclosure, Loran was around when I was in the \nNavy, so obviously it is a pretty old program. The President and the \nadministration called it ``obsolete technology.'' I certainly agree.\n  The administration stated in its budget submission--and I have that \nsomewhere--and I quote from it:\n\n       The Loran-C is a federally provided radio navigation system \n     for civil marine use in U.S. coastal areas. The Nation no \n     longer needs this system because the nationally supported \n     civilian Global Positioning System [known to us as GPS] has \n     replaced it with superior capabilities. As a result, Loran-C, \n     including recently technological enhancements, serves only \n     the remaining small group of longtime users. It no longer \n     serves any governmental function, and it is not capable as a \n     backup for GPS.\n\n  I want to point out again to my colleagues, that is not my view, and \nI will enumerate a number of governmental agencies that agree with \nthat. But several Federal agencies, including the Departments of \nDefense, Transportation, and Homeland Security, already have backup \nsystems for their critical GPS applications, and the termination of \nLoran-C does not foreclose future development of a national backup \nsystem. It nearly stops the outflow of taxpayers' dollars to sustain a \nsystem that does not now and will not in its current state serve as a \nbackup to GPS. That is pretty strong and pretty direct and pretty clear \nlanguage.\n  Obviously, the administration is proposing to terminate the \nterrestrial-based, long-range radio navigation system, Loran-C, \noperated by the Coast Guard because it is obsolete technology.\n  Accounting for inflation, this will achieve a savings of $36 million \nin 2010 and $190 million over 5 years. Again, I point out this is one \nof 121 terminations or cuts the President of the United States \nannounced the administration wanted done and, of course, many Americans \nbelieved they would be achieved. So far we haven't done one. I am sure \nwe may, but we have not done one.\n  In 2005 numerous Federal agencies called for the termination of this \nprogram, as I mentioned earlier, including the Coast Guard; the \nSecretary of Defense; Secretary of Transportation, representing the \nFederal Aviation Administration; and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, representing the Coast Guard.\n  All signed, in October 2005, a report that stated the Department of \nDefense has determined that Loran is no longer needed as a positioning, \nnavigational, or timing aid for military users, and ``with respect to \naviation, the FAA has determined that sufficient alternative navigation \naids exist in the event of a loss of GPS-based services, and, \ntherefore, Loran is not needed as a back-up navigation aid for aviation \nusers.'' And, ``with respect to maritime safety, the United States \nCoast Guard has determined that sufficient back-ups are in place to \nsupport safe maritime navigation in the event of a loss of GPS-based \nservices, and, therefore, Loran is not needed as a back-up navigational \naid for maritime safety.''\n  It is not a new debate. Once programs come into being, they are \nalmost impossible to kill, and we may not be able to kill this one. The \nvotes so far have indicated there certainly is not a harboring of \nsuccess. This is a GAO report, the U.S. Government General Accounting \nOffice, dated September 18, 1981. The report States:\n\n       DOT, [Department of Transportation] should terminate \n     further Loran-C development and modernization exploit the \n     potential of the Navstar global position system, [i.e. GPS.]\n\n  Remarkable. 1981. So the report goes on--and I will not waste too \nmuch time going into it--but the GAO obviously found that the Coast \nGuard--\n\n       We have completed a follow-up review on our March 21, 1978 \n     report. The report concluded that the Department of Defense's \n     DOD satellite-based Navstar GPS could be a national asset, \n     could replace many existing navigation systems at substantial \n     savings.\n\n  The report considered these systems, including the Department of \nTransportation's Loran-C system, to be unneeded by the early 1990s and \ncautioned against further investment in Loran-C. It also recommended \nthat the Secretary of Transportation become more involved in the GPS \nprogram to ensure the timely availability of low-cost civil receivers. \nObviously, we have low-cost civil receivers.\n  So beginning in 1981 and here we are 28 years later trying to \nterminate a program that literally every agency of government is trying \nto kill. But will we succeed? Again, the votes so far do not indicate \nthat.\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\n  Yesterday there was an article by Mr. Walter Alarkon, which says.\n\n       Democrats ignore Obama's cuts. Congressional Democrats are \n     largely ignoring President Obama's $19.8 billion in budget \n     cuts. The President proposed axing dozens of programs that he \n     said were inefficient or ineffective, but Members of the \n     House Appropriations Committee are including the money for \n     them.\n\n  Over here on this side of the Capitol we are doing the same thing. \nThe Associated Press:\n\n       Congress largely is ignoring Obama budget cuts. Lawmakers \n     have yet to deal with most controversial proposed cuts. Obama \n     proposed the cuts last month after what he promised would be \n     a line-by-line scrub of the Federal budget to counter \n     Republican charges that he is spending the country into too \n     much debt. The House has already rejected his effort to kill \n     a $400 million program that helps States with the costs of \n     incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants, and a homeland \n     security spending bill up for a House vote this week keeps in \n     place the World War II era Loran-C maritime navigation system \n     that Obama wanted to ax even though it has been rendered \n     obsolete by the modern global positioning system.\n       The homeland security measures also preserve $12 million \n     for bus systems--\n\n  That is the one that died, the amendment we tried to kill yesterday \nthat died 51 to 47--\n\n     and $40 million in grants to local governments for emergency \n     operations centers.\n\n  That one was not approved today by a vote of 60 to 38.\n\n       All told, lawmakers in both parties--California Republicans \n     were the driving force in preserving the State Criminal Alien \n     Assistance Program--have combined to preserve more than $750 \n     million worth of cuts suggested by Obama.\n  From Politico:\n\n       Democrats make show of budget cuts.\n\n  That was on June 23.\n\n       With growing public concern about the deficit and billions \n     still backed up in President Obama's economic recovery \n     program, just how do Democrats sell another 8 percent \n     increase in discretionary spending this summer? Some of the \n     terminations are less than advertised.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  I applaud the President's commitment cutting some of these programs. \nI spoke out at the time when he said they would go line by line, when \nhe said they would have budget cuts that were significant, that there \nwould be billions of dollars saved in unwanted, unnecessary programs \nand spending. Why don't we in Congress get that message?\n  If we continue on this path--and we probably will; I have been around \nthis body long enough to see where the votes are; the appropriators \nhave the control here--I will strongly suggest that the President start \nvetoing some of these bills, something the previous administration \nshould have done and the previous President should have done. I came to \nthe floor and fought against these earmark pork-barrel projects in the \nlast administration, just as I am with this one.\n  Yesterday I offered an amendment to strip funding for a program the \nadministration had declared unnecessary and sought to terminate. The \namendment was defeated, and only 12 Members of the President's party \nsupported the amendment seeking to implement the administration's \nrecommendation. When are we going to get serious about making tough \nchoices around here?\n  I know there are other amendments in line. Let me sum up. This system \nis an aid to navigation for ships at sea and in rivers and lakes that \nlong ago was replaced by something called GPS, the global positioning \nsystem. We have them in our cars. They are easily available to be \nbought at very low price at most any of our stores and outlets. I am \nsure one could draw a scenario where somehow all satellites fall from \nthe sky and we are deprived of Loran-C, but that is sheer foolishness. \nIf we don't kill this program, which was recommended to be terminated \nby GAO in September of 1981, it is pretty obvious we are not going to \nbe able to reduce or terminate funding for any program, once it gets \ninto production and once it gets its sponsors in the Congress.\n  I strongly recommend that my colleagues understand that we can't keep \nspending this kind of money. We just can't do it. We are laying a \nterrible burden on our children and grandchildren. This is some $36 \nmillion for next year, $190 million for the next 5 years. For anybody \nwho has a rudimentary understanding of what GPS provides and how \nobsolete Loran-C is, it is willful ignorance.\n  I urge colleagues, let's, for a change, stand up for the American \ntaxpayer. Let's stand up for the taxpayer and our children and \ngrandchildren. In this era of $10 trillion debts and trillion-dollar-\nplus deficits, does $36 million in 2010 and $190 million over 5 years \nmatter? I think it matters in that we ought to at least sometimes stop \nbusiness as usual. People are not able to stay in their homes, not \nkeeping jobs. Unemployment is at an all-time high. And we are going to \nwaste another $36 million?\n  How many people could stay in their homes, how many people could we \nemploy in small businesses, how many people could educate their kids \nwith this $36 million for next year? There is something wrong here that \nwe continue to spend like this, when America is going through the \ntoughest recession in our history. Time after time we come to the floor \nand try to terminate obsolete programs. We try to stop the wasteful and \nunnecessary pork-barrel spending and earmarks. What do we get? We get \nmajority votes against it.\n  Don't be surprised when the TEA parties get bigger around the \ncountry. Don't be surprised when more and more Americans register as \nIndependents because they think both sides of the aisle are guilty. \nDon't be surprised when Americans in every way that they can express \ntheir extreme dissatisfaction with our spending habits and the \ncorruption that exists as a result.\n  It is time we started standing up for the American people and not the \nspecial interests that are the sponsors of Loran-C and so many wasteful \nand unnecessary programs we continue to see increase in spending, when \nevery other American family is having to tighten their belts and \ndecrease spending, if they are able to spend at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \noffering this amendment. Indeed, Loran-C was established after World \nWar II as a navigational tool for our mariners and aviators. The \nPresident has proposed to terminate Loran-C stations on October 1, \n2009, with the justification that the federally supported civilian \nglobal positioning system is now the primary navigational tool and the \nLoran-C is no longer needed by the Armed Forces or by the \ntransportation sector or by the Nation's security interests. The Office \nof Management and Budget has also told us that many agencies, including \nthe Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Transportation, \nand the Department of Defense, do, as the Senator stated, already have \nbackup systems for GPS.\n  I want to set the record straight about what this committee mark does \nhave in it that is before us. It does provide for the orderly \ntermination of Loran-C beginning January 4, 2010. So the underlying \nbill does terminate the Loran-C program, and it does so in a way that \nallows the Coast Guard the time to inform the public and provide for \nthe orderly termination of that program. The committee bill continues \noperations of Loran-C until January 4, 2010. Then the program is \nterminated.\n  Contrary to the sponsor's statement yesterday, there is not $35 \nmillion in this bill for Loran-C. This bill does have $18 million. The \nPresident in his request did include no funding to pay for the cost to \nterminate these stations. According to the Coast Guard, which has \nprovided us information, they do need this funding to remove the high-\nvalue equipment and electronics hazardous material. They need it to \nremediate the environmental concerns and to fund a variety of measures \nto secure the sites until they are fully decommissioned. This money is \nnot to continue the operation of Loran-C. It is to terminate it in a \nway that is proper and makes sure that while we remove these stations, \nwe are doing it in a responsible way.\n  What we do in the committee mark is to make sure that the Coast Guard \ndoesn't have to take away money from critical missions--search and \nrescue or drug interdiction or marine safety or environmental \ncompliance--to terminate this program. We did include funding so that \nthe Loran-C stations could be shut down responsibly.\n  The administration has sent us a statement of administration policy. \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n  H.R. 2892--Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010\n\n       (Senator Inouye, D-Hawaii, July 7, 2009)\n       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. \n     2892, with the committee-reported text of S. 1298, making \n     appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.\n       As we face difficult economic and fiscal decisions, it is \n     important to make efficient and effective investments. The \n     Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010, as \n     considered by the Senate Committee, makes important \n     investments in transportation systems, cyber security, \n     innovation and job creation, security for our borders, and \n     emergency response. This legislation serves as an important \n     piece of the Nation's economic recovery.\n       The Administration would like to take this opportunity to \n     share additional views regarding the Committee's version of \n     the bill.\n\n\n                    Federal Protection Service (FPS)\n\n       The Administration is pleased that the Committee supports \n     the transfer of FPS to the National Protection and Programs \n     Directorate (NPPD). This transfer will properly align the \n     activities of FPS and NPPD, while allowing Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement to focus on its key immigration \n     enforcement mission. The Administration plans to provide \n     additional details to the Congress in support of the FPS \n     transition and realignment of these responsibilities in the \n     next few weeks.\n\n\n                           E-Verify Extension\n\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \n     E-Verify by fully funding the request and including a three-\n     year reauthorization to continue operations. This critical \n     program supports immigration enforcement and promotes \n     compliance with immigration laws.\n\n\n  Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Disaster Relief Fund\n\n       The Committee significantly underfunds the Disaster Relief \n     Fund (DRF). In an effort to implement a more transparent \n     funding process for DRF, the Administration's $2 billion \n     request is based on a methodology that incorporates \n     historical costs associated with FEMA's response for non-\n     catastrophic incidents.\n\n\n                          Loran-C Termination\n\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \n     termination of the Loran-C radio navigation system. The \n     Administration supports the Committee's aim to achieve an \n     orderly termination through a phased decommissioning \n     beginning in January 2010, and the requirement that \n     certifications be provided to document that the Loran-C \n     termination will not impair maritime safety or the \n     development of possible GPS backup capabilities or needs.\n\n\n                          Immigration Services\n\n       The Congress is urged to provide the requested funding to \n     reform immigration fees. Eliminating the practice of passing \n     on costs for refugees and asylees to other applicants for \n     immigration benefits is an important first step to improve \n     the accuracy, transparency, and fairness of immigration fees.\n       The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide \n     additional resources to support and expand successful \n     immigrant integration programs across the country.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It says:\n\n       The Administration appreciates the committee's support for \n     termination of the Loran-C radio navigation system. The \n     administration supports the committee's aim to achieve an \n     orderly termination through a phased decommissioning, \n     beginning in January 2010, and the requirement that \n     certifications be provided to document that the Loran-C \n     termination will not impair maritime safety or the \n     development of possible GPS back-up capabilities or needs.\n\n  So the administration has said that the committee is complying with \nwhat they have asked us to do which is to terminate the Loran-C \nprogram.\n  The aim of the amendment is unclear to me. What it actually does is \nstrip the Coast Guard of the authority we have provided in the \nunderlying bill to terminate a program that will indeed save taxpayers \n$36 million a year.\n  The way the amendment is written, I oppose it because it will take \naway what the committee has written in here to terminate the Loran-C \nprogram, as the President has requested, in a responsible way, to do it \nin a way that we deal with the mitigation that needs to be done when we \nremove equipment such as this. The amendment that has been offered will \nactually strip the Coast Guard of the authority to do just that.\n  The committee bill does what the Senator is asking us to do. It does \nit in a timely and responsible way and does terminate the Loran-C \nprogram.\n  I urge colleagues to support the committee amendment that does it in \na responsible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman left out a \ncouple of items. One, it will still cost an additional $18 million, if \nthe program is terminated by January 4, 2010.\n  The interesting thing, when we read the bill on pages 75, 76, and 77, \nthere is a list of caveats that have to be achieved in order for that \nto happen. How many times have I seen around here a determination made \nthat they will terminate a program if the following criteria are met? \nThe limitations in the bill are that termination will not adversely \nimpact the safety of maritime navigation, the system is not needed as a \nbackup to the GPS or any other Federal navigation, if the Commandant \nmakes a certification. The Commandant doesn't have to make a \ncertification. The Coast Guard has already said they don't want it. It \nneeds no certification.\n  From the language of the bill:\n\n       Not later than 30 days after such certification pursuant to \n     subsection (b), the Commandant shall submit to the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives \n     a report setting forth a proposed schedule for the phased \n     decommissioning of the Loran-C system infrastructure in the \n     event of the decommissioning of such infrastructure in \n     accordance with subsection (c).\n       If the Commandant makes the certification described in \n     subsection (b), the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting \n     through the Commandant of the Coast Guard, may, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, sell any real or \n     personal property under the administrative control of the \n     Coast Guard and used for the Loran system, by directing the \n     Administrator of General Services to sell such real and \n     personal property . . .\n\n  So after the completion of such activities, the unexpended balance \nshall be available for any other environmental compliance and \nrestoration. Why not stop it now? Why not stop it now? Why spend an \nadditional $18 million? Why open this? Since 1981, we have been trying \nto kill it. Why open it for an additional period of time when clearly \nthis system needs to stop?\n  With all due respect to the Senator from Washington, let's stop it \nnow. We can stop it now. We know it can be stopped now. We don't have \nto spend an additional $18 million on the program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator and I are on the same page. \nWe want to terminate this program. But we have a responsibility, as \noversight, to make sure that we do it in a way that mitigates any \nproblems that are out there.\n  We have high-value equipment. We have electronic hazardous materials \nthat are out there. The Coast Guard--whoever is responsible--has to \nremediate the environmental concerns. They need to secure these sites \nwhere the Loran-Cs are. That is what this funding is for, to make sure \nit is done responsibly.\n  If we do not provide the funds in this amendment, the Coast Guard \nwill be required to take the money to do that out of other very \nimportant missions that many of us care about, whether it is search and \nrescue or drug interdiction or marine safety or threats of terrorism. \nWe do not want the Coast Guard to have to take away that money to do \nthat.\n  I want to specifically say again, the amendment before us, the way it \nis written, strikes the language that the President requested to \nprovide for the orderly termination by providing authority to sell the \nLoran-C assets. If this amendment is adopted, they will not be able to \nsell the Loran-C assets and thereby save taxpayer dollars.\n  I understand where the Senator is coming from. I know his past \nconcerns about this program. We are going to shut it down. That is what \nthis amendment does. The commandant, who is, in our language, being \nasked to certify, goes at the behest of the President. As the Senator \nfrom Arizona well knows, the President has said he wants the program \nshut down, and that is what this committee is trying to do, in a \nresponsible way, to save taxpayer dollars in the long run and \nspecifically to be able to sell the Loran-C assets so the taxpayers can \nregain their money at the end of the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, in 2007 I offered this direct amendment. \nWe spent 3 hours on it on the Senate floor. Everybody agreed we needed \nto get rid of this program then. We had some concerns. The thing I do \nnot understand is why we are waiting the extra 5 months to shut down a \nprogram. There is nobody who needs this program. That 5 months--just \nthat 5 months of continuing the program--costs the American taxpayers \n$18 million.\n  So if, in fact, we are going to shut down the program, I would like \nto understand the logic of turning it down in January instead of \nOctober 1.\n  First of all, nobody is using this system now. Nobody is using it. \nWhy can't they notify in 3 months all the people--which is zero--who \nare using this today? The other question is, why does it take $35 \nmillion? Where is the backup detail that shows what the costs will be? \nMaybe it is $18 million.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It is $18 million.\n  Mr. COBURN. So why does it take $18 million? There are only seven \nstations left, and we are talking about facilities that are smaller \nthan these four desks. Tell me how it takes $2.5 million per buoy to \nshut them down. Only from Washington would it take that much money. \nWhere is the basis for the knowledge that it takes $18 million?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am sure the Senator understands from the \nbudget of the U.S. Government for fiscal year 2010 that the Office of \nManagement and Budget submitted to the Congress, it says the \nadministration is proposing to terminate and achieve a savings of $36 \nmillion in 2010, and now the Senator from Washington is obviously \ncontradicting what we were told by the administration, which is what we \nwanted.\n  How it could cost $18 million, as you say, to shut down seven sites, \nand not be allowed to sell off valuable assets, of course, is \nfoolishness. Of course the government sells off assets that are \nextraneous assets all the time without the permission or the need to \nhave legislation.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would tell the Senator from Washington, \nfirst of all, I do appreciate that the Senator is attempting to shut \nthis down, and I thank the Senator for that. It has been long overdue. \nBut I do question the amount of money it takes to shut this down. We \nknow the bureaucracies always want more money than what is necessary. \nYou have allowed in this bill that whatever is not used they can plow \nback into anything they want to use it for.\n  Why would we not terminate it at the end of the fiscal year? Every \nmonth we are running it, it costs $3 to $4 million--$3 to $4 million. I \nknow it does not seem like a lot when we are going to have a $1.8 \ntrillion budget deficit this year, but I do not understand why we would \nnot do it.\n  I say to the Senator, I appreciate the fact that he is doing it. I \nthink it can be done for a lot cheaper, and I think it could be done \nsooner, and I would hope the committee would consider that.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. COBURN. There is not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Consumer Financial Protection Agency\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today, colleagues, I rise to give voice \nto my strong support for President Obama's proposal to create a \nconsumer financial protection agency separate from our prudential \nbanking regulators. I believe establishing this new independent agency \nis critical to protecting the economic security of the American middle \nclass and ensuring the stability of our financial system and the banks \nwithin it.\n  Let me share with you a story about Ira Cheatham. Ira is a 73-year-\nold retired veteran of the Korean war. I think his story helps explain \nwhy we need to do more to protect middle-class economic security. Ira \nand his wife lived in Portland, OR, for 21 years. By 2002, this couple \nhad nearly paid off their mortgage. But a few years ago, in the midst \nof the subprime boom, the family received what looked like a check from \ntheir bank, their mortgage company, a check for $1,000. Ira cashed in \nthe check. Ira did not realize that the check actually represented a \nhigh-interest loan.\n  Within a week or two after cashing the check, the family received a \ncall from their mortgage company urging the couple to consolidate this \n$1,000 loan with their credit card debt into a single mortgage. This \nfamily had excellent credit, and the mortgage company promised the \ncouple they would receive an interest rate between 5 and 6 percent, \nwhich would have reduced monthly payments.\n  Based on this promise, the couple agreed. But what they soon \ndiscovered was they had been assigned an interest rate of 11.8 percent. \nMoreover, the loan contained discount points financed into the loan, \ninflating the loan amount and stripping away equity in the house. Under \nthis new subprime loan, the mortgage payments swelled to $1,655--nearly \n60 percent of the family's monthly income.\n  Having discovered this, it would have been great if this family could \nhave simply refinanced. But in the loan was a $7,500 prepayment \npenalty; in other words, stripping them of another $7,500. Once they \ndiscovered what they had been trapped into--what they had been tricked \ninto--they were then locked into this prepayment penalty that would \nfurther decimate their equity.\n  They did not have many good options--an unsustainable interest rate, \nan outrageous prepayment penalty--but, finally, they took and did what \nthey had to do, which was to pay that prepayment penalty in order to \nrefinance their mortgage with another lender.\n  Our financial marketplace has become infested with these kinds of \npredatory lending products and practices that exploited this elderly \ncouple and millions of other families across this Nation. Now these \npractices are commonplace because they are not regulated. They are \ncommonplace because they are highly profitable. They are embedded in \ndocuments inches thick in a home loan. They are written in light gray \nink on the back of a check. When deposited, you have actually signed a \nfinancial document.\n  Well, these types of tricks and traps are unacceptable. Mr. \nPresident, $2.7 trillion in losses to subprime writedowns only \nscratches the surface of the total cost of this economic catastrophe--a \ncatastrophe that would have been avoided if banks had sold stable prime \nloans instead of tricking and trapping families into volatile subprime \nloans.\n  In short, we need to reestablish strong consumer protection in our \nfinancial markets. The solution is simple and should have been adopted \na long time ago: centralizing financial consumer protection regulation \nin a single agency, an agency that is not compromised by having another \nmission, another mission of regulating monetary policy or another \nmission of overseeing the stock market or another mission here or \nthere; no, a mission responsible to the consumers of this Nation of \nfinancial products that says our transactions are going to be \ntransparent, the terms are going to be clear, we are going to get rid \nof the tricks and traps.\n  Many of you know we recently passed a bill in this Chamber on credit \ncards to get rid of the tricks and traps we know of in the credit card \nindustry. That is a tremendous step forward. But who would doubt--who \nin this Chamber would doubt; who in America would\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\ndoubt--that within 12 months we will have a new set of tricks and \ntraps?\n  You cannot simply legislate every time one of these is created. You \nneed a consumer financial products agency to oversee this process, to \nmake sure we protect the consumer from new, clever ways of stripping \nAmericans' wealth. Establishing a strong consumer financial protection \nagency would be a major step forward in protecting the economic \nsecurity of working Americans. There are folks who say: You know what, \nwe are making a lot of money. We don't want this type of regulation.\n\n  Let's draw a parallel here to consumer products in other areas. How \nabout toys for our children. There are folks who would say: No, we \nshouldn't regulate the quality of toys, we shouldn't regulate whether \nthere are small parts that will choke our child, we shouldn't regulate \nwhether there are exploding parts that might take out an eye, we \nshouldn't regulate the lead in the paint, because this reduces choice. \nBut we have recognized that when it comes to consumer products \nappearing in our homes, we need to have ongoing oversight to make sure \nproducts are fair and safe, and we need to do the same thing in the \nfinancial world.\n  The failure to regulate has had an enormous toll: $700 billion in \ntaxpayer money spent to bail out our banks, $12.2 trillion in household \nwealth lost in America since 2007, and the tragedy of millions of \nAmericans losing their homes and their jobs. Those are the real costs \nof failing to regulate financial consumer protection.\n  Let's look at a few things such an agency would do.\n  First, it would mean less bureaucracy and less cost. Each of our \nbanking regulators already has a consumer protection obligation, a \nconsumer protection division. Three of four Federal banking agencies \nhave separate consumer protection functions from the rest of the \nagency. Now, that mission is often set aside, that mission is often \nignored, in light of the other missions of the agency, but it is far \nmore effective, cost-effective, to have these missions combined into a \nsingle entity with the responsibility directly to consumers.\n  A second concern has been that it would be a mistake to have folks \nwho offer financial products provide a simple, plain-vanilla product as \na comparison to give them a framework for the contract being put before \nthem. But these types of straightforward, plain-vanilla comparisons are \nvery useful to consumers to allow them to make an informed choice. In \nthe long term, a smarter consumer produces better competition between \nthose who provide these products because now they are forced to compete \nnot on tricks and traps but on transparency, on consumer service--\ncustomer service--and that is a positive thing. It means real \ncompetition in terms of price. I think our community financial \ninstitutions in particular would have a stronger claim in such new \nbusiness because who provides better consumer service than our local \ncommunity bankers?\n  Third, a consumer protection agency would clear the field of \nunregulated bad actors whose competition lowers standards across \nfinancial products. Well, I wish to draw a bit of an analogy here to a \nfootball game. Imagine a football game where only one side gets called \nfor penalties. That is what happens when you have one responsible \nfinancial player and another that isn't abiding by any sort of fairness \nor transparency. That does not produce good competition. If only your \nopponent can jump the line or face mask or get away with just about \nanything without penalty flags being thrown, how is your team going to \ncompete? That is the challenge the responsible players have in the \nmarketplace today. Well, let's not put them in such a difficult \nposition. Let's make sure all of the players are acting responsibly, \nand that is the role such an agency would carry on.\n  We need a consumer financial protection agency to protect the hard-\nearned wealth of hard-working Americans--Americans like the elderly \ncouple I told the story about earlier, Americans like Maggie from \nSalem, OR. Maggie paid her credit card bill on time, and then what \nhappened? She was charged a late fee.\n  So she called up and said: Why is that?\n  The credit card company said: Well, you know what, we get to sit on \nyour payment for 10 days before we post it, so technically you are late \neven though you paid us early.\n  Maggie said: Where is the fairness in that?\n  Folks like Maggie across this country are asking that simple \nquestion: Where is the fairness in that?\n  Our consumers deserve fairness. Let's not try to have short-term \nprofits that undermine the success of our families by stripping wealth \nthrough tricks and traps. Let's have our consumers say: Isn't it great \nthat here in America we make sure there is fairness in our financial \nproducts, that we don't try to depend on tricks and traps that strip \nwealth from elderly couples, strip wealth from young families trying to \nraise children, that take away the opportunities of those families to \nprovide for their children. Let's put a referee into the game again. We \nneed this agency.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1406\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my understanding is the Senator from \nMaine would like 10 minutes to speak on the McCain amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that following the remarks of the Senator from Maine, \nthe Senate vote in relation to the McCain amendment, with no other \namendments in order prior to the vote on the McCain amendment, in \nrelation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Let me start with some background on the Loran system since it may \nnot be familiar to many of our colleagues. This is a radio navigation \nsystem with 24 land-based transmitters which are operated by the Coast \nGuard that can be used to determine the location and speed of the \nreceiver. Some mariners and aviators use the current system, which is \nknown as Loran-C, for navigation, while others have switched to the GPS \nsystem. An upgraded Loran system, which is known as eLoran, would use \nLoran-C transmitting stations as its foundation and it would serve as a \nbackup to GPS as well as a primary navigational tool.\n  This infrastructure would provide the foundation that is necessary to \nhave a backup for the GPS. If we abandon the Loran-C system, as Senator \nMcCain has advocated, we would lose the considerable investment of $160 \nmillion we have already made to deploy the eLoran system, and this \nsystem is one that a joint Department of Homeland Security and \nDepartment of Transportation assessment team has recommended as the \nbackup for GPS.\n  Why do we need a backup for GPS? The fact is GPS is vulnerable to \natmospheric interference and jamming. A loss of the GPS signal for even \na short duration and in an isolated region would adversely affect cell \nphone coverage, the national power grid, and air traffic.\n  Our Nation needs a reliable backup. This isn't just my opinion. This \nis the considered opinion of an independent assessment team that just \nfiled its final report in January of this year. One of the previous \nspeakers referred to a GAO report that is over 25 years old. I am \ntalking about an assessment that was just completed in January of this \nyear. DHS and the Department of Transportation jointly commissioned an \nassessment team that included a diverse group of senior decisionmakers \nand experts from government, academia, and industry. This team reviewed \n40 previous reports, interviewed the key stakeholders, industry \nrepresentatives, and other experts, and received 980 comments on what \nshould be done, and 93 percent of those comments were in favor of \nmaintaining the Loran system--93 percent.\n  Listen to who some of the commentators were. Sprint Nextel, which is \nthe supplier of critical communications capabilities, and the \nDepartment of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration both \nstated that they currently use the Loran system and that\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\nthey support upgrading to eLoran as a backup and complement to the GPS \nsystem. The Department of Energy moves controlled nuclear material \naround the country and uses Loran-C as ``an active and robust \nsupplement to GPS.'' This is the Department of Energy's Nuclear \nSecurity Administration telling us it needs and relies on the Loran-C \nsystem. They describe it as an active and robust supplement to GPS. The \nDepartment of Energy uses Loran-C to provide location information on \nnuclear material in the event of blocked visibility, solar storms, and \nintentional jamming of the GPS system.\n  In January of this year, when the team released its report, it \nunanimously concluded that the eLoran should serve as the national \nbackup system for GPS and that the Loran-C infrastructure should be \nmaintained until we have full deployment of the eLoran.\n  Think what we are doing if this amendment passes. What we are \nproposing is to discontinue a system that is being relied upon by the \nDepartment of Energy and countless other users. That is why this \nindependent assessment team--this isn't my opinion, this is the \nindependent assessment team's conclusion--says we must maintain the \ncurrent system until we have fully transitioned to the eLoran system, \nwhich will be the backup for GPS. What is being proposed by this \namendment is to discontinue the Loran-C system prior to having a backup \nin place. That makes no sense whatsoever.\n  Again, I would emphasize that this was a unanimous conclusion of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation's \nindependent assessment team as of January of this year. It is the \nnewest assessment we have. It is the most complete review that has ever \nbeen done.\n  The fact is, the weaknesses in the GPS system are well known. A GAO \nreport published in May raised serious concerns regarding the near- and \nlong-term health and reliability of the GPS network, noting that there \nis a high risk--that is GAO's assessment--that the Air Force will not \nbe able to meet its schedule for the deployment of GPS satellites. The \nDepartment of Defense predicts that over the next several years, many \nof the older satellites will reach the end of their operational life \nfaster than they will be able to be replaced.\n  A Wall Street Journal article in June concluded that the GPS \nsatellite system--the article cited new interference problems with the \nsignals being transmitted by recently launched GPS satellites, raising \nadditional serious concerns about the timeline for the deployment of \nthe next generation of GPS satellites.\n  The assessment team reported on a GPS interference incident in San \nDiego that lasted 3 hours. The GPS system is not failproof. It can be \nintentionally interfered with or it can stop operating due to \natmospheric conditions.\n  The eLoran would fulfill the requirement established in National \nSecurity Presidential Directive 39 for a backup to GPS. This is a \nmodest investment of funds to make sure we do not experience a \ndangerous gap.\n  Another myth we keep hearing is that there hasn't been sufficient \nstudy into the issue of whether a backup is needed for the GPS system. \nIn fact, as I have indicated, eLoran has been exhaustively studied. The \nresult of these successive scientific and budgetary analyses is that \neLoran represents the most cost-effective backup to GPS.\n  Again, that is not just my opinion. That is the unanimous conclusion \nof the independent assessment team that was established by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation.\n  I urge the defeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1406, offered by the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. McCain.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have made great progress over the last \nday on the Homeland Security Appropriations bill. This is a very \nimportant bill that provides for the security of this country.\n  We have made good progress with a number of amendments that we have \nworked our way through today. We intend to finish this bill tomorrow. \nWe ask Senators from either side of the aisle to notify either myself \nor the Senator from Ohio, who is managing for the Republicans on this \nbill, to let us know this evening if they have any amendments they want \nto be considered; otherwise they may find themselves not able to offer \ntheir amendment.\n  So we ask all Members to please let us know, the managers of this \nbill, this evening if there are any amendments you will require a vote \non tomorrow. We do intend to finish this bill tomorrow.\n  I also notify Members that the majority leader intends to file \ncloture on this bill tonight. If we cannot work our way through it \ntomorrow, we will be here Friday voting on cloture. So I again ask \nMembers to work with us to finish this bill in a very timely manner.\n  We have got a lot of work done. We expect that we can finish it \ntomorrow in a timely fashion if we get the cooperation of all Members. \nI urge Members to get their amendments in to either myself or the \nRepublican manager of this bill by this evening so we can move forward \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1432\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, taking the chairman up on her offer, let me \nspeak on an amendment I got pending earlier today. It is amendment No. \n1432. This is an amendment to strike an earmark in the bill. It is a \n$900,000 earmark for the city of Whitefish emergency operations center \nin Montana. That is all the amendment does. The amendment does the same \nthing the administration did in that it terminates a program that the \nObama administration terminated in its budget. It is one of several \nprojects that was terminated in the budget submission.\n  I do not strike the program because I agree or disagree with it. I \nthink you could make an argument that it is a reasonable thing to do. I \nsuspect my colleague from Montana will make that argument. That is not \nthe point. As the administration pointed out, the point is there is a \nway to do these\n\n[[Page S7249]]\n\nprojects and then there is a way not to do them. The way not to do them \nis through earmarks.\n  The Whitefish emergency operations center has not been subject to a \ncongressional hearing, nor has it been authorized by Congress. \nMoreover, not only did the administration not request funding for the \nproject, they specifically zeroed out the funding.\n  On the floor the day before yesterday--or maybe it was yesterday; I \nhave forgotten now--my colleague Senator McCain described several \nprojects, including this project, and noted why it and other earmarks \nin the bill should not proceed.\n  He said: The earmarks are in the bill for one reason and one reason \nonly, because of the selective prerogatives of a few Members of the \nSenate. Sadly, these Members chose to serve their own interests over \nthose of the American taxpayers.\n  His point also was not that the project is either good or bad, but as \nthe administration noted, there is a way to do it and a way not to do \nit that is fair to all of the States and to all of the Members, and \nthat way is to have those subject to authorization and then \nappropriated.\n  Senator Feingold also on the floor yesterday noted:\n\n       While we all may not agree on the appropriateness of \n     earmarking in general, I certainly hope we can agree that \n     certain things should not be earmarked, including FEMA grant \n     programs such as those that protect Americans from terrorist \n     attack.\n\n  I think he is absolutely right, which is why I voted for his \namendment earlier this afternoon. These are important projects. These \nare FEMA projects to protect the American people. Why should they be \nsubject to the earmarking process rather than regular order? Again, \nthat is exactly what the administration had earlier concluded.\n  I think it is wrong when we are funding projects with very scarce \nFederal dollars in the name of homeland security and the decision on \nwhat to fund is based on the influence of a Senator or a House Member \nrather than the security risk to Americans.\n  Especially at a time when unemployment has reached nearly 10 percent \nand many Americans are obviously hurting a great deal, is it \nappropriate for Congress to make funding decisions in this manner? Is \nthis the message we want to be sending to our constituents: If you have \npolitical power, you can get money earmarked. If you do not, then your \ncommunity is going to suffer. We are already spending $44.3 billion on \nthis bill. That is $96 million above the President's request and 7 \npercent above last year's level. Those amounts are significant. And \nthat increase does not include nearly $2.8 billion in stimulus funding.\n  Current budget projections indicate that we will add, on average, \nnearly $1 trillion a year to the public debt level from the $7 trillion \nto date, to $17 trillion in 2019. We have all heard the statistic \nbefore that the President's budget doubles the debt in 5 years, triples \nit in 10 years.\n  The President's administration said there are some things we should \nnot fund in the way they are funded in this bill. All I am doing is \nagreeing with the administration not to add more debt on top of what \nhas already been accumulated.\n  The path forward is not sustainable. I think the head of the OMB has \nmade that point. So I think we need to start making tough decisions \naround here and we need to respect the congressional budget process. It \nseems to me the easiest way to make a tough budget decision is when, on \na matter of process, we can all agree it is not the right way to \nproceed.\n  That is why I think this particular project, though the amount of \nmoney is relatively small, is still a good candidate to show we can \nmake those tough decisions as a way of demonstrating to the American \npublic that at least we are willing to start somewhere.\n  Finally, I will reiterate, I am not here to argue the merits of this \nproject. I am sure my colleague from Montana will describe its merits \nin glowing terms. To me, that is not the point. The point is that the \nadministration has said this emergency operations grant program should \nbe terminated, it should not exist, we should not spend money on it \nbecause this is the wrong way to spend money.\n  In the document entitled ``Terminations, Reductions and Savings,'' in \nthat volume of the President's fiscal year 2010 budget, the \nadministration states:\n\n       The Administration is proposing to eliminate the Emergency \n     Operations Center (EOC) Grant Program in the 2010 Budget \n     because the program's award allocations are not based on a \n     risk assessment. Also, other Department of Homeland Security \n     grant programs can provide funding for the same purpose more \n     effectively.\n\n  I think that rationale demonstrates why we need to support my \namendment to eliminate this part. This is only one part of that grant \nprogram. But it is a part that I think would at least illustrate to the \nAmerican people that we want to begin the process and spend this money \nin the right way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the part of the budget designated \n``Termination: Emergency Operations Center Grant Program,'' which \ndescribes what the administration has said, be printed at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. I understand that a little bit later we will be able to \nreach an agreement on voting on several of the amendments. This \namendment presumably will be voted on sometime tomorrow. I would hope \nthe proponents and opponents would have a minute each prior to the vote \nto reiterate their arguments and would hope my colleagues would support \namendment No. 1432.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Termination: Emergency Operations Center Grant Program\n\n\n                    Department of Homeland Security\n\n       The Administration is proposing to eliminate the Emergency \n     Operations Center (EOC) Grant Program in the 2010 Budget \n     because the program's award allocations are not based on risk \n     assessment. Also, other Department of Homeland Security grant \n     programs can provide funding for the same purpose more \n     effectively.\n\n                             FUNDING SUMMARY\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  2010\n                                            2009       2010      Change\n                                          Enacted    Request   from 2009\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBudget Authority.......................         35          0        -35\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                             Justification\n\n       The 2008 EOC Grant Program was established to improve \n     emergency management and preparedness capabilities for State \n     and local communities by supporting flexible, sustainable, \n     secure, and interoperable EOCs with a focus on addressing \n     identified deficiencies and needs. However, this focus was \n     compromised, and by 2009, 60 percent of the EOC grant funds \n     were congressional earmarks not allocated by merit-based \n     criteria.\n       The EOC Grant Program uses award criteria that are not \n     risk-based, and the Administration supports a risk-based \n     approach to homeland security grant awards. This is the best \n     way to allocate resources in order to maximize security gains \n     for the Nation.\n       In addition, in 2009, EOC construction and renovation was \n     approved as an allowable expense under the Emergency \n     Management Performance Grant Program, thus providing a more \n     effective funding mechanism through which potential grantees \n     prioritize expenditures on EOCs against other emergency \n     management initiatives.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I assure the Senator that we do intend to \nvote on this amendment tomorrow morning. There will be time prior to \nthe vote. We will work out an agreement with the Senator on how much \ntime.\n  The Senator from Montana is on his way to the floor right now to \ndebate this amendment. I think the Senate has a right to listen to him.\n  I will say this, having been in the Senate for a long time, we \nrespect other Senators and the knowledge they have about their States. \nAnd when they come and talk to one of our committees about a specific \nneed, we listen to them and respect what they know.\n  I certainly know the Senator from Montana knows this area very well. \nHe has visited it numerous times. He understands the deep concerns that \nface this region and knows exactly why they need an emergency \noperations center there. He made a very good argument to the \nsubcommittee, and the subcommittee included it in our mark that is \nbefore the Senate today.\n  The Senator was out on the floor earlier today talking about the \nimportance of having an emergency center located at Whitefish. I will \ntell all of my colleagues that it is easy to pick out one earmark \nbecause it is in someone else's State or region. I am not\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\nfrom Montana, but I certainly respect the Senator from Montana when he \ntells me that Montana has suffered numerous natural disasters in recent \nyears, including, I remember, a devastating fire at Glacier National \nPark.\n  I do not know all of the geography of this region, but do know that \nthis emergency center in Whitefish, as the Senator from Montana talked \nto us about it, supports Glacier National Park. That is a national park \nthat all of us have a responsibility for. It is next to an Indian \nreservation, and Federal land with Federal responsibility. When we talk \nabout an emergency center that assures that we protect the assets of \nthis Nation, I think the Senator from Montana is right in telling our \nsubcommittee that an emergency center is needed there.\n  The EOCs respond to a lot more than terrorist threats. I remind all \nof my colleagues of fires, floods, earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, \nand countless other disasters.\n  I notice that the Senator from Montana is on the floor and he can \ndescribe to all of us the importance of this EOC in his region.\n  Disasters happen anywhere in this country at any time, and our local \ncommunities have got to have the tools they need to be able to respond \neffectively, especially when they are next to national assets such as \nGlacier National Park and an Indian reservation that the Senator will \ndescribe to us. But I want to remind all of our colleagues that these \nso-called earmarks, congressional mandates that we put into these \nbills, are here because the Senator has come to the subcommittee, \ndescribed it to us in detail, put them up on their Web sites, and \neveryone has an opportunity to look at them.\n  This subcommittee marked up in subcommittee and full committee and \nhad an opportunity to listen to the Senator from Montana describe the \nneed. We respected the wishes of an individual Senator and his \nunderstanding of why this emergency operations center was so badly \nneeded in his State. In having the respect of other Senators, this \nSenate can do the will of the people.\n  The interesting thing I think all of us should recognize, in writing \nout where these are going to be, we actually have them in the light of \nday. They are held accountable. We do have votes on them. People are \nable to see them. If we just pass funds over to an agency, these \ndecisions are made without any input from people who live in those \nStates, who know the regions and who know the needs of their \ncommunities.\n  I respect the Senator from Montana when he comes to this \nsubcommittee--and I know Senator Byrd, who chairs this subcommittee--\nwhen he goes to Senator Byrd and makes a case for what he has. Senator \nByrd listens to everybody's requests and puts them into these bills. It \nis done so out of respect for that Senator and the knowledge of his \nState. I certainly believe the Senator from Montana has made the case. \nI urge our colleagues to reject this single-minded amendment that \nsimply picks out one Senator's State and says we will not fund an EOC \nin their State.\n  I will oppose this amendment tomorrow when we vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher remarks. They were spot on. I had the opportunity to see part of \nSenator Kyl's comments on TV, and I have a few responses. Then I wish \nto talk about the project.\n  First, Senator Kyl said the EOC program was a target of the \nadministration. His amendment is not taking away the program and \nzeroing it out. If that is his concern, that is what he should have \ndone. It takes away this specific project.\n  The second point was about security. The fact is, the EOC program is \nto respond not only to terrorist activities, which I will get into in a \nminute, but to all hazards as they apply, natural and manmade.\n  Finally, fiscal responsibility was the third point. He said we can't \nafford this earmark. This amendment doesn't save one red cent. It moves \nit back to FEMA.\n  I spoke earlier today on the floor about this emergency operations \ncenter in Whitefish. I will reiterate some of those points. It is in \nthe northwest part of the State, about 60 miles south of the Canadian \nborder. People who deal with this Nation's security tell us the main \nthreat on the northern border is terrorism. Immigration is the main \nthreat on the southern border. This EOC facility will be located 60 \nmiles south of the border, just west of Glacier National Park, which \nsits beside the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. To the north, to the \nwest, and to the south of Whitefish are literally millions of acres of \nforested ground. Whether it is the potential--and I mean potential--\nthat something may happen on the Canadian border that is bad, this \ncenter is there. Whether it is the potential of forest fires on Forest \nService ground or in the park, this emergency operations center is \nthere. It also houses police, fire, provides for interoperability for \nradios. It is very much needed.\n  Their current facility is in the basement. It is about a third the \nsize they need. It is built on a fault line and a flood plain. The fact \nis, if we want to talk about the need for an emergency operations \ncenter in this country, there is no doubt the need is here.\n  I wish to talk about one other thing. The EOC program is just not for \nmanmade disasters. It is for all disasters. We all know what beetle \nkill and disease and global warming has done to the forests, and the \nnorthwest of Montana is no exception.\n  This amendment picks on one specific area in one specific State. This \npicks on an area I happen to know very well. I have been up there \nseveral times. I was there last weekend, one of the many weekends I go \nhome, which is every weekend. I was in Whitefish. This area is a good \nplace for an emergency operations center. I am an elected official from \nthe State. I have seen it with my own two eyes. I know what is \nnecessary. We are going to take this away and give this money back to \nFEMA, to an appointed bureaucrat who probably maybe has been in the \nState of Montana, maybe not. Chances they have been in Whitefish are \ndoubtful.\n  This is a good project. I am all for fighting waste. I am all for \nfighting pork. The fact that we are having this debate speaks to the \nfact that we have moved a long way in this body, as far as earmarks in \nthe middle of the night plugged in and not having the opportunity to \ndebate them. I will tell my colleagues this: This is a good project. It \nis a project that spends our taxpayer dollars wisely, and it will \nbenefit the entire country when it is done. It is a project that is \nvery much needed. There is no pork in this. This is about our country's \nsecurity.\n  It is unfortunate I didn't have the opportunity to visit with the \ngood Senator from Arizona while he was on the floor because, quite \nfrankly, it may have changed his opinion. Maybe not. I don't know why \nhe singled this project out for his amendment. He brought up the point \nthat the administration took the EOC program, and it was a target of \nthe administration. Then put up an amendment to zero it out. That is \nnot what his amendment does. He talked about fiscal responsibility. \nThis doesn't save a penny. The fact is, if we are talking about \nsecurity, it is just not manmade terrorism, it is emergency hazards \ncaused by Mother Nature. This facility will help address all those \nissues.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this issue. This is an \nunfortunate amendment, but we will vote on it and see what happens.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership and support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We will be voting on this amendment tomorrow morning. \nThere will be time for debate on this amendment as well.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of S. 1298, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2010.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $42.9 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2010, which will result in new outlays of $25.5 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $46.7 billion.\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\n  The bill includes $242 million in budget authority designated as \nbeing for overseas deployment and other activities for the Coast Guard. \nPursuant to section 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the 2010, budget \nresolution, an adjustment to the 2010 discretionary spending limits and \nthe Appropriations Committee's 302(a) allocation has been made for this \namount in budget authority and for the outlays flowing therefrom.\n  The Senate-reported bill matches its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and is $1 million below its allocation for outlays. No \npoints of order lie against the committee-reported bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    S. 1298, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n  [Spending Comparisons--Senate-reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  General\n                                     Defense      purpose       Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n  Budget Authority...............        1,582       41,345       42,927\n  Outlays........................        1,404       45,298       46,702\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n  Budget Authority...............        - - -        - - -       42,927\n  Outlays........................        - - -        - - -       46,703\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n  Budget Authority...............        1,553       41,064       42,617\n  Outlays........................        1,390       44,931       46,321\nPresident's Request:\n  Budget Authority...............        1,365       41,473       42,838\n  Outlays........................        1,219       45,079       46,298\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget Authority...............        - - -        - - -            0\n  Outlays........................        - - -        - - -           -1\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n  Budget Authority...............           29          281          310\n  Outlays........................           14          367          381\nPresident's Request:\n  Budget Authority...............          217         -128           89\n  Outlays........................          185          219         404\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Both House and Senate bills include $242 million in budget\n  authority designated as being for overseas deployment and other\n  activities for the Coast Guard.\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7251-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I think I can be done in 10 minutes, but \nif I can't be, I would like to have a little bit longer because I am \ngoing to talk about a very good Iowan who was murdered 2 weeks ago \ntoday. This is the purpose for which I rise. This is coach Ed Thomas. I \nwill get to that in a minute. But before I leave that up there for \nSenators to view, I wish to tell them, this is not any ordinary high \nschool football coach. This is obviously an old picture because it only \ngoes to 1998. He coached 37 years at this high school. It says here \n``championship.'' I know he had a recent State championship as well. He \nis no ordinary high school football coach. Because in this small town \nof Parkersburg, IA, the high school is in two towns, Aplington-\nParkersburg, IA. It only has 2,000 people in it. But this football \ncoach has taken four of his former players now presently playing in the \nNFL. At least three and maybe all four of these returned to be \npallbearers at his funeral.\n  We can see this record of the previous decade, and that record would \nbe as good for the last decade. I am only sorry I don't have a more \nrecent picture showing Ed Thomas.\n  Two weeks ago today, at 10:30 in the morning, a former student, a \nformer football player and the brother of a football player who would \nhave been playing this fall at this high school, came into the weight \nroom at Parkersburg High School. This coach was always there because he \nwanted to encourage his players to work out and to be healthy. He was \nthere with them. This former student came in and killed him with a gun. \nDidn't bother anybody else. That was it. He was rushed to the hospital \nbut probably dead on arrival.\n  I say how outstanding he was and how well liked he was. About 12 \nmonths before that, a tornado went through Parkersburg destroying about \na third of the town. This is a town of only 2,000. This coach had his \nhouse blown away, but he didn't worry about himself. He headed for his \nhigh school, which was also destroyed, to do immediately what he could \nto help turn things around.\n  I have prepared remarks where I will refer to this so colleagues will \nbe hearing it twice. His goal from that Memorial Day weekend to the \nopening of the football season, the first Friday night in August, was \nto have that football field ready to go so they could play football as \nthey have. They had a very outstanding season.\n  This is a person who led a community. He was not just a football \ncoach. My home of 75 years is 10 miles from that high school. They were \nour competitors. There is very fierce competition between football \nteams in these small towns of the Midwest. I went Sunday afternoon. The \nviewing of the body was from 3 to 8. The next day the funeral had 2,500 \npeople at it. But at the time--I get there at 3 o'clock--the line was 3 \nblocks long. I stood in line 3 hours to get to say my condolences to \nthe family and to view. This family was so strong that they probably \ngave more comfort to the people who were there to view than each of us \ngave to the family.\n  Three hours, and I thought: How long is the line? By 6:30, the line \nwas 4 blocks long. That family stood there until 11 o'clock that night \nto greet all the friends of this beloved Iowa coach.\n  With that as background, I came to the floor to give this statement. \nI thought I ought to put it in some context.\n  I come before the Senate with the heavy heart of an entire community \nand in humble recognition of a man who, by all accounts, was a servant \nof God in every sense, a person who put his faith to work by mentoring \nthe young people of his community as a teacher and a football coach, a \nperson who put his faith to work by providing a guiding hand as the \ncommunity recovered from the tragedy of a tornado just a little over a \nyear ago, a person who put his faith to work as a father, a husband, \nand an elder in the church.\n  Parenthetically, I wish to say this about the close-knit families we \nhave in the small communities of Iowa. It happens that Coach Thomas and \nthe family of the murderer go to the same church. The person who did \nthe murdering had, I assume from the newspaper, a drug problem. The \nSunday before the murder, so the newspapers tell me, the family of the \nperson with the drug problem who did the murder asked in the church, \nwould they pray for their son. Coach Ed Thomas led the prayer for that \nson, as it was reported in the newspaper.\n  It was barely a year ago when news reports came across the wires \nabout a small Iowa farming town that was devastated by an F-5 tornado \nthat tore across the community and leveled hundreds of homes and \nbusinesses--with eight people dying--the school and what locals call \nthe Sacred Acre or, to the rest of us the famous Parkersburg Falcon \nfootball field.\n  Just last week, this same town was hit with possibly a more crushing \nblow than a tornado could ever take from a town. The caretaker of the \nSacred Acre, the beloved football coach and town leader, Coach Ed \nThomas, was senselessly murdered in front of his very own students.\n  In our area of the State, it is not hard to know Coach Thomas. He was \na pillar of the community. His success on the football field made him \nan icon in his profession--two State championships and four players \ncurrently in the NFL. But the people who knew him will remember him \nmost for his leadership off the field.\n  It was his leadership that helped pull up the community that was \nknocked off its feet by the F-5 tornado. His declaration in the \naftermath of the tornado that the Aplington-Parkersburg boys would play \nfootball on their home field in just a couple months gave the town of \nParkersburg, IA, purpose in the most difficult of times.\n  It was the Sacred Acre that brought everyone in town together, and it \nwas the whole town that put the Sacred Acre back together so they could \nstart the football season on time in that home game, the last Friday of \nAugust.\n  Coach Thomas and his Sacred Acre brought out the best in the \ncommunity, just as he brought out the best in his team with what Coach \nThomas called, ``strength in togetherness.''\n  His impact reached the people of this community long before that \nfateful day in May 2008. For nearly four decades, Coach Thomas led \nyoung men in more than just the game of football. He led\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\nthem in the lessons of life. His current and former players have been \nseen and heard everywhere--each of them now sharing lessons that will \nbe passed on yet to another generation.\n  Most of us can remember that one coach or that one teacher who had \nthe greatest impact on each of us. For many in the Parkersburg \ncommunity, that one person was Coach Thomas.\n  He was well known for getting the best out of his players and \nstudents. He was always providing motivation to his kids. But those who \nknew Coach Thomas best say his No. 1 talent was friendship. His friend, \nAl Kerns, said:\n\n       He only saw the best in others, and I guess that's why he \n     got all this back.\n\n  ``This'' being the outpouring of compassion from people across Iowa. \nIt may be best demonstrated by the scene in Parkersburg last week at \nthe funeral. As the hearse traveled from the funeral to the nearby \ncemetery, the streets were lined four or five deep with myriads of \ncolor. It has been a true testament to the reach of this icon, not only \nbecause of the sheer numbers of people but the myriad of colors that \ncame from high school football teams from all across Iowa that came in \ntheir game jerseys to honor a selfless man who shared his playbook as \nwell as his heart.\n  The tributes made since that tragic morning show that even after his \ndeath, Ed Thomas is teaching us to be better people by the way he lived \nhis life.\n  It has been obvious that his two sons have taken his life lessons to \nheart, just like many others. I continue to be struck by the poise of \nhis sons who have performed the most monumental task by asking us to \npray for the family of the man who killed their father. I cannot think \nof a greater tribute to their dad than the actions they have performed \nand the words they have spoken over the last 10 days. There is no \nquestion in my mind that these two young men possess the same qualities \nas their father and that these two boys will continue his legacy.\n  Aaron Thomas, the oldest of Ed and Jan's two boys, said this at the \nfuneral. He actually said more than I am going to quote, but this is a \nvery important part:\n\n       You can be sad the rest of the day, but come tomorrow, once \n     you wake up, it's time to get going . . . there's a lot of \n     work to be done in this town.\n\n  While this community's heart is heavy, they will move forward to see \nthe brightness of another day and of another game, just as Coach Thomas \nwould have wanted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, before I make my remarks, I want to \nexpress my appreciation to Senator Grassley for his obviously \npassionate and compassionate remarks about a story and a man who has \ncaptured America. As Senator Grassley knows, I have the privilege of \nvisiting Iowa once or twice a year and have dear friends there, and I \nknow how strong the people of Iowa are.\n  I want to tell Senator Grassley, his remarks, his compassion, and his \npassion are appreciated, I am sure, not only by the family and all \nIowans but all of us in America, as we share in the tragedy and loss of \na great man. I commend him on his remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7252-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NEAL BOORTZ\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for just a minute to talk about a \ngentleman who resides in my State, a man I have known for 40 years, and \na man I, never in a million years, thought I would stand on the floor \nof the Senate and brag about. But today I did something I have never \ndone. I voted on the Internet in relation to the National Radio Hall of \nFame nominees for 2009 for a gentleman by the name of Neal Boortz.\n  Neal Boortz is a daytime talk show host in the city of Atlanta. He \nstarted in radio with Ring Radio in 1969, a little old 1,000-watt \nstation in Brookhaven, GA. Now he is one of the leading talk show hosts \nin terms of audience in the United States of America.\n  He is syndicated on 230 different stations, has an audience of 5 \nmillion people, and calls himself the High Priest of the Church of the \nPainful Truth. I have to rise and tell you as a politician who has been \nboth the victim and the beneficiary of any number of Neal's diatribes, \nhe is exactly that. He is a man of the painful truth. He can find the \nfacts on any issue. He can get to the core of the issue, and he can \nmove communities to do good things and do the right thing.\n  I was delighted to hear that the National Radio Foundation has \nnominated him for this award, and I want to say today I voted for him \nbecause I sincerely hope he gets the recognition for three reasons: One \nis, while he is not always right, he is seldom in doubt. His passion \nfor what he believes rubs off, and I think that is important.\n  Secondly, he loves to be challenged. Unlike so many you hear on the \nradio who want you to believe it is their way or the highway, he loves \nto share his own ideas. He has published three books. The first one, \n``The Terrible Truth About Liberals,'' is on its sixth publishing. \n``The FairTax Book,'' which he cowrote with a Georgia Congressman, John \nLinder, has been on the New York Times Best Seller list for a long \nperiod of time.\n  Right now, his most recent book--and that is, ``Somebody's Got to Say \nIt,'' which he oftentimes does--is in its second printing and No. 2 on \nthe New York Times Best Seller list.\n  But the best part of Neal Boortz is not the thousands he has \ninfluenced in over 40 years on the radio, his humor and his passion. It \nis not his longevity. It is the fact that he always gives back to his \ncommunity and his State.\n  Just one shining example is his wife Donna, who, by the way, prides \nherself in saying she has never listened to 1 minute of Neal's radio \nshow. But Neal donated the proceeds of his book sales to Donna for the \nestablishment of a foundation, which she uses that money to help those \nless fortunate, those in need, and those on the cusp of doing great \nthings who need a little encouragement and a little capitalization.\n  So as all of us have our opinions from time to time about talk radio \nor journalism or commentaries or those who may sometimes accuse us and \nsometimes praise us as politicians, I am delighted to stand on the \nfloor of the Senate and praise a man from my State who for 40 years has \ngiven the best he has, who has fought for what he believed in but \naccepted being challenged, and who always tried to say and do the right \nthing for America and the right thing for our community.\n  It is my sincere hope when the voting ends on October 1, that \nmillions of Americans will have gone to the poll on the Internet, \nradiohof.org, and cast their vote for Neal Boortz.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7252-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7252-S7253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, we have all heard that America's health \ncare system is in crisis. But all too often, Washington loses sight of \nwhat is truly at stake. Some talk constantly about how much reform will \ncost, but without action more and more hard-working Americans will lose \ncoverage.\n  Soaring health care costs are increasing the burdens on the American \npeople, American businesses, and our government. Today, our health care \nsystem stands on the brink of collapse.\n  Over the past 2 years, 3.5 million Illinois residents, nearly 31 \npercent of the under-65 population, have been without health care \ninsurance at one time or another. How can we allow American citizens to \nlive in fear that the next cough or fever would put them in the \npoorhouse? There is a better way.\n  Even for those who manage to stay insured amid the current climate of \nrapid increasing costs, the economic toll of paying for insurance can \nbe crippling to middle-class families.\n  Over the past 9 years, insurance premiums have more than doubled. By \n2016 the projected cost of insurance for a family of four in Illinois \nwill top $25,000 a year, meaning for a median income family in my \nState, nearly half of their earnings would be spent for health \ninsurance. Obviously, this would prove disastrous to people in Illinois \nand across the Nation.\n  The pressure of increasing premiums is hurting our economy from the \nbusiness side as well. Small businesses in particular often cannot \nafford to provide care for their workers. In 2006 only 41 percent of \nIllinois businesses with less than 50 employees were able to\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\noffer coverage. Over the next few years, an additional 19 percent of \nAmerican small businesses may be forced to eliminate their coverage as \nwell. But there is a better way.\n  From a government standpoint, we are currently spending 4 percent of \nthe GDP on Medicare and Medicaid. By 2040, that number could reach 15 \npercent. This level of government spending would be unsustainable. \nThere is a better way.\n  Meaningful reform could cut costs for families, save small \nbusinesses, and even help pay down the budget deficit.\n  Some still say the cost of reform is too high. But the choice is \nclear: We can invest in the right reform now, ensuring quality health \ncare in the future and sustained cost reductions in the long term, or \nwe can do nothing and watch as the cost of health care steadily \nincreases until it drives our families--and our country--to financial \nruin.\n  My colleagues and I have real solutions. We can ensure that every \nsingle American has access to quality, affordable health care. We can \nsave money on administrative costs and put an end to coverage denials \ndue to preexisting conditions. With a shift in our focus from what we \nrefer to as ``sick care'' and toward preventive medicine, we can keep \npeople healthier, bolster our economy, and we can save money. This is \nthe better way.\n  I urge my colleagues to leave partisanship at the door and do what is \nright for the American people. We cannot afford to do any less.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this week, bloody clashes have erupted \nbetween the minority Uighur community and the majority Han ethnic group \nin the Xinjiang region of western China. Reports indicate that the \nChinese Government has responded with a heavy hand--deploying police \nand paramilitary troops, establishing a curfew, closing mosques, \ncutting off Internet and mobile phone access, and rounding up and \narresting innocent civilians.\n  The state-controlled media reported that at least 156 Chinese \ncitizens have been killed, more than 1,000 have been injured, and \napproximately 1,400 have been arrested since the clashes began earlier \nthis week.\n  I am deeply concerned about ongoing tension in Xinjiang and believe \nthe senseless loss of life, suppression of press freedom, and \nviolations of basic human rights is unconscionable in China, and \nanywhere else in the world.\n  Today, I call on all parties to demonstrate restraint, end the \nviolence, cease persecution of minorities, and protect fundamental \nhuman rights. I also call on the Chinese Government to open Internet \nand mobile phone access, end jamming of international broadcasting, and \nlift the grave and growing restrictions on the press.\n  We all know independent journalists have been censored for decades in \nChina--a fact that is painfully evident as we try to understand how \nrecent demonstrations metastasized into violence in western China.\n  According to the State Department Report on Human Rights for 2009, \nthe Chinese Government has increased cultural and religious repression \nof ethnic minorities, including on the Muslim Uighurs. It appears that \nas ethnic tensions rose, members of the Uighur community took to the \nstreets, resulting in an aggressive crackdown by the Chinese security \nforces on Sunday.\n  The exact circumstances by which violence transpired remains unclear, \nlargely because the government censors information including the \nofficial number of casualties.\n  In what can only be described as questionable, these numbers have \nremained stagnant in the past two days\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\ndespite ongoing violence and civil unrest.\n  In recent years, the Chinese Government has demonstrated great \nefficiency in monitoring the Internet and restricting Web sites such as \nFacebook, My Space, Twitter, YouTube, blogs, and other outlets of \ninformation to monitor the free exchange of ideas among its people and \nthe press.\n  It has also used advanced technology to jam international satellite \nand radio broadcasting including the U.S.-funded Voice of America and \nRadio Free Asia.\n  In Xinjiang specifically, it has shut down more than 50 Uighur \nlanguage Internet forums, jammed Radio Free Asia's Uighur-language \nservice, and cut off Internet and mobile phone access in the past week.\n  In fact, Li Zhi, a top Communist Party official in Urumqi, the \ncapital of Xinjiang, Province, confirmed yesterday that the government \ncut off Internet access to the region.\n  Because of such limitations, the Han population now believes that the \nUighurs are solely responsible for ongoing unrest, and such \nmisperceptions have elevated the level of ethnic tension. By creating a \nvacuum of information in and out of Xinjiang, the Chinese Government \nhas exacerbated the crisis.\n  While the casualty numbers remain uncertain, it is clear that recent \ndevelopments have incurred an immeasurable human toll, including--but \nnot limited to--the loss of innocent lives.\n  There have been pictures of children in hospitals, who have been \nforced to witness violence perpetrated against their parents. The \nWashington Post today reported emotional stories of women demanding the \nreturn of their missing husbands.\n  And the UK's Guardian reveals an image of an elderly woman on \ncrutches standing defiantly in front of a police riot bus, an image \nwhich is eerily reminiscent of the bravery and defiance demonstrated 20 \nyears ago in Tiananmen.\n  These glimpses of ongoing developments stir great empathy and anger, \nand it is essential that the whole story be told, among the \ninternational community and also within China. This is why I call on \nthe Chinese Government to provide unimpeded press coverage and Internet \naccess, allow journalists to report without restrictions. I condemn the \ncontinued repression of Uighurs and violence perpetrated against all \ninnocent civilians in China and hope the ongoing unrest will soon be \nbrought to an end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7254-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7254-S7255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BRITISH HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, a July 7, 2009, Wall Street Journal editorial \n``Of NICE and Men'' describes the denial and delay of health care in \nBritain as a result of decisions by the British government's health \ncare cost-containment board, the National Institute for Health and \nClinical Excellence, NICE.\n  The article quotes the Guardian, which in 1998 reported, ``Health \nministers are setting up [NICE], designed to ensure that every \ntreatment, operation, or medicine used is the proven best. It will root \nout under-performing doctors and useless treatments, spreading best \npractices everywhere.''\n  Yet NICE routinely denies patients the very treatments and \nmedications they need.\n  For example, according to the editorial, ``NICE ruled against the use \nof two drugs, Lapatinib and Sutent, that prolong the life of those with \ncertain forms of breast and stomach cancer.''\n  Explaining the ruling against the use of a drug that would help \nterminally ill kidney-cancer patients, Peter Littlejohns, NICE's \nclinical public health director, said there is ``a limited pot of \nmoney.''\n  The editorial provides numerous other examples of drugs and \ntreatments that are either denied or restricted in order to reduce \ncosts.\n  And it explains how NICE has even assigned a mathematical formula for \ndetermining the maximum amount the government will spend to extend a \nlife for 6 months.\n  President Obama has praised countries that spend less than the U.S. \non health care, while saying we can spend less here too, even while \nadding tens of millions to a government-run health care program and \nimproving the quality of care.\n  This editorial clearly and concisely outlines why this cannot be \nachieved and why, if President Obama's health care plan passes, the \nadministration's new Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research \ncould eventually gain the same authority to deny or delay treatments \nand care as Britain's NICE.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record, \nand urge my colleagues to consider the facts and arguments contained in \nthis editorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 7, 2009]\n\n                            Of NICE and Men\n\n       Speaking to the American Medical Association last month, \n     President Obama waxed enthusiastic about countries that \n     ``spend less'' than the U.S. on health care. He's right that \n     many countries do, but what he doesn't want to explain is how \n     they ration care to do it.\n       Take the United Kingdom, which is often praised for \n     spending as little as half as much per capita on health care \n     as the U.S. Credit for this cost containment goes in large \n     part to the National Institute for Health and Clinical \n     Excellence, or NICE. Americans should understand how NICE \n     works because under ObamaCare it will eventually be coming to \n     a hospital near you.\n       * * *\n       The British officials who established NICE in the late \n     1990s pitched it as a body that would ensure that the \n     government-run National Health System used ``best practices'' \n     in medicine. As the Guardian reported in 1998: ``Health \n     ministers are setting up [NICE], designed to ensure that \n     every treatment, operation, or medicine used is the proven \n     best. It will root out under-performing doctors and useless \n     treatments, spreading best practices everywhere.''\n       What NICE has become in practice is a rationing board. As \n     health costs have exploded in Britain as in most developed \n     countries, NICE has become the heavy that reduces spending by \n     limiting the treatments that 61 million citizens are allowed \n     to receive through the NHS. For example:\n       In March, NICE ruled against the use of two drugs, \n     Lapatinib and Sutent, that prolong the life of those with \n     certain forms of breast and stomach cancer. This followed on \n     a 2008 ruling against drugs--including Sutent, which costs \n     about $50,000--that would help terminally ill kidney-cancer \n     patients. After last year's ruling, Peter Littlejohns, NICE's \n     clinical and public health director, noted that ``there is a \n     limited pot of money,'' that the drugs were of ``marginal \n     benefit at quite often an extreme cost,'' and the money might \n     be better spent elsewhere.\n       In 2007, the board restricted access to two drugs for \n     macular degeneration, a cause of blindness. The drug Macugen \n     was blocked outright. The other, Lucentis, was limited to a \n     particular category of individuals with the disease, \n     restricting it to about one in five sufferers. Even then, the \n     drug was only approved for use in one eye, meaning those \n     lucky enough to get it would still go blind in the other. As \n     Andrew Dillon, the chief executive of NICE, explained at the \n     time: ``When treatments are very expensive, we have to use \n     them where they give the most benefit to patients.''\n       NICE has limited the use of Alzheimer's drugs, including \n     Aricept, for patients in the early stages of the disease. \n     Doctors in the U.K. argued vociferously that the most \n     effective way to slow the progress of the disease is to give \n     drugs at the first sign of dementia. NICE ruled the drugs \n     were not ``cost effective'' in early stages.\n       Other NICE rulings include the rejection of Kineret, a drug \n     for rheumatoid arthritis; Avonex, which reduces the relapse \n     rate in patients with multiple sclerosis; and lenalidomide, \n     which fights multiple myeloma. Private U.S. insurers \n     often cover all, or at least portions, of the cost of many \n     of these NICE-denied drugs.\n       NICE has also produced guidance that restrains certain \n     surgical operations and treatments. NICE has restrictions on \n     fertility treatments, as well as on procedures for back pain, \n     including surgeries and steroid injections. The U.K. has \n     recently been absorbed by the cases of several young women \n     who developed cervical cancer after being denied pap smears \n     by a related health authority, the Cervical Screening \n     Programme, which in order to reduce government healthcare \n     spending has refused the screens to women under age 25.\n       We could go on. NICE is the target of frequent protests and \n     lawsuits, and at times under political pressure has reversed \n     or watered-down its rulings. But it has by now established \n     the principle that the only way to control health-care costs \n     is for this panel of medical high priests to dictate limits \n     on certain kinds of care to certain classes of patients.\n       The NICE board even has a mathematical formula for doing \n     so, based on a ``quality adjusted life year.'' While the \n     guidelines are complex, NICE currently holds that, except in \n     unusual cases, Britain cannot afford to spend more than about \n     $22,000 to extend a life by six months. Why $22,000? It seems \n     to be arbitrary, calculated mainly based on how much the \n     government wants to spend on health care. That figure has \n     remained fairly constant since NICE was established and \n     doesn't adjust for either overall or medical inflation.\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\n       Proponents argue that such cost-benefit analysis has to \n     figure into health-care decisions, and that any medical \n     system rations care in some way. And it is true that U.S. \n     private insurers also deny reimbursement for some kinds of \n     care. The core issue is whether those decisions are going to \n     be dictated by the brute force of politics (NICE) or by \n     prices (a private insurance system).\n       The last six months of life are a particularly difficult \n     moral issue because that is when most health-care spending \n     occurs. But who would you rather have making decisions about \n     whether a treatment is worth the price--the combination of \n     you, your doctor and a private insurer, or a government board \n     that cuts everyone off at $22,000?\n       One virtue of a private system is that competition allows \n     choice and experimentation. To take an example from one of \n     our recent editorials, Medicare today refuses to reimburse \n     for the new, less invasive preventive treatment known as a \n     virtual colonoscopy, but such private insurers as Cigna and \n     United Healthcare do. As clinical evidence accumulates on the \n     virtual colonoscopy, doctors and insurers will be able to \n     adjust their practices accordingly. NICE merely issues \n     orders, and patients have little recourse.\n       This has medical consequences. The Concord study published \n     in 2008 showed that cancer survival rates in Britain are \n     among the worst in Europe. Five-year survival rates among \n     U.S. cancer patients are also significantly higher than in \n     Europe: 84% vs. 73% for breast cancer, 92% vs. 57% for \n     prostate cancer. While there is more than one reason for this \n     difference, surely one is medical innovation and the greater \n     U.S. willingness to reimburse for it.\n       * * *\n       The NICE precedent also undercuts the Obama \n     Administration's argument that vast health savings can be \n     gleaned simply by automating health records or squeezing out \n     ``waste.'' Britain has tried all of that but ultimately has \n     concluded that it can only rein in costs by limiting care. \n     The logic of a health-care system dominated by government is \n     that it always ends up with some version of a NICE board that \n     makes these life-or-death treatment decisions. The \n     Administration's new Council for Comparative Effectiveness \n     Research currently lacks the authority of NICE. But over \n     time, if the Obama plan passes and taxpayer costs inevitably \n     soar, it could quickly gain it.\n       Mr. Obama and Democrats claim they can expand subsidies for \n     tens of millions of Americans, while saving money and \n     improving the quality of care. It can't possibly be done. The \n     inevitable result of their plan will be some version of a \n     NICE board that will tell millions of Americans that they are \n     too young, or too old, or too sick to be worth paying to care \n     for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7255-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CRISIS IN HONDURAS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the current \npolitical crisis in Honduras. Vermont and Honduras have had a long, \nclose relationship through the Partners of the Americas, and many \nVermonters regularly travel to Honduras to engage in health care and \nother humanitarian and development work in rural communities.\n  Last week a lawfully elected President--Manuel Zelaya--was forcibly \nremoved from office and flown to a neighboring country by the Honduran \nmilitary. The military and the Supreme Court apparently believed that \nPresident Zelaya was acting in a manner that was contrary to the \nHonduran Constitution. While such an accusation is troubling, military \ncoups cannot be condoned, particularly when Honduras' Constitution \ncontains provisions to handle such concerns--impeachment, for one.\n  The sooner the Honduran military reverses course and allows President \nZelaya to return the better it will be for Honduras and all of Central \nAmerica. He has pledged to leave office at the end of his term, unlike \nother Latin American leaders who seem to believe constitutions are to \nbe amended with the stroke of a pen so they can remain in office. When \nPresident Zelaya returns, if there is credible evidence that he broke \nlaws, he should be held accountable in accordance with the laws of the \ncountry.\n  While I condemn the actions of the Honduran military, I applaud the \nefforts of the Organization of American States, with the support of the \nObama administration, to defuse this situation diplomatically. Removing \nHonduras' membership and beginning to impose sanctions in concert with \nwidespread international condemnation is the appropriate response.\n  We should also recognize that the people of Honduras appear to be \ndeeply divided over President Zelaya. Rural Hondurans in particular \nhave been dissatisfied with his performance as President. When he \nreturns to office I hope he reconsiders his priorities and focuses his \nefforts on improving the lives of the people of Honduras who are most \nin need of the government's assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7255-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOSPITAL QUALITY REPORT CARD ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs Hospital Quality Report Card Act of 2009.\n  One of my proudest jobs in the Senate is serving on the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs. Among its other roles, this committee \nprovides oversight of VA health facilities, working with information \nfrom the VA, its Inspector General, Veterans Service Organizations, and \nthe general public. We work with a lot of information--it is, after \nall, our committee's job. But sifting through a pile of reports to find \nthe best hospitals should not be a full time job for those who need \nhealth care. This bill will help ensure that it is not.\n  Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this bill, \nthe VA would be mandated to establish a Hospital Quality Report Card \nInitiative. Under the Initiative, the Secretary would be required to \npublish reports on the VA's hospitals which assess health care \neffectiveness, safety, timeliness, efficiency, patient-centeredness, \nsatisfaction of patients and health professionals, and care equity. \nThese factors would be assessed as letter grades, to ensure that the \nresults of these reports are not swabbed over with bureaucratic jargon.\n  In collecting and reporting this data, the Secretary would have to \ninclude extensive and detailed patient-centered information such as \nstaffing levels of nurses, rates of infections contracted at VA \nhospitals, volume of various procedures performed, hospital sanctions \nand other violations, the availability of emergency rooms, the quality \nof care in various hospital settings, and additional measures \ndetermined appropriate by the VA Secretary. Each report submitted under \nthe Initiative would have to be available in electronic and hard copy \nformats, in an understandable manner, and allow for a comparison of the \nindividual VA hospital quality with local or regional hospitals.\n  The bill would further mandate that the Secretary institute quality \ncontrol measures to identify potential data irregularities that would \nlead to artificial improvements in the hospital's quality measurements. \nIn addition, the Secretary would need to evaluate and periodically \nreport to Congress--and the public--on the effectiveness of this \nInitiative.\n  I believe that our veterans should easily be able to identify the \nbest hospitals around them. It is unconscionable to make often elderly \nand disabled veterans wade through pages of statistical data in order \nto assure themselves that their local VA health facility is providing \nthe best care possible. Often, the factors veterans care about such as \nthe wait times for appointments and medical attention--are not measured \nreliably or presented to veterans in an accessible or usable fashion. I \nwant to change that. Information on health facilities should not be a \nprivilege; it should be an obligation for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. This legislation is a positive step in the right direction.\n  I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this commonsense legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7255-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7255-S7256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING ARNOLD PALMER\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today, I honor one of the great sports \nlegends of all time, Arnold Palmer. Not only is Arnold Palmer a world-\nclass athlete, he is a generous philanthropist and devoted husband, \nfather, and grandfather. This son of Latrobe, PA, changed the game of \ngolf, both how it is played and how it is appreciated, forever.\n  Mr. Palmer learned how to play golf when he was merely 4 years old, \nplaying with clubs his father had cut down for him at Latrobe Country \nClub. His talent emerged visibly at an early age, and he was soon able \nto outplay children far older than him. He began to caddy when he was \n11 years old and later held almost every job at the country club. In \nhis late teens, he also served as a member of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  His seven major career victories make Mr. Palmer one of the greatest \ngolfers of all time. He won the Masters Tournament four times in 1958, \n1960,\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\n1962, and 1964; the U.S. Open in 1960 and the British Open in 1961 and \n1962. He twice represented the United States in the Ryder Cup Match, \nincluding serving as captain of the victorious American team in 1963.\n  In 1997, he successfully battled prostate cancer and is a champion of \nprograms supporting cancer research and early detection. In addition to \nthe numerous charities he supports, Mr. Palmer led a fundraising drive \ncreating the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando and the \nLatrobe Area Hospital Charitable Foundation.\n  Mr. Palmer has led by example in kindness, good sportsmanship, and \ngenerosity. Today, along with my colleagues, I ask Congress to award \nMr. Palmer a gold medal in recognition of his service to the Nation in \npromoting excellence and good sportsmanship in golf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7256-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING JOHANNA JUSTIN-JINICH\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, on Wednesday, May 6, 2009, Johanna \nJustin-Jinich, a resident of Timnath, CO, was senselessly murdered in \nMiddletown, CT. Johanna was a member of the Class of 2010 at Wesleyan \nUniversity--my alma mater. Faculty and students alike describe a \nvibrant, intelligent, creative, and compassionate young woman. A young \nwoman whose short life was full of exuberance and study--and public \nservice. Johanna's friends note that her warmth, passion, and \ndedication to those she loved that defined her life to the very end. \nAnd these qualities are what they will miss the most.\n  Johanna's family and her friends have suffered an unspeakable loss \nand will no doubt continue to grieve for the loss of someone so \ncompassionate, so dedicated, and so giving. Wesleyan University and the \ntown of Timnath have witnessed the passing of one too young and with so \nmuch potential to serve the public good. She was particularly committed \nto helping women gain access to proper health care and resources, \nregardless of their means. Johanna's concern for public health can be \ntraced back to her family. Her maternal grandmother, a Holocaust \nsurvivor, was a doctor, as are both of her parents.\n  As Wesleyan's president, Michael Roth, said ``We return to the \nrhythms of our campus lives with the memory of our loss still very \nfresh. We turn again, and we remember. May Johanna's memory be a \nblessing to us all.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7256-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING CUSTOM CORDAGE, LLC\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize the contributions \nof a tremendously innovative small business from my home State of \nMaine--Custom Cordage, LLC--that has taken on the mission of helping \nlobstermen dispose of their old, unusable rope by transforming it into \ncharming gifts.\n  When Maine lobstermen went to set their traps this spring, they first \nhad to replace the rope they used to connect one lobster trap to \nanother as the result of a new regulation banning the use of \ntraditional floating rope. It requires lobster pots to be linked with \nsink-rope, the goal being to reduce the risk of entangling whales. \nRegrettably, Maine's lobstermen face a financial burden as the new \nsink-rope can cost twice as much as float-rope and is far more \nexpensive to maintain. Additionally, the new regulation threatened to \nresult in hundreds of thousands of pounds of unusable rope clogging \nlocal landfills.\n  Aware of this mounting problem for Maine's lobstermen, David Bird, \nowner of Custom Cordage, a Waldoboro company that manufactures a \nvariety of rope, cord, and similar products, decided last summer to \nbegin making doormats out of retired float-rope. This colorful float-\nrope is uniquely weathered by seasons of use and exposure to salt \nwater, producing a distinctive and lasting gift. Previously, the \nrepurchased float-rope was melted and reformed as cheap plastic pots \nfor plants. Now, the float-rope is beginning to grace the front doors \nof houses across the country in the form of high-quality, handwoven \ndoormats.\n  Mr. Bird's creative and novel idea has caught the Nation's attention \nquickly. His company produces roughly 40 mats each day, and customers \nfrom across the Nation purchase over a thousand mats per month! An \nexceptional product, these vivid doormats were recently acknowledged as \nthe ``Best New Product'' at this year's New England Products Trade Show \nin Portland.\n  Maine's lobster industry, comprised of more than 7,000 owner-operated \nsmall businesses, is a pillar of Maine's fishing industry and of our \nState's economy. Thanks to the forward-looking actions of Mr. Bird, \nlobstermen can more effectively offset the cost of upgrading to sink-\nrope, and the old float-rope can be kept out of local landfills. My \nsincerest thanks to Mr. Bird and everyone at Custom Cordage for their \ndevotion to building forward-thinking small businesses that help our \nenvironment, our lobstermen, and our local economy. I wish them all \nsuccess with this and future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7256-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7256-S7257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING MAINE FLOAT-ROPE COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize the contributions \nof a tremendously innovative small business from my home State of \nMaine--the Maine Float-Rope Company--that has taken on the mission of \nhelping lobstermen dispose of their old, unusable rope by transforming \nit into charming gifts.\n  When Maine lobstermen went to set their traps this spring, they first \nhad to replace the rope they used to connect one lobster trap to \nanother as the result of a new regulation banning the use of \ntraditional floating rope. It requires lobster pots to be linked with \nsink-rope, the goal being to reduce the risk of entangling whales. \nRegrettably, Maine's lobstermen face a financial burden as the new \nsink-rope can cost twice as much as float-rope and is far more \nexpensive to maintain. Additionally, the new regulation threatened to \nresult in hundreds of thousands of pounds of unusable rope clogging \nlocal landfills.\n  Seeking to keep the old rope out of landfills, Penny Johnston, a \nsales and marketing specialist, established the Waldoboro-based Maine \nFloat-Rope Company in April of this year. Her goal was to ramp up sale \nof the resourceful doormats that a local company, Custom Cordage, began \ncreating last summer out of retired float-rope. Specifically, her \ncompany sells the attractive and durable Down East Doormats that are \nconstructed using the colorful float-rope that is uniquely weathered by \nseasons of use and exposure to salt water. Previously, the repurchased \nfloat-rope was melted and reformed as cheap plastic pots for plants. \nNow, the float-rope is beginning to grace the front doors of houses \nacross the country in the form of high-quality, handwoven doormats. In \nfact, since Ms. Johnston's involvement, sales have skyrocketed, with \nMaine Float-Rope selling over a thousand mats per month!\n  In addition, Maine Float-Rope donates a percentage of its profits to \norganizations that support the vitality of lobstermen, the protection \nof North Atlantic right whales, and a host of groups that advocate for \nenvironmentally sound practices. An exceptional product, the vivid Down \nEast Doormat was recently acknowledged as the ``Best New Product'' at \nthis year's New England Products Trade Show in Portland.\n  Ms. Johnston, who calls herself a ``green entrepreneur,'' has a \nsuccessful record of starting businesses based on creative uses of old \nand recycled material. Prior to founding the Maine Float-Rope Company, \nMs. Johnston started The Maine Barn Furniture Company, which took wood \nfrom old, dilapidated barns and used it to make handsome tables. She \nalso started Historic Hardscapes, a unique business that reclaims and \nreuses old hand-cut granite from abandoned farmlands and quarries \nacross the State. Down East Doormats are one more example of how Ms. \nJohnston finds innovative ways to turn what others would simply discard \ninto high-quality products.\n  Maine's lobster industry, comprised of more than 7,000 owner-operated \nsmall businesses, is a pillar of Maine's fishing industry and of our \nState's economy. Thanks to the actions of Ms. Johnston, lobstermen can \nmore effectively offset the cost of upgrading to\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\nsink-rope, and the old float-rope can be kept out of local landfills. \nMy sincerest thanks to Ms. Johnston and everyone at the Maine Float-\nRope Company for their devotion to building forward-thinking small \nbusinesses that help our environment, our lobstermen, and our local \neconomy. I wish them all success with this and future ``green \nentrepreneurial'' endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7257-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7257-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/08/senate-section/article/S7257-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, announced that the House has passed the following bills, \nin which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1129.

A bill to expedite the adjudication of employer petitions \nfor aliens with extraordinary artistic ability; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, one of the best ways that the U.S. can gain \nunderstanding and appreciation of other cultures is through the arts. \nExposing children and adults alike to the creativity of other countries \nenriches our own artistic talents and helps bridge the gap between \nnations. It is for those reasons my colleague Senator Hatch and I have \nintroduced the Arts Require Timely Service, ARTS, Act.\n  This legislation helps streamline the visa process and waive fees so \nthat foreign artists and musicians can share their talents in the U.S. \nCurrently, the visa process for visiting artists is slow and costly, \noften times prohibiting artists from coming to the U.S. to share their \ntalents. Breaking down these barriers is important and we shouldn't let \nthe politics of immigration interfere with expanding our cultural \nhorizons.\n  I am proud to stand with Senator Hatch and the Performing Arts Visa \nTask Force to try and help artists visit our country and inspire our \ncommunities. I hope our colleagues will join us and pass this sensible \nreform to expedite cultural exchanges and artistic expression.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce with my colleague, \nSenator John Kerry, the Arts Require Timely Services, ARTS, Act.\n  For some time, I have been working to improve the processing of visa \npetitions filed by nonprofit arts organizations. Unfortunately, years \nof delays, errors, and unpredictability have forced some U.S.-based \nnonprofit arts organizations from even trying to bring international \nartists into the United States. We must eliminate some of the \nbureaucratic barriers that have been negatively affecting performing \nartists.\n  There is no doubt that nonprofit arts organizations across the \ncountry engage foreign guest artists in their orchestras, theatres, and \ndance and opera companies. In my home state of Utah, I am aware that \nmany organizations that will benefit from passage of the ARTS Act, \nincluding Brigham Young University, Cache Valley Center for the Arts, \nThe Orchestra of Southern Utah, University of Utah, Murray Symphony \nOrchestra, Salt Lake Symphony, and the Utah Shakespeare Festival, to \nname a few.\n  The ARTS Act would apply only to temporary, nonimmigrant visas for \nforeign artists visiting the United States. The legislation would \nrequire U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to treat as a Premium \nProcessing case, or a 15-day turn-around, free of additional charge, \nany nonprofit arts-related O- and P-visa petition that it fails to \nadjudicate within 30 days. In November 2007, the Congressional Budget \nOffice issued a cost estimate for the ARTS Act, stating that the bill \nwould have no significant cost to the Federal Government.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will support passage of this \nlegislation in the near future.\n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Kennedy (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Sanders, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1410.--A bill to establish expanded learning time initiatives, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege today to be introducing \ntwo bills to improve our schools and bring them into the 21st century. \nThe Time for Innovation Matters in Education Act, S. 1410, or TIME Act, \nseeks to expand our 19th century school calendar to provide more time \nfor learning across the curriculum. The Keeping Parents and Communities \nEngaged Act, S. 1411, or Keeping PACE Act, will encourage greater \ninvolvement of parents in their children's education, and engage \ncommunity partners in supporting the comprehensive learning needs of \nstudents in school.\n  These bills take different approaches, but both address critical \nchallenges for our Nation's schools. By providing the time and \nresources for students to succeed, we can ensure that all students are \nequipped with the tools needed to be successful in the 21st century \neconomy.\n  As a result of the current 6 hours a day, 180 days a year schedule, \nAmerican students spend about 30 percent less time in school than \nstudents in other leading nations. This gap hinders the ability of our \nstudents to compete with their peers around the globe who derive a \nsignificant advantage by having more time to learn what they need to \nknow. About 1,000 U.S. schools are already tackling this problem on \ntheir own, and now it's time for the Federal Government to step up and \nhelp more students obtain the time in school they need.\n  The TIME Act authorizes $350 million next year, increasing to up to \n$500 million in 2014, to support schools in expanding learning time by \n300 hours a year and redesigning their school day to meet the needs of \nstudents and teachers. The act promotes partnerships between schools \nand community-based organizations in expanding and redesigning the \nschool schedule to give students a broader learning experience and \nencourage innovation. The goal of the act is not merely to encourage \nschools to add more time at the end of the day, but to take a close \nlook at how they use their time and redesign the entire school schedule \nfor the benefit of students' learning experiences.\n  Studies document the difference an extra hour of school each day, a \nfew more weeks of school each year, or additional time after or before \nschool for tutoring can make to all students. According to these \nstudies, the students for whom this time is most important for are the \nstudents we need to be focusing on--our neediest students. Students in \ndisadvantaged families show a drop-off in learning over long summer \nrecesses compared to their better-off classmates, and they fall farther \nbehind each year. A 2007 study found that \\2/3\\ of the reading \nachievement gap between 9th graders of low and high socioeconomic \nstanding in Baltimore public schools can be traced to what they \nlearned, or failed to learn, during their summers.\n\n[[Page S7264]]\n\n  These students also are less likely to have parents with the time to \nhelp them with their school work. Expanded learning time can help these \nneedy students catch up by shortening their summer recesses, providing \nmore time for educators to support student learning, and giving schools \nthe opportunity to provide these students with additional nutritious \nmeals.\n  In addition to those at risk of falling behind, more time for \nlearning helps students who are on grade level get ahead, by providing \ngreater time for enrichment and a broader curriculum. Additional time \nalso enables more students to participate in experiential and \ninteractive learning, in service learning opportunities in their \nschools and communities, and in internships, all of which help keep \nstudents engaged in school and make school more relevant.\n  For additional time to be used most effectively, it must also work \nfor teachers. The act encourages the use of this time for greater \nteacher planning and collaboration across grades and subjects, so that \nteachers can work together to help their students. Today's elementary \nschool teachers spend less than 10 percent of their time planning \nlessons and preparing for classes--compared to over 40 percent for \ntheir Asian counterparts. Just as it does for students, time matters \nfor teachers, by helping them to help their students more effectively.\n  To assess the difference these programs will make, the TIME Act calls \nfor a comprehensive evaluation of the programs it supports. We're still \nin the learning stages of expanded learning time. It is intuitive that \ntime matters, but we're still learning what practices work best--for \nteachers, for students, and for schools. This evaluation will ensure \nthat we will learn as much as possible about what works, and that the \nDepartment of Education will be able to do a better job of sharing best \npractices nationwide in supporting these initiatives.\n  Expanded learning is an idea whose time has come, thanks in large \npart to the leadership of Massachusetts. As John Adams wrote in the \nMassachusetts Constitution in 1780, the education of the people is \n``necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties.'' Ever \nsince, Massachusetts has been ahead of the curve in education reform. \nIn recent years, the Commonwealth has developed a significant expanded \nlearning time initiative that enables schools to offer 300 additional \nhours of instruction during the school year, allocated as each school \nchooses. The initiative began with 10 schools in 2006. Twenty-six \nschools are now participating, and more than 40 are now planning to \nparticipate.\n  At the Edwards Middle School in Boston's Charlestown neighborhood, \nadditional time has made a difference. The percentage of students \nscoring ``proficient'' on math tests rose almost thirteen points during \nits first year with expanded school hours, and the school is also \noffering a wide array of extracurricular activities, including Latin \nAmerican Dance, Musical Theater, and valuable apprenticeship \nopportunities.\n  We know that many schools and districts around the country are \nseeking better ways to strengthen the support they offer parents and to \ndeepen their connection with their communities. The No Child Left \nBehind Law includes requirements to develop parent-involvement policies \nand programs, release school report cards, and engage parents and \ncommunity representatives to construct plans to improve struggling \nschools. The Keeping PACE Act builds on these activities to support \nschools in making parents and the community full partners in the \neducation of their children.\n  Parents are their children's first teachers, and they have immense \ninfluence over their children's attitudes, focus, priorities and goals. \nWell-informed parents are more likely to be involved, to ask questions, \nto suggest constructive changes and to make a difference in their \nchild's education. They deserve to know what their children are \nlearning and being tested on, what their children's grades and \nassessment scores mean, and how assessment data can be used to improve \nlearning. Informed and engaged parents can help turn around struggling \nschools.\n\n  Educators have long recognized this fact, based on their own \nexperience and abundant research. Unfortunately, a series of reports by \nAppleseed make clear schools and districts continue to face too many \nchallenges that undermine the effort to achieve parental involvement. \nParents may feel intimidated by language or cultural barriers, or have \ndifficulty understanding their role as an advocate for their children. \nParents too often find that the information provided by schools and \ndistricts is not released in a timely manner, is not clear and student-\nspecific, and uses technical terms that are unfamiliar. Poor \ncommunication also often obscures the school-choice and supplemental-\nservices options for parents under the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Heather Weiss, the director of the Harvard Family Research Project, \nemphasizes that with the conclusive evidence now available, the time \nhas come for action. As she states, ``The question we must ask is, in \naddition to quality schools, what non-school learning resources should \nwe invest in and scale up to improve educational outcomes, narrow \nachievement gaps, and equip our children with the knowledge and skills \nneeded to succeed in the complex and global 21st century?''\n  To encourage greater parent involvement, this bill amends the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act to enable States to award grants \nto local education agencies to assist schools in hiring and maintaining \nParent and Community Outreach Coordinators. These coordinators will \nbuild vital partnerships among families, schools, and the community. \nThey'll work with school principals, teachers, and staff to encourage \nparents to become more involved in their child's education and give \nthem the tools necessary to become successful advocates for their \nchildren. Instead of giving teachers, counselors, and principals more \nto do, every school should have a resource they can turn to for help \nwith identifying student needs and using community resources to help \nall students succeed.\n  Educational research also shows that students flourish in \nenvironments in which learning is a community value and in which \nschools have the ability to address a broad range of student needs. \nMany school districts have established full-service community schools \nthat directly involve parents, families, and the entire community in \neducation. These schools use integrated services to students to help \nmeet multiple local needs in areas such as education, health, social \nservices, and recreation. President Obama has recognized the power of \nthese schools, by often citing the extraordinary success of the Harlem \nChildren's Zone and using it as a model for his Promise Neighborhoods \nproposal.\n  Responding to this research and to success stories from around the \nnation, the Keeping PACE Act will help school districts do more to \nincrease community involvement in schools, provide a wide range of \nsupport and services to children, and make schools the center of their \nneighborhood. The Keeping PACE Act supports incentives for local \neducation agencies to coordinate with mayors, community-based \norganizations, for-profit entities, and other local partners to re-\ndesign and modernize their current school plans and facilities to link \nstudents more effectively with existing resources.\n  Improved coordination among parents, schools, and their communities \ncan create networks that enable and empower students to take advantage \nof many more opportunities to learn, and by doing so, we will uncover \ninnovations to help all schools.\n  As with the TIME Act, establishing this network will benefit not only \nstudents who need the greatest help with their learning, or who are at \nrisk of dropping out, but also those who need more challenging \nschoolwork to keep them engaged and making progress.\n  Yet again, Massachusetts is leading the way. A current Massachusetts \npilot initiative has placed 32 full-time family and community outreach \ncoordinators in Boston public schools. These coordinators are \nresponsible for supporting families, teachers, and the community in a \ncommon effort to help students academically and socially, and their \nefforts have been successful.\n  For example, the Family and Community Outreach Coordinator at the \nCondon School in Boston has offered workshops for parents on middle \nschool transition and math curriculum and coordinated parent \nparticipation on an\n\n[[Page S7265]]\n\nanti-bullying initiative at the school, called the School Climate \nCommittee. The Coordinator has helped teachers and parents make \nconnections for parent-teacher conferences, bringing in over 200 \nparents to participate in a fall open house, in which some of the \nteachers have reported contact with over 80 percent of their students' \nfamilies. The Coordinator has also inspired donations to the school \nthrough the generosity of local businesses.\n  Now is the time for the nation as a whole to make a greater effort on \nexpanded learning and parent and community involvement. These two bills \nconstitute a strong commitment to meet the comprehensive learning needs \nof children and families, guarantee a role for parents and families in \nlocal schools, and provide real hope to students most at-risk of \ndropping out. Addressing these challenges is essential to the future \nand prosperity of our nation as a whole.\n  We know the dimensions of the problem we face. Today, 65 percent of \n12th graders do not read on grade level, and 1.2 million students who \nenter the ninth grade fail to receive a high school diploma four years \nlater. We can no longer afford to pay this high price, either in terms \nof lost human potential or national productivity. These bills will help \nmillions of young people reach their potential, and help make our \neducation system the best in the world once again.\n  The Keeping PACE Act is supported by 40 organizations representing \neducation communities. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \ntheir joint letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 19, 2009.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The 40 undersigned organizations \n     support the Keeping Parents and Communities Engaged (PACE) \n     Act. We commend you for your sponsorship and look forward to \n     working together to include Keeping PACE in the \n     reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act.\n       The Keeping PACE Act creates incentives and structure for \n     schools and communities to work together to support students \n     through coordinated, comprehensive, and targeted approaches \n     to meet the needs of students in school and outside school. \n     We're confident that this approach, supported by extensive \n     research, will lead to greater academic improvement and \n     future success for our young people.\n       The legislation achieves these goals through a series of \n     voluntary programs that will be supported by federal grants. \n     Resources will be available to support parent and community \n     outreach coordinators to assist schools in engaging with the \n     community and achieving greater parental involvement. The \n     bill also will connect students to community resources and \n     comprehensive support services, so that effective community \n     organizations and others can provide students with support \n     outside the classroom to promote academic achievement. In \n     addition, resources will be provided to schools as centers of \n     communities, in order to expand the community school \n     movement.\n       Extensive research and experience support the \n     implementation of each of these three approaches. Through \n     this approach, we believe that schools and communities will \n     be able to provide the services needed by students, \n     particularly those who are disadvantaged. We commend you for \n     introducing this legislation and we look forward to working \n     together to enact it.\n           Sincerely,\n         Communities In Schools; American Association of School \n           Administrators; American Association of University \n           Women; American Federation of Teachers; American Humane \n           Association; America's Promise Alliance; Association \n           for Supervision and Curriculum Development; Boys & \n           Girls Clubs of America; Big Brothers Big Sisters of \n           America; Center for American Progress.\n         Center for Parent Leadership/Commonwealth Institute for \n           Parent Leadership; Chicago Public Schools; Children's \n           Aid Society; Citizen Schools; City Year; Coalition for \n           Community Schools; Family Connection of Easton; First \n           Focus; I Have A Dream Foundation; Massachusetts Parent \n           Information & Resource Center.\n         Mentor; National Alliance of Black School Educators; \n           National Association of Elementary School Principals; \n           National Association of School Psychologists; National \n           Association of Secondary School Principals; National \n           Association of State Boards of Education; National \n           Association of State Directors of Special Education; \n           National Collaboration for Youth; National Coalition \n           for Parent Involvement in Education.\n         National Education Association; National Youth Leadership \n           Council; PACER; Parent Teacher Association; Parent \n           Institute for Quality Education; Public Education \n           Network; The Forum for Youth Investment; The National \n           Coalition of ESEA Title I Parents--Region VII; Save the \n           Children; United Way; Youth Service America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1413. A bill to amend the Adams National Historical Park Act of \n1998 to include the Quincy Homestead within the boundary of the Adams \nNational Historical Park, and for other purposes, to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill designate Quincy Homestead, a local and national treasure, within \nthe boundary of the Adams National Historic Park. The Quincy Homestead, \nlocated in Quincy, MA, was constructed in 1686 by Edmund Quincy II and \nwas called home by five generations of Quincys and is an important \nhistorical site for Massachusetts and the nation. It housed great \nAmericans such as President John Quincy Adams, Oliver Wendell Holmes, \nand Dorothy Quincy Hancock, the first First Lady of Massachusetts. In \nthe years leading up to the American Revolution, it also served as a \nmeeting place for renowned American patriots including President John \nAdams, Josiah Quincy, and John Hancock.\n  In addition to its historical significance the Homestead is also a \npristine example of American architecture and represents its evolution \nover three hundred years. The Quincy Homestead was designated a \nNational Historic Landmark in 2005.\n  While a lot of passion and hard work has gone into the preservation \nand operation of this property, there is more to be done to enhance \nthese efforts and to realize the full potential of this property. \nAdding Quincy Homestead to the Adams National Park will advance \nopportunities for educational and recreational activities at the \nHomestead and allow greater public access to its rich historic and \narchitectural traditions. I believe this piece of legislation will help \nthe citizens of Massachusetts and the American people to take much \nfuller advantage of this stunning, national landmark. I ask all my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. McCASKILL: \n  S. 1414. A bill to confer upon the United States Court of Federal \nClaims jurisdiction to hear, determine, and render final judgment on \nany legal or equitable claim against the United States to receive just \ncompensation for the taking of certain lands in the State of Missouri, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I am here to talk about a simple \nbill that would correct a serious injustice.\n  In 1992, land belonging to over 100 south St. Louis County homeowners \nwas converted into a recreational trail under the National Trails \nSystem Act, which allows rights-of-way abandoned by railroads to be \nmade into trails. I have nothing against the National Trails System \nAct. It is a good program; it improves communities and preserves \nrights-of-way. In 1990, the Supreme Court upheld the program as a \nrightful use of eminent domain, but made it absolutely clear that, in \naccordance with the Fifth Amendment, property owners must be justly \ncompensated for their losses. Only this did not happen in the case of \nmy constituents back in Missouri. These homeowners--modest, hardworking \npeople--were never compensated for the loss of their land.\n  These Missouri homeowners did everything right. First, in December \n1998, they filed their claim. Federal Judge Bruggink ruled the claim to \nbe filed in timely manner, and the Department of Justice later agreed. \nThen, on two separate occasions, Judge Bruggink ruled that the federal \ngovernment was liable for taking the Missouri homeowners' land. After 6 \nyears of litigation, the Department of Justice finally agreed on the \namount of just compensation owed to each homeowner. On December 17, \n2004, Judge Bruggink found the settlement to be fair and prepared to \nenter a final order. However, just days before Judge Bruggink was to \nissue the final order, a separate court--considering an unrelated \ncase--changed the rule on how to calculate the 6-year\n\n[[Page S7266]]\n\nstatute of limitations in which property owners have to file a claim \nfor compensation.\n  This new rule determined that the clock on the statute of limitations \nstarts to run at the time negotiations for a possible trail begin, \ninstead of when a trail is actually established. Frankly, this is a \nlittle ridiculous because the negotiations are between the railroad \ncompany and the trail operator, not the actual property owners who must \nfile the claim. Frequently property owners are not even notified of the \nnegotiations until a trail is established! In the Missouri homeowners' \ncase, negotiations began in March 1992, 6 years and 9 months before \nthey filed their claim. Under the new rule, they filed their claim 9 \nmonths too late. As a result, the Court of Claims no longer had \njurisdiction to approve the settlement and Judge Bruggink was forced to \ndismiss the case. To this day the government is still using these \ncitizens' land for a recreational trail, the Grant's Trail, but the \ncitizens have never been extended their constitutional right to just \ncompensation.\n  Today, along with my distinguished colleague from Missouri, Senator \nBond, I am introducing legislation to correct this injustice. The Fair \nCompensation Act of 2009 would simply confer jurisdiction upon the U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims to hear the Missouri homeowners' claim. We are \ndoing this for people like Gale and Sarah Illig, a retired couple who \nhad a 50-foot wide strip of land taken from their yard. Then there is \nBetty Mea Steinhans, who lived in her home for 51 years. The \nrecreational trail took out a sizable chunk of Betty's prized garden. A \ngovernment appraiser and the DOJ determined that the Federal Government \nowed Betty $31,000. That is almost 25 percent of the value of her home! \nThese Missourians, and dozens like them, have worked hard to purchase \ntheir homes, and they will likely rely on their home's value to provide \nfor them into retirement. They deserve their day in court.\n  Let me make this clear: our legislation does not award a monetary \namount to Missouri landowners. While I certainly think the homeowners \nare entitled to just compensation, that is not Congress' decision. It \nis the Court of Federal Claim's job to make that decision. This \nlegislation would only allow the Court the opportunity to hear this \ncase on its merits and would not require any additional appropriations \nfrom Congress.\n  Congress has the authority to enact special jurisdiction legislation; \nwe have exercised it multiple times and the Supreme Court has upheld \nthis right. In the late 1800s, Congress used it to give the Court of \nFederal Claims jurisdiction to hear the case of a businessman who had \nseveral hundred bales of cotton captured by General Sherman during the \nCivil War. More recently, Congress used it to give the Court \njurisdiction to hear the case of the Pueblo of Isleta Indian Tribe, who \nhad a sizable portion of their land taken by the Federal Government.\n  I want to thank Senator Whitehouse and his staff for working with us \nto draft this legislation. I will continue to work with the Judiciary \nCommittee on this issue, and I urge them to give this important \nlegislation the consideration it deserves. I am confident that Congress \nwill do what is right, and allow these hardworking Missouri homeowners \ntheir day in court.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado:\n  S. 1417. A bill to amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \nAdjustment Act of 1992 to require the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation, to remedy problems caused by a \ncollapsed drainage tunnel in Leadville, Colorado, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nLeadville Mine Drainage Tunnel Remediation Act of 2009. This bill is \nthe same as a bill introduced in the last Congress by my colleague \nRepresentative Doug Lamborn. I was proud to cosponsor that bill in the \nlast Congress, which passed the House of Representative but was not \ntaken up in the Senate, and I am pleased to introduce it today.\n  The Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel Remediation Act addresses concerns \nregarding a mine tunnel in Leadville, Colorado. In 2008, a blockage \nformed in the tunnel that backed up a large volume of water, thereby \ncreating a potential safety hazard to the community in the event of a \ncatastrophic failure. While taking actions to address the immediate \nthreat, questions arose as to whether the Bureau of Reclamation, which \nowns the tunnel, has the authority to help implement a number of \nremedies to reduce this threat and clean up additional contaminated \nwater from the tunnel. My bill would clarify that the Bureau of \nReclamation has the authority to treat water in the tunnel and is \nresponsible for maintaining it in order to reduce future threats to the \ncommunity.\n  The Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel was originally constructed by the \nfederal Bureau of Mines in the 1940s and 1950s to facilitate the \nextraction of lead and zinc ore for World War II and Korean War \nefforts. The Bureau of Reclamation acquired the tunnel in 1959, hoping \nto use it as a source of water for the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, a \nwater diversion project in the Fryingpan and Arkansas River Basins. \nAlthough the tunnel was never used for the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, \nwater that flows out of the tunnel is considered part of the natural \nflow of the Arkansas River. With the passage and subsequent signing \ninto law of H.R. 429 during the 102nd Congress, the Bureau of \nReclamation constructed and continues to operate a water treatment \nplant at the mouth of the tunnel.\n  Groundwater levels at the tunnel have fluctuated in recent years. The \n2008 collapse in the tunnel increased the tunnel's mine pool \nsignificantly, leading to new seeps and springs in the area. Estimates \nsuggest that up to 1 billion gallons of water may have built up behind \nthe blockage within the mine pool.\n  In November 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, sent \na letter to the Bureau of Reclamation expressing concerns over a \ncatastrophic blowout as a result of the built up water, and, in \nFebruary 2008, the Lake County Commissioners declared a state of \nemergency. The Bureau of Reclamation developed a risk assessment in the \narea, and the EPA and the Bureau of Reclamation performed some \nemergency measures to relieve water pressure in the area.\n  While this emergency work was important, the long-term need to \nrehabilitate and maintain the tunnel remains an open question. There \nhas been general agreement on what needs to be done; namely, plugging \nthe tunnel, drilling a well behind the plug, and then pumping the water \nout so it can be piped to the Bureau of Reclamation's existing \ntreatment plant. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Bureau \nof Reclamation has the authority to help solve the problem by treating \nthe water that the EPA plans to pump from behind the blockage.\n  In short, we found there is not only a physical blockage, but also a \nlegal blockage that has prevented the Bureau of Reclamation, the EPA \nand the State of Colorado from reaching an agreement on a long-term \nsolution. This legislation will clear out the legal blockage by \nallowing the Bureau of Reclamation and the EPA to collaboratively \nimplement the proposed remedy and address the unsafe mine pool in the \ntunnel.\n  Specifically, the bill does three things:\n  First, it clarifies that the Bureau of Reclamation has the authority \nto treat water pooling up behind the blockage. Currently, the Bureau \nhas authority to treat ``historic releases,'' which could include water \nbehind the tunnel blockage, but Bureau of Reclamation officials are \nuncertain. In response, this bill eliminates the ``historic release'' \nlanguage and clarifies that the Bureau of Reclamation can treat the \nblocked water in the tunnel.\n  Second, the bill authorizes and directs the Bureau of Reclamation to \nparticipate with the EPA on the remedy established under Superfund for \nthe tunnel. The bill also maintains that the Bureau of Reclamation is \nnot liable for the Superfund site cleanup in Leadville. Nevertheless, \nsince remediation activities will occur within the Superfund site, the \nBureau of Reclamation has been reluctant to implement this remedy. The \nBureau of Reclamation does not want to assume any Superfund liability \nand does not read current law as allowing participation\n\n[[Page S7267]]\n\nwith the EPA on the long-term remedy. The bill clarifies that the \nBureau of Reclamation not only has the authority to implement the long-\nterm solution at the Superfund site, but that it will be required to \njoin the EPA in implementing it.\n  Third, the bill clarifies that the Bureau of Reclamation is required \nto maintain the structural integrity of the tunnel to minimize the \nchance of another blockage within the tunnel.\n  The bill also authorizes any funding that might be necessary for the \nBureau of Reclamation to perform its clarified responsibilities under \nthis bill.\n  By clearing up the legal blockage, the bill will help create a \ncollaborative working relationship between the Bureau of Reclamation, \nthe EPA and the State of Colorado to solve this problem for the long-\nterm benefit of Colorado.\n  I look forward to working with the rest of the Colorado Congressional \ndelegation on this legislation and on moving quickly to address \nconcerns with the Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1417\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to carry out \na study to determine the suitability and feasibility of establishing \nCamp Hale as a unit of the National Park System; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Camp \nHale Study Act of 2009. This is a companion bill to the one my Colorado \ncolleague, Rep. Doug Lamborn, has introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives, H.R. 2330.\n  This bill was first introduced by Rep. Lamborn in the last Congress \nand I was proud to cosponsor that bill. The bill passed the House of \nRepresentatives last session, but was not taken up by the Senate. H.R. \n2330 has passed the House of Representatives in this Congress and I \nhope that the Senate can do the same.\n  I am again pleased to join my colleague Representative Lamborn in \nreintroducing this bill. It concerns an important military legacy from \nthe WWII era. Camp Hale, located in the mountains of central Colorado, \nwas a facility that trained a number of soldiers for combat in high \nalpine and mountainous conditions. Principally, it was a training venue \nfor the Army's 10th Mountain Division and other elements of the U.S. \nArmed Forces. The geography of the area was ideal for winter and high-\naltitude training, with steep mountains surrounding a level valley \nsuitable for housing and other facilities. The camp itself was located \nin Eagle County along the Eagle River, and its training boundary \nincluded lands in Eagle, Summit, Lake, and Pitkin Counties.\n  In addition to the 10th Mountain Division, the 38th Regimental Combat \nTeam, 99th Infantry Battalion, and soldiers from Fort Carson were \ntrained at Camp Hale from 1942 to 1965. Throughout this time, the Army \ntested a variety of weapons and equipment at Camp Hale.\n  Between 1956 and 1965, the camp was also used by the Central \nIntelligence Agency as a secret center for training Tibetan refugees in \nguerilla warfare to resist the Chinese occupation of their mountainous \ncountry.\n  In July 1965, Camp Hale was deactivated and control of the lands was \nreturned to the Forest Service in 1966. Today the camp is part of the \nWhite River and San Isabel National Forests. The U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers is working to clean up potentially hazardous munitions left \nover from weapons testing at the camp, particularly in the East Fork.\n  Camp Hale was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in \n1992. The bill I am introducing today would direct the Secretary of the \nInterior to study the feasibility and suitability of establishing Camp \nHale, near Leadville, CO, as a national historic district.\n  Specifically, the bill directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Director of the National Park Service, to complete a \nspecial resource study of Camp Hale to determine the suitability and \nfeasibility of designating Camp Hale as a separate unit of the National \nPark System, and also to consider other Federal, State, local, private \nor nonprofit means of protecting and interpreting the site. That would \ninclude an analysis of the significance of Camp Hale in relation to the \ndefense of our Nation during World War II and the Cold War, including \nthe use of Camp Hale for training of the 10th Mountain Division and \nother elements of the United States Armed Forces; and use of Camp Hale \nfor training by the Central Intelligence Agency of Tibetan refugees \nseeking to resist the Chinese occupation of Tibet.\n  The study would also examine the opportunities for public enjoyment \nof the site, any operational, management, and private property issues \nthat need to be considered if Camp Hale were to be added to the \nNational Park System, the feasibility of administering Camp Hale as a \nunit of the National Park System considering its size, configuration, \nownership, costs, and other factors, and the adequacy of other \nalternatives for management and resource protection of Camp Hale and \nfor appropriately commemorating the role of Camp Hale in connection \nwith training of United States troops and assistance to Tibetans \nopposed to the occupation of Tibet.\n  The bill also contains language ensuring that existing private \nproperty rights are not affected by this study, including water rights. \nThe bill in this Congress contains a small change from the last bill in \nthat it makes clear that the bill does not affect the ability to \nconstruct needed water infrastructure in the area subject to the study.\n  Camp Hale is an important part of our nation's proud national defense \nlegacy and it deserves to be recognized and protected. The people who \ntrained there are proud of their accomplishments and I am proud to join \nRepresentative Lamborn in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S7268]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

But given the situation, it \n     is the most effective and responsible way to address this \n     challenge facing our Nation. By giving the auto companies a \n     chance to restructure, we will shield the American people \n     from a harsh economic blow at a vulnerable time and we will \n     give American workers an opportunity to show the world, once \n     again, they can meet challenges with ingenuity and \n     determination, and bounce back from tough times and emerge \n     stronger than before.'';\n       Whereas on March 30, 2009, President Barack Obama stated: \n     ``We cannot, and must not, and we will not let our auto \n     industry simply vanish.

It's what helped build the middle class \n     and sustained it throughout the 20th century. It's a source \n     of deep pride for the generations of American workers whose \n     hard work and imagination led to some of the finest cars the \n     world has ever known. It's a pillar of our economy that has \n     held up the dreams of millions of our people . . . .
