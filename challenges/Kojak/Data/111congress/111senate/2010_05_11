Madam President, this past Sunday, a young pitcher for the \nOakland Athletics threw a perfect game. For those of you who do not \nknow baseball, the Oakland Athletics is a baseball team, and throwing a \nperfect game is truly a big deal. It is such a big deal, it is only the \n19th time this has ever happened--and baseball started keeping records \nin 1880-something--and this is the first time it happened on Mother's \nDay.\n  Someone did throw a perfect game on Father's Day. On that Sunday, \nmore than 45 years ago, one of our colleagues made history by \naccomplishing one of the most remarkable, most elusive, and most \ncoveted accomplishments in all of athletics, throwing a perfect game in \nMajor League Baseball. That pitcher was the junior Senator from \nKentucky, Jim Bunning. He threw the second no-hitter of his Hall of \nFame career, and I repeat: this time, a perfect game.\n  To show how stupendous this game Senator Bunning pitched was, \nunderstand this young man who pitched a perfect game last Sunday did \nso, I think, throwing 108 pitches, something like that. Jim Bunning \nthrew 90 pitches. This is unbelievable, that in 9 innings someone could \npitch a whole baseball game and throw only 90 pitches. It is a rare \noccurrence in modern day baseball for someone to complete a game, but \nto complete a game--and a perfect game--in 90 pitches is truly amazing.\n  Sometimes in this body, this Senate, our political passions or \nlegislative objectives get in the way of our personal relationships and \nthe respect we show for one another. When that happens, we do a \ndisservice to the citizens we serve. The Senate was created as a place \nfor leaders to work for the American people, and the only way to do \nthat work is to work together, not against each other.\n  We surely have our differences, just as those we represent do not see \neye to eye on every issue. That is inherent in a representative \ndemocracy, and none of us is perfect. As Senator Jim Bunning once said:\n\n       Everybody makes mistakes. The only time I've ever been \n     perfect was for about two hours and 10 minutes on June 21, \n     1964.\n\n  But we should also be able to appreciate those differences and \nappreciate the distinguished men and women who make up this body, the \nSenate. We have combat veterans. We have a man who has won the \nCongressional Medal of Honor for his valor in combat. We have doctors. \nWe have teachers, farmers, entrepreneurs, Governors, Cabinet \nSecretaries. We have an astronaut, the Senator from Florida, and we \nhave a Hall of Fame pitcher, whom I just talked about.\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\n                           Wall Street Reform\n\n  The day before the perfect game on this past Sunday, a story appeared \non the front page of the Washington Post. The story began this way:\n\n       Something unusual is taking place on the Senate floor: \n     Republicans and Democrats are working together on a major \n     piece of legislation.\n\n  It is a shame that bipartisan cooperation passes for news these days, \nnot to mention front-page news in one of our Nation's largest \nnewspapers.\n  But I hope that collaboration continues this week as we vote on \namendments from both sides, as we move closer to a final vote on this \nvery important piece of legislation. Reforming the rules of the road on \nWall Street is critical to our Nation's future. We need to restore the \nAmerican people's trust in our financial system.\n  The American people demand we act. Families demand we safeguard their \nsavings. Seniors demand we protect their pensions. They have seen big \nbankers gamble away so much of their money--not the bankers' money but \nour money--their retirements, and their home equity, which has been \nshaken. The last thing they want is for their leaders to waste their \ntime also.\n  So I still hope we can pass Wall Street accountability reforms this \nweek. I am going to do everything I can to see that happens.\n\n\n                         Supreme Court Nominee\n\n  Let's talk about the Supreme Court for just a short time. We have \naccomplished much in the first few months of this year. It has been \ndifficult, but we have done a lot. But we have so much more to do. On \nthat list is one of our most important responsibilities as Senators: \ngiving our advice and consent to the President's nominees for the \ncourts and in this instance the Supreme Court.\n  In the day or so since President Obama asked our Solicitor General, \nElena Kagan, to serve as the Court's 112th Justice, she has received \nbipartisan praise for her intellect, her dedication to public service, \nand her ability to bring people together, especially when they \ndisagree. She has produced impressive work as an academic, \ncontributed to lifesaving legislation as a lawyer, and has been a \npolicy aide at the highest levels. She has inspired students as the \ndean of Harvard Law School and made her country and her fellow citizens \nstronger as Solicitor General. So I commend President Obama for \nchoosing her to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\n  My No. 1 goal for this new Supreme Court Justice--I have stated it \npublicly before the Judiciary Committee; I have told the President \nhimself--let's stop having judges go on the Supreme Court. I wanted \nsomeone who had not worn the robe, someone who had a little common \nsense separate and apart from the Supreme Court.\n  I know those Justices have common sense, but they have worn those \nrobes a long time, and I think it is good to get a fresh insight into \nwhat is going on in the world. Elena Kagan is a lawyer and scholar so \nrespected because she knows the value of listening to all sides of an \nargument before making a judgment. In that sense, she is a good role \nmodel for her own confirmation process. Let's listen to what she has to \nsay, to what those who know her have to say about her, and to the \nAmerican people, who demand that the Supreme Court puts the rights of \npeople ahead of the wallets of corporate America.\n  My Republican colleagues--I have heard some in the media say: Well, \nshe is not experienced enough. I developed a personal relationship with \nChief Justice Rehnquist. I developed that respect for him for a couple \nreasons. No. 1, when I was chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, \nI did something for which people said: Why are you bothering? He will \nnever do that. I called him and said: Mr. Justice, would you come over \nto the Senate and talk to my Democratic Senators? He said: I would be \nhappy to.\n  Over he comes. What a wonderful meeting we had. He had a great sense \nof humor. He handled all the questions with ease. Then, shortly \nthereafter, he was sitting where the Acting President pro tempore is \nnow sitting, as we did the impeachment trial of President Clinton. \nAgain, he had such a good sense of fairness as he worked his way \nthrough those very difficult proceedings.\n  He had a bad back, and he would have to get up once in a while--stand \nwhere the Acting President pro tempore is now sitting. When the breaks \nwould be taken, he would go back into one of the rooms back here, and \nwe would all go visit with him--a terrific man. You may not agree with \na lot of the direction of his opinions, but they were brilliantly \nwritten. He had no judicial experience--zero.\n  One of my favorite Supreme Court Justices, in recent years, has been \nSandra Day O'Connor, not because she is a Republican but because she \nwas a good judge. She had run for public office. She served in the \nlegislature in Arizona. That is why she could identify with many of the \nproblems created by us legislators, and she could work her way through \nthat.\n  I think Solicitor General Kagan will bring a lot of those same views \nof these two Republicans to the bench; that is, she has fresh ideas. \nShe has been out in the real world recently. I think she is going to be \na terrific addition to the Supreme Court.\n  Would the Chair now announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/11/senate-section/article/S3488-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator controls 20 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask that the Chair notify me after 15 \nminutes has been used.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I have called up Vitter amendment No. \n3760, which is verbatim, word for word, the Ron Paul language that was \nadded to the House bill in committee by a strong bipartisan vote.\n  In doing so, I also ask unanimous consent to add the following \nSenators as cosponsors: Senators DeMint, Grassley, Hatch, McCain, \nBunning, Crapo, and Risch.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, on the Senate side, I have been a strong \ncosponsor and supporter of S. 604 and Senator Sanders' amendment on \nthis bill. I present this different amendment because Senator Sanders \ndecided to modify his amendment late last week, and I thought there was \na continuing need to have this language exactly as it now appears in \nthe House bill, as it was included in the House bill by a strong \nbipartisan vote in the house committee.\n  First, let me say I support the Sanders amendment. I will vote for \nit. It is a very important and useful look in the rearview mirror, if \nyou will, a one-time audit of significant Federal Reserve activity, \nparticularly in 2008 and 2009. I welcome that.\n  That should not be the end of the matter, and it should not be \nrecognized as all we need because it clearly is not. We need to look in \nthe rearview mirror at those important events. That was a very \nsignificant period. But we also need to look forward because these \nevents and these debates and these opportunities for bailouts and other \nactions absolutely continue. The Vitter amendment addresses that--a \nlook forward as well as that important one-time look back.\n  If we needed any reason to think we need this ability to continue to \nlook forward and look at the detailed provisions of Fed activity, it is \nin the news right now--absolutely right now--in terms of the Greek and \nEuropean economic crisis.\n  Although Chairman Bernanke assured Congress in recent testimony that \n``we have no plans to be involved in any foreign bailouts or anything \nof that sort,'' very recently, in the last few days, the Fed has \nannounced the opening of significant facilities to central banks in \nEurope that certainly involve it, at least at the margin, in that \nactivity.\n  I do not know enough about those recent deals and currency exchange \nswaps to comment on whether they are a good idea or a bad idea, or to \ncomment a clear conclusion about the extent to which they put U.S. \ntaxpayers at risk. But clearly they are a significant event. Clearly, \nthere is significant action of the Fed. And clearly, they are a perfect \nand very recent example of why we need to look in detail at what the \nFed is doing on an ongoing basis.\n  With Greece, Portugal, and Spain, all possibly on the cusp of \nfinancial crisis, with this significant decision of the Fed, we must go \nbeyond the Sanders amendment. We must look forward and not just one \ntime back to ensure the American people that we all know what our \nFederal Reserve is doing and exactly why it is doing it.\n  This Vitter amendment does that. It will bring real reform and \naccountability to the Federal Reserve. That is essential, given the \nhistoric, major actions the Fed has undertaken in the last few years \nand continues to announce, even as we speak, activities that would not \nbe covered by the Sanders amendment.\n  There has been a lot of rhetoric about all of the evil and dangerous \nthings my amendment would do at the Fed. Let me directly address and \ndispel these notions.\n  First, there has been a lot of suggestion that this will politicize \nindividual monetary policy decisions; that this will have individual \nMembers of Congress bringing undue influence on those decisions. I \ntruly think there are enormous protections in this amendment that will \nclearly avoid that situation.\n  Let's start with the clear language of the amendment:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as \n     interference in or dictation of monetary policy to the \n     Federal Reserve System by the Congress or the Government \n     Accountability Office.\n\n  It is a very clear, very broad, very strong statement. The amendment \ngoes even farther. The other specific language of the amendment is very \ncareful to ensure the audits that the amendment will require will not \ninclude unreleased transcripts or minutes of meetings of the Federal \nReserve Board of Governors or of the Federal Open Markets Committee.\n  In addition to the extent any audit deals with an individual market \naction, such as a change in interest rates, the audit will only be \nreleased 180 days after the action occurs.\n  If this is an attempt for any Members of Congress, any individuals to \ncontrol individual decisions, to have a direct impact on an individual \ndecision, such as an interest rate decision, it is a pretty dumb, \nineffective way to do it because the audit will not be out for half a \nyear. Clearly, it will have no impact on that decision.\n  Under these protections, the Federal Reserve will still operate \nmonetary policy independently, but it is reasonable that those actions, \nafter an appropriate lag of time in some cases will be transparent, \nwill be fully understandable and fully open to the American people and \nto Congress.\n  Again, I think it is very important to dispel these notions that are \nflying about that are untrue. I have talked with Chairman Bernanke \nseveral times about these proposals. Always, invariably, his stated \nconcern is the opportunity for an audit to try to impact an individual \ndecision, such as an interest rate decision. We have addressed that \nvery directly in the way I explained.\n  In addition, the GAO cannot review many actions such as discount \nwindow lending--direct loans to financial institutions--open market \noperations and any other transactions made under the direction of the \nFederal Open Market Committee.\n  GAO also, under the clear terms of this amendment, cannot look into \nthe Fed's transactions with foreign governments. This, again, is plenty \nof protection against the concerns annunciated prior to this debate and \nvote.\n  What this comes down to is: Do the American people deserve full \ninformation about Federal Reserve decisions or is somehow this beyond \nthe capability of Congress and the American people to digest?\n  In Federal Reserve Board minutes that were only recently released--\nthese minutes go back to 2004--Alan Greenspan said this:\n\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\n\n       We run the risk, by laying out the pros and cons of a \n     particular argument, of inducing people to join in on the \n     debate, and in this regard it is possible to lose control of \n     a process that only we fully understand.\n\n  It is somewhat amazing to me, but that is a verbatim, direct quote. \nMore than any statistic, more than any other quote, more than any fact, \nthat direct quote is about what this debate and what this amendment is \nabout.\n  Is this an area of governance that affects all of our daily lives \nthat we should leave purely up to the elites without ever having full \ntransparency and a full opportunity for debate? Alternatively, is this \nstill America, and do Congress and the American people deserve full \nopenness?\n  Let me read this quote again because it goes to the heart of the \nissue:\n\n       We run the risk, by laying out the pros and cons of a \n     particular argument, of inducing people to join in on the \n     debate, and in this regard it is possible to lose control of \n     a process that only we fully understand.\n\n  If you adopt that offensive, in my opinion, elitist attitude, vote \nagainst the Vitter amendment. If you think we should have much greater \nopenness and transparency and the opportunity for a full debate, with \nall of the protections of the individual, interest rate, and other \ndecisions I have laid out, please vote for the Vitter amendment.\n  Again, Madam President, I will support the Sanders amendment. It is \nan important and appropriate one-time look back, one-time look in the \nrearview mirror about a very important period of time, particularly \n2008-2009 when the Fed was busier and more active with more aggressive \npolicy than ever before. But the opportunity for that aggressive policy \nis not over. We see that this week, with the Fed participating with \nEuropean national banks in the crisis in Europe. We need this \nopportunity on an ongoing basis. We need the Vitter amendment. In \naddition, we need a full audit, and with all of the protections \nincluded, we need that opportunity continuing for full openness and \ntransparency.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont. The \nSenator controls 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me begin by thanking my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Vitter, not only for his remarks today but for \nhis excellent work throughout this process. I have enjoyed working with \nhim. What we have tried to do in this whole process is to bring \ntogether people who come from very different ideologies to basically \nmake the point that the time is now to end the secrecy at the Fed.\n  Madam President, I would like to yield myself 15 minutes, if the \nChair can let me know when 15 minutes has expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, at a time when the Federal Reserve has \nbeen provided the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world, \nto the largest financial institutions in this country--trillion-dollar \ninstitutions--without the approval of Congress, without the real \nknowledge of the American people, the Sanders amendment makes it clear \nthat the Fed can no longer operate forever in the kind of secrecy in \nwhich it has operated. Under the Sanders amendment, for the first time \nthe American people will know exactly who received over $2 trillion in \nzero, or virtually zero, interest loans from the Fed, and they will \nknow the exact terms of those financial arrangements.\n  Under the Sanders amendment, for the first time, the GAO will be \nrequired to conduct a top-to-bottom comprehensive audit of every single \nemergency action the Fed has undertaken since the financial crisis \nbegan. Under the Sanders amendment, for the first time, the GAO will \ninvestigate whether there were conflicts of interest surrounding the \nemergency actions of the Fed.\n  Madam President, the Fed has been fighting all the way to the U.S. \nSupreme Court to keep this information secret. Well, this amendment \nsays, in no uncertain terms, this money does not belong to the Fed; it \nbelongs to the American people, and the American people have a right to \nknow where their taxpayer dollars are going. That is not a difficult \nconcept to get one's arms around. The American people have a right to \nknow.\n  Specifically, the Sanders amendment does two things: First, it \nrequires the Fed to put on its Web site by December 1, 2010, the names \nof all of the financial institutions, corporations and foreign central \nbanks--let me repeat, foreign central banks--that received trillions of \ndollars in taxpayer assistance from the Fed since the beginning of the \nfinancial bailout period.\n  Second, the Sanders amendment requires the GAO--the Government \nAccountability Office--to conduct a top-to-bottom comprehensive audit \nof all of the emergency actions the Fed has taken since the beginning \nof the financial crisis, with a particular focus on all of the \npotential conflicts of interest within these secret deals. And that, \nMadam President, is an extremely important point which, by the way, was \nnot in my original amendment.\n  The fight for a GAO audit of the Fed and to require more transparency \nhas been a long and arduous struggle. There are many people to thank \nfor being at the point we are today. Partisan politics aside, this has \nbeen a joint effort on the part of some of the most progressive Members \nof Congress and some of the most conservative, and some of the most \nprogressive grass roots organizations and some of the most \nconservative.\n  I specifically want to thank, in the Senate, Majority Leader Reid, \nMajority Whip Durbin, Senators Dorgan, Feingold, Boxer, and Leahy and \nmany others for their leadership on this issue on my side of the aisle, \nand to thank Senators DeMint, Vitter, Brownback, McCain, Grassley, and \nothers on the other side of the aisle.\n  Last week, a number of Senators--Democrats and Republicans--indicated \nto me they were uncomfortable with my original amendment, which they \nbelieved would have allowed Congress to be involved in the day-to-day \nmonetary operations of the Fed. That was never my intention, and I \nstill do not believe my original amendment would have done that. \nNonetheless, that is what a number of Senators believed and were \nconcerned about and they came to me about. The chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Dodd, indicated to me if we could clarify this \nissue, he would not only be supportive of this amendment, but he would \ncosponsor it. That is exactly what he did, and I very much appreciate \nhis support.\n  Let me just very briefly speak to what the principles of this \namendment are. No. 1, the Sanders amendment, in terms of transparency, \nis clear we need to make sure the Federal Reserve releases the names of \nevery single financial institution, corporation, and foreign central \nbank the Fed provided over $2 trillion in taxpayer assistance to since \nthe financial crisis started and what the exact details of those \narrangements were. This information, as a result of this amendment, \nwill be on the Fed's Web site on December 1, 2010, and every single \nAmerican who has a computer will be able to access that information. \nThat is a major step forward.\n  Secondly, in terms of the audit, I have always believed the main \npurpose of this audit was for the GAO to conduct a top-to-bottom \ncomprehensive review of every single emergency action the Fed has \nundertaken since the start of the financial crisis. That is exactly \nwhat this amendment does.\n  In addition, let me be clear, the modified amendment--the amendment I \nam offering today--is stronger than my original amendment on one very \nimportant point, a point I think millions of Americans are concerned \nabout; that is, it requires the GAO to investigate whether there were \nconflicts of interest in the establishment of the emergency lending \nprograms at the Fed.\n  My original amendment would have allowed the GAO to look into \nconflicts of interest at the Fed but did not require it. This amendment \nrequires it. We are very specific about that.\n  For example, I want to know--and I think the American people want to \nknow--why Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, attended a meeting \nat the New York Fed when the Federal Government decided to bail out AIG \nto the eventual tune of $182 billion, allowing Goldman Sachs to pocket \n$13 billion of that money. My original amendment would have allowed the \nGAO to look at this. The new amendment makes it clear this kind of \nconflict of\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\ninterest must be looked into by the GAO.\n  Further, I want to know--and I think the American people want to \nknow--why the head of the New York Fed, Stephen Friedman, was allowed \nto serve on the board of directors at Goldman Sachs and was allowed to \npurchase over 37,000 shares of Goldman stock at the same time the New \nYork Fed was approving Goldman's application to become a bank holding \ncompany. My original amendment would have allowed the GAO to look into \nthis. The new Sanders amendment requires the Fed to investigate whether \nconflicts of interest existed in these types of financial deals.\n  Some 35 members of the Fed's Board of Directors are executives at \nbanks which received over $120 billion in TARP money. I want to know--\nand I think the American people want to know--how much these financial \ninstitutions received from the Fed and if this represents a conflict of \ninterest. My original amendment would have allowed the GAO to look at \nthis. The new Sanders amendment requires the GAO to take a look at \nthose potential conflicts of interest.\n  What is important to point out is, in terms of transparency, I am not \nthe only person--other Members of the Senate are not the only people--\nwho is demanding that the Fed tell us to whom they lent money. I would \npoint out that Bloomberg News has gone to court and, in fact, has won \ntwo Federal court decisions against the Fed in which the courts have \nsaid the Fed has to release that information. But the Fed persists in \nsaying no. They want to keep that information secret.\n  So that is where we are today. We are on the verge of lifting the \nveil of secrecy at perhaps the most important government agency in the \nUnited States--an agency which has control of and expends trillions of \ndollars. They do it behind closed doors, and they do it in ways the \nAmerican people know very little about. So I ask for strong support for \nthe Sanders amendment so we can go forward and break this veil of \nsecrecy.\n  With that, Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut \ncontrols 20 minutes, the Senator from Alabama controls 20 minutes, the \nSenator from Vermont has 8\\1/2\\ minutes, and the Senator from \nLouisiana, 9 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me ask how much time my friend needs?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would ask for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the Senator from New Hampshire at least 5 minutes, \nunless he needs more.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, first off, at this point I congratulate \nthe Senator from Vermont and express my appreciation for his very \nconstructive approach to this issue. I had very serious reservations \nregarding his original amendment, but he has worked with Members of \nthis side of the aisle, the chairman of the committee, and members of \nthe administration and the Fed and has come up with an extremely \nresponsible amendment.\n  The Senator's amendment gets to the issues which he is concerned \nabout, which are totally legitimate; that is, the question of \ntransparency and making sure, to the fullest extent possible, the \nAmerican people know what is happening with this very significant \nagency that impacts our lives but which we know little about--a lot of \nAmericans don't--and that is the Federal Reserve.\n  I also wish to congratulate Chairman Bernanke--he and his staff--for \nstepping forward and aggressively pursuing a resolution to this issue \nin a manner which I think will be very positive for both sides.\n  So I intend to support the amendment of the Senator from Vermont, as \namended, and appreciate his offering it and appreciate his responsible \neffort. I do have, however, deep and severe reservations and strongly \noppose the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana. The issue here \nisn't transparency any longer with the amendment of the Senator from \nLouisiana. The issue is whether we have a Federal Reserve which can \nfunction and can pursue its primary purpose, which is maintaining the \nintegrity of the currency of the United States.\n  When the Federal Reserve was created back in 1917, there was a huge \ndebate--a huge debate--raging in this Nation, and had been raging since \nthe great depressions of 1897 and 1907--about how to manage the \ncurrency of this country. The central figure in that debate was William \nJennings Bryan, a man of immense proportions in our history. He was a \npopulist in the extreme, and he believed genuinely that there should be \na monetary policy in this country which allowed for free money to be \nproduced, essentially. His Cross of Gold Speech was, of course, \nhistoric. His view was, basically, those who were in control of the \ngovernment--public elected officials--should have control over the \ncurrency. But what had been learned over time was if you turn control \nof the currency over to elected officials, the currency becomes at risk \nbecause there is a natural tendency by elected bodies to want to \nproduce money arbitrarily to take care of spending which they deem to \nbe in the public interest.\n\n  Thanks to the leadership at that time of a number of thoughtful \npeople, including people such as Woodrow Wilson, the decision was made \nto create a separate entity called the Federal Reserve, which would \nmanage the currency of the United States and decide how much money was \nprinted. The printing presses would be taken away from elected \nofficials.\n  This decision has probably been one of the best decisions we ever \nmade as a nation in order to determine a strong fiscal future and a \nstrong economy because it has allowed us to have a currency which has \nbasically been protected from the winds of the politics of the day. \nThat is absolutely critical. It is as important today as it was when \nthe Federal Reserve was created, if not more important today.\n  We have seen a world where there is a tremendous amount of pressure \non the currencies of almost every nation, certainly every developed \nnation with the exception of a few. That pressure inevitably leads to \npopulist outrage on occasion or to popular decisions which can request \nthat the currency be devalued in order to produce what some people see \nas a better lifestyle or in order to address concerns a nation may \nhave. But you cannot do that at the whim of elected officials. It is \nabsolutely critical that the currency of the Nation be protected from \nthe day-to-day activities of politics.\n  We have created this Federal Reserve System which accomplishes that. \nThe essence of that system is the Open Market Committee, which decides \nessentially how much money there is going to be in circulation in this \ncountry. We have always believed that system should have integrity, be \nkept separate from the political process; that Members of the Congress \nshould not have the ability, either directly or indirectly, to \ninfluence the decision of the printing of dollars in this Nation. It is \na good decision and we should not abandon that course of action.\n  Yet the Vitter amendment, couched in all sorts of----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from New \nHampshire has used the 5 minutes he was yielded.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for 4 minutes out of the time of Senator Shelby.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. The amendment offered by Senator Vitter unfortunately has, \nas its essence, the disassembling of this independence. It would give \nthe Congress the ability, through the GAO--and because the GAO is an \narm of the Congress, our accounting arm--to go in and investigate what \nhappens with the Open Market Committee. That is clearly going to create \nconsequences which would be inappropriate in the decisionmaking process \nof the Federal Reserve. It would influence their ability to make \ndecisions in the sense they would be concerned about Congress coming in \nand investigating them. It would open activities which, if they are not \ndone in some level of confidence, inevitably end up disrupting the \nmarkets. So it is absolutely critical that the Congress not be allowed \nto go into the Open Market Committee and audit that part of the Federal \nReserve activities--absolutely critical if we are going to maintain the \nintegrity of the dollar.\n  Remember, this is about Main Street. Whether that dollar you take on \nMain\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\nStreet to buy clothing or food or a car--whether that dollar has the \nvalue you think it has depends entirely on whether there is confidence \nit is not going to be inflated arbitrarily. If the political process \nstarts to influence the decisions as to how much money is printed in \nthis country and therefore affects the inflationary value of the \ndollar, you will see your dollars devalued as you try to buy items on \nMain Street. The effect of that will be devastating on your ability as \nan American citizen to have confidence in the dollars which you earn \nand what they are going to buy and what they are going to mean when you \nsave them--which is even more important.\n  We cannot have a system which allows Congress to influence the \ndecisions in this critical area. All the rest of the activities the \nFederal Reserve undertakes should be open, should be audited by the \nCongress, and should be available for public inspection on a regular \nbasis. That is essentially what the amendment of Senator Sanders does. \nThere is already a lot of audit activity at the Fed, but what it does \nis expand that and make it more transparent and more available to the \nAmerican people. But in this one area which Congress has specifically \nby law exempted from review for the very logical and appropriate reason \nthat we do not want the politics of the day to influence the decision \nas to the value of our currency, in this one area we need to keep the \nexception and give the Fed that type of protection.\n  I strongly oppose the Vitter amendment. I hope those who are \nconcerned about maintaining the integrity of our currency will also \noppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield myself 10 minutes on my time, if I may, and reserve \n5, if the Chair will let me know when that time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my friend and colleague from New Hampshire. He is \nalways thoughtful on these issues. I appreciate the history lesson as \nwell. It is always important that Members understand the genesis and \nhistory of necessary decisions, so it is an important contribution this \nmorning to what we are trying to achieve. Also, let me say how much I \nappreciate the efforts of the Senator from Vermont. Occasionally around \nhere you get to make a historic contribution. I don't want to engage in \nhyperbole, but this is a historic moment the Senator from Vermont has \nprovided us, to be able to do something we have talked about. I want to \ntell my colleague from Vermont not only do I think we are going to \nachieve what he wants with his amendment, but we just had a meeting \nwith the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to kind of brief us on these \nevents in Europe over the weekend, and the Federal Reserve, without \nlegislation but clearly under the influence of this proposed \nlegislation, is going to put up on its Web site as soon as possible the \ncontracts between the Fed and other central banks that occurred over \nthe past weekend.\n  It has also committed the Fed will report weekly on the activity of \neach of the swaps accounts by the central banks--not in the aggregate, \neach one of them. The legislation is going to do a lot, but the Senator \nhas already had an influence on the conduct of the Fed in terms of the \ntransparency issues.\n  I appreciate very much the efforts of Senator Sanders. He is not new \nto the issue. He has raised this repeatedly since he became a Member of \nthis body. I also associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire regarding the Vitter amendment. Again, the central \nquestion in many ways is exactly as he has described it, and that is \nthe independence of the central bank, the most important central bank \nin the world, to be able to operate devoid of the kind of political \ninfluences that could ultimately change that Federal Reserve Board from \nmaking the kind of decisions that are going to protect the integrity of \nour currency.\n  The Open Market Committee's functioning absolutely is critical. So \nthis is a well-crafted proposal, in my view, because it goes to the \nheart of the issue of transparency, including the requirements now \nmandated by the Sanders amendment. The previous incarnation of this \namendment was a request. I think all of us know where requests end up \nif there is no will on the other side to engage them. But this now \nmandates, in fact--we could have potential conflict of interest \nexamined as to when these decisions are made.\n  I point out that our bill today includes language, if adopted, that \nwill change how the New York Fed president is chosen. Presently he is \nchosen by the very institutions that office is designed to regulate. In \na sense, we change all of that because that on its face seems to be an \ninherent conflict. When you get to choose your regulator--one of the \ncomplaints we have had, legitimately, about regulatory arbitrage is \nthat institutions picked their regulator of least resistance and that \ncontributed to some of the problems we have run into. Under the present \nconstruct, without the changes included in our bill, of course that \ngoes on. Imagine, if you can sit around and choose your own regulator \nif you are lending institutions, financial institutions. That presently \nis what happens with regional banks. So the very banks that are the \nsubject of the Federal regulation decide who the regulator will be. Our \nbill changes that as well, and that goes to the heart of exactly what \nthe Senator from Vermont is talking about.\n  I urge my colleagues to give strong support to the Sanders amendment. \nI am a cosponsor. I don't cosponsor many amendments for the obvious \nreason we have a lot of them and I realize some I am supportive of, \nmaybe not as strongly as others. I am a strong supporter of this \namendment, and I want my name attached to it, and I appreciate the \nefforts of my colleague in putting this forward.\n  I am as strongly in opposition to the Vitter amendment because it \nundermines, in effect, what the Sanders amendment accomplishes. That \nwould be a tragedy, in my view. The fact is we are going to do \nsomething that has been needed to be done for years, and that is to get \nthe transparency of what occurs at the Federal Reserve, but not \nengaging in the kind of damage that could occur--particularly at this \nmoment.\n  We all understand. I think we have made the case over and over again \nover many days. We are no longer talking about a financial system that \nis in jeopardy because of what happens in terms of mismanagement of \nmajor financial institutions. We now know that events thousands of \nmiles away from our shores, in nation states that have no direct \nbearing, necessarily, or are directly affected by decisions we make \nhere, can cause the kind of disruptions, economically, around the \nworld. It is that kind of world we live in.\n  I remember a few years ago a very small exchange, relatively small \nexchange in Shanghai, China, had a decline of about 12 percent one \nmorning. That exchange represented about 5 percent of the volume of the \nNew York Stock Exchange in Shanghai. Yet that action in that relatively \nsmall exchange caused, within a matter of hours, all over the globe \nexchanges to react to it. My point simply being, without going into the \ndetails of what occurred there, events that occur in one part of the \nworld can have a huge implication here as well.\n  At this very important moment, to undermine the independence of the \nFederal Reserve with the Vitter amendment would do great damage to our \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to be supportive of the Sanders amendment \nand then join with Senator Gregg and myself and others in our \nopposition to the Vitter amendment because it undercuts exactly what, \nin a sense, we are trying to achieve here with this legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask to speak----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask to speak under Senator Vitter's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, there are few things more important to \nAmericans than our money. It represents our life's work, our savings, \nour investment. When our Founders put this country and the Constitution \ntogether, they gave the Congress the responsibility to protect our \ncurrency\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\nand the value of our money. This is a responsibility that decades ago \nthe Congress delegated to the Federal Reserve, to operate as an \nindependent institution, responsible for protecting our monetary system \nas well as overseeing employment in our country.\n  Congress has not paid much attention to what the Federal Reserve has \ndone. In fact, we have little idea now what they are doing. We do know \nthey are doing many things now that they didn't do even a few years \nbefore--trillions of dollars buying toxic assets from various financial \ninstitutions. We know they are doing business all over the world, \nlending money with international banks. But we don't know exactly what \nthey are doing, why they are doing it, or how they are doing it.\n  We don't know if a lot of these activities could eventually bring \ndown our financial system. We need to be concerned because it is our \nresponsibility as a Congress and if we allow our currency to be \nundermined anywhere in the world, it is detrimental to every American \nfamily, everything we worked for, everything we have saved.\n  We cannot pass this off. This Congress has established other \nfinancial institutions such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to supposedly \nfacilitate the mortgage industry and make it easier for people to buy \nhomes. We were told there was no problem with subprime lending and all \nthe things Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were involved with. But as a \nCongress we did not do our job overseeing, asking enough questions. \nThen when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac created this huge housing bubble \nand brought our economy to its knees, millions of Americans lost much \nof what they had worked for and saved.\n  But what happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is small compared \nto what could happen if the Federal Reserve did something to undermine \nthe confidence in the dollar worldwide.\n  Congress should not be managing our monetary system. I do not think \nwe can do it in the current political structure. But it is our job to \nprovide accountability and transparency to what is going on at the \nFederal Reserve.\n  Last week, I spoke in support of the Sanders amendment. I still plan \nto support it today, but that amendment has been changed. It narrows \nthe scope of a complete audit. It really cannot be called a complete \naudit anymore. It is just disclosure on various aspects of what the \nFederal Reserve does. It does not now include what they would refer to \nnow as monetary policy. My understanding was, that is pretty much what \nthey did at the Federal Reserve. Cutting that takes out a big part of \nwhat we need to know about what they are doing. It would block us from \nfinding out what the Federal Reserve is doing with banks all around the \nworld. It would block us from finding out a lot of things that could \ngive us an indication of whether the Federal Reserve is putting our \nmonetary and financial systems at risk.\n  I think it is important, at least at one point in time, for us to \nfind out what the Federal Reserve is doing and disclose it to the \nAmerican people in a way that they will have confidence that what is \nhappening with the Federal Reserve and with our currency is going to \ncreate a stable currency out into the future.\n  Senator Vitter offered the original amendment before it was changed, \nthe same amendment that was passed in the House by an overwhelming \nmajority which will include all aspects of the Federal Reserve--not in \nreal time, but there will be a delay so that we can't meddle in what \nthey are doing. But it opens a full audit of the Federal Reserve so \nthat this Congress can make good decisions about any needed reforms and \ncertainly keeping some accountability over the Federal Reserve.\n  It makes absolutely no sense to create really the most powerful \nagency in the world over the Reserve currency for the world and for \nthere to be no accountability over what they are doing. We know they \nthink we are not smart enough to understand what they are doing, and we \nmay not be. But based on what they have told us in the past, they are \nnot necessarily as smart as they think they are either, because only a \nfew months before Fannie Mae collapsed, the Federal Reserve told us \nthere was no problem. Now they are telling us there is no problem and \nthat we don't need to look at what they are doing.\n  I think it is important that we have full disclosure and \naccountability and transparency at the Federal Reserve. It is important \nthat the American people trust those who are managing their currency, \nand right now they don't. A full audit would help restore that trust \nand help Congress do its job to oversee the Federal Reserve. The \nFederal Reserve can maintain its independence, but it doesn't have to \nbe independent in secret because if they are operating secretly, \nCongress is not doing its job.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Sanders amendment but also \nthe Vitter amendment so that we will have a full audit and know for the \nfirst time what our Federal Reserve is doing with our money.\n  I reserve the remainder of Senator Vitter's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I rise today to support the Sanders amendment to bring \ntransparency to the Federal Reserve. I believe this amendment is needed \nbecause the Federal Reserve has abused its independence. The Federal \nReserve has repeatedly assumed and exercised vast fiscal powers under \nthe guise of ``monetary policy.'' It has sought to escape \naccountability for these actions by claiming that its independence \nplaces it beyond the scope of congressional oversight. To allow any \nagency, including the Federal Reserve, to exercise the immense powers \nnow wielded by the Fed with so little accountability is simply \nincompatible with our constitutional system of government.\n  Congress granted the Federal Reserve independence with respect to \nmonetary policy on grounds that ``monetary policy'' was a technical, \nnonpolitical task that did not put taxpayers at risk. Unfortunately, \nthe Fed has failed to stay within the limits envisioned by Congress. \nOver the past 3 years, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet has exploded \nto more than $2.3 trillion, with much of the increase related to \nactions that had little to do with monetary policy and more to do with \nbailouts, fiscal policy, and plain politics.\n  Although the Fed likes to pretend it is independent and removed from \npolitics, the reality here is that the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve is one of the biggest political players in town.\n  Ironically, while the Fed is fighting this amendment, the Fed remains \nsilent about other measures that would compromise its independence. \nWhy? The answer is politics. When it serves its politics, the Fed is \nhappy to selectively sacrifice its independence. For example, the Dodd \nbill compromises the Fed's independence by having the Fed directly fund \nthe Democrats' new consumer bureaucracy. This establishes a dangerous \nprecedent. Anytime Congress needs a funding source, it can now go \noutside the budget process and have the Fed print money. Yet the Fed \nhas remained remarkably quiet. Why? Again, politics. The Fed's silence \nshould come as no surprise given the close political ties between the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the Obama administration. \nThe Board of Governors has clearly decided to help the Obama \nadministration advance its legislative goals.\n  The Fed cannot have its cake and eat it too. If the Fed wants to be \nindependent, it should defend its independence consistently but \notherwise should stay out of politics. On the other hand, if the \nFederal Reserve wants to be political, it should not expect Congress to \ntreat it as a so-called independent, nor should the Fed expect that its \nnonmonetary policy actions are exempt from congressional oversight. \nThese activities, even when conducted by FOMC, are fiscal or regulatory \nactions that involve taxpayer dollars and policy judgments. They are no \ndifferent from other policy decisions made by the executive branch.\n  Accordingly, I believe Congress has a constitutional duty to oversee \nthese activities. Unfortunately, the Fed often acts as if Congress \nshould be kept in the dark. It uses this independence as a shield to \nhide its actions from congressional oversight, including its bailouts \nof AIG and Bear Sterns. No agency should have the fiscal and regulatory \npowers exercised by the Fed and not think it has to be fully \naccountable to Congress. It should.\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\n  It is my hope this amendment will be the first step in moving the Fed \nback to its more limited and traditional role in our regulatory and \nconstitutional systems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to inquire how much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut controls 13 \nminutes; the Senator from Alabama, 4 minutes; the Senator from \nLouisiana, 3 minutes; the Senator from Vermont, 8 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Well, I am kind of done. I don't know if my colleague from \nVermont wants to add any words to all of this. I don't even know \nwhether the leaders want to be heard on this amendment or whether other \nMembers want to be heard. So I guess what I will do is propose that \nthere is an absence of a quorum and that the time be equally extracted \nfrom all Members who control time.\n  Is there a fixed time for the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur at the expiration or the \nyielding back of the time.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent \nthat the time be equally charged to all three of the Members who \ncontrol the time at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nMcCain amendment is disposed of, the next amendment in order be the \nCorker amendment--the next Republican amendment--dealing with \nunderwriting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, just so we are clear, when \nwe dispose of the McCain amendment and related amendments to it, there \nmay be a side-by-side, the next Republican amendment--there will be a \nDemocratic amendment after the McCain amendment. Then the next \namendment after that--Republican amendment--will be the Corker \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. I have an inquiry.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, as far as other amendments, I have an \ninquiry. As far as other amendments, I have a number of what I would \ncall surgical amendments, some of which may be--I just have an inquiry \nas to other types of amendments. I know we are going in order, \nRepublican and Democrat. I just thought we might talk for a second. I \nhave a number of surgical amendments that improve the bill. None of \nthem are messaging amendments. I actually think some of them are going \nto be taken in a managers' amendment.\n  But I would just inquire of the manager of the bill what his thinking \nis as it relates to sort of time limits and how we might move through \nsome of these other amendments that are here strictly to try to improve \nthe bill and may have strong bipartisan support.\n  The PRESIDING Officer. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have yet to meet a Member who didn't think \nan amendment they offered was going to improve the bill. We can't make \nthat the criteria.\n  First, I appreciate the Senator raising the issue because it is an \nimportant question. I have raised with my colleague and the former \nchairman, Senator Shelby, a package of amendments, technical or others, \nwhere we think there is agreement, although he will have to take a look \nat them to make that determination, not as a final managers' amendment \nbut to try and clear out those amendments we think can be adopted \nwithout taking up time for votes on individual amendments. I invite any \nMember who has amendments, including my colleague from Tennessee, to \ngive us the amendments he or she has or to show them to Senator Shelby, \nand we will try to accept them where we can.\n  If there is some problem we can't resolve, then we need to provide \nthe time between now and the conclusion of the bill to consider them. I \nwill do my best to see that happens.\n  Let me take advantage of the question to make a plea to my \ncolleagues. Obviously, there is not an unlimited amount of time to \ndebate this bill. We have other matters we are all painfully aware of \nthat have to come up before we adjourn for the year. My hope is Members \nwill provide the time and come forward and we will get short time \nagreements for some amendments, maybe a bit longer for others that are \na bit more substantive and require more debate. But we need to move on \nthis. We have submitted, several days ago, a package of what I thought \nwould qualify as a managers' amendment. We need to get some answers on \nthat so we can try to accommodate provisions to this bill that are good \ncontributions offered by Republicans and Democrats--in some cases \nboth--so we can actually add to the product of this legislation. I \nappreciate my colleague's suggestion. If we can see them, we will try \nto agree to all of them. If there is any problem, we will let him know \nand then thin out that list so we can get to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me summarize again what the Sanders \namendment does. Let me take my colleagues back to a meeting of the \nBudget Committee, on which I serve, about a year ago. Chairman Bernanke \ncame before that committee. I asked him: Will you tell the committee, \nme, and the American people which large financial institutions received \ntrillions of dollars of zero or near zero interest loans? I thought \nthat was a reasonable question.\n  Mr. Bernanke said: No, I will not do that. I will not release that \ninformation.\n  On that day, I introduced legislation to compel him to release the \ninformation. This amendment, if passed, on December 1, 2010, would, in \nfact, contain that information. It is a major step forward.\n  Secondly, many Americans are beginning to catch on--and some Senators \nhave referred to that today--to the immense power of the Fed. People \nare demanding transparency at the Fed. People want to know what happens \nbehind closed doors when some of the leaders of the largest financial \ninstitutions sit down with the Fed and, lo and behold, programs are \ndeveloped which benefit those very same large financial institutions. \nWouldn't it be nice, wouldn't it be great if small businesses in \nVermont could end up with zero interest loans? They can't. But somehow \nor another, some of the largest financial institutions in this country \nmanage to do that, and we don't know how this process goes on.\n  Passage of the Sanders amendment is a step forward. I congratulate \nall those people from both political parties, with very different \npolitical ideologies, for coming forward, for pushing this issue \nforward. This is not the end. This is a beginning. As Senator Dodd said \na moment ago, this is historic. We are beginning to lift the veil of \nsecrecy on what is perhaps the most important agency in the government.\n  I urge passage of the Sanders amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand to join with a bipartisan group of \ncolleagues supporting the Sanders amendment and also in support of the \nVitter side-by-side amendment. These are not mutually exclusive \nalternatives. Both Senator Sanders and myself and many others will \nstrongly support both. I urge all my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to do the same.\n  Particularly since the financial crisis, the American people have \nbeen demanding several things. One of them clearly has been openness \nand transparency about U.S. economic policy, including at the Federal \nReserve. That has been a major theme, particularly since the financial \ncrisis. That has\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\nbeen a clear demand of the American people, certainly of Louisianans, \nparticularly since the financial crisis.\n  Most of us have voted and spoken in strong support of that. If we \ntruly want to make it happen and if we truly want to preserve that \nrecord, we need to vote for the Sanders amendment and the Vitter \namendment today to get that done.\n  If we want to continue to support the same push as in the stand-alone \nSanders Senate bill, we need to vote for both amendments. If Members \nwant to continue to support their position, if they voted for the \nSanders budget amendment a few months ago--and a strong majority of \nthis body did--they need to vote for both amendments. If they want to \nsupport the position of the House which, in a bipartisan way, supported \nexactly the same language as contained in my amendment through an \namendment in the Banking Committee, a strong bipartisan vote, they need \nto support both amendments. Supporting one, walking on the other, is \nnot good enough and will surely be recognized as not good enough.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support both amendments, to have full \nopenness and accountability and transparency, with all the protections \nincluded against politicizing individual Fed decisions.\n  In many ways, I think it comes down to this one quote by Alan \nGreenspan from 2004:\n\n       We run the risk, by laying out the pros and cons of a \n     particular argument, of inducing people to join in on the \n     debate, and in this regard, it is possible to lose control of \n     a process that only we fully understand.\n\n  Imagine, Congress, the American people joining in on the debate. God \nforbid. Imagine the moneyed elites losing complete control of the \nprocess. God forbid. If Members share that Alan Greenspan view of \ndemocracy, vote against my amendment. But if they share a very \ndifferent view, which I believe is embodied in this institution and our \nConstitution, please support both the Sanders and Vitter amendments.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe there is no more time. Has the \ntime expired for the Senator from Louisiana?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has consumed his \ntime. The Senator from Alabama has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. We are prepared to yield back time on our side. I gather \nthe Senator from Alabama is prepared to yield back his time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the Sanders amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back all our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3738, as modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nBingaman) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nMexico (Mr. Bingaman) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I support Senator Sanders' amendment No. \n3738 regarding Federal Reserve transparency. As a cosponsor of S. 604, \nthe Federal Reserve Sunshine Act of 2009, my support for these efforts \nis clear. American taxpayers have a right to know how, where, and when \ntheir money is spent or put at risk. For too long, they have put up \nwith secrecy and arrogance. That has to stop, and that is why I would \nhave voted for Senator Sanders' amendment had I been able to do so and \nwhy I voted for Senator Vitter's amendment when I arrived in \nWashington. My travel was detained due to severe weather and tornadoes \naffecting Oklahoma yesterday.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before we recess, let me say that the next \namendment up is the McCain amendment, and while we don't have an \nagreement yet, I am hopeful one will be agreed to right after we come \nback after the respective caucus luncheons at 2:15 p.m.\n  I am urging Members, again, we are trying to line up these amendments \nso\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\nwe can have an afternoon full of votes--a short debate on amendments \nand then votes. I don't want to hear later people telling me, ``I \ndidn't have enough time,'' when in fact we are trying to provide time \nfor people. You can't have it both ways. You can't say you needed more \ntime and then not be here or get the time agreements to allow us to \nmove forward.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/11/senate-section/article/S3496-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3839 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3839 and ask for \nits immediate consideration and ask to set aside pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Shelby, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Corker, Mr. \n     Burr, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Roberts, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3839 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 5, 2010, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before we continue, I know the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee and the manager of the \nbill want us to move forward. I understand that. As we speak, I am \ncompiling a list of those who want to speak on the amendment on this \nside. I assure him we will try to get a time agreement completed as \nsoon as possible. I ask my colleagues on this side of the aisle who \nwant to speak on this amendment to call the cloakroom so we can get \nthat done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Burr, Hutchison, \nand Roberts be added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues for giving \nthem false information a couple of days ago. It is not $125.9 billion \nthat we are now pouring into Fannie and Freddie; it is up to $145 \nbillion that is now being poured in--$145 billion. I remind my \ncolleagues again that last Christmas Eve at 7 p.m. was when the \nTreasury Department decided to lift the cap, which had been at $400 \nbillion. It is now up--$145 billion. Here we are addressing financial \nregulatory reform and not looking at $5 trillion of toxic assets that \nhave already spent $145 billion off budget. It is off budget. \nIncredible.\n  My distinguished friend from Connecticut pointed out yesterday--he \nsays I want a little revisionist history. He says the House financial \ncommittee passed bipartisan legislation. It stalled in the committee \nover here despite the support for it. The Republican-controlled \ncommittee then passed a bill and never filed it, never brought it up \nfor a vote here on the floor of the Senate in 2005. That was my friend \nSenator Dodd's statement yesterday.\n  The fact is--a little revisionist history--on April 1, 2004, the \nSenate Banking Committee passed the bill, the Federal Housing \nEnterprise Regulatory Reform Act. All 12 Republicans voted for it. All \nDemocrats, including the distinguished chairman, voted against it, \naccording to the Record. So neither bill was taken on the floor \nbecause, as we know, we don't move forward with legislation if it is \nblocked by the other side.\n  Then Senator Dodd went on to say: I became chairman of the Banking \nCommittee in 2007. We arrived at 2008. We had a significant number of \nhearings. In the summer of 2008, the Banking Committee passed a \ncomprehensive bill--et cetera, et cetera. The Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act was finally enacted on July 30, 2008. Just 39 days later, \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship.\n  I remind Senator Dodd that back in 2006, there was a group of us, in \nresponse to an inspector general's report, who said we need to fix it \nand fix it now, and that was blocked by the other side.\n  Senator Dodd said: If you think the market took a plunge last \nThursday, adopt the McCain amendment. It is a reckless amendment.\n  What is reckless is the status quo. What is reckless is to totally \nignore $5 trillion in toxic assets, already $145 billion of the \ntaxpayers' money being spent. It is reckless for us to go to the \nAmerican people and say we are fixing the problem that caused the \nfinancial meltdown and yet we are ignoring Fannie and Freddie. We are \nignoring the trillions of dollars of toxic assets. And don't worry, we \nwill address it later on. That is what the distinguished chairman is \ngoing to say--we will address this later on. Later on? Later on? When \nwe have this already done? And it is not on budget. Remarkable.\n  What the amendment says is that the conservatorship has to end in 24 \nmonths. We will give them 2 years to figure all this out. It is \nreckless, in my view, to say we are not addressing these trillions of \ndollars in toxic assets, the hemorrhaging of $145 billion already of \ntaxpayers' dollars, on which there is no expert who believes we will \never see a return.\n  Finally, I would like to quote the Wall Street Journal editorial of \nthis morning that says, ``$145 Billion and Counting. Fannie and Freddie \nlose it all for you.''\n  The editorial says:\n\n       These efforts to support the Obama anti-foreclosure program \n     resulted in a doubling of loan modifications compared to the \n     previous--\n\n  Let me start from the beginning.\n\n       Fannie Mae yesterday announced its 11th consecutive \n     quarterly loss--$11.5 billion--and asked for another $8.4 \n     billion in taxpayer assistance.\n\n  They lost that. They are asking for $8.4 billion. That puts us well \nover $150 billion.\n\n       Fannie Mae is the Cal Ripken of bad real-estate deals, \n     reliably pouring taxpayer money into the housing market. \n     Granted, Fannie faces tough competition from its toxic twin, \n     Freddie Mac, which last week announced its own request of \n     another $10.6 billion from taxpayers.\n       Once the checks from the Treasury clear, Fan and Fred will \n     have consumed a combined $145 billion in taxpayer cash, and \n     the end is nowhere in sight. Both companies warned of further \n     losses triggering more government assistance, which is now \n     unlimited after a 2009 Treasury decision.\n       The losses are unlimited because the companies are now run \n     by the government not to make money, by deliberately \n     subsidizing housing. In yesterday's press release, CEO Mike \n     Williams didn't even pretend that he's running a profit-\n     making business. ``In the first quarter, we continued to \n     serve as a leading source of liquidity to the mortgage \n     market, and we made solid progress in our ongoing effort to \n     keep people in their homes,'' he said. These efforts to \n     support the Obama anti-foreclosure program resulted in a \n     doubling of loan modifications compared to the previous \n     quarter.\n       Ramping up modifications makes perfect sense in the upside-\n     down world of Fannie Mae. The company also announced that \n     most of the loans it modified in the first three quarters of \n     2009 had gone delinquent again within six months.\n\n  Does anyone get that? Most of the loans that were modified--at the \ncost of $100-and-some billion of taxpayers money--have gone under \nagain, have gone delinquent again within 6 months.\n  The Wall Street Journal goes on:\n\n       Talk about an exciting business opportunity. In case anyone \n     still hasn't gotten the joke, the company also clarified \n     yesterday that its directors ``are not obligated to consider \n     the interests of the company'' unless the government tells \n     them to do so.\n       The real joke is that the Obama Administration and Senator \n     Chris Dodd have collaborated on a financial regulatory reform \n     bill that includes no reform of Fan or Fred. Senators should \n     rectify this embarrassment as early as today by voting for \n     John McCain's amendment to end this most costly of all \n     bailouts.\n\n  My question to the distinguished chairman is, even if he doesn't \naccept any of the statements I made, is it true that there are \ntrillions of dollars in toxic assets and, if so, what are we going to \ndo about it and when? If not on this bill, where?\n  The cynicism out there amongst the American people is at the highest \nlevel\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\nI have ever seen it in the many years I have been privileged to serve. \nTo go to the American people and say we are going to take measures \nwhich will prevent another worldwide fiscal meltdown and we are not \ngoing to address trillions of dollars in toxic assets we have already \npoured $145 billion into--they lifted the cap on Christmas Eve at 7 \np.m, so they think it is going to be in excess of $400 billion over \ntime, and nothing in this piece of legislation, nothing in it has \nanything to do with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Don't be surprised at \nthe cynicism of the American people.\n  I want to tell the manager, because he was not here, that I am trying \nto get a list of speakers, get time agreements and give him a time \nagreement at least on this side as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3938 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. DODD. I see my colleagues here. Let me say to my friend from \nArizona, what I am going to do is call up an amendment that will be a \nside-by-side arrangement. I will not ask for any time on this, and I \nappreciate him getting back so we can get a time certain.\n  I call up amendment No. 3938.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3938 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a study \n   on ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and \n                 reforming the housing finance system)\n\n       On page 1455, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1077. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY STUDY ON ENDING THE \n                   CONSERVATORSHIP OF FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC, AND \n                   REFORMING THE HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Study Required.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     conduct a study of and develop recommendations regarding the \n     options for ending the conservatorship of the Federal \n     National Mortgage Association (in this section referred to as \n     ``Fannie Mae'') and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage \n     Corporation (in this section referred to as ``Freddie Mac''), \n     while minimizing the cost to taxpayers, including such \n     options as--\n       (A) the gradual wind-down and liquidation of such entities;\n       (B) the privatization of such entities;\n       (C) the incorporation of the functions of such entities \n     into a Federal agency;\n       (D) the dissolution of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into \n     smaller companies; or\n       (E) any other measures the Secretary determines \n     appropriate.\n       (2) Analyses.--The study required under paragraph (1) shall \n     include an analysis of--\n       (A) the role of the Federal Government in supporting a \n     stable, well-functioning housing finance system, and whether \n     and to what extent the Federal Government should bear risks \n     in meeting Federal housing finance objectives;\n       (B) how the current structure of the housing finance system \n     can be improved;\n       (C) how the housing finance system should support the \n     continued availability of mortgage credit to all segments of \n     the market;\n       (D) how the housing finance system should be structured to \n     ensure that consumers continue to have access to 30-year, \n     fixed rate, pre-payable mortgages and other mortgage products \n     that have simple terms that can be easily understood;\n       (E) the role of the Federal Housing Administration and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs in a future housing system;\n       (F) the impact of reforms of the housing finance system on \n     the financing of rental housing;\n       (G) the impact of reforms of the housing finance system on \n     secondary market liquidity;\n       (H) the role of standardization in the housing finance \n     system;\n       (I) how housing finance systems in other countries offer \n     insights that can help inform options for reform in the \n     United States; and\n       (J) the options for transition to a reformed housing \n     finance system.\n       (b) Report and Recommendations.--Not later than January 31, \n     2011, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit the report \n     and recommendations required under subsection (a) to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House \n     of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I realize people want to be heard, but I again urge my \ncolleagues, if we can--every amendment has great value. There are about \n60 amendments. At some point we have to draw the line, so I urge people \nto use as little time as necessary--all the time they think they need, \nbut if we can get to a point where we can vote up or down on these two \namendments, I would appreciate it very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the chairman for \nallowing us to debate this amendment this afternoon. I think this is \none of the most critical amendments that certainly we have talked about \nto date, and moving forward, unless we address the issue of the GSEs, \nas I am going to talk about in a minute, I am not sure we have \naccomplished anything in this bill.\n  For all of the potential unintended consequences in this financial \nregulatory restructuring package, at least one will be entirely \nintentional--failing to address Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\n  Despite the general theme of the increased ``overreaching'' \nregulatory power of this legislation, a glaring example of something \nthat was actually left out is a substantive attempt to address one of \nthe most significant causes of the financial crisis--reform of the \ngovernment sponsored eniterprises, or GSEs, such as Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae.\n  It has been highlighted from this floor that recent market volatility \nand a faulty trading construct in our financial markets are \nillustrations that the bill before us is needed now more than ever. \nSpecifically, the sudden significant drop throughout certain exchanges \nlast week has been pointed to as evidence of the necessity for greater \nregulation of our markets.\n  However, when news broke last week that Freddie lost $8 billion in \nthe first quarter and would yet again be knocking on the taxpayer's \ndoor for a $10.6 billion bailout--another bailout after both Fannie and \nFreddie had already received $126 billion in taxpayer dollars--I failed \nto hear calls for reform from the other side.\n  And just today it was announced that Fannie Mae will ask for another \n$8.4 billion after posting a loss of $11.5 billion for its first \nquarter. Shouldn't these entities' repeated failures serve as ample \nevidence that the future of these ``bailout behemoths'' must be \naddressed?\n  Apparently, this administration feels differently, and has for some \ntime. In fact, while it was busy cutting backroom deals over the health \ncare bill and making noise that a government takeover of health care \nwould reduce the deficit, in the quiet of night on Christmas Eve \nanother deal was made--only this one didn't make it out of the \nbackroom.\n  At the eleventh hour, after the Senate had finished its vote that \nholiday eve, the administration pledged to the mortgage its current \ngiants unlimited financial, assistance--by lifting $400 billion cap on \nemergency aid without even seeking congressional approval.\n  How can we have a serious conversation about overhauling our \nfinancial regulatory structure, yet ignore two entities that have \nexposed the taxpayers to more than $5 trillion in risk as of today. As \nthe Wall Street Journal put it recently, ``Reforming the financial \nsystem without fixing Fannie and Freddie is like declaring a war on \nterror and ignoring al Qaeda.''\n  Many have suggested that now is not the time to restructure these \ngiants; that they will have to be addressed later, indicating that due \nto the comprehensive nature of their needed reforms, any attempt to \naddress the problems of Freddie and Fannie here would more than double \nthe size of the current financial regulatory reform bill.\n  Where were these legislative ``size standards'' when this body was \ndebating health care? That bill was more than 2,000 pages long. \nApparently, while we can address too big to fail, these government \nsinkholes have become too big to legislate.\n  The fact is that the number of pages in a bill is not the reason \nFreddie and Fannie are ignored here. And it is not for a lack of \nunderstanding the problem. There has been no shortage of hearings on \nGSEs, in both the House and Senate. The housing policies of this and \nprevious administrations have chained the taxpayers to a self-\nperpetuating financial illness. Policies such\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\nas the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, which forces banks to make \nloans to otherwise unqualified borrowers set the stage for Fannie and \nFreddie to buy up these bad loans on the secondary mortgage market.\n  Such backward policies exacerbated the causes of the financial \ncrises. Why would a bank not make these loans knowing they could turn \naround and sell them to the government? Especially when regulators were \nencouraging such practices? As a result, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and \nthe Federal Housing Administration, or more specifically, the taxpayer, \nnow own or guarantee about half of all outstanding residential \nmortgages.\n  It is time we address this enormous problem, the McCain amendment \ndoes that and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, in deference to the chairman, I will be \nbrief. But I come because I feel compelled today because of the two \namendments this body will be dealing with: one is the McCain amendment \nand another amendment later in the day dealing with underwriting. So I \nwill save the remarks on that for when those amendments are pending.\n  I agree with Senator Chambliss, and I commend Senator McCain. I come \nfrom a lifetime in the real estate business. So what I talk about, I do \nunderstand its cause and effect in the marketplace. We cannot have \nresponsible reform of financial services and leave out Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae.\n  One of the reasons that, along with Senator Conrad, I created the \nFinancial Markets Crisis Commission--which is now meeting, by the way, \nand will report back at the end of December--is I knew there were \npervasive and redundant failures in the system that brought about what \nbecame a cataclysmic collapse.\n  I understand the chairman has been under great pressure to bring this \nlegislation forward, and I have great respect for the chairman and \nappreciate his work. I wish we had waited until the Financial Markets \nCrisis Commission reported, but we have not. So let me just for a \nsecond address Freddie and Fannie and the McCain amendment.\n  Freddie and Fannie filled the void the savings and loans created when \nthey failed in the late 1980s. There are a lot of people who will hear \nthis speech who will remember savings and loan days. Those were when \nsavings and loans associations were chartered to make home loans. With \nthe exception of FHA and VA, they basically made them all. There were a \nfew players but not too many.\n  Those entities, by the way, those savings and loans, had 100 percent \nrisk retention of every loan they made because their depositors put in \nmoney for the sole purpose of getting a preferred rate of interest and \nfor mortgage loans to be made to generate the income. But they went \nunder. They went under because of a lot of factors. One was the Federal \nGovernment changing in midstream the rules under which they operated \nwhich caused them to collapse.\n  Freddie and Fannie immediately filled that void. They did a great job \nfor a long period of time by creating a secondary market for capital to \nbe formed, put into mortgages, the mortgage be securitized, and the \nsecurities traded. It worked for a long time.\n  It worked, quite frankly, until a couple of things happened. One, \nuntil the government all of a sudden told Fannie it started having to \nown a certain percentage of what it called ``affordable loans,'' which \nlater became known as subprime loans. In fact, Fannie Mae became the \npurchaser of record for the first subprime securities that were created \nto meet the congressional mandate to end up having these affordable \nloans, which made a market for those securities which subsequently were \nsold around the world.\n  So I wanted to commend the Senator from Arizona. What he brings \nbefore us is important. I do not know how we can leave Freddie and \nFannie out and talk about real financial services reform in the United \nStates of America. If anything, they need to be a critical part of it.\n  I recognize this legislation portends there will be a 2-year wind-\ndown unless they improve. Then there will be a liquidation at some \npoint in time. But let me tell you what is going to happen if nothing \nhappens. At some point in time, Freddie and Fannie will have to be \nliquidated and a new entity will have to be created that will fill the \nvoid when that liquidation takes place. We are going to have the \nmortgage money in this country one way or another because America would \nnot be America without it.\n  But we cannot tend to have a black hole and an entity that can be \nused for political purposes, or was used for political purposes, to \ncreate a market for securities that ultimately fails and breaks down \nthe financial market.\n  I commend the Senator from Arizona. I associate myself with the \nremarks of the other Senator from Georgia. I thank the distinguished \nBanking Committee chairman for his time.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to rise also and first I want to \nassociate myself with the words from the Senator from Georgia. He is \nabsolutely correct in his history of how Freddie and Fannie got started \nand what their purpose was and the fact that they are a great idea that \nwent wrong, unfortunately--or went ``awry'' would be a better term, not \nwrong. The concept remains a good idea.\n  I rise to support Senator McCain's proposal because what he is \nsuggesting is a way out of a very deep and dark hole of debt for our \nNation and our American taxpayers, which is being generated by the \nlegacy and the present activities of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\n  Part of this amendment in which I played a role primarily is the \nissue of bringing on-budget and, therefore, into the light of day just \nhow much the American taxpayers owe as a result of the situation that \nhas occurred in those two businesses. It is estimated that the American \ntaxpayer will end up picking up somewhere around $400 to $500 billion \nin costs as a result of the activities of Freddie and Fannie.\n  As far as the American taxpayer knows, this will be something that \ncomes out of the sky. I mean, nobody is aware of it. Nobody is thinking \nabout it. Nobody is talking about it. But these are actual debts that \nare going to get put on our books and which will affect our credit \nworthiness as a nation and which all Americans will have to pay back.\n  Why is this going to happen? It is going to happen because during the \nhalcyon days of taking on debt, or taking on obligations in the area of \nmortgages which were not properly underwritten--and there will be a \nlater amendment by Senator Corker which I will support in the area of \nunderwriting--but which were not properly underwritten and which were \nsecuritized and basically insured, for all intents and purposes, by \nFreddie and Fannie, we ended up with a situation where they own a lot \nof paper which does not have the value it is supposed to have and which \nis not being paid back at the rate at which it was supposed to be paid \nback.\n  Unfortunately, there was a tacit understanding that grew up in the \nmarkets that the American taxpayer was going to stand behind that \npaper. It was never explicit, but it became tacit, and people expected \nthat. Then when the actual event occurred, as these defaults started to \naccelerate, it became real and the American taxpayer is now having to \nstand behind all of this debt.\n  It is certainly going to come as a shock to most Americans that they \nowe approximately $\\1/2\\ trillion--$\\1/2\\ trillion--because of very bad \ndecisions that were made by a group of people who were underwriting and \nbasically securitizing these loans.\n  Why did that happen? Well, there will be a lot of recrimination on \nthis subject. But the basic reason was that the Congress decided that \nAmericans should own houses whether they could afford the houses or \nwhether the houses sustained the value of their loans, Americans should \nbe able to go out and buy houses. So a lot of houses were sold which \ndid not have the underlying value necessary to support the loans which \nwere made on them, and which the person who bought the house and took \nout the mortgage did not have the income over the extended period of \ntime of that loan to pay it back. Everybody knew it at the time the\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\nhouse was bought. Everybody knew it at the time the mortgage was made. \nBut they figured: Well, appreciation will always occur in real estate \nprices. So that will not bother us with the value of the house. Well, \nmaybe this person who got the loan for the house, maybe their income \nwill increase, or when the reset day occurs on that mortgage they will \nbe able to take care of it in some way.\n\n  So nobody faced up to the problem at the time, and literally \nmillions, millions of homes were purchased under that basic scenario. \nThat is what caused the implosion, basically, of our financial markets \nback in late 2008, and Freddie and Fannie are a large part of that \nimplosion. But a lot of the initiative for that came from the Congress, \nbasically asserting that people should be able to get those types of \nloans, and pushing Freddie and Fannie from using what had been very \nstandard and traditional underwriting standards in the 1990s into much \nmore aggressive standards as they moved into the early 2000 period.\n  As a result, we had this proliferation of loans which simply did not \nhave the underlying value and did not have the capacity to be repaid. \nThey were all securitized by Freddie and Fannie. So now the American \ntaxpayer ends up with this huge bill.\n  I think we have an obligation as a Congress to at least be honest \nwith the American taxpayer on this and tell them this is how big the \nbill is. And it is huge. It is huge.\n  So this bill is now hidden in the drawer under the Federal accounting \nsystem where we do not even acknowledge that it exists under the \nFederal budget, even though we know we owe it, even though we know it \nis going to be put on the books of the Federal Government, even though \nwe know the American taxpayer is going to have to end up picking this \nup in the long run. We do not even acknowledge it. It is stuck in some \ndrawer somewhere in Washington.\n  Well, that should not happen any longer. We just had an amendment \nabout transparency with the Federal Reserve. Everybody voted for it. \nEverybody voted for the transparency amendment on the Federal Reserve. \nThis is the transparency amendment on Freddie and Fannie. This \namendment will tell the American taxpayer just how much they really do \nowe. It will bring on-budget the issue of the debts of these two \ncorporations, which are now the obligations of the Federal Government \nand therefore the American taxpayer. Absolutely last to be done.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for including in his amendment this \nlanguage which brings this on-budget the way it should be. It opens the \nlight of day so that the American taxpayer can understand just how much \nrisk has been piled on their backs, how much debt has been piled on \ntheir backs as a result of the irresponsible activity, which in large \npart was initiated by this Congress over the years, forcing out loans \nand pushing a public policy that these loans should be made.\n  Secondly, I congratulate the Senator from Arizona for bringing \nforward an idea, a proposal for how we unwind this situation and how we \nget out of this situation by putting us on a path, a path toward \nbasically decoupling Freddie and Fannie from the American taxpayer, \nhaving those two organizations no longer be dependent on the American \ntaxpayer and having the American taxpayer no longer having to pick up \nthe debts of mistakes made by those two corporations, even when those \nmistakes were caused, to some significant degree, by the Congress \ntaking actions which were inappropriate--or which were bad policy, not \nnecessarily inappropriate, but definitely bad policy.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Arizona. I think this is a good \namendment. As has been said, how can we take up financial reform if we \ndo not take up the single biggest entity, the single biggest two \nentities, when combined the single biggest entity, that affects the \nfinancial markets relative to real estate lending in this country, \nwhich is what caused the downturn and the crisis at the end of 2008.\n  We cannot do it. We cannot claim we have done financial reform if we \ndo not take on and address this issue. I understand that the \nadministration said: Well, we will do it next year. Well, we do not \nhave time. It needs to be done now. We need to address this now. It is \na critical issue, and it is at the essence of whether we can get our \nhouse right and our ducks in the correct order relative to financial \nreform.\n  If we do not straighten out Freddie and Fannie and its relationship \nto the Federal Government, and specifically its relationship to the \nAmerican taxpayer, we really have not done anything to solve the long-\nterm problems of how we get our fiscal house in order because that \nissue of how to make real estate loans in this country is at the \nessence of how we correct the financial structure of this country.\n  This amendment, coupled with the amendment that is coming from \nSenator Corker on the issue of underwriting, are the two key amendments \nto this bill which address the two elements which are not addressed but \nwhich have to be addressed if we are going to have effective, \ncomprehensive, lasting, and meaningful reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the information of the manager, I have \nthe following speakers: Senator Coburn for 10 minutes, Senator DeMint \nfor 10 minutes, Senator Thune for 10 minutes. I have not been able to \nnail down Senator Shelby as to how much time he will take. I would like \nto sum up for 5 minutes. There will be no more speakers on my side \nother than those.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I can't do the math that fast. I don't know \nwhat that amounted to, but if we add 15 minutes for myself--why don't I \nask for 20 and then I will yield back. I will take maybe 10. I don't \nhave any requests for speakers at this time, but I may want to leave \nspace in case others may want to be heard. If we could calculate what \nthe time is, find out about Senator Shelby, and then lock down the \ntime. I don't need any additional time for a side-by-side. I will use \n15 minutes. As soon as we get a number on that, we will let our \ncolleagues know.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes kind of \ngeneral talking. I wish to give an example because this is a very big \nbill with a lot of hard work by the Banking Committee and their staffs. \nI want Members to compare this bill to a loved one who gets pneumonia. \nThey go to the doctor and they have a cough and a fever and chills. \nThey feel terrible. Think about it. If you would take your loved one to \nthe doctor and the answer you would get is: I think I can take care of \nthat. I can give you something for the cough that will suppress the \ncough and I will give you something to take care of the fever and I \nwill give you a little something to take care of the pain in your \nchest. You go on home. You come back if you don't get better. Of \ncourse, 2 days later your loved one ends up in the hospital with \nraging, now bilateral pneumonia and sepsis, bacteria in the blood. This \nbill is kind of like that. It is kind of like a doctor treating \nsymptoms instead of the real disease.\n  The real disease was Congress. The real disease was poor underwriting \nstandards, actually no underwriting standards. The real disease was \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the real disease was the rating \nagencies that haven't been controlled effectively by this proposed \nlegislation. This legislation does nothing for the real disease. It \ntreats a lot of symptoms. It grows government gigantically. It will \ncreate more bureaucrats and rules than we can shake a stick at. But it \ndoes not fix the underlying problem.\n  When people dispute that, ask the following question: If you are at \nhome, working and paying your mortgage, guess what. The reason we are \nnot fixing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is so you can continue to pay \nmore taxes so Freddie Mac can solve those mortgage problems through \nyour tax dollars and other people not being responsible for theirs.\n  That is what is going on here. That is why you are going to see $500 \nbillion in additional losses with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, because \nwe are going to get them to keep going until we have satisfied all \nthis, not doing the hard work, not recognizing that we are actually \ngoing to need $5 or $600 billion more in taxes or we are going to \nborrow that to take care of this problem.\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nSo everybody who is out there today who is working hard, paying the \nmortgage, and keeping up is going to get to pay extra because we are \nnot going to fix Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in this bill.\n  That is why this amendment is so important. We decided in this \ncountry a long time ago that we were going to set forth a policy to \nhelp people own homes, except we overdid it. We created incentives that \nwould bring out the worst nature in people. If you don't believe that, \nlook at Long Beach Mortgage, where 90 percent of the mortgages they \nwrote prior to them folding were totally fraudulent. Where was the \noversight? There wasn't any--the Office of Thrift Supervision, but we \ndidn't oversee the Office of Thrift Supervision. We created the symptom \nand a set of incentives and now we want to leave them right there.\n  This underlying bill does not address the three main diseases that \ncaused the problems we have. Congress genuflects and redirects any \ncriticism from us to the greedy banks or the greedy loan originators, \nbut they never say anything about us not doing oversight. They never \nsay anything about us not reforming Fannie and Freddie when we knew \nwhat was coming in terms of their losses and also the financial \ndifficulties they had. We have a bill that doesn't fix it--a lot of \nhard work, a lot of good intentions, but it doesn't fix the core \nproblems so they will not occur in the future.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire said, if you combine strong \nunderwriting standards and transparency associated with limiting the \nloss the American taxpayer is going to take on with Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, you will do something. But the way the bill is now, we \nwill have created big theatrics. Everybody will shake hands and holler \nand dance around when the bill passes, except the dirty little story \nwill be that we didn't fix the real disease. When that loved one in ICU \nwith double pneumonia and sepsis dies, we go after the person who \ndidn't fix it, who should have fixed it, who had the knowledge to fix \nit, and we say: You are liable.\n  Well, we are liable. We ought to be fixing this. The very fact is we \nare not.\n  The McCain amendment is a commonsense amendment. I understand the \nreservations. They don't want another $400 billion of recognized debt. \nThey don't want to account for the losses that are continuing to flow, \n$20 billion so far in the first quarter of this year, out of those two \ninstitutions. The Senator from New Hampshire way underestimated the \ncost to the American taxpayer and what it will ultimately be by not \nfixing this.\n  My appeal to the chairman of the committee is to seriously look, give \nus good answers on why we are not fixing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nWhat are the real reasons we are not fixing that? What are the real \nreasons we are not creating strong, transparent underwriting standards \nso the problem doesn't occur in the future? What is the real reason? \nWhat is the real reason we don't hold accountable the rating agencies \nand take away the conflict of interest thoroughly--not partially but \nthoroughly--from the rating agencies?\n  The rating agencies are supposed to be a check. Had they been doing \ntheir jobs, we wouldn't have had all these securities sold that were \nworthless or were nonperforming. But they don't do their job. We didn't \ndo our job. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac didn't do their job. Yet we are \nnot going to address the core issues that created the setup and \nframework we are now experiencing as an economy. To me, that creates a \ntremendous amount of liability on our part. We ought to have to be in \nexplanation of every ounce of our being on why we don't fix the real \ndisease that caused this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me speak for 5 minutes. I ask the Chair \nto inform me when I have done so.\n  First, let me notify my colleagues, we don't have a time agreement \nyet, but I hope we will shortly on the McCain amendment and the \namendment I will offer as a side-by-side on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \nthe National Association of Home Builders and the National Association \nof REALTORS, both of which oppose the McCain amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Home Builders,\n\n                                     Washington, DC., May 6, 2010.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator John McCain: On behalf of the 175,000 members \n     of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I am \n     writing to express our strong concerns with an amendment \n     offered by Senator John McCain (R-AZ) dealing with the future \n     of the housing Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n       Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been, and remain, critical \n     components of the U.S. housing finance system. NAHB is \n     working with Congress to craft a thoughtful approach to the \n     future of these institutions, as well as the future of the \n     housing finance system itself. However, we remain concerned \n     about how to get from the current structure to a future \n     arrangement without undermining ongoing financial rescue \n     efforts and disrupting the operation of the overall housing \n     finance system. Any changes should be undertaken with extreme \n     care and with sufficient time to ensure that U.S. home buyers \n     and renters are not placed in harm's way, and that the \n     mortgage funding and delivery system operate efficiently and \n     effectively as a new system is put in place.\n       NAHB is concerned that the provisions in the McCain \n     amendment, if the GSEs are deemed viable, dealing with \n     portfolio limitations, loan limit repeals and escalating \n     mandatory down payments would greatly limit the GSEs' ability \n     to participate in the secondary housing market and lead the \n     housing market into recovery. Moreover, NAHB is concerned \n     that the McCain amendment could effectively end the current \n     housing finance delivery system without offering a thoughtful \n     replacement.\n       Again, NAHB has strong concerns with the impact the McCain \n     amendment would have on the current housing finance system, \n     and urges the Senate to address the future of Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac in a thoughtful and deliberative manner.\n           Best regards,\n                                                   Joseph Stanton,\n     Senior Vice President and Chief Lobbyist, Government Affairs\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                     Realtors,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of more than 1.1 million members of \n     the National Association of REALTORS' (NAR) \n     involved in residential and commercial real estate as \n     brokers, sales people, property managers, appraisers, \n     counselors, and others engaged in all aspects of the real \n     estate industry, I respectfully request that you oppose the \n     Corker-Gregg-Isakson (#3834) and the McCain-Shelby-Gregg \n     (#3839) amendments to S. 3217, the Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010.\n\n\n                     corker-gregg-isakson amendment\n\n       The Corker-Gregg-Isakson (#3834) amendment replaces the \n     risk retention provisions of S. 3217, Title VII, Subtitle D, \n     (b) Credit Risk Retentions--with a study on the feasibility \n     of risk retention requirements for financial institutions and \n     implements residential mortgage underwriting standards that \n     include a mandatory 5% down payment for all mortgages. As our \n     nation continues to recover from the worst economic downturn \n     since the Great Depression, REALTORS' are \n     cognizant that lax underwriting standards brought us to this \n     point, and must be curtailed. However, we caution that \n     swinging the pendulum too far in the opposite direction may \n     reverse our fragile recovery.\n       Based on data from NAR's 2009 Profile of Home Buyers and \n     Sellers, 11% of all home purchasers surveyed had downpayments \n     of 5% or less. When considering only first-time homebuyers, \n     the percentage utilizing a downpayment below 5% increase to \n     18%. Improving underwriting to ensure that the consumer has \n     the ability to repay their obligation is in the best interest \n     of everyone, but eliminating the possibility for some \n     creditworthy consumers to buy a home will have significant \n     detrimental ramifications for American families, the housing \n     sector an those businesses that support it.\n\n\n                     McCain-Shelby-Gregg Amendment\n\n       The McCain-Shelby-Gregg (#3839) amendment, which creates \n     Title XII to S. 3217, places Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on \n     the fast track to dissolution. REALTORS' believe \n     that reform of these institutions that have played a pivotal \n     role in the evolution of the U.S. housing market is \n     necessary; however now is not the time for drastic action, \n     especially considering their current role in stabilizing the \n     housing market, and that the McCain-Shelby-Gregg amendment \n     does not offer a replacement to fill the enormous gap that \n     the shuttered GSEs will leave.\n       As NAR mentioned in our testimony before the House \n     Financial Services Committee, March 23rd, 2010, on the \n     ``Future of the Housing Finance'', the transition of these \n     organizations to their new form must be conducted in a \n     fashion that is the least disruptive to the marketplace and \n     ensures mortgage capital continues to flow to all markets in \n     all market conditions. The establishment of aggressive \n     timetables for the GSEs to return to\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\n     profitability, prior to the full recovery of our nation's \n     economy and housing market, pre-disposes them to failure, and \n     will cause significant angst for homebuyers and the nation's \n     housing markets.\n       Furthermore, the requirements that this amendment places on \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when they become viable, will \n     effectively prohibit them from participating in the secondary \n     mortgage market.\n       First, the aggressive reduction of their portfolio will \n     prevent them from being an effective buffer during future \n     economic downturns. A key element of NAR's recommendation for \n     the restructure of the GSEs is that their portfolios should \n     only be large enough to support their business needs and \n     ensure a stable supply of mortgage capital when necessary \n     because of insufficient private investment. The requirements \n     established in this amendment would thwart the GSEs' ability \n     to be an effective buffer.\n       Second, the amendment repeals all increases to loan limits, \n     both permanent and temporary. The loan limits would return \n     to: $417,000. Moreover, the GSEs would be prohibited from \n     purchasing homes that had prices over the median-home price, \n     for properties of the same size, for the area in which the \n     property was purchased. This would reduce loan limits to less \n     than $100,000 in some areas, less than half the current FHA \n     floor.\n       NAR advocated for the increase of the loan limits for high \n     cost areas and is actively advocating that the current limits \n     be made permanent in order to ensure that creditworthy \n     homebuyers have access to affordable capital. The housing \n     market remains fragile, and private capital has not returned \n     to either the mortgage or MBS markets to the extent that is \n     needed to support the housing industry. Reducing the GSEs' \n     loan limits to the suggested levels will significantly limit \n     the ability of homebuyers to obtain mortgage funding \n     throughout the country, and damage the business sectors \n     supported by mortgage finance.\n       Third, the amendment establishes an escalating mandatory \n     down payment percentage that REALTORS' believe \n     unfairly and unnecessarily denies the opportunity to many \n     families who have the potential to succeed as homeowners. \n     Beginning 1-year after the 24-month assessment period, the \n     minimum down payment requirement will be 5%. 2-years out, the \n     downpayment will be 7.5%. After three years, the downpayment \n     will be 10% for conventional-conforming loans.\n       The removal of flexible downpayment options will \n     significantly reduce the ability of creditworthy consumers to \n     purchase a home. As mentioned with regard to the Corker-\n     Gregg-Isakson amendment, a 5% downpayment requirement \n     excludes 11% of all current homebuyers and 18% of all current \n     first-time homebuyers, based on NAR's most recent homebuyers \n     survey. Increasing the downpayment requirement to 10% would \n     exclude nearly 25% of all current creditworthy borrowers, and \n     up to 37% of current creditworthy first-time homebuyers. \n     Underwriting standards have already been corrected and loans \n     are only available for borrowers who can afford them. There \n     is no reason to over-correct by imposing higher downpayment \n     requirements.\n       As we have seen, without the GSEs, the current crisis would \n     have been even more catastrophic for the housing market and \n     the overall economy, as virtually no activity would have \n     occurred within the housing sector because little private \n     capital would have been available. REALTORS' \n     support reforming our housing finance system, and the GSEs. \n     However, taking a measured approach is critical to ensuring \n     that our economic recovery remains viable.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share with you the views of \n     more than 1.1 million real estate practitioners and \n     respectfully request that you oppose the McCain-Shelby-Gregg \n     (#3839) and the Corker-Gregg-Isakson (#3834) amendments to S. \n     3217, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Vicki Cox Golder, CRB,\n\n                                                   2010 President,\n                                              National Association\n                                          of Realtors'.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I say this with all due respect, but the McCain amendment \nsays that in 24 months we get rid of Fannie and Freddie. I don't call \nthat reform. They are just getting rid of something. What are the \nimplications of just getting rid of Fannie and Freddie? The fact is, \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at this juncture, account for 96.5 percent \nof all funding for all mortgages today. The amendment could undermine \nthe supply without establishing any alternative, and there is no \nalternative. It just says in 24 months you get rid of Fannie and \nFreddie. That is a wonderful conclusion, except for the fact that what \nyou get for that--and I don't make up these numbers--is higher interest \nrates on mortgages, declining values in properties, the possibility of \neliminating the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, which only exists because, \nfrankly, we have had the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage program.\n  This program needs to be fixed. There is no question about it. We \nneed an alternative housing financing system. That is without question. \nBut this amendment doesn't offer any. It just says get rid of the one \nwe have.\n  As the letter from the National Association of REALTORS reads:\n\n       [It] places Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a fast track to \n     dissolution. REALTORS believe that reform of these \n     institutions, that have played a pivotal role in the \n     evolution of the U.S. housing market, is necessary; however, \n     now is not the time for drastic action. Especially, \n     considering the current role in stabilizing the housing \n     market. [The McCain] amendment does not offer a replacement \n     to fill the enormous gap that the shuttered GSEs will leave.\n\n  That is what we are being asked to do. In the letter from the \nNational Association of Home Builders, they write:\n\n       Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been, and remain, critical \n     components of the U.S. housing finance system. However, we \n     remain concerned about how to get from the current structure \n     to a future arrangement without undermining ongoing financial \n     rescue efforts and disrupting the operation of the overall \n     housing financing system. Any changes should be undertaken \n     with extreme care and with sufficient time to ensure that \n     U.S. home buyers and renters are not placed in harm's way, \n     and that the mortgage funding and delivery system operate \n     efficiently and effectively as a new system is put in place.\n\n  We have to do this carefully. It was the housing problems that got us \ninto this mess. It was not Fannie and Freddie. It was this notion of a \nderegulated environment that occurred. All the problems emerged in the \nunregulated sector--unregulated brokers, unregulated mortgage \ncompanies. They were luring people into mortgages they could not \nafford, with no documentation, no background checks whatsoever. That is \nthe genesis of this whole issue. Read a new book, ``The Big Short,'' if \nyou want a good read about the genesis of this problem. I should not be \nin the business of promoting books, but that book will lay out what \nhappened. Fannie and Freddie contributed to the problem further out, \nbut the problem began in a totally unregulated environment, an \nunregulated environment that was promoted by the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve and his advocates and supporters over the years. That \nis the origin of the mess that got us into this. Today there is no \nbackup. If 96.5 percent of mortgages are backed by these two \ninstitutions right now, what replaces it? There isn't any with this \namendment. We are left in a free fall. Who gets hurt? Average \nAmericans. Clearly, we have to step up. Our amendment that we will \noffer as a substitute demands within 6 months a plan be laid out. There \nare a lot of different ideas on how to do it. We have had a lot of \nhearings and discussions on what ought to replace the present housing \nfinancing system. But I don't know of anyone who has come to one single \nconclusion on what the best alternative is. Some have advocated a \npublic utility concept. That has very attractive features to it and is \none I would be inclined to be supportive of. There are other ideas on \nhow to do this, but to just eliminate it altogether, without an \nalternative, at a time when we are just beginning to get back on our \nfeet, housing values are beginning to creep up, housing sales are \nbeginning to move forward?\n  Again, if we leave this sector of the economy with the kind of \ndisruption created by this amendment, then we could fall right back \ninto a recession. We have lost 8.5 million jobs, 7 million homes have \nbeen lost, 4 million homes today are underwater in the United States, \nand 250,000 have been seized in the first 3 months of this year. If we \nwant to contribute to that, if that is what our goal is in this bill, \nto decide on a whim and offering an amendment just to strike these two \nentities that exist with all their problems, that this is the way to \ndeal with the housing problem, it would be a drastic mistake to make, \nhaving an amendment such as this be adopted. That is the reason I feel \nstrongly about it. That does not, in any way, take a backseat to the \nnotion we have to come up with an alternative housing financing system. \nThat is absolutely certain. This amendment does not do that. It just \ngets rid of the present one without replacing it with anything. That is \nnot the way to engage in the kind of reform that is needed.\n  I think my 5 minutes have expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I yield to Senator Thune, in \nresponse to Senator Dodd's statement, I am incredulous that we would \nsomehow believe Fannie and Freddie were not among the prime reasons for \nthis financial meltdown.\n  Peter Wallison, who is a fellow in financial policy studies at the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\nEnterprise Institute and is a leading expert on banking and securities \nregulation, has written extensively about this issue and says:\n\n       The roots of the financial crisis date back to 1993, when \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--\n\n  With the encouragement, by the way, of Members of Congress, including \nthe passage of the Community Reinvestment Act, which basically forced \npeople to give home loan mortgages to people who could never pay them \nback--he goes on to say--\n\n     began stocking up on subprime mortgage assets and other risky \n     loans while reporting them as prime. The agencies' conflict \n     of interest between lending to low-income borrowers and \n     minimizing risk-taking activity may be to blame for their \n     behavior, however, it is certain that the government's \n     failure to properly regulate the enterprises has created one \n     of the worst policy disasters in history.\n       On Christmas Eve, when most Americans' minds were on other \n     things, the Treasury Department announced it was removing the \n     $400 billion cap from what the administration believes will \n     be necessary to keep Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac solvent. This \n     action confirms that the decade-long congressional failure to \n     more closely regulate these two government-sponsored \n     enterprises (GSEs) will rank for U.S. taxpayers as one of the \n     worst policy disasters in our history.\n\n  That is the view of most economists. How in the world someone as \nknowledgeable as the distinguished chairman of the committee does not \nrecognize this is one of the prime reasons for the failure, this is one \nof the prime reasons why 48 percent of the homes in Arizona are \nunderwater, where people are throwing keys in the middle of the living \nroom floor because they cannot afford to make the payments.\n  The enablers were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--the enablers of all \nthis. Time after time, this Congress--this Congress--put pressure on \nthem to increase their home loan mortgages to people who could never \nafford to pay their mortgages. We know that is the cause of it, and how \nthe Senator from Connecticut can somehow allege that Fannie and Freddie \nwere not--as Mr. Wallison says, the ``action confirms that the decade-\nlong congressional failure to more closely regulate these two \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises will rank for U.S. taxpayers as one of \nthe worst policy disasters in our history.''\n  This morning, Mr. Wallison is quoted as saying:\n\n       Right now we have a consensus that something needs to be \n     done. The sensible thing to do is to put Congress in a \n     position where they have to act within a certain period of \n     time.\n\n  That is what this amendment does. They have to act in a certain \nperiod of time. The Senator wants to know who should be making home \nloans? Community banks. Community banks should be making home loans to \npeople. They should be able to extend lines of credit to small \nbusinesses. But the main thing is, it should not be given to a \ngovernment-sponsored enterprise to keep it in business, where the \nhundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars being spent is unlimited.\n  I yield the floor. Senator Thune, I believe, has 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for \nyielding me time.\n  I would say Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a pox on all of us. But \nshame on us if we do not try to do something in this legislation to \naddress this issue. What the McCain-Shelby-Gregg amendment does is \nresponsible. It does allow for a wind-down of this conservatorship. \nBut, as the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, it goes squarely at \nwhat I think most economists argue was a huge contributor to the \nmeltdown we experienced a couple years ago: the runaway lending and \nirresponsible lending practices that were involved with the plight we \nnow see with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, where they have, up until, I \nthink, this last quarter--or taking the last quarter combined, it is \nabout $145 billion now that the taxpayers are on the hook for.\n  As the Senator from Arizona pointed out, last Christmas Eve the \nadministration lifted the cap. There was a $400 billion cap on the \namount of taxpayer assistance that could be provided to these two \ninstitutions. But now that cap has been lifted. Imagine the scale and \ndimension of what we are talking about, when we already have $145 \nbillion of taxpayer exposure. We assume it could be as much as $400 \nbillion. But just in case, the administration lifts the cap because it \ncould go well beyond that, which suggests, if history is any \nindication, it will go well beyond that.\n  What this does is say we need to exercise some responsibility with \nregard to the regulation of all the financial institutions in this \ncountry. What the Senator from Connecticut, in his bill, does--with the \nfinancial services regulation reform bill--is to attempt to get at what \ncontributed, in many respects, to the meltdown we experienced a couple \nyears ago. But it ignores perhaps, as has been pointed out by the \nSenator from Arizona, one of the biggest contributors to that problem; \nthat is, these two toxic institutions, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\n  The administration has said they need time to come up with a plan. \nThe side-by-side that is going to be offered by the Democrats is going \nto be a study. We are going to study this for about 6 months. I think \ntheir argument is, it would be dangerous to rush the process. I think \nthe contrary is true. I believe it is dangerous to ignore this problem \nany longer. We cannot afford to wait so more taxpayer money can be \nlost, can be wasted in trying to keep these two entities afloat.\n  As I said before, last week we were informed that Freddie Mac needs \nan additional $10.6 billion in taxpayer funds due to an $8 billion loss \nin the first quarter of 2010. Since September of 2008, that brings the \ntaxpayers' invoice for Freddie Mac to $61.3 billion.\n  Fannie Mae reported a first quarter loss of more than $13 billion, \nneeding $8.4 billion from the government, putting their bill to the \nAmerican taxpayers at $83.6 billion.\n  So the grand total of taxpayer loss from these two entities since \ntheir takeover in 2008 is a whopping $145 billion.\n  The losses racked up by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae exceed--exceed--\nthe government's losses on AIG, General Motors, and Chrysler. Yet the \ncurrent legislation in the Senate is completely silent on these two \nentities. That is outrageous. We cannot continue to funnel unlimited \namounts of taxpayer money into Freddie and Fannie and have no plan to \nend this siphon.\n  In a time when we are faced with crushing debt and out-of-control \ndeficits, we are willing to turn a blind eye to a $145 billion problem, \nwhich is going to only magnify over time. Last Christmas Eve, the \nadministration lifted the cap of $400 billion, which is what initially \nwas put in place that would limit the amount of taxpayer exposure. But \nwhat we are now saying is that may not be enough. Yet we do nothing--\nnothing--in this legislation to remedy this problem.\n  Obviously, the administration knew there was more bad news ahead when \nthey decided to lift the cap on government assistance on Christmas Eve \nof last year. The Obama administration decided that taxpayers could \nafford unlimited funding for Freddie and Fannie rather than keep a $400 \nbillion cap on assistance in place. It is frightening they believe that \n$400 billion is not going to be enough--unlimited funding may not be \nenough. Who knows where this ends.\n  That is why I think it is important right now that we deal with this \nissue, and the McCain-Shelby-Gregg amendment does it in a responsible \nway by winding down and providing a timeline. It sets a 30-month date \nout there by which this conservatorship has to be wound down.\n  If you look at what the current exposure is in terms of Freddie and \nFannie, they own or guarantee over 30 million home loans, worth about \n$5.5 trillion. The CBO estimates that Freddie and Fannie could cost the \ntaxpayers as much as $380 billion through 2020. As I said before, my \nassumption is that because we lifted--``we,'' the administration \nlifted--the cap on the $400 billion of exposure, the assumption is, it \nis going to go much higher than that. So I think we have to ask \nourselves this fundamental question: Is this the direction in which we \nwant to continue heading or is it time to change course?\n\n  The time to change course is now while we are debating a bill that is \ndesigned to address the very problems we encountered a couple years \nago. Freddie and Fannie, as the Senator from Arizona said, were at the \nvery heart, the very core of that issue.\n  According to a recent Washington Post article, with the government's\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\nconservatorship of Freddie and Fannie and the increase in FHA and VA \nloans, the government backed nearly 97 percent of home loans in the \nfirst quarter of 2010. Madam President, 97 percent of loans are backed \nby the U.S. Government. Is this where we want to end up? Is this where \nwe want to head? Is this the best course for our housing market? Is \nthis the role the Federal Government should be taking when it comes to \nhousing in this country?\n  I firmly believe it is time we change course. I think there is great \nvalue--we all agree there is great value--in home ownership and helping \nfamilies achieve the American dream of owning their own homes. But we \nhave to bring personal responsibility back into the conversation. We \nneed to go back to a time when families saved up money to make a \ndownpayment on a house. They went to their banks. They provided the \nnecessary documentation to prove they could pay back their loans, and \nthey bought a house that was within their budgets. Buying and owning a \nhome should be a goal people work to achieve, not a government mandate \nfunded by the taxpayers. That essentially is what we have created.\n  So I believe it is about time to take responsibility for our actions. \nMy constituents in my State who bought houses they could afford and \npaid their bills on time want to see Congress start taking some \nresponsibility. I believe the McCain-Shelby-Gregg amendment does just \nthat. It shows our commitment to getting our fiscal house in order in \nWashington, DC.\n  As I said, it is a sound plan for winding down the government \nbackstop to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. It mandates that \nconservatorship will end in 30 months or less. Freddie Mac and Fannie \nMae will have to reduce their portfolios by 10 percent each year, and \nif they are not viable enough to exist after the 30 months they will be \nliquidated. If they are a viable company after the 30 months, they \nwould only enjoy their Federal GSE status for another 3 years.\n  The amendment repeals the affordable housing goals that persuaded the \ntwo entities to enter into the subprime loan business in the first \nplace, which I believe was the slippery slope that got us into all the \nproblems, all the troubles we are facing today.\n  It creates new underwriting requirements on loans purchased by \nFreddie and Fannie. Freddie and Fannie will have to reduce their \nmortgage assets by more than 50 percent within 2 years and increase \ntheir capital reserves. It repeals the temporary increase in the \nconforming loan limit, returning it to $417,000. The two would have to \npay State and local taxes, register with the SEC, and pay a fee to the \ngovernment to repay their debts to the taxpayer.\n  These are all responsible reforms. Contrary to the assertions that \nhave been made by the other side, this amendment is the correct way to \nproceed in dealing with these two giant institutions that have lost \ntheir way and are costing the taxpayers literally billions and billions \nand billions of dollars every quarter that passes that we do not take \nsteps to fix this problem.\n  The amendment would reinstate the $400 billion cap that the \nadministration lifted in December so the taxpayers know for certain \nthey are not going to be on the hook for unlimited financial support.\n  The amendment establishes a new special inspector general at the GAO \nto investigate and report to Congress on these two entities. Freddie \nand Fannie would be included in the Federal budget until their \nconservatorship has ended, which is the fiscally responsible thing to \ndo when we all know they do, in fact, have an impact on our budget and \non our debt.\n  As I said, I have heard the arguments on the other side of the aisle, \nand I think they are ignoring the clear will of the American people. \nThe American people get this. They know why we are where we are. They \nare sick and tired of subsidizing the mistakes of Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae. We need to put an end to the taxpayer bailout.\n  I think it is important to the credibility of our economy and our \ncredibility with the American taxpayers--but it is important to the \ncredibility of the markets and to our economy--that they understand we \nare serious about solving this problem. That is why the McCain-Shelby-\nGregg amendment is the correct way to proceed. We are going to have a \nvote on that very soon, and I hope we will not leave this subject, that \nwe will not dispose of this financial services regulation reform bill \nwithout addressing this very important topic.\n  To suggest for a minute, as the other side has, that somehow we can \ndo a study, we can put this off for 6 months--and who knows. By the \ntime they complete the study, they will have to think about the results \nof that study and formulate a plan, and that will take another 6 months \nor a year. Every single month, every single quarter that goes by, we \ncontinue to hemorrhage more and more money at the cost of billions and \nbillions of dollars to the American taxpayers. They have had enough. We \nshould say we have had enough and we are going to bring some \ndiscipline. This amendment does that, and I hope my colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, as part of the debate on the McCain-\nShelby-Gregg amendment, I wish to take this opportunity this afternoon \nto discuss the history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from my \nperspective. By doing this, I want to emphasize past Republican \nattempts at regulating and reforming these institutions, while also \ndiscussing their role in the financial crisis.\n  The government-sponsored enterprises that we call Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac were key players in the collapse of the U.S. housing \nmarket. Their multitrillion dollar portfolios gave them the purchasing \npower to drive markets. In addition, false presumptions about their \nhousing finance expertise and their connections to the government gave \nthem further power to influence the housing market. And let us not \nforget the GSEs' nationwide lobbying and public affairs apparatus that \nwas designed to keep reformers at bay and their supporters flush with \ncash.\n  When the GSEs began to buy subprime securities, other firms, \nincluding most of the Wall Street banks, took this as a signal that \nsubprime mortgage securities were safe and worthwhile investments. In \neffect, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac placed the Good Housekeeping ``Seal \nof Approval'' on these risky instruments. As a result, the rest of the \nmarket engaged in this practice, and the race to the bottom began. \nUltimately, the GSEs' collapse lit a wildfire that burned throughout \nthe financial markets.\n  Due to their miscalculations, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been \nplaced in conservatorship and have already cost the taxpayers well over \n$100 billion. Just last week, we learned that the GSEs will need \nanother $20 billion in taxpayer assistance for their losses during the \nprevious quarter.\n  This did not have to happen. For years, the warning signs were \nflashing, and Republicans made multiple attempts to adopt the necessary \nreforms. Unfortunately, those efforts were opposed by Democrats in the \nSenate Banking Committee and ultimately caused the many efforts put \nforth by Republicans to stall in the Senate.\n  In 2003, as chairman of the Banking Committee at that time, I held \nmultiple hearings on proposals for improving the regulation of the \nGSEs. I wish to read a portion of my opening statement from one of \nthose hearings. I quote from that time:\n\n       The enterprises are large institutions. Collectively, \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac carry $1.6 trillion in assets on \n     their balance sheets and have outstanding debt of almost $1.5 \n     trillion. The Federal Home Loan Bank System is not far \n     behind, with combined assets of over $780 billion and \n     outstanding advances to member institutions of $495 billion. \n     Due to the importance of the housing GSEs' mission, and the \n     size of their assets, I believe that the enterprises require \n     a strong, credible regulator.\n\n  I further read from the statement then:\n\n       I remain concerned that the current regulatory structure \n     for housing the GSEs is neither strong nor credible.\n\n\n[[Page S3504]]\n\n\n  At this same hearing, it became apparent that the two parties had \nvery different perspectives regarding the need for reform. One of my \nDemocratic colleagues noted--and it is in the record:\n\n       There is an old expression, if it ain't broke, don't fix \n     it. I think some of us here in the Senate believe that when \n     we try to fix things that aren't really broken, we can end up \n     doing more harm than good.\n\n  Notwithstanding the mindset on the other side of the aisle, my \nRepublican colleagues and I persevered, and we remained engaged in the \neffort to reform the GSEs by holding numerous hearings and closely \ntracking the GSEs' activities at that time.\n  We decided those who believed ``things aren't really broken'' were \nwrong. In the face of strong Democratic opposition and a relentless \nlobbying campaign by the GSEs and their supporters, we proceeded with a \nmarkup of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2004.\n  I wish to again read portions of my brief opening statement from that \nmarkup which lays out the issues and the responses we crafted to \naddress the problems of the GSEs then:\n\n       This afternoon the committee will consider S. 1508, a bill \n     to address regulation of the housing GSEs.\n       Today, we are faced with the most important decisions \n     considered by this committee in years--determining the \n     strength, independence and credibility of regulation of our \n     nation's Government Sponsored Housing Enterprises. The \n     strength, independence and credibility of this regulatory \n     system have tremendous implications for the future health and \n     vitality of our housing markets, our capital markets, and the \n     economy as a whole.\n\n  I continue to quote the statement:\n\n       Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae currently have $1.7 billion debt \n     outstanding. To provide some perspective, our nation's \n     Treasury debt in the hands of the public stands at just over \n     $4 trillion. The Federal Home Loan Bank System has also grown \n     significantly since the 1990s and has a vastly expanded \n     membership base.\n       Its current regulator is not up to the task of providing \n     adequate oversight of its significant role.\n\n  My statement continued:\n\n       Fannie Mae is the second largest financial institution in \n     the United States. Freddie Mac is fourth. Their debt is held \n     by foreign central banks, insurance companies, money center \n     banks and community banks. Because of the interest rate risk \n     these GSEs must manage, they have an extensive network of \n     derivative contracts. Should one of these institutions \n     encounter significant financial difficulty it could make the \n     S crisis pale by comparison.\n\n  I was here speaking as an early member of the Banking Committee, as \nwas Senator Dodd, during the bailout of the S And it was no pretty \nmatter. It ended up costing the taxpayers at least $130 billion.\n  I continue:\n\n       This experience has only reaffirmed my resolve to ensure \n     such a debacle never revisits the taxpayer. And, quite \n     simply, the real truth is we cannot afford a crisis of the \n     magnitude a failing GSE would pose.\n       I approach this markup today with a firm appreciation of \n     the gravity and relevance of what we do here today. I state \n     again, as I have before--I support the housing missions of \n     the GSEs. Home ownership is the primary source of wealth for \n     many Americans. It fosters strong communities and promotes \n     stability for children and families.\n       But, and I believe there is consensus in this Committee on \n     this one point at least, they are not well-regulated and, \n     therefore, pose significant risk to the taxpayer and the \n     markets they serve.\n       To be clear: they are not well-regulated because the \n     regulatory structures and authorities that Congress created \n     are insufficient and weak by design.\n       And that is what the draft before us is all about. \n     Reaffirming the important mission of GSEs, creating a \n     regulator that has all the tools and independence that other \n     first class financial regulators require, and protecting the \n     taxpayer. These are the guiding principles that animate the \n     draft that I have put forth before the Banking Committee \n     today.\n\n  Unfortunately for the taxpayers of this country, politics got in the \nway of advancing credible public policy then. Apparently, the Democrats \nfelt it was better to block necessary change, adhere to the status quo, \nand ignore the risk to the financial system, all while leaving the \ntaxpayers fully exposed.\n  We, the same Republicans who have been characterized by Democrats as \nbeing pro-Wall Street and antiregulation throughout this process, were \ntrying to create a stronger regulator, raise capital standards, reduce \nrisk taking, and put in place a resolution regime that would limit \ntaxpayer exposure in the event of a firm failure.\n  That was a number of years back. I wish to revisit the words of one \nof my then-Democratic colleagues who made the following statement--and \nit is in the record--as we debated the merits of the Republican GSE \nreform bill at that time:\n\n       Lord only knows where the economy would be today if it were \n     not for the stability of the housing market in the midst of \n     so much turbulence and the ability of Americans to draw down \n     some of their home equity to engage in consumer purchases.\n\n  Then, as we stood on the precipice of a housing and financial \nmeltdown, my Democratic colleagues were opposing more regulation and \npromoting more consumer spending. As if that were not bad enough, we \nwere encouraging homeowners to raid the home's equity to finance their \npurchases. And look where it brought us.\n  Another Democrat took issue with the fact that we attempted to give \nthe regulator the power to place a GSE into receivership:\n\n       Receivership, first, it does not have to be in the bill, \n     but, second, to allow a regulator who may not like this \n     institution to then sort of dole out little pieces of it one \n     way or another and weaken the fundamental structure of Fannie \n     and Freddie easily leads to its demise.\n\n  I am not sure whether my colleagues then understood the basic concept \nbehind establishing an orderly resolution process, but I hope the \nlesson has now been learned. Ironically, Democratic opposition to \nstrong reform actually produced the exact outcome my colleague feared. \nWhen reform stalled in the face of Democratic objections, investors \nonce again viewed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as ``too big to fail.'' \nThey were confident that Congress and the U.S. Government would never \nallow them to go under. This, of course, gave the GSEs a significant \nfinancing cost advantage which led to their explosive growth and \nexcessive risk taking.\n  Finally, and most telling, one of my Democratic colleagues was \nconcerned about how Wall Street might interpret the regulatory changes \nthat Republicans were advocating, stating:\n\n       It is a fact that just mere speculation about the prospects \n     of some provisions in the bill is sending shock waves through \n     Wall Street.\n\n  Really?\n  When Wall Street became concerned that our legislation at that time \nwould provide a stronger regulator, require higher capital standards, \nmandate less risk taking, and establish a well-designed resolution \nregime, the Democrats came to Wall Street's rescue, not the \nRepublicans.\n  When the choice was between Main Street and Wall Street, the \nDemocrats made it absolutely clear whose side they were on. They chose \nWall Street, and Wall Street ultimately paved the road that led to this \ncollapse.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nrecorded vote of the proceedings of that day in the Senate Banking \nCommittee. That result was a party-line vote with all 12 Republicans \nvoting for GSE reform and all Democrats opposing it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nMarkup of S. 1508, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act \n                                of 2004\n\n       The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:10 p.m., in \n     room SD-538, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Senator Richard \n     Shelby (Chairman of the Committee) presiding.\n       Present: Senators Shelby, Bennett, Allard, Enzi, Hagel, \n     Santorum, Bunning, Crapo, Sununu, Dole, Chafee, Sarbanes, \n     Dodd, Johnson, Reed, Schumer, Bayh, Carper, Stabenow, and \n     Corzine.\n\n\n                  STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN RICHARD SHELBY\n\n       Chairman Shelby.

Madam President, that was not the end of the story, \nthough. More than 1 year later, we tried again to pass these important \nreforms. The Banking Committee held more hearings leading to the markup \nof S. 190, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of \n2005. I will not read my entire statement from this markup, but I will \nread a part of it that describes the commonsense steps that we were \nattempting to take with our newest effort to pass then GSE reform. I \nquote from that markup:\n\n       My legislation creates a new regulator with combined \n     oversight for both the safety and soundness and the housing \n     mission of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan \n     Bank System.\n       The new regulator will have general regulatory authority \n     over all housing GSEs, including enhanced authority over \n     capital requirements, and enforcement and prompt corrective \n     action authorities that are comparable to those of the bank \n     regulatory agencies.\n       Among other enhanced regulatory authorities, the bill we \n     will consider today includes clear direction on portfolio \n     review for compliance with safety and soundness, mission and \n     systemic risk.\n       Under this proposal, the enterprises are permitted to hold \n     those assets which promote the enterprises' mission in the \n     housing market.\n       The bill also transfers the product review function from \n     HUD to the new regulator and creates a two-tier approval \n     process through which the enterprises must receive approval \n     prior to offering any new product.\n       The bill also establishes new criteria for approval of a \n     product that will ensure the enterprises remain focused on \n     their statutory mission of facilitating a secondary mortgage \n     market.\n       The new regulator will also have the power to conduct an \n     orderly resolution of a failing or insolvent GSE through a \n     receivership process. This clear and definitive process for \n     dealing with a troubled enterprise is a critical tool for the \n     credibility and strength of a new regulator.\n\n  Madam President, unfortunately, the Democrats did not share my view \nof increasing regulations on the GSEs, and their comments during the \nsecond attempt to pass meaningful reforms are telling. One of my \nDemocratic colleagues stated then, ``When the sink is leaking, you do \nnot tear down the house, especially if the house has served you well.'' \nAnother recalled a critique he read of the bill before the markup, \nwhich claimed, ``It is like trying to cure the common cold with \nchemotherapy.''\n  In fact, at one hearing, one of my Democratic colleagues expressed an \ninterest in hearing how the roles of the GSEs might be increased, when \nhe explained:\n\n       I am not only interested in hearing about the role GSEs \n     currently play in the mortgage market, I am also interested \n     in how their commitment to home ownership and affordable \n     housing can be expanded.\n\n  In the end, the result of our 2005 markup was the same as our 2004 \nmarkup--a strict party-line vote with all 11 Republicans supporting the \nreforms and all 9 Democrats opposing them. Unfortunately, the Democrats \nonce again sided with Wall Street and the special interests by \nrejecting GSE reform and any attempt to move the legislation beyond the \nBanking Committee.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of that recorded vote in the Banking Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nMarkup of the Nominations of Hon.

Mr. Chairman, the yeas are 11, the nays nine.\n       Chairman Shelby. S. 190 as amended is ordered reported to \n     the full Senate.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would like to point out another bit of irony right now. \nMany of my colleagues who recently complained about the process \nregarding consideration of this bill were some of the same people who \ntook every measure to block all consideration of GSE reform. Actions \nhave consequences, and in this particular instance, they were almost \nimmediate. As soon as it was apparent that GSE reform was dead, Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac took steps to dramatically increase their risk.\n  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, detailed this in a \nSeptember 2009 report. The GAO discovered that in 2004 and 2005, the \nenterprises:\n\n       . . . embarked on aggressive strategies to purchase \n     mortgages and mortgage assets with questionable underwriting \n     standards. For example, they purchased a large volume of what \n     are known as Alt-A mortgages, which typically did not have \n     documentation of borrowers' incomes and had higher loan-to-\n     value ratios or debt-to-income ratios.\n       Furthermore, purchases of private-label MBS increased \n     rapidly as a percentage of retained mortgage portfolios from \n     2003 to 2006. By the end of 2007, the enterprises \n     collectively held more than $313 billion in private-label \n     mortgage-backed securities, of which $94 billion was held by \n     Fannie Mae and $218.9 billion held by Freddie Mac.\n\n  Recently, Daniel Mudd, Fannie Mae's former chief operating officer \nand chief executive officer, testified:\n\n       While the market was changing, Fannie Mae struggled to meet \n     aggressively increasing HUD goals. The goals were extremely \n     challenging, increased significantly every year, and \n     permitted no leeway to account for the challenging lending \n     environment. Certain mortgages that may not have met our \n     traditional standards could not be ignored.\n\n  While Mr. Mudd may be correct that these mortgages aided their \nability to meet their HUD goals, it also should be\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\nnoted that the GAO in this same report did not see these purchases as a \nbenefit to their mission, stating:\n\n       The rapid increase in the enterprises' mortgage portfolios \n     and the associated interest-rate risk did not result in a \n     corresponding benefit to the achievement of their housing \n     mission.\n\n  Ultimately, this increased risk played a significant role in the \ndemise of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  I would like to read one final section of that 2009 GAO report here \nthis afternoon.\n\n       According to the Federal Housing Finance Administration, \n     while these questionable mortgage assets accounted for less \n     than 20 percent of the enterprises' total assets, they \n     represented a disproportionate share of credit-related losses \n     in 2007 and 2008.\n       For example, by the end of 2008, Fannie Mae held \n     approximately $295 billion in Alt-A loans, which accounted \n     for about 10 percent of the total single-family mortgage book \n     of business. Similarly, Alt-A mortgages accounted for nearly \n     half of Fannie Mae's $27.1 billion in credit losses of its \n     single-family guarantee book of business in 2008.\n       At a June 2009 congressional hearing, former OFHEO Director \n     James Lockhart said that 60 percent of the triple-A rated \n     private label MBS purchased by the enterprises had since been \n     downgraded to below investment grade. He also stated that \n     investor concerns about the extent of the enterprises' \n     holdings of such assets and the potential associated losses \n     compromised their capacity to raise needed capital and issue \n     debt at acceptable rates.\n\n  Madam President, we all know what happened once they were unable to \nraise capital, but let's also remember the consequences that followed \nour failure to properly regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  Charles Duhigg of the New York Times, part of a group of journalists \nwho produced ``The Reckoning,'' a series that explored the roots of the \nfinancial crisis, wrote in 2008 that:\n\n       The ripple effect of Fannie's plunge into riskier lending \n     was profound. Fannie's stamp of approval made shunned \n     borrowers and complex loans more acceptable to other lenders, \n     particularly small and less sophisticated banks.\n\n  James Lockhart supported this conclusion in his testimony before the \nFinancial Crisis Inquiry Commission on April 9 of this year when he \nobserved that the GSEs:\n\n       . . . indirectly encouraged lower standards by purchasing \n     private label securities. They also encouraged lower \n     standards by not aggressively pursuing the obligations to \n     repurchase mortgages if they did not comply with the \n     enterprises' underwriting requirements.\n\n  Madam President, during the debate on this bill before us, we have \nheard numerous times that we need to have a tighter grip on Wall Street \nto prevent those large Wall Street firms from harming small businesses \non Main Street.\n  If only my Democratic colleagues had been less concerned with Wall \nStreet's reaction in 2004 and 2005, perhaps we could have protected not \nonly those less sophisticated smaller banks on Main Street but also the \nmillions of consumers caught up in the resulting inflated housing \nmarket and the millions of taxpayers who have had to foot the bill for \nthe resulting debacle. Instead, the stalling of this legislation by \nDemocrats at that time ended any attempts of meaningful GSE reform \nuntil mid-2008, when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were already in serious \ntrouble.\n  The simple truth is that we didn't act when we could have effected \nreal change. Republicans were ready to enact real reform and--\nunfortunately for the taxpayer--Democrats were not. Let's not make the \nsame mistake again here today.\n  The McCain-Shelby-Gregg GSE amendment takes several important steps \nto reform the GSEs. It provides transparency to the conservatorships of \nthe GSEs by establishing much needed investigative oversight. It also \nrequires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be included in the Federal \nbudget as long as they are in conservatorship or receivership status. \nIt reestablishes taxpayer protections that were abolished by the Obama \nadministration last Christmas Eve, and it requires that Congress be \ninvolved in any decision to spend additional resources to stabilize the \nhousing markets. Finally, it establishes a definite end to the ongoing \nconservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and paves a responsible \npath forward by refocusing their efforts, installing proper safeguards, \nand untangling the U.S. taxpayer from this mess.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues to ignore Wall Street and the special \ninterests lobbying against this amendment. Join the Republicans in \ndoing something good for the American taxpayer--support the McCain-\nShelby-Gregg amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the only \ndebate remaining on the pending Dodd and McCain amendments be 20 \nminutes, with 10 minutes accorded to each amendment; that upon the use \nor yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \nDodd amendment No. 3938, to be followed by a vote in relation to the \nMcCain amendment No. 3839, with no amendment in order to either \namendment prior to the vote; further, that upon disposition of the \namendments described above and as if in executive session, the Senate \nproceed to executive session and proceed to vote on confirmation of the \nfollowing nominations in the order listed: Executive Calendar No. 704 \nand 729; that upon confirmation, the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, any statements relating to the \nnominees be printed in the Record, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession; that after the first vote in this sequence, the remaining \nvotes be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Well, Madam President, let me now proceed with my time. I \nknow my colleague from Arizona will come over to be heard.\n  Let me emphasize again to my colleagues that the McCain amendment is \nopposed by the National Association of Realtors, the homebuilders, and \nthe credit unions for the simple reason that the amendment doesn't do \nanything except end Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That is hardly reform. \nIt replaces it with nothing, so we end up in a free fall in this \ncountry when it comes to providing affordable mortgages for middle-\nincome families.\n  Granted, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac need to be reformed, and the \namendment we will vote on first off--that I will be proposing--in fact \nrequires that the administration, by January, submit a specific plan \nthat would call for how to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and what \nto replace it with in a housing financing system. Not to have a housing \nfinancing system, just to leave us without one altogether, as we would \nachieve with the McCain amendment, just eliminating Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac with no replacement within the year, is hardly what we need \nto do at this time.\n  We have been through a lot. This problem began in the housing market, \nin an unregulated segment of our economy. For years, the previous \nadministration and others advocated a totally unregulated market. \nBecause of those attitudes, we ended up where we did--with brokers and \nmortgage companies that were providing mortgages to people without any \ndocumentation, without any underwriting standards whatsoever, and we \nended up, of course, with 7 million homes lost, 4 million underwater \ntoday, and 250,000 seized just in the last number of months, since the \noutset of this year.\n  The McCain amendment would actually leave us in a very fragile \nsituation, and that is the point the homebuilders, the realtors, and \nthe credit unions are making in their strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  Our amendment lays out a timeframe in which the administration would \nhave to submit a specific set of plans so we could then, in the next \nCongress, move forward.\n  As my colleague from New Hampshire has pointed out, the issue of \nreplacing and coming up with an alternative housing finance system is \nvery complex. There are a lot of different ideas out there about which \nplan ought to replace the one we have working today. Obviously that is \nsomething the Congress will have to consider.\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\n  I mentioned earlier Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHA together \naccount for 96.5 percent of the funding for mortgages today. The McCain \namendment would undermine this supply without establishing a reasonable \nalternative. It is irresponsible public policy at a very uncertain \ntime. As Senator Gregg said earlier, on the debate in the Wall Street \nreform bill the GSE issue is ``too complex to do in this bill.''\n  The McCain amendment would require the Federal Housing Finance Agency \nto either end the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie or disband \nthem, put them into receivership within 2 years. That is all. The \namendment poses no alternative to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It would \ntotally privatize the mortgage market other than FHA.\n  We have had some experience with how the housing market behaves when \nit is completely privatized. It is called subprime and exotic mortgage \nmarkets. As we know, it was this unregulated market, fanned by Wall \nStreet, that pushed out those irresponsible mortgages that they knew \npeople could not afford which led to our current problems. With a still \nfragile housing market in dangerous times, the McCain amendment would \npush us back into this downward spiral.\n  The amendment would do the following. It results in an increase in \nmortgage rates for home buyers and homeowners. Try to explain that as \nyou go back to your States, if this amendment were adopted. It reduces \nthe availability of mortgage credit in communities across our country, \nincluding communities with relatively low-cost housing. This would \nresult in reductions in existing housing values at a time when the \nhousing market is just starting to recover some value.\n  Further, this amendment would reduce the availability of mortgage \ncredit to first-time home buyers, to low- and moderate-income families \nseeking to buy or refinance a home by eliminating housing goals. It \ngoes on by delaying or to put home ownership out of reach to many \nfamilies. It raises the minimum downpayment requirements to 10 percent. \nA minimum 10 percent for families starting out, with better \nunderwriting standards, that kind of criterion excludes a lot of young \nfamilies starting out who wish to buy their first home. It reduces the \navailability of mortgage credit for affordable rental housing by \neliminating the housing goals, and it undermines the efforts to get \nloan modifications and affordable refinances to homeowners trying to \nsave their homes.\n  Last, it results in the potential elimination of a 30-year fixed rate \nprepayable mortgage.\n  This last point is something I do not think most Americans are aware \nof. We are the only country in the world that provides a 30-year fixed \nrate mortgage for families. That is the source of wealth creation for \nmost Americans. It is not buying stocks on Wall Street or getting \ninvolved in fancy credit default swaps and over-the-counter derivatives \nand all of this casino gambling that goes on. Average Americans \naccumulate wealth when they can afford to buy a home and hold on to \nthat property, watching equity increase. That equity provides a source \nof income for retirement years, helps provide for the college education \nof their kids, and equity in a neighborhood provides stability for that \nneighborhood and strengthens communities. If you eliminate the 30-year \nfixed rate mortgage, you have dealt a huge blow to working families in \nthis country. I do not think we want to look like Europe when it comes \nto home mortgages, and that is how we will end up if the McCain \namendment is adopted.\n  For all of those reasons, as I said, homebuilders, realtors, and \ncredit unions oppose this amendment.\n  Reform of the GSEs--everyone agrees we need to make that reform. \nHowever, the homebuilders say in their letter to Senator McCain:\n\n     . . . we remain concerned about how to get from the current \n     structure to future arrangements without . . . disrupting the \n     operation of the overall housing finance system. Any changes \n     should be undertaken with care. . . .\n\n  I agree. We should keep in mind that the Congress created a strong \nnew regulatory regime for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008. Their \nregulator is maintaining strong oversight of these enterprises, while \nthey continue to provide crucial assistance to the housing market.\n  Longer term reform of Fannie and Freddie would require a thoughtful \nreconsideration of the structure of the whole housing finance system. \nThis will require hearings about exactly what structure we want to put \nin place to finance housing in this country. This will require hearings \nwith many stakeholders and others involved in the serious discussions \nto determine what that system ought to be.\n  To wipe out the present system--I have to tell you a quick story. It \nmay seem unrelated to the subject at hand.\n  Many years ago, when I was the ripe old age of 22, I was a Peace \nCorps volunteer in the Dominican Republic and I went to one of the \nmountain villages near the border of Haiti and I asked the people what \nthey thought their needs were. They said, What do you think we need to \ndo, of this young American. I looked over at the old schoolhouse they \nhad, one room, made of palm wood with a dirt floor. I said I think you \nneed a new school. They said that is a pretty good idea. We agree with \nyou. What should we do first? I said, first tear down the old school.\n  It was my first project. For the next 2 years they had no school in \ntown. It took that long. We didn't know where to build the school. We \ndidn't know where the property was, we didn't have the materials, so we \ngathered in people's homes to become the school. In effect, that is \nwhat the McCain amendment is going to do.\n  I made a mistake at age 22. Before deciding to build what you are \ngoing to have, don't tear down what you have without knowing what you \nare going to replace it with. Eventually we got a school built in that \ntown, but they went through a rough 2 years because this young American \ndidn't understand that while the old school wasn't great and it was in \ndesperate need of repair, tearing it down and leaving them with no \nschool left that little community without the ability to have a decent \nplace to house and teach their kids. That analogy applies here because \nwhat the McCain amendment does is tear down without building anything \nin its place.\n  Again, I will take a back seat to no one. Democrats should have done \na better job. Republicans--I listen to my colleague from Alabama talk \nabout the history of Fannie and Freddie. Believe me, I have an \nalternative history. But we can go back and forth on that endlessly. \nLet's suffice to say this: We all should have done a better job at this \nand finger pointing doesn't get us anywhere. We are not in the business \nof trying to rewrite history today, we are trying to see to how best to \nensure the coming generation will never have to go through what this \ngeneration has. What we are offering here is a specific idea of how to \nget us to that new plan of housing finance. You don't get there by \neliminating what we have today and putting everything else at risk as a \nresult of what is included in this amendment.\n  Under our amendment, the Treasury specifically is told not ``may'' \nbut it ``shall'' do following things: Come up and tell us how we are \ngoing to wind down and liquidate Fannie and Freddie; the privatization \nof the two GSEs; the breakup of the GSEs into small companies; and \nother options that may be available.\n  This is a tough study. This isn't one to kind of paint this over; it \ndemands a report back, ``shall,'' how specifically we can do this in a \ntime certain. It is not perfect. I wish I had some magical reform to \noffer everyone today.\n  We have looked at this for weeks and months and there is a \nsignificant debate over what that housing financing system ought to be. \nI can't tell you with any certainty what is the best idea at this \njuncture. I know this much, to tear down what we have and replace it \nwith nothing would be the height of irresponsibility. It would put our \ncountry's economy into a tailspin, in my view, at the very time we are \nbeginning to come out of our difficulties--290,000 new jobs created in \nthe last month alone. In the last previous months, 121,000 more than we \nanticipated. Housing starts are picking up, values are picking up \nagain. Why at this very hour would we step back?\n  For all those reasons, I say respectfully, the McCain amendment I \nhope will be rejected by our colleagues and our substitute amendment \nwill be supported.\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have been around this body for a long \ntime. I have seen the side-by-sides. This is one of the classics that \nwe have seen time after time. If you don't like a tough amendment, then \nhave one that requires a study. Let's study the problem. And the \npurpose of this amendment as stated, and I quote from the amendment:\n\n       To require the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a study \n     on ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \n     and reforming the housing finance system.\n\n  Reforming the housing finance system--I thought reforming the housing \nfinance system was part of the deal here. I had no idea we were not \ngoing to reform the housing finance system when we advertised this \nlegislation to the American people as to assure them that there would \nnever be another financial meltdown which was caused by the housing \nfinance system.\n  What does the side-by-side amendment do? It will require the \nSecretary of Treasury to conduct a study. Do you mean to tell me the \nSecretary of Treasury, after the greatest financial meltdown in history \nsince the Great Depression, has to conduct a study? He has to conduct a \nstudy to figure out why we have just spent $145 billion, lifted the \n$400 billion cap at 7 p.m. on Christmas Eve? The system cries out for \nreform now. As is stated by literally every expert in America, it was \nthe housing meltdown, abetted by the enablers Fannie and Freddie, that \ncaused the financial meltdown. So we are doing nothing about it except \nasking the Secretary of Treasury to conduct a study. Remarkable. \nRemarkable.\n  Again I want to quote from the Wall Street Journal that says it well \nenough. It says:\n\n       This action confirms the decade-long congressional failure \n     to more closely regulate these two government-sponsored \n     enterprises will rank for U.S. taxpayers as one of the worst \n     policy disasters in our history.\n\n  One of the worst policy disasters in our history, and we are doing \nnothing about it except conduct a study. That ought to do it.\n  I am not calling for the abolition of Fannie and Freddie. I am \ncalling for them to stop being in the government trough. I am saying \nthat Fannie and Freddie ought to be doing their job in competition with \neverybody else who finances home loan mortgages in America. The history \nof these organizations is replete with enabling by the Congress of the \nUnited States--including, by the way, incredible compensation for the \nso-called people who were supervising these organizations as they went \ninto the tank--one of them $93 million for a year or two of supervising \ngoing farther and farther into toxic assets.\n  All I can say is if we pass this legislation without this amendment, \ndo not look the American people in the eye and say we have reformed the \nfinancial system in America. Do not look the American people in the eye \nand say we will never again have a financial collapse in this country. \nDo not say we are going to turn off the spigot of Federal tax dollars--\nalready $145 billion.\n  Why did the Treasury lift the cap of $400 billion that we were going \nto spend to help with these toxic assets of Fannie and Freddie if they \ndidn't think it was going to be more than $400 billion?\n  So what are we doing in response? Sitting by and watching hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of the taxpayers' money being used to bail out \nthese two government-sponsored enterprises to the great cost of the \nAmerican taxpayer. Again I say to my colleagues: Don't wonder why the \nAmerican people are fed up. Don't wonder why the American people are in \nvirtual peaceful revolt, when we continue to pour good money after bad, \nto the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, without reforming the \ninstitutions that caused it. We are not fulfilling our responsibilities \nto the American taxpayers.\n  I am asking my colleagues, don't vote for another study. If you are \ngoing to vote against my amendment, fine, but let's not continue this \ncharade and vote for another study.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alabama what time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, earlier today in the Senate I spoke about \nthe past actions or, rather, inactions of this body that led us to the \ncurrent situation with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I now will take just \na few minutes to discuss the current status of these institutions as \nSenator McCain has mentioned. I will also explain the specifics of the \nMcCain-Shelby-Gregg amendment and why I believe we must adopt it.\n  Since September of 2008, we have had to spend more than $150 billion \nto bail out these GSEs. By some estimates, this amount exceeds the \ntotal cost of the savings and loan bailouts that occurred in the late \n1980s and early 1990s. Let me repeat that. Bailing out the GSEs has now \ncost as much or more than the entire savings and loan crisis, and it is \ncontinuing.\n  Having spent such considerable amounts of taxpayer dollars, one would \nthink that the GSEs would be topic No. 1 as we consider financial \nreform. Unfortunately, that is not the case. As recently reported by \nGretchen Morgenson, a Pulitzer Prize writer of the New York Times:\n\n       Freddie [has] warned that its credit losses were likely to \n     continue rising throughout 2010.\n\n  Even more troubling, while the GSEs have considerable legacy problems \nassociated with the older loans in their portfolios, they are being \nused by the Obama Administration to take on additional risks.\n  On Christmas Day of last year, the Obama administration announced it \nwould relax important taxpayer protections at GSEs, and it would prop \nthem up with unlimited taxpayer funding. That is exactly what they are \ndoing today.\n  The administration took this step so it would have the flexibility to \ncontinue its efforts to support the housing market. Some now are \nquestioning those efforts. In the New York Times piece I mentioned, Ms. \nMorgenson quotes Dean Baker, codirector of the Center for Economic and \nPolicy Research, who noted:\n\n       I do not understand why people are not talking about it \n     [referring to Freddie's losses] . . . it seems to me the most \n     fundamental question is, have they on an ongoing basis been \n     paying too much for loans ever since they went into \n     conservatorship?\n\n  This begs the question of why the GSEs would overpay at this point. \nWhat is to be gained? Ms. Morgenson posits a rather compelling theory:\n\n       Mr. Baker's concern that Freddie may be racking up losses \n     by overpaying for mortgages derives from his suspicion that \n     the government might be encouraging it to do so as a way to \n     bolster the operations of mortgage lenders.\n\n  I hope not. In the past, those huge piles of money that have \nconsistently been spent found their way into the pockets of Democratic \noperatives such as Frank Raines, Jim Johnson, Jamie Gorelick, Tim \nHoward, and President Obama's Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel. Now similar \npiles are floating around, not necessarily to Democrats but certainly \non behalf of their pet initiatives.\n  The only constant in either scenario has been the taxpayer has been \nstuck with footing the bill. I believe this afternoon this must end. It \nis finally time to protect the taxpayer. The McCain-Shelby-Gregg \namendment will do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. All time has expired, I hope.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I think it is safe to say we can yield back our time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing \nto the Dodd amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If I could just interject, I believe Senator Bennet, after \nthe judges, would be prepared to speak for about 10 minutes on his \namendment, and then we could have a voice vote on that amendment. We do \nnot even need a recorded vote on that amendment. It is a bipartisan \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right, and then Senator Corker and Senator Merkley and \na vote.\n  Mr. DODD. And 30 minutes equally divided, I think we are talking \nabout, for both amendments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. If we could do the judges now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, this week, the President nominated Elena \nKagan to the Supreme Court. I trust that her nomination will be treated \nbetter than President Obama's other judicial nominations, including \nthese. President Obama nominated Jon DeGuilio to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy in Indiana last year. He was unanimously reported by \nthe bipartisan membership of the Senate Judiciary Committee in early \nMarch. His nomination has been held hostage for 2 months. President \nObama nominated Judge Timothy Black last January, and he was reported \nunanimously in early February. His nomination has been held hostage for \n3 months for no good purpose and with no explanation. Republican \nobjection to their consideration has stalled both these nominations. \nNow that they are finally receiving votes, I suspect they will be \nconfirmed unanimously, as have so many of President Obama's \nnominations. So why the delay? Why the weeks and weeks, and months and \nmonths, of obstruction? This obstruction is of nominees that Senate \nRepublicans support. This is wrong. I have called for it to end, but \nthe Republican Senate leadership persists in this practice.\n  By this date in President Bush's first term, 56 of President Bush's \njudicial nominations had been confirmed. Now that President Obama is in \nthe White House, Republicans have allowed votes on only 23 of his \nFederal circuit and district court nominees.\n  The two nominations we consider today, that of Timothy S. Black to \nthe Southern District of Ohio and Jon E. DeGuilio to the Northern \nDistrict of Indiana, should have been considered and confirmed months \nago. Both nominations have the support of Democratic and Republican \nhome State senators. Both received positive ratings from the American \nBar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal judiciary. Both \nwere reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee months ago by voice \nvote, without any dissent--Judge Black on February 11 and Mr. DeGuilio \non March 4.\n  As of today, there are 24 of President Obama's judicial nominations \nfavorably reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee stalled on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar. The Senate has confirmed only 23, even \nthough these nominations were reported as far back as November. Even \nafter the Senate acts today, there will be 22 judicial nominees still \npending, and 16 of those\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\nnominations were reported without a single negative vote. These should \nbe easy for the Senate to consider in a timely manner and confirm. Yet \nRepublicans continue to stall.\n  The majority leader has had to file cloture petitions to cut off the \nRepublican stalling by filibuster on President Obama's nominees 22 \ntimes. Four times he has had to file cloture to proceed with judicial \nnominees, only to eventually see those nominees confirmed, two which \nwere confirmed unanimously. This stalling and obstruction is wrong.\n  We should be doing the business of the American people, like reining \nin the abuses on Wall Street, rather than having to waste weeks and \nmonths considering nominations that should be easily confirmed. Several \nSenators have gone to the floor in recent weeks and have been outspoken \nabout these delays and secret holds on judicial nominations, as well as \nscores of other Presidential nominations on which the Republican \nminority refuses to act. Regrettably, Republicans have objected to live \nrequests for action on these nominations. They have also refused to \nidentify who is objecting and the reasons for the objections, in \naccordance with the Senate rules.\n  The action of the Republican minority to place politics ahead of \nconstitutional duty by refusing to adhere to the Senate's tradition of \nquickly considering noncontroversial nominees reminds me of the 1996 \nsession when the Republican majority considered only 17 of President \nClinton's judicial nominations. That was a low point I thought would \nnot be repeated. Their failing to fill judicial vacancies led to rebuke \nby Chief Justice Rehnquist. But they are repeating this unfortunate \nhistory today, again allowing vacancies to skyrocket to over a 100, \nmore than 40 of which have been declared ``judicial emergencies'' by \nthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n  Despite the fact that President Obama began sending judicial \nnominations to the Senate 2 months earlier than President Bush, the \nSenate is far behind the pace we set during the Bush administration. As \nI noted earlier, by this date in George W. Bush's Presidency, the \nSenate had confirmed 56 Federal circuit and district court judges. In \nthe second half of 2001 and through 2002, the Senate with a Democratic \nmajority confirmed 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees. Given \nRepublican delay and obstruction, this Senate may not achieve half of \nthat. Last year the Senate was allowed to confirm only 12 Federal \ncircuit and district court judges all year. That was the lowest total \nin more than 50 years. So far this year, despite two dozen nominations \non the Executive Calendar, we have confirmed only 11 more.\n  The Republican pattern of obstructionism we have seen since President \nObama took office has led to this unprecedented backlog in nominations \non the Senate calendar awaiting final consideration. We should end the \nbacklog by restoring the Senate's tradition of moving promptly to \nconsider noncontroversial nominees with up-or-down votes in a matter of \ndays, not weeks and certainly not months. For those nominees \nRepublicans wish to debate, they should come to time agreement to have \nthose debates and votes. It is past time to end the destructive \ndelaying tactics of stalling nominees for no good purpose.\n  The confirmation of the two nominations we consider today is long \noverdue.\n  Judge Black has served the Southern District of Ohio for 6 years as a \nFederal magistrate judge. Before that, he spent a decade as a municipal \ncourt judge, and he also had a long career as a civil litigator. His \nnomination has the support of both of his home State senators, Senator \nGeorge Voinovich and Senator Sherrod Brown, one a Republican and one a \nDemocrat.\n  Mr. DeGuilio served the Northern District of Indiana for 6 years as \nits U.S. attorney. In addition, he has more than a decade of experience \nas a lawyer in private practice, and he also worked as a local \nprosecutor. He has the support of both of his home State senators, \nSenator Richard Lugar and Senator Evan Bayh, one a Republican and one a \nDemocrat.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmations \ntoday. I urge the Republican leadership to restore the Senate's \ntradition practice and agree to prompt consideration of the additional \n22 judicial nominees they continue to stall.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I am here today to express my \nunqualified support for the confirmation of Judge Timothy Black to be \nU.S. district judge for the Southern District of Ohio.\n  I am proud to say that I worked closely with my fellow Ohioan, \nSenator Voinovich, to establish a bipartisan selection process that \nresulted in the selection of Judge Black as a candidate for submission \nto the President.\n  I would like to thank the members of the Southern District Judicial \nAdvisory Commission, particularly Mr. Paul Harris, Chair, for all their \nefforts in vetting numerous candidates for the nomination.\n  Of all the candidates reviewed for this vacancy, the commission was \nmost impressed with Judge Black. The commission recognized his \nleadership, his commitment to legal excellence, and temperament as \nqualities that make Judge Black well-suited to serve in this capacity.\n  Judge Black has served the Southern District of Ohio with excellence \nfor 6 years as a Federal magistrate judge. Before that, he spent a \ndecade as a municipal court judge, and he also had a long career as a \ncivil litigator.\n  In addition to his commitment to the legal profession, Judge Black \nhas exemplified a commitment to service through his work as a \ncoconvener of the Round Table, a partnership between the Black Lawyers \nAssociation of Cincinnati and the Cincinnati Bar Association to improve \ndiversity and inclusion in the legal profession.\n  Additionally, his valiant efforts as vice president and member of the \nboard of ProKids, an organization that represents abused and neglected \nchildren--Judge Black's service extends beyond the judges chamber and \ninto neighborhoods and communities in which he lives and works.\n  President Obama nominated Judge Black last year, stating that he has \nthe ``evenhandedness, intellect, and spirit of service that Americans \nexpect and deserve from their federal judges.''\n  Judge Black is more than ready to serve and should be confirmed \nwithout delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the nominations?\n  If not, the question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the \nnominations of Timothy S. Black, of Ohio, to be United States District \nJudge for the Southern District of Ohio, and Jon E. DeGuilio, of \nIndiana, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof Indiana?\n  The nominations were confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motions to \nreconsider are considered made and laid upon the table, the President \nwill be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate \nwill resume legislative session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/11/senate-section/article/S3510-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nchairman, after the Corker amendment is disposed of, is it possible to \nbring up the Klobuchar-Hutchison amendment and have a debate and vote \ntomorrow?\n  Mr. DODD. After the side-by-side on Senators Corker and Merkley--\nafter that, I would be happy to set a time and either debate this \nevening and vote in the morning, however the Senators want to do it.\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

I am worried about an obligation that we all have this \nevening. We are getting pressed. I want to be careful about asking \nMembers to hang around when we all have an obligation--100 of us. I \nsuggest that we enter into an agreement if we can. I am hopeful this \ncan be worked out. There may be a side-by-side. I would be agreeable to \nsetting a time certain tonight--preferably tomorrow, with debate \ntonight and a vote in the morning--maybe an hour after we come in, or a \nhalf hour after we come in. We will have to make sure the leadership is \nfine with that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we could certainly have 30 minutes \nequally divided on the Hutchison-Klobuchar amendment, and we can agree \nto vote 30 minutes after we come in, whatever time that is.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I will reserve 2 minutes for Senator \nTester out of my time.\n  As I mentioned earlier this week, we have an important opportunity to \nsafeguard our economy from the conditions that drove our country into \nthis catastrophic financial meltdown.\n  The Wall Street reform bill we have before us takes critically \nimportant steps forward, helping to stabilize and safeguard our \nfinancial institutions, our financial system for consumers and \nbusinesses alike.

Mr. President, my amendment is based on bipartisan \nlegislation I introduced earlier this Congress called the Pay It Back \nAct. I was greatly encouraged at that time by the broad bipartisan \nsupport in this body for winding down the TARP, getting serious about \ndeficit reduction, and spurring our economy back to health.\n  As I talk with Coloradans all across my State, I hear the same \nconcerns again and again. People are deeply concerned and worried about \nthe economy. They worry about jobs and they worry about our rising \nFederal deficit. But mostly they just want a fair shake--a chance to \nachieve their own vision of success through hard work.\n  That is why they don't understand the behavior of some of our largest \nfinancial institutions. They don't understand how these behemoths could \nhave made bad bets, lose billions of dollars, and then be bailed out by \nthe Federal Government. That doesn't make sense to most people in \nColorado, and it certainly doesn't make sense to anybody running a \nbusiness.\n  This pay it back amendment takes a big step forward in our efforts to \nwind down and eventually end the TARP. It prevents further government \nspending, recaptures taxpayers' investments in financial institutions, \nand ensures that repaid funds are used for deficit reduction.\n  It does this in a couple of ways. First, it reduces the TARP's \nauthority by about $150 billion, which will ensure that unused TARP \nfunds are not used for new government spending.\n  Chairman Dodd's bill sends a strong message to Wall Street and our \nbroader markets that there is no longer an implicit guarantee of \ngovernment support for excessive and sloppy risk taking. This amendment \nreinforces this important principle by reducing TARP's authority. In \nshort, it begins to wind down the TARP and ensures that the government \ndoesn't use the excess funding for new spending initiatives. It is a \ncommonsense way forward for a program whose time has come and \nthankfully is almost gone.\n  But that is not enough. As we wind down TARP, we need to make sure \nthat taxpayers realize a fair return on their investment. That is why \nthe second element of the Pay It Back Act amendment is that it takes \ncaptured, repaid TARP funds and applies them to deficit reduction. It \ndoes it by severely restricting TARP's revolving door of credit.\n  Although some companies have already repaid the money they received, \nTARP currently allows the Treasury to keep $700 billion ``outstanding \nat any one time.''\n  Let me make this clear. The Treasury has already received about $180 \nbillion in repaid funds from banks that are now in a position to repay \nthe taxpayers. But right now, Treasury can turn around and lend that \nsame money to some other financial institution. It can use our money \nagain and again. And since the TARP money is borrowed against our kids' \nand grandkids' futures, that is using their money again and again and \nagain. I can tell you for sure that my daughters don't want to be stuck \nfooting the bill for keeping the TARP around even 1 day longer than we \nhave to. By supporting my amendment, this body can move forcefully \ntoward ending the TARP and restoring fiscal sanity.\n  The amendment also creates a sunset for unused Recovery Act funds. \nAny funds not obligated by the Federal Government by December 31, 2012, \nwill be returned to the Treasury to pay down the national deficit. \nCongress passed the Recovery Act to jolt our struggling economy back to \nlife and help create and save jobs now. Yet, if funds have not been \nused by the end of 2012, can we say they have been used to ease our \ncurrent recession? The taxpayers deserve to see stimulus funds used for \nreal stimulus. If not, they should be used to pay down our debt.\n  The pay it back amendment sets a schedule for getting the government \nout of the business of owning businesses. It lets excessive risk takers \nknow that Washington no longer provides a backstop for greed, \noverleveraging, reckless levels of risk, and irresponsibility. If big \nfinancial institutions want to behave that way, they must know that \nthey do so without the TARP--without money from Main Street--to bail \nthem out any longer.\n  In short, it is time for this assistance to come to a responsible \nend. At the heart of the Wall Street reform bill is an effort to \nprevent future bailouts. So let's start by finally winding down the \nbiggest bailout of them all and making sure taxpayers get the best \npossible return on their money.\n  I thank my colleagues who are cosponsors of the bill, and I ask all \nof my colleagues to support this important amendment. I thank Senator \nDodd and Senator Lincoln and the ranking members of the Banking and \nAgriculture Committees for their hard work to bring Wall Street reform \nto the floor.\n  I know the Senator from Montana wants to take a couple of minutes. I \nwill say this. Americans have been watching the news in Europe this \nweek, and they are seeing what is happening in Greece and the rest of \nEurope. If we don't think that is a canary in the coal mine, we do that \nat our peril. This bill will not solve our deficit and debt problem, \nbut it takes a stand that says we are not going to leave a legacy of \n$12 trillion behind for our kids and grandkids.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of \nSenator Bennet's amendment to begin winding down the Wall Street \nbailout once and for all.\n  I also want to express my appreciation for Senator Bennet's \neffectiveness and stick-to-itiveness in working on this for some time \nand being able to get this through. This is a very important amendment. \nAs Senator Bennet has said, it will not solve our debt problems, but it \nis a step in the right direction. I appreciate his vision and \nleadership.\n  Montanans were disgusted by the reckless actions of big, greedy Wall \nStreet banks that brought this country to the brink of another \nDepression.\n  I voted against both the bailouts of Wall Street and the U.S. auto \nindustry because I thought taxpayers were getting a raw deal. I don't \nbelieve in bailouts.\n  Why? Whether you are a family farmer or a hot-shot executive, the \nopportunity that allows us to fail is the same opportunity that allows \nus to succeed.\n  And America's taxpayers--Main Street small businesses and working \nfamilies--should never have to pay for the sins of Wall Street.\n  That is why I am pleased to join Senator Bennet on this amendment to \nensure that we get the maximum value for the taxpayer dollars spent \nthrough the TARP bailout.\n  I opposed the bailout then and I oppose it now. But at a minimum, we \nshould recapture taxpayer investments and unused Recovery Act funds to \npay down the debt.\n  This amendment not only achieves that but also begins to wind down \nTARP by reducing its authority by over $190 billion. And it prevents \nthe Treasury from redirecting funds for other purposes.\n  The amendment would also establish a sunset for unused Recovery Act \nfunds and improve oversight of unused funds.\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\n  Additionally, it would ensure that the proceeds from taxpayer \ninvestments in Fannie and Freddie are used to pay down the debt.\n  We have a commitment to the American people to spend their hard-\nearned money as wisely as we would spend our own.\n  Our national debt is something both parties have ignored for far too \nlong. How do we get our arms around it?\n  It is going to take smart--and very tough--decisions. It is going to \ntake working together. and it is going to take rebuilding our economy \nby creating jobs and new opportunities, not more taxpayer-funded \nbailouts.\n  This amendment will get things back on track to return taxpayer \ndollars. And to begin paying down the debt that we have inherited.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Bennet for his leadership.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, I commend our colleague from \nColorado for reaching out on this. The amendment is authored by the \nSenator from Colorado, and he has attracted good bipartisan support \nfrom Senators Tester, Isakson, Klobuchar, Begich, LeMieux, Mark Udall, \nand Brown of Massachusetts on how this ought to be done. The substance \nof the amendment is critically important. He worked with Treasury to \nensure that we are responsibly winding down the TARP and getting the \ngovernment out of the business of owning businesses. We can all agree \nwith that, and I commend him for that amendment. It also ensures that \nunused TARP funds are used to pay down the deficit. We have heard a lot \nof talk about fiscal responsibility and watching what is happening in \nEurope and other countries and knowing the fiscal problems of those \nnations are the root cause of a lot of the problems they are going \nthrough today.\n  This amendment actually dedicates these resources to deficit \nreduction. I think all of us applaud his leadership on it.\n  There are signs our economy is recovering. In the last 3 months of \n2010, our economy added roughly 187,000 jobs a month. Last year, it was \n290,000 jobs, which is the largest number in over 4 years. Compare that \nto the first 3 months of 2009 when we were losing 750,000 jobs a month. \nIn the first quarter, the economy grew 3.2 percent, a swing upwards of \nnearly 10 percent in 1 year, something many economists say is largely \ndue to the Recovery Act. Just over a year ago, the economy was \nshrinking about 6 percent on an annual basis.\n  This amendment is tremendously valuable to this bill. We have all had \ndiscussions about it--our colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, \nSenator LeMieux, and Senator Tester. Because of the leadership of Mike \nBennet, he has brought us to this point. I thank him immensely. I thank \nall of our colleagues.\n  I am prepared to do a voice vote, unless someone objects to a voice \nvote on the Bennet amendment, so we can move to finalize how we deal \nwith the Corker amendment and the other issues before us.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We have no objection to the Bennet amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Is there further debate? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3928) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3955 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for a study of the asset-backed securitization \n     process and for residential mortgage underwriting standards.)\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3955.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Corker], for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg, Mr. LeMieux, Mr. Coburn, and Mr. Brown of \n     Massachusetts, proposes an amendment numbered 3955 to \n     amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, my understanding is we have about 30 \nminutes on each side--is that correct--on this amendment--30 minutes on \nthis amendment and 30 minutes on Merkley; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order in effect.\n  Mr. CORKER. I know Senator Isakson, Senator Gregg, and Senator Shelby \nwish to speak on our side.\n  Mr. DODD. Technically, there is no time agreement.\n  Mr. CORKER. I will be very brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nCorker finishes his remarks, Senator Isakson be recognized and then I \nbe recognized. If Senator Shelby wants to be recognized, he should be \nrecognized before Senator Isakson. Senator Shelby should start, then \nSenator Isakson, and then myself.\n  Mr. DODD. If a Member on this side somewhere in the midst of this can \nbe heard as well----\n  Mr. GREGG. That would be totally reasonable.\n  Mr. DODD. That was not a sophisticated request.\n  Mr. CORKER. If we can move along on our side----\n  Mr. DODD. Move along.\n  Mr. CORKER. It sounds like there was no objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the sequence the Senator \nfrom----\n  Mr. CORKER. To restate, Senator Shelby, Senator Isakson, Senator \nGregg, and then anybody else on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, the Dodd bill attempts to deal with \nquarterly liquidation. I know there have been discussions about the \npros and cons. There have been attempts to deal with the derivatives \ntitle. My sense is, before it is all said and done, there is a chance \nthat may work out well. I think we have overly dealt with consumer \nprotection and hope that somehow in this body we will bring that back \ninto balance.\n  This bill glaringly does not deal with some of the core issues of \nthis last crisis. We just voted on GSEs, an amendment that would have \ndealt with that over the next couple of years in a way that does not \nprescribe exactly a solution but makes sure we deal with it. We just \nvoted it down.\n  Even more glaring, the Dodd bill does not deal with the essence of \nwhat created this last crisis. At the base of this crisis--an inverted \npyramid--was the fact that we had a lot of loans that were written that \nshould never have been written. Those loans were done by companies that \nwere leveraged 30, 40, 50 to 1, and then $600 trillion worth of \nnotional value of these loans that should never have been written were \nspread across the world. That, in essence, brought down our financial \nsystem.\n  It seems to me if we are going to do a financial regulation bill, we \nought to at least deal with the core issue, which is very poor \nunderwriting. I have offered an amendment. I know there is going to be \na side-by-side. I might add, the side-by-side--and I want to make sure \nthe people on my side know this--lets the consumer protection agency \ndeal with underwriting, which is pretty incredible to me.\n  It seems to me that what we want to ensure is that the underwriting \nwe do does not undermine the safety and soundness of our financial \ninstitutions and, therefore, should be dealt with by those regulators.\n  This amendment is very simple. It does some things that have been \nvery basic to making our country strong as it relates to residential \nlending. Here is what it does: It establishes that there will be a \nminimum of a 5-percent downpayment. If I was left to my own accord, I \nmight do something more stringent than that. It causes any loan that is \nwritten at above an 85 percent loan to value to have private mortgage \ninsurance. It actually requests the persons's income; that this loan \nhas to be fully documented, including credit history and employment \nhistory. It seems this is something at a minimum in this country we \nwould like to see\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\nhappen as it relates to residential lending.\n  Then there has to be a method for determining the borrower's ability \nto repay--a no-brainer--considering their debt-to-income ratio.\n  Those four simple requirements are put into law so we do not have the \nsame type of underwriting problems we just had with this last episode. \nThis does not apply to the VA. VA is an entitlement, something we have \ngiven to those who serve our country. It does not apply to rural \nhousing. Regulators have to update the standards no less than every 5 \nyears.\n  For those people who may be concerned about organizations such as \nHabitat for Humanity and others that use sweat equity and do not use \nmoney down, this gives the regulators the ability to exempt nonprofits \nthat meet certain criteria on a case-by-case basis. So if there is a \nnonprofit in your community that is involved in allowing people to \ncreate sweat equity for housing, they would not be hurt. This requires \na review of exemptions every 2 years to make sure they are within that \ncriteria and it prohibits an exemption going to organizations that are \nprohibited from receiving Federal funding. We know of some of those. \nThis also requires a study of FHA to make sure their underwriting \nstandards are intact.\n  The way the Dodd bill addresses underwriting, it deals with something \ncalled risk retention on securitizations. I think most people realize \nthat is a flawed model. It has nothing to do with the loans underneath \nthose securities. I think Chairman Dodd is even trying to find a better \nsolution.\n  This bill also strikes the 5-percent retention that most people in \nthis room think is going to actually shut down the securitization \nprocess and make less credit available, especially in the commercial \nareas. This, instead, puts in place a study so we can actually \ndetermine the best way to look at securitizations and know what type of \nrisk retention should be in place.\n  I urge all colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do something that \nis real, that is substantive, that gets at the heart of this issue, \nthat actually causes us to put in law proper underwriting standards. I \ncannot imagine there are many people in America who do not think this, \nat a minimum, ought to be done as part of underwriting home mortgages.\n  I yield time now to the Senator from Alabama, who may not be here. I \ndivert and yield to Senator Isakson from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I \ncommend the Senator from Tennessee who has worked tirelessly for months \non this legislation but in particular has worked tirelessly on this \nparticular amendment.\n  I rise to try and make my point as strongly as I can. This body, I \nknow, always wants to do the right thing. We want to address the \nconcerns that made the market begin to collapse 2 years ago. We want to \nrestore confidence in real estate finance. We want to bring back the \nvibrant housing industry. We do not want to reincarnate subprime loans. \nAnd we ought to do one simple thing today: We ought to learn from \nhistory. I want to give everybody a small history lesson.\n  The underlying bill answers the question of better underwriting by \nputting risk retention as a requirement on a newly originated mortgage, \na risk retention of 5 percent. The tier 1 minimum capital requirement \nof a nationally chartered bank is 8 percent. You are going to tell me \nthe banks of America are going to reserve another 5 percent against the \nmortgages they originate? No, they are just not going to originate \nmortgages whatsoever.\n  Secondly, risk retention is no insurance for a better mortgage having \nbeen made. The fact is, in the late 1980s, the American savings and \nloan industry, which was chartered for the purpose of financing \nAmerican homes, went under, and they had a 100-percent risk retention.\n  What causes bad lending is bad underwriting. Risk retention has \nnothing to do with it if you have bad underwriting or, as we had in \nlate 2007, 2008, 2009, no underwriting at all.\n  First of all, Senator Corker's amendment is an outstanding amendment \nthat strikes at the heart of the problem that got us here, while at the \nsame time according the opportunity for the American finance industry \nto bring back competitive mortgage lending. If it is not FHA and it is \nnot VA and it is not a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loan right now, you \nare not getting one. We do not have people in the market anymore \nbecause they are scared. There is no standard.\n  This brings us back to a standard of underwriting that is right. It \nrecognizes somebody has a job, has an ability to pay, has reasonable \ncredit, and has some skin in the game so they will pay that loan back. \nHistorically, the default rate on the mortgage industry in the United \nStates of America, outside the last 3 years, was around 1.2 percent to \n1.4 percent--very little; in fact, probably the highest best risk \ninvestment an investor could make.\n  What happened was, when underwriting failed and we got into exotic \ninstruments, when Congress told Freddie and Fannie to make affordable \nloans and they created market subprime loans, the genie got out of the \nbottle and everything failed.\n  I want to say to the body, if we let this bill pass with risk \nretention in it thinking we have done something, the only thing we will \nhave accomplished is a total absence of mortgage money for the American \nhome buyer and American real estate industry. That is a bad mistake.\n  Facts are stubborn things. If a guy has a job, makes a downpayment, \nhe will repay his loan. If he does not, he might not.\n  Let's get back to the roots that got us to where we are as a great \ncountry. Let's restore home ownership and ability to finance it, but \nlet's recognize the weakness was in underwriting. It was not in the \nretained risk of the originator.\n  I commend Senator Corker, Senator Shelby, Senator Gregg, Senator \nLeMieux, and the others who have worked on this issue. If this \namendment fails, then this entire legislation fails in meeting the \nstandard it set upon itself. That would be a tragedy and a mistake for \nthe United States of America.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to join in congratulating Senator \nCorker, Senator Isakson, Senator Shelby, and others who have come \ntogether around this issue of better underwriting standards.\n  It is hard for me to understand why this would be resisted in this \nbill because this has been outlined both by Senator Corker and by \nSenator Isakson. It was underwriting that created the problems which \nled our Nation to the brink of a fiscal collapse.\n  The way I have described it is this: What we had was an inverted \npyramid. We had this situation where an individual made a loan to \nanother individual or a corporation made a loan to an individual based \non the value of a piece of property. Unfortunately, when that loan was \nmade, it was made in a way where nobody looked at the value of the \nproperty relative to the loan and nobody looked at whether the person \nwho was getting the loan could pay it back because the system no longer \nhad strong underwriting standards.\n  Then that loan was taken and it was syndicated, it was securitized, \nit was synthesized, and it became multiplied, as the Senator from \nTennessee said, into $600 trillion of notional value. We ended up with \nthis huge pyramid of debt built on the basis of this loan down here at \nthe bottom between this corporation and this individual, this loan \nwhich was based on value which was not there, and ability to repay, \nwhich was not there once the rates of the loan were reset.\n  Why did this happen? Why was this loan so inappropriately made? It \nwas inappropriately made because we had a breakdown in underwriting \nstandards. I have been through three of these events in my professional \ncareer: once in the late seventies when I was involved in representing \na bank in New Hampshire, once in the late eighties when I was Governor \nof New Hampshire, and now. Three major financial disruptions which were \ncreated almost entirely by a failure in underwriting standards, where \npeople were making\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\nloans that couldn't be paid back based on asset value which wasn't \nthere. It just was aggravated radically this time because of the way \nthe system suddenly took these loans and exploded them through the \nsecuritization process and the syndication process.\n\n  So if you are going to fix this problem, if you are going to put in \nplace a regulatory reform system which actually fixes the issues which \ncaused the crisis, you have to address underwriting standards. That is \nwhy the Corker amendment is so critical, because this bill does not \naddress underwriting standards in any other way, in any significant \nmanner. So if you are going to have a legitimate effort to try to make \nsure this type of an event doesn't occur again, you have to put in \nplace underwriting standards which establish the rules of the road, \nwhich say that in the future America will not allow this sort of \nproliferation of lending which is not properly secured, where we know \nthat the person getting the loan can't repay the obligation. \nIronically, in this situation, these loans were made, in some \ninstances, with the full understanding that this wouldn't happen, that \nthey couldn't repay and the value wasn't there. Why? Because we \nseparated underwriting standards from the process of actually making \nthe loan. The people making loans were only interested in making a fee. \nThey were not interested in making sure there was value of the \nsecurity. They weren't interested in making sure the people could \nrepay. They were just interested in the fee.\n  This should stop. The language Senator Corker has put before us would \naccomplish that. It would put in place not unusual underwriting \nstandards, not new underwriting standards, it would simply go back \nessentially to the types of standards--and they are not quite as \nstrict, honestly--we had at a prior time when we didn't have this kind \nof risk in the marketplace because people knew when they borrowed money \nto buy a house they were going to have to put money down, and if they \ndidn't put the full amount of the value down, they would have to have \ninsurance to cover the difference. They knew their creditworthiness was \ngoing to be checked, and thoroughly checked, and their ability to pay \nthe loan was going to be checked. So it is a totally reasonable \napproach.\n  If you are going to do one thing in this bill to avoid a future event \nlike the one we confronted in late 2008 where basically the entire \nfinancial industry of this country almost melted down, if you are going \nto do one thing to prevent that event, you should adopt the Corker \namendment. This should be a bipartisan amendment. I don't understand \nany opposition to it. I don't understand the concept which would oppose \nit because it is basically good banking and good lending. It is also \ngood for the people who borrow money because they are not going to get \nmoney just arbitrarily but only if they have the value in the asset \nthey are borrowing on and if they have the ability to repay. So I \ncertainly hope this amendment will be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise specifically to support the \nimportant steps the Corker amendment takes to establish sound \nunderwriting standards for mortgages. If there is any clear message \nfrom the crisis we have been through, it is that much of what went \nwrong began when loans were made to individuals who couldn't repay \nthem.\n  The Corker amendment makes commonsense changes. It requires minimum \ndownpayments on mortgages, which makes it more likely that borrowers \nremain committed to paying their mortgages. It requires, among other \nthings, that lenders verify a borrower's income and their ability to \nrepay these loans. These might sound simple, but remarkably they have \nbeen overlooked by the Dodd bill. In the past, they have worked. We \nused to not have these kinds of problems. The Corker amendment, if we \nadopt this--and I urge my colleagues to vote for it--will go a long way \nin taking the right steps to bring common sense to our mortgage market.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, how much time remains of our 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CORKER. I yield a few minutes, if I could, to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate my colleague from \nTennessee on his amendment, and I rise in support of it.\n  In Florida, we know this was the very problem that started this whole \ncrisis. We called them NINJO loans--no income, no job. Underwriting \nstandards went out the window because of the hunger of Wall Street to \nsuck up these mortgages, to bundle them into these large securitized \npackages and then sell them off. So as Wall Street demanded more and \nmore, underwriting went out the window. And what does the bank or the \nmortgage broker care if they can just ship off their mortgage and sell \nit off to Wall Street? What do they care if the person they are giving \nthe mortgage to can't pay it back? What do they care if that person \ncan't afford the home to start with? So we got ourselves into this \nperfect storm of a situation, and one of the key elements that allowed \nthis to happen was the fact that there weren't underwriting standards.\n  When I bought my first home back in 1995, I didn't have 20 percent to \nput down; I had 15 percent. So I had to get mortgage insurance to cover \nthe other 5 percent of my downpayment. Until such time as my family--my \nwife and I at the time, before we had any of our kids--could make a \npayoff to get the 20 percent of equity value to the loan, we had to pay \nfor the mortgage insurance. Once we did, we no longer had to pay for \nthat.\n  Well, in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, that went out the \nwindow. No longer were these underwriting standards in place. We now \nknow, looking back on the debacle that happened in 2008, that one of \nthe key reasons it happened, one of the key things that made it fertile \nfor this problem to grow was the fact that there weren't underwriting \nstandards.\n  What Senator Corker does in his bill is he puts these mortgage \nunderwriting standards back into law the way they were when everything \noperated the right way--a 5-percent downpayment, credit enhancement to \nget you to an 80-percent loan to value, fully documented income, \nincluding credit history and employment history, and a method for \ndetermining the borrower's ability to repay. All those things make \ncommon sense. But that common sense didn't prevail in the mid-2000s.\n  Last year, in an initiative the Wall Street Journal put forward, it \ntalked about the 20 most important things that could be done to avert \nthe financial collapse that happened, and the No. 1 most important \nthing was to strengthen underwriting standards. But this bill we are \nconsidering which is supposed to get at the problems that caused this \nmeltdown in 2008--it is 1,409 pages long--doesn't address perhaps the \nNo. 1 biggest reason we had a financial failure in 2008.\n  Senator Corker, along with Senators Isakson, Shelby, Gregg, and to a \nsmaller extent myself, have worked on this, and I commend my colleague \nfrom Tennessee. There is absolutely no reason not to pass this. If any \nof our colleagues are serious about really reforming our financial \nsystem and preventing this problem from happening again, then they must \nsupport this very fine amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, not seeing other Senators at this time \nwishing to speak, I want to recap, if I could.\n  We spend a year and a half working on financial regulation in this \nbody, and there are a lot of fancy things we are looking at that \ncertainly need to be looked at, no question. We are looking at clearing \ntrades with derivatives. We are looking at all kinds of section 106 \nissues and other kinds of things, many of which I have issues with. But \nit is amazing that after all this time, we are still not dealing with \nthe core issue.\n  It is hard for me to imagine that anybody in this body would think \nthat a 5-percent downpayment on a loan would be something that is \nextraordinary. This puts in place, as the other Senators have \nmentioned--and I certainly appreciate those who have joined me in \ncosponsoring. I have had a couple of folks on the other side of the \naisle today come up and say: Look, this makes common sense. I am going \nto support this. It is amazing to me that we are not focusing on those \nvery things that we think are the core issues.\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\n  We had a chance a minute ago to deal with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \nand, of course, we didn't. I know it is a complex issue, but I felt the \nMcCain amendment gave us a timeframe within which we could deal with \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We didn't. We decided to have another \nstudy.\n  But I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, while \nthere is an unwillingness to deal with the issues over Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac and some of the problems that exist right now within FHFA, \nwhat this amendment would do is to put in place underwriting standards \nthat would at least ensure the mortgages Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are \npurchasing themselves would have proper underwriting standards. I think \nthat is very important.\n  It is amazing that sometimes we will spend a year and a half in this \nbody--a year, 6 months, whatever--on different types of issues, and we \nfocus on lots of things that industry brings us, that other people \nbring us, but we don't get down to just the commonsense core issues \nthat Americans know work.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida and others who have joined in this \neffort to ensure we have appropriate underwriting standards. Again, let \nme just recap. These are not Draconian steps. Basically, Federal \nbanking regulators themselves--the regulators of our financial \ninstitutions--would set criteria for underwriting. There would be a \nminimum of a 5-percent downpayment. Any loan that is above 80 percent \nloan to value would have a credit enhancement--such as has been done \nfor years in the past--of private mortgage insurance. There would be \nfully documented income--I can't imagine anybody in this body not \nthinking that wouldn't be a good idea for people taking out a loan that \nmany people expect to pay off over a 30-year period--including a credit \nhistory and employment history. There would be a method for determining \nthe borrower's ability to repay. This is something the regulators \nthemselves would get together and lay out. It would also include \nconsideration--imagine this--of the debt-to-income ratio--again, just a \nbasic element of lending. This does not apply to VA, where we have made \nguarantees to veterans. It does not apply to rural housing.\n  For those people who may hear from some of the nonprofit \norganizations that I have worked with and some others in this body have \nworked with--I helped create one in Chattanooga in 1986 that helped \nover 10,000 families have decent housing--those types of organizations \nhave the ability to be exempted if they are the types that allow \npeople, through sweat equity and other kinds of things, to have sort of \nskin in the game in other ways. We applaud those efforts and applaud \npeople who go out and volunteer and take care of their fellow citizens \nby helping them have homes, helping people who are less fortunate. I \nknow all of us support that. We go to events where we thank people who \nvolunteer in that way. This amendment does nothing other than allow \nthem to operate as they do through exemptions through our regulators.\n  I know the other side of the aisle, as I mentioned earlier, has tried \nto deal with this issue, and they haven't figured out a way to deal \nwith it yet. I know we have a side-by-side amendment that is coming up, \nand I thank those on the other side of the aisle who have put some \neffort into trying to do this same thing. But this, again, is a \ncommonsense effort. And my guess is that if you laid this out in front \nof most citizens back home in every State we come from, they would say: \nYou know, this is just basic. If you are going to loan money to \nsomeone, these basic underwriting standards ought to be in place.\n  Mr. President, I urge everyone in this body to please at least look \nat this seriously. This is one thing we can do that is tangible, that \nis not a study, that is not putting something off and hoping regulators \nmight do something down the road. This is something tangible that we \ncan do to ensure that the core issue that created this financial crisis \nover the last 24 months is dealt with and that the individual loan that \nis made from a lender to somebody who is borrowing money is done with \nproper underwriting standards in place.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Connecticut is ready to move on \nto the next issue, so I yield the rest of my time, and I thank the \nChair for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3962 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit certain payments to loan originators and to \n require verification by lenders of the ability of consumers to repay \n                                 loans)\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3962, the \nMerkley-Klobuchar amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley), for himself, Ms. \n     Klobuchar, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Brown of \n     Massachusetts, Mr. Begich, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, \n     Mr. Franken, and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3962 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent Senator Kerry, Senator Franken, \nand Senator Levin be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of this \namendment, including Senator Snowe, Senator Scott Brown, and Members on \nboth sides--my colleague, Senator Klobuchar, will be speaking in a \nmoment--Senator Begich, Senator Boxer, as I mentioned, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Franken, and Senator Schumer.\n  I would like to applaud my colleague from Tennessee. Virtually every \nword that Senator Corker stated tonight is an argument for this \namendment that Senator Klobuchar and I are cosponsoring. I will get \ninto the details later because I want to yield time to my colleague \nfrom Minnesota and then my colleague from Connecticut to speak to the \nbill. Then I will offer my remarks.\n  I do think it is important to recognize that the bulk of what Senator \nCorker addressed goes right to the heart of this amendment as well. \nThere is a point of distinction between the two amendments, a critical \npoint of distinction; that is, the 5-percent underwriting absolute \nline. That line is a line of great concern for those of us who have had \nexperience with first-time home buyers, those who have had experience \nwith families who are at the bottom of the income spectrum. I should \nmake it clear that the downpayment is only a portion of the skin in the \ngame that such families have because there are tremendous closing costs \nassociated with these loans that the families must bear as well. So the \ninflexibility of that standard is a great concern and a great point of \ndistinction between these two amendments.\n  I will continue on after my colleagues have spoken to address some of \nthe major challenges this amendment addresses, but I would like to \nyield 5 minutes to Senator Klobuchar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Merkley for his \nleadership on this issue. I was proud to work with him on this issue. I \nthank Chairman Dodd as well for advancing this amendment, for the work \nhe has done in this area. I also want to mention my good colleague in \nthe House, Representative Ellison, who was a leader on this in the \nState legislature in Minnesota and now in Congress. We worked on this \nissue in this bill together.\n  Complex and deceitful lending practices were at the heart of the \nfinancial crisis, and as we work to reform Wall Street we must ensure \nthat the homes and the home equity of Americans are not put at \nunnecessary risk. With 1 in 7 homeowners--1 in 7, who would have ever \nthought that--delinquent on their mortgage or already in foreclosure, \nand many home loans delinquent, the housing market continues to slow \neconomic recovery.\n  It has been estimated that each year predatory mortgage lending \nresults in a loss of $1.9 billion for American families. It is critical \nthat families have access to safe, fair, and affordable mortgages.\n  I see my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, who has seen \nfirsthand in\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\nhis State people losing their homes, people at the mercy of call-lines \nwhere they cannot reach anyone when they are calling for help.\n  Important borrower protections such as those we have in Minnesota \nshould be a national policy to help safeguard families across the \ncountry. A decade ago, just 5 percent of mortgage loan originations \nwere subprime, meaning they were made to borrowers who would not \nqualify for regular mortgages--only 5 percent. By 2005 it was 20 \npercent of mortgages that were subprime. It was a disaster waiting to \nhappen.\n  This expanded home ownership to millions of people, but it also \ngreatly increased the risk to our financial system. In Minnesota, in \n2000 there were 8,347 subprime mortgages issued. By 2005 it had \nincreased more than fivefold to more than 47,000 subprime mortgages. \nHowever, we now know that between 60 and 65 percent of people who ended \nup with subprime mortgages actually qualified for traditional \nmortgages. We need to make sure this never happens again.\n  That is why last year I introduced the Homeowner Fairness Act, which \nis comprehensive housing reform legislation that proposes tough new \nnational standards based on the successes of the Minnesota mortgage \nlending law passed in 2007. That is why I have joined Senator Merkley \non an amendment that will ensure several key ideas from this bill are \nincluded in the Wall Street reform bill.\n  These are not radical ideas. The fact that practices were ever \nallowed to take place should be shocking to those who have not even \nheard about them.\n  First, this amendment would require all mortgage originators to \nverify a borrower has the ability to repay a mortgage before giving \nloan approval. Let me repeat that. This amendment would require \nmortgage originators to verify a borrower has the ability to repay a \nmortgage before they approve the loan. It may just sound like common \nsense that you wouldn't loan someone money without first figuring out \nif they were able to pay, but these lenders never intended to keep the \nloans they originated long enough for it to matter. They simply sold \ntheir risky bets to someone else and put the profits on the bank.\n  Second, this amendment would prohibit a mortgage originator from \nsteering a borrower toward terms that are more expensive than those for \nwhich he can qualify. In recent years, loan originators were often paid \nmore if they got borrowers to take out predatory subprime loans, even \nwhen the borrower qualified for a prime loan. It is important to \nremember that the crisis we are addressing today with this \ncomprehensive Wall Street reform bill was first triggered by the \ndownturn in the national housing market. This downturn brought to light \nthe prevalence of unsound lending practices, especially predatory \nlending tactics in the subprime market.\n  Ultimately, this disregard for underwriting standards spread risk \nthroughout the financial system as these unsound loans were securitized \nand sold, chopped up and sold again. No one had any skin in the game.\n  Although the market for some prime mortgages was less than 1 percent \nof global financial assets, the faults in the system that started with \nunscrupulous origination practices allowed the turmoil in the housing \nmarket to spill over into other sectors. When sound mortgage loans are \nmade they provide families with a piece of the American dream. But when \nloans are made recklessly, without concern for the consumer, these \nloans become nightmares--not just for the families who are left on the \nhook but for our entire economy. We need to make sure those abusive and \nexploitative mortgage practices come to an end.\n  For far too long, subprime lenders have put the homes and home equity \nof Americans at unnecessary risk. These commonsense protections are \nessential to restoring our economy and preventing a future crisis in \nthe housing market.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Merkley-Klobuchar amendment, and I \nyield the floor to my friend and great leader on this issue, Senator \nMerkley of Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Minnesota \nfor the incredibly solid and important work she has done on this topic. \nIt goes right to the heart of building a family's financial \nfoundations. There is a lot of movement that needs to be made to \nrestore a framework that will build those foundations rather than \ndestroy those foundations.\n  I yield to my colleague from Connecticut if he wishes to make remarks \non this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleague from Oregon \nand my colleague from Minnesota as well for their contribution. While \nhe has left the floor, I would be remiss if I did not express my \ngratitude to Bob Corker from Tennessee. Putting aside whatever \ndifferences we may have on this amendment, he has been a very valuable \nmember of our committee.\n  This bill that is right here, all 1400 pages of it--substantial parts \nof this bill can be attributed to the work of Bob Corker of Tennessee. \nI want my colleagues to know how grateful I am to him, to his staff, \nand others for some valuable ideas and thoughts. While not every one \nwas included in the bill, he played a consistent role, showing up every \ntime there was a meeting or gathering on this legislation. He spent a \nlot of hours with our colleague from Virginia, Mark Warner, \nparticularly on titles I and II of this bill. I will say more about \nSenator Corker's contribution during debate on this bill, but I wanted \nat least at the outset of this debate and discussion to thank him for \nhis wonderful efforts on this legislation.\n  Let me begin and thank, of course, Senator Merkley and Senator \nKlobuchar, as well as their other cosponsors of this, for the \nbipartisan support for their amendment. I will ask to have printed in \nthe Record some correspondence. I have a letter we sent out in 2006. It \nwill give you an idea--it was 4 years ago. It was signed by myself, \nWayne Allard, who is no longer with us, of Colorado, Senator Sarbanes, \nJim Bunning of Kentucky, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, and Chuck Schumer.\n  The letter was pushing the regulators to establish some underwriting \nguidance for subprime mortgages. That is in 2006 that we sent that \nfirst letter. We were in the minority, we Democrats.\n  In April of 2007 we sent another letter to Chairman Bernanke. Here we \nsaid that our committee had held two hearings this year on the problem \nin subprime mortgage rates. This was in February and March of 2007, 3 \nyears ago.\n\n       At the hearings, a number of committee members raised \n     concerns that the regulators have not kept pace with \n     deteriorating credit standards on the growth of abusive, \n     unfair and deceptive lending practices. In addition, we are \n     concerned that the Federal Reserve Board has not exercised \n     its obligations under the Home Ownership and Equity \n     Protection Act of 1994 to issue regulations that address the \n     problems of predatory lending.\n\n  The letter goes on for two or three pages. That was signed by myself, \nSenator Reed, Senator Schumer, Senator Bayh, Senator Carper, Senator \nMenendez, Senator Akaka, Senator Sherrod Brown, Senator Bob Casey, and \nSenator Tester.\n  In December of 2007 we sent another letter to Chairman Bernanke.\n\n       In light of the deepening crisis in the mortgage markets, a \n     crisis you correctly attribute to abusive practices and lax \n     underwriting standards in the subprime market, we want to \n     reiterate to you the importance of acting forcefully to \n     protect consumers in the rulemaking the Federal Reserve Board \n     is currently undertaking under the Homeowners Equity \n     Protection Act.\n\n  We go on for two or three pages. Again, I say respectfully, but not a \nsingle member of our committee from the other side signed that letter \nor the one in April of 2007. This letter was signed by myself, Senator \nJohnson, Senator Reed, Senator Schumer, Senator Bayh, Senator Carper, \nSenator Menendez, Senator Akaka, Senator Brown, Senator Casey, Senator \nTester, and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.\n  Those are just three pieces of correspondence going back years ago, \ntrying to get some attention to the predatory lending practices that \nwere going on. Had we acted in 2006 or even in 2007, we would not even \nbe close to the disastrous effects that have occurred with 7 million \nhomes lost, 4 million today underwater in the country--in danger of \nfalling into foreclosure, 250,000. A\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\nquarter of a million homes this year have been seized in foreclosure \nproceedings. Here were three pieces of lengthy correspondence signed, \nin one case on a bipartisan basis in 2006; in 2007 unfortunately on a \npartisan basis--not because we didn't seek additional signatures on the \nletter--to highlight the importance of underwriting standards and the \nneed to step up.\n  I also want to add at this point a letter from the National \nAssociation of REALTORS, expressing strong opposition to the Corker-\nGregg amendment. In their letter to the Senate--to all Senators, this \nletter went--they say the following.\n\n       The Corker-Gregg-Isakson amendment replaces the risk \n     retention provisions . . . of the credit risk retention with \n     a study on a feasibility of risk retention requirements for \n     financial institutions and implements the residential \n     mortgage underwriting standards that include a mandatory 5 \n     percent downpayment for all mortgages. As our Nation \n     continues to recover from the worst economic downturn since \n     the Great Depression, REALTORS are cognizant that lax \n     underwriting standards brought us to this point. It must be \n     curtailed. However we caution that swinging the pendulum too \n     far in the opposite direction may reverse the fragile \n     recovery.\n       Based on data from the National Association of REALTORS, of \n     home buyers and sellers, 11 percent of all home purchasers \n     surveyed had downpayments of 5 percent or less. When \n     considering only first-time home buyers, the percentage \n     utilizing a downpayment of under 5 percent increases to 18 \n     percent of all purchases. Improving underwriting to ensure \n     that the consumer has the ability to pay their obligation is \n     in the best interests of everyone, but eliminating the \n     possibility for some creditworthy customers to buy a home \n     will have significant detrimental ramifications for American \n     families, the housing sector, and those businesses that \n     support it.\n\n  Let me take a couple of minutes. I know my colleague from Texas is \nhere, and others, but this is important, that people understand what \nhappened. Because 5 percent sounds pretty reasonable. Why not 5 \npercent? Let me explain why that provision poses some risk to all of \nus. The Senator's amendment as offered has two parts to it. They almost \nkind of run into each other in a way.\n  The first half of the amendment strikes the government-imposed risk \nretention requirements in the underlying bill. These requirements, as \nexplained before, and I will in a second again, would result in strong \nmarket-based underwriting standards in the residential mortgage market.\n  Then in the second half of the amendment, the amendment puts in \ngovernment-dictated, hard-wired underwriting standards that would have \nvery serious consequences, as the National Association of Realtors \npoints out, for first-time home buyers, minority home buyers, and \nothers who are seeking to attain the American dream of home ownership.\n  Like the earlier debates we have had, it does this at a time, as we \nall know, that the housing markets are just starting to recover, \npotentially putting that recovery at risk.\n  Let me start by discussing the first part of this amendment. The \nbill, section 941 of our bill, requires securitizers to retain an \neconomic interest in the material portion of the credit risk for any \nasset that securitizers transfer, sell, or convey to a third party. \nWhat does this mean? Very simply put, it is skin in the game. Skin in \nthe game--a skin-in-the game requirement that creates incentives that \nencourage sound lending practices, restores investor confidence, and \npermits securitization markets to resume their important role as a \nsource of credit for households and businesses.\n  Excesses and abuses in the securitization process played a very major \nrole in this crisis under what is called the ``originate to \ndistribute'' model. Loans were made expressly to be sold into the \nsecuritization pools, which meant the lenders did not expect to bear \nthe credit risk of borrower default.\n  What does that mean? Well, if you are the broker out cutting the \ndeal, what was the first piece of advice on their Web page to the \nbrokers, the unregulated brokers? The first piece of advice to them \nwas, from their association: Convince the borrower. Convince the \nborrower you are their financial adviser.\n  Well, of course, they were anything but their financial adviser. \nTheir job was, of course, to get people to sign up and commit to these \nmortgages, which they knew, in too many cases, could never, ever be \nmet; that is, they, the borrower, would never possibly meet it.\n  If you had some skin in the game if you are the broker, you may be a \nlittle more careful about that. But, of course, the broker was acting \non behalf of the lending institutions. Now you think, well, the lending \ninstitution is going to care about this. You know, when I bought my \nfirst home back X numbers of years ago, my mortgage stayed at the Old \nStone Bank. I signed those papers. I could go down every day and I \ncould pull out that drawer, wherever it was, and look at my mortgage. \nIt did not leave the Old Stone Bank. It stayed right there.\n  Let me tell you, that fellow at the Old Stone Bank wanted to make \ndarn sure that this young lawyer in Connecticut was going to meet his \nfinancial obligations. So they had underwriting standards for me. It \ndid not cost me a lot on a downpayment. I was a new buyer, first-time \nhome buyer. I had just gotten licensed to practice law in Connecticut, \nso they had a little confidence I might be able to meet my obligations. \nSo they had underwriting standards.\n  Today it is vastly different. That fellow, a young lawyer today, who \ngoes and gets that mortgage, the lending institution frankly could care \nless whether you have the underwriting standards. Why? Because it is \ngoing to sell that mortgage. That is what securitization is: I am going \nto sell it. On average they hold your mortgage 8 to 10 weeks. Then they \nsell it. It goes right out the door. So the broker could care less. He \ngot me to sign up with a deal I could not afford. The old bank does not \ncare anymore, because they are selling it, and bundling them together \nand shipping them out the door, and some unwitting investor may be \npurchasing these. Because they have been branded by the rating agencies \nas AAA or AA, they think they are pretty good.\n  So why am I putting skin in the game? Because if you do not have skin \nin the game, if you do not have a vested interest financially in the \noutcome, you do not care what happens, unfortunately, in too many \ncases. You have been paid. You have got out your dollar. You have been \ncompensated as the broker; you have been compensated as the lending \ninstitution; you wash your hands of the whole thing.\n  That is what created this domino effect, because there were not \npeople watching and caring what went on. So in my bill I said: Well, \nwhy not keep a little skin in the game or drop the skin in the game but \nwrite underwriting standards. You make the choice. But if you have got \nskin in the game, I suspect you are going to be careful about \nunderwriting standards. If you write the underwriting standards, I do \nnot want to take a pound of your flesh from the lending institution, if \nyou are going to meet those obligations.\n  That is exactly what Senator Merkley and our colleague from Minnesota \nand others are suggesting here: Let's get good underwriting standards \nhere. That is why I support what they are talking about. So I apologize \nfor going into all of that ``originate to distribute,'' but originate \nthe mortgage to distribute it. That is exactly what it means.\n  This led to significant, of course, deterioration in credit and loan \nunderwriting standards, particularly in residential mortgages. With the \nonset of the crisis, there was widespread uncertainty regarding the \ntrue financial condition of holders of asset-backed securities, for \nobvious reasons, freezing interbank lending, constricting the general \nflow of credit. Complexity and opacity in the securitization markets \nprolonged and deepened the crisis, and it made recovery efforts that \nmuch more difficult.\n  My proposal in the bill has a measured approach which requires, of \ncourse, separate rulemaking requirements for different assets. I will \nnot bother you with all of that.\n  A lot of people support this, by the way, including the Consumer \nFederation of America, the Investors Working Group, the America \nSecuritization Forum, CalPERS, the Group of 30, even a former \nRepublican Secretary of the Treasury, John Snow. And he says:\n\n       Because of the lack of participant accountability, the \n     originate-to-distribute model of mortgage finance, with its \n     once great promise of managing risk, became itself a massive \n     generator of risk.\n\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\n\n  A study is not a credible response. I say that respectfully of the \namendment of the Senator from Tennessee. He calls for a study in all of \nthis. Our bill provides for comprehensive regulation of securitization \nmarkets, to prevent excesses and eliminate a potential source of \nfinancial instability.\n  Let me add quickly, I am a strong supporter of securitization. That \nhas provided liquidity, which has made home ownership more available to \nmore people. But you have got to do it carefully. If you are packaging \nthese mortgages with no regard to whether they are available, and \nsending them out the door to be sold off, then you jeopardize \nsecuritization. If you get good underwriting standards, as the Senator \nfrom Oregon and Minnesota are requiring, then you are going to build in \nsome safeguards; then securitization, with proper branding of what they \nare worth, and you are back on track again, and we can start to see \nhousing improve for everybody.\n  The Corker amendment also requires, of course, here a 5-percent \ndownpayment for all loans, no matter what the circumstance. That is a \ngovernment-mandated requirement in a sense in this amendment. Even with \nFHA loans, hardwiring in statutes that as a requirement is very ill-\nconsidered, I would say.\n  The key cause of the crisis, as I have said many times over the past \nalmost 4 years on the floor of this body, was the unscrupulous mortgage \nbrokers and mortgage lenders who sold unaffordable mortgages to people \nwho could not pay those mortgages.\n  In the majority of the cases, those loans were refinance loans, they \nwere not even original mortgages. It was refinancing. No downpayments \nare required in refinancing at all. Downpayments did not even come up \nor come into play for these borrowers. But the mortgages were still \noutrageous and unaffordable. They still led to the foreclosures and \ncontributed to the economic crisis we are in.\n  Why was this? Well, it was because the brokers and bankers had no \nskin in the game. So they not only did not pay attention, in too many \ncases they did not even care whether the borrowers had the ability to \npay back those loans. The Merkley-Klobuchar amendment specifically \naddresses this problem, by specifically requiring that lenders take \ninto account the borrower's ability to pay, and laying out important \ncriteria for determining that.\n  It will end the steering payments that caused so much of the trouble \nin the first place. And while the 5-percent downpayment may sound \nreasonable, and in some cases it is, there are many lending programs \nout there that allow for downpayments that are lower than 5 percent: \nFHA, which is struggling now, has traditionally allowed for \ndownpayments less than 5 percent. FHA has been a path to home \nownership, as we know, for millions of our fellow citizens. Many \nnonprofits such as Habitat for Humanity, the Enterprise Foundation, \nchurch-related housing groups--in fact, I have a letter signed by a \nnumber of these nonprofit organizations in opposition to the Corker \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that all these letters I have \nreferred to be printed in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                                 of REALTORS ,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of more than 1.1 million members of \n     the National Association of REALTORS  (NAR) involved in \n     residential and commercial real estate as brokers, sales \n     people, property managers, appraisers, counselors, and others \n     engaged in all aspects of the real estate industry, I \n     respectfully request that you oppose the Corker-Gregg (#3834) \n     and the McCain-Shelby-Gregg (#3839) amendments to S. 3217, \n     the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010.\n\n\n                     Corker-Gregg-Isakson Amendment\n\n       The Corker-Gregg-Isakson (#3834) amendment replaces the \n     risk retention provisions of S. 3217, Title VII, Subtitle D, \n     (b) Credit Risk Retention--with a study on the feasibility of \n     risk retention requirements for financial institutions and \n     implements residential mortgage underwriting standards that \n     include a mandatory 5% down payment for all mortgages. As our \n     nation continues to recover from the worst economic downturn \n     since the Great Depression, REALTORS  are cognizant that lax \n     underwriting standards brought us to this point, and must be \n     curtailed. However, we caution that swinging the pendulum too \n     far in the opposite direction may reverse our fragile \n     recovery.\n       Based on data from NAR's 2009 Profile of Home Buyers and \n     Sellers, 11% of all home purchasers surveyed had downpayments \n     of 5% or less. When considering only first-time homebuyers, \n     the percentage utilizing a downpayment below 5% increases to \n     18%. Improving underwriting to ensure that the consumer has \n     the ability to repay their obligation is in the best interest \n     of everyone, but eliminating the possibility for some \n     creditworthy consumers to buy a home will have significant \n     detrimental ramifications for American families, the housing \n     sector and those businesses that support it.\n\n\n                     McCain-Shelby-Gregg Amendment\n\n       The McCain-Shelby-Gregg (#3839) amendment, which creates \n     Title XII to S. 3217, places Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on \n     the fast track to dissolution. REALTORS  believe that reform \n     of these institutions, that have played a pivotal role in the \n     evolution of the U.S. housing market, is necessary; however, \n     now is not the time for drastic action. Especially, \n     considering their current role in stabilizing the housing \n     market, and that the McCain-Shelby-Gregg amendment does not \n     offer a replacement to fill the enormous gap that the \n     shuttered GSEs will leave.\n       As NAR mentioned in our testimony before the House \n     Financial Services Committee, March 23rd, 2010, on the \n     ``Future of the Housing Finance,'' the transition of these \n     organizations to their new form must be conducted in a \n     fashion that is the least disruptive to the marketplace and \n     ensures mortgage capital continues to flow to all markets in \n     all market conditions. The establishment of aggressive \n     timetables for the GSEs to return to profitability, prior to \n     the full recovery of our nation's economy and housing market, \n     pre-disposes them to failure, and will cause significant \n     angst for homebuyers and the nation's housing markets.\n       Furthermore, the requirements that this amendment places on \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when they become viable, will \n     effectively prohibit them from participating in the secondary \n     mortgage market.\n       First, the aggressive reduction of their portfolio will \n     prevent them from being an effective buffer during future \n     economic downturns. A key element of NAR's recommendation for \n     the restructure of the GSEs is that their portfolios should \n     only be large enough to support their business needs and \n     ensure a stable supply of mortgage capital when necessary \n     because of insufficient private investment. The requirements \n     established in this amendment would thwart the GSEs ability \n     to be an effective buffer.\n       Second, the amendment repeals all increases to loan limits, \n     both permanent and temporary. The loan limits would return \n     to: $417,000. Moreover, the GSEs would be prohibited from \n     purchasing homes that had prices over the median-home price, \n     for properties of the same size, for the area in which the \n     property was purchased. This would reduce loan limits to less \n     than $100,000 in some areas, less than half the current FHA \n     floor.\n       NAR advocated for the increase of the loan limits for high \n     cost areas and is actively advocating that the current limits \n     be made permanent in order to ensure that creditworthy \n     homebuyers have access to affordable capital. The housing \n     market remains fragile, and private capital has not returned \n     to either the mortgage or MBS markets to the extent that is \n     needed to support the housing industry. Reducing the GSEs' \n     loan limits to the suggested levels will significantly limit \n     the ability of homebuyers to obtain mortgage funding \n     throughout the country, and damage the business sectors \n     supported by mortgage finance.\n       Third, the amendment establishes an escalating mandatory \n     down payment percentage that REALTORS  believe unfairly and \n     unnecessarily denies the opportunity to many families who \n     have the potential to succeed as homeowners. Beginning 1-year \n     after the 24-month assessment period, the minimum down \n     payment requirement will be 5%. 2-years out, the down payment \n     will be 7.5%. After three years, the down payment will be 10% \n     for conventional-conforming loans.\n       The removal of flexible down payment options will \n     significantly reduce the ability of creditworthy consumers to \n     purchase a home. As mentioned with regard to the Corker-Greg-\n     Isakson amendment, a 5% down payment requirement excludes 11% \n     of all current homebuyers and 18% of all current first-time \n     homebuyers, based on NAR's most recent homebuyers survey. \n     Increasing the down payment to requirement to 10% would \n     exclude nearly 25% of all current creditworthy borrowers, and \n     up to 37% of current creditworthy first-time homebuyers. \n     Underwriting standards have already been corrected and loans \n     are only available for borrowers who can afford them. There \n     is no reason to over-correct by imposing higher downpayment \n     requirements.\n       As we have seen, without the GSEs, the current crisis would \n     have been even more catastrophic for the housing market and \n     the overall economy, as virtually no activity would have \n     occurred within the housing sector because little private \n     capital would have been available. REALTORS  support \n     reforming our housing finance system, and the GSEs. However, \n     taking a measured approach is critical to ensuring that our \n     economic recovery remains viable.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share with you the views of \n     more than 1.1 million real estate practitioners respectfully \n     request that\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\n     you oppose the McCain-Shelby-Gregg (# ) and the Corker-Gregg-\n     Isakson (# ) amendments to S. 3217, the Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Vicki Cox Golder,\n\n                                                   2010 President,\n                                           National Association of\n     REALTORS .\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 11, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n         Urban Affairs, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby: We write in \n     opposition to amendments to the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act that would mandate a one-size-fits-all approach \n     to mortgage underwriting and those amendments that would \n     undercut the current mortgage finance system by eliminating \n     Government Sponsor Enterprises (GSEs) without having a \n     successor system in place.\n       Certain amendments currently being considered, such as a \n     mandatory 5 percent down payment requirement, would undermine \n     successful first-time homebuyer and workforce housing \n     programs offered by qualified nonprofits and state and local \n     governments. Unlike the broader mortgage market, these \n     nonprofit and government sponsored lending programs require \n     borrower financial education and have very low default rates. \n     For example, the program administered by NYC's Department of \n     Housing Preservation and Development had only five \n     foreclosures out of 17,000 loans. The reason is that programs \n     such as these utilize stringent underwriting standards that \n     were lacking in some segments of the mortgage finance market. \n     Yet, local government and nonprofit loan programs would be \n     virtually eliminated by a national mandate for a 5 percent \n     down payment because these programs utilize alternative down \n     payment requirements to ensure that the homebuyer has ``skin \n     in the game.'' For example, self-help homebuyer programs \n     allow hours spent in building homes to compensate as part of \n     the down payment. Other programs require extensive financial \n     literacy, including pre- and post-purchase counseling, and \n     state or local government issued loans coupled with sound \n     underwriting standards that have proved successful in \n     enabling low income and workforce families to achieve the \n     American dream of homeownership, build wealth, and remain in \n     their homes.\n       Moreover, buyers who receive financial literacy training \n     and homeownership counseling with traditional loan products, \n     irrespective of the down payment percentage, are critical to \n     our nation's ability to address the foreclosure crisis and \n     stabilize the housing market. A one-size-fits-all approach \n     and flat down payment amounts eliminate the ability for local \n     communities to rely on the experience and strong track \n     records of local non-profit and government lenders who have \n     built successful homeownership programs that did not \n     contribute to the housing crisis.\n       In addition to avoiding flat down payments and federally \n     mandated underwriting standards, we also believe that \n     Congress should employ a thoughtful and analytic approach to \n     examining the role of the two Government Sponsored Entities \n     (GSEs) in the mortgage crisis and what the future of the U.S. \n     mortgage finance system should look like versus an immediate \n     wind down of both GSEs. We urge Congress to ensure that a \n     successor system is in place prior to dissolving the two \n     firms. The GSEs have provided critical capital to the housing \n     market, ensuring that more Americans can benefit from \n     homeownership. Though we must be careful only to extend \n     mortgage loans to those who can afford to pay the loans over \n     the life of the mortgage, we must be equally careful not to \n     cut off mortgage lending at a time when the markets are \n     recovering.\n       The problems in the housing market were caused by a \n     confluence of factors. We must address all of them, instead \n     of singling out one or two reasons or entities, and, \n     inadvertently, making homeownership unattainable for many \n     working families.\n       Thank you for taking the time to address these concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n         Enterprise Community Partners; National NeighborWorks \n           Association; Habitat for Humanity International; \n           Community Resources and Housing Development \n           Corporation; National Community Reinvestment Coalition; \n           Kalamazoo Neighborhood Housing Services, Inc.; Nuestra \n           Comunidad Development Corporation; Manna, Inc; \n           Community Frameworks; UNHS NeighborWorks HomeOwnership \n           Center; Frontier Housing, Inc.; Boston LISC; Chicago \n           LISC; Connecticut Statewide LISC; Duluth LISC; Houston \n           LISC; Jacksonville LISC; Los Angeles LISC; Mid South \n           Delta LISC; New York City LISC; Philadelphia LISC; \n           Pittsburgh Partnership for Neighborhood Development \n           (SWPA LISC); San Diego LISC; Toledo LISC; Virginia \n           LISC; Impact Capital (Washington State LISC); Local \n           Initiatives Support Corporation; Housing Assistance \n           Council; Homes for America, Inc.; Housing Partnership \n           Network; Neighborhood Housing Services of Phoenix; \n           Cambridge Neighborhood Apartment Housing Services; NHS \n           of the Lehigh Valley, Inc.; NeighborWorks Columbus; \n           Ithaca Neighborhood Housing Services; Knox Housing \n           Partnership; NHS of Orange County; Buffalo LISC; \n           Greater Cincinnati & NE Kentucky LISC; Detroit LISC; \n           Hartford LISC; Indianapolis LISC; Greater Kansas City \n           LISC; Michigan Statewide LISC; Milwaukee LISC; Greater \n           Newark & Jersey City LISC; Phoenix LISC; Rhode Island \n           LISC; San Francisco Bay Area LISC; Twin Cities LISC; \n           Washington DC LISC.\n\n  Mr. DODD. These are groups, it appears that, in fact, I should say in \nfairness to Senator Corker, in the latest version of his amendment, \nthat allows for some exceptions on a case-by-case basis of these \nnonprofits, where each individual nonprofit has to go to the regulators \nfor such an exemption. But they simply may not get it. They get to \napply. It is optional to give that.\n  Many insured depositors, of course, have mortgage programs that \nrequire less than 5-percent downpayments. They are performing well, and \nhave done so in the past. And we want low- and moderate-income families \nto go to banks and get loans, qualified low- and moderate-income people \nto have to meet those standards. We do not want to simply shut them off \nto nonprofits. We want to get them into the financial mainstream.\n  The Corker amendment would create a new barrier to accomplishing that \ngoal. But the Merkley-Klobuchar amendment provides for those \nunderwriting safeguards, does not put such tight restrictions, even on \nFHA mortgages, that would make it impossible for an awful lot of \npeople.\n  I thank my colleagues. I have spoken a long time here. I apologize. \nBut I think it is important to know the history of how we got into the \nmess and what happened out there that led us to these difficulties, why \nunderwriting is important.\n  What Senator Merkley and Senator Klobuchar have offered is to get \nback to that sensible requirement here without writing these stringent \nrequirements in this legislation that would be so difficult. So I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Merkley-Klobuchar amendment and \nrespectfully oppose the Corker amendment.\n  By the way, their amendment is endorsed by a number of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle. I thank Senator Scott Brown of \nMassachusetts, who is involved with this amendment, by Senator Merkley \nand others. I commend him for it. It is a good proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I interject myself in this debate for 1 minute to \nask unanimous consent with respect to the Whitehouse amendment that \nrestores States rights to protect against exorbitant, out-of-State \nlenders doing business in one's own State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cochran of Mississippi be added \nas a cosponsor. I want to take a moment to let him know how much I \nappreciate his cosponsorship of what is now a bipartisan amendment, and \nI look forward to continuing to secure additional sponsors from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, before I speak on this amendment, I want \nto applaud my colleague from Connecticut who spoke so passionately and \nknowledgeably about the challenge that had been faced by subprime \nunderwriting gone astray.\n  If only the letters that he and his colleagues wrote in 2006 and in \n2007, those multiple appeals, if only those who had the power to \nestablish those underwriting standards had been listened to, had been \nfollowed up on, then we would have a much smaller challenge today. We \nwould not have had this big meltdown in 2008 and 2009, with so many \nmillions of American families having the value of their home destroyed. \nI applaud him for his advocacy year after year after year.\n  I am pleased to be able to join him in this effort now. I \nparticularly applaud the efforts to establish standards for skin in the \ngame. This is a very responsible way to create accountability for our \nmortgage originators. I do want to note that there are three issues \nthat particularly contributed to dysfunction at the retail mortgage \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\n  The first is liar loans, undocumented income, where a mortgage \noriginator would tell the client: Well, we will just pencil in here \nthat you earn $150,000. It does not matter. Don't you worry about what \nyou are earning. We will put this in here. That obviously led to a \ncomplete corruption of the quality of the mortgage. Certainly the \nfamilies involved had no prospect of paying for those mortgages and the \ninterest rates they were being signed up for.\n  A second was to fail to employ basic underwriting measures, measures \nlike loan to value and credit history and employment history, and \ncurrent obligations and debt to income, and so forth.\n  These are the types of measures any responsible originator goes \nthrough to understand whether this loan makes sense for this family, \nwhether there will be the ability to repay.\n  The third piece is the incentives that were provided to mortgage \noriginators put those originators 180 degrees out of sync with their \ncustomers. Essentially, it worked like this. If a loan was good for a \nfamily, it didn't make as much money for the lender. If it was bad for \na family, it made a lot of money for the lender. So the lender and the \nhome buyer have different interests; one wants a low-interest mortgage, \na fair mortgage; the other wants a mortgage that has hidden clauses, \nprepayment penalties, and exploding interest rates. But incentive \npayments, sometimes called steering payments, technically called yield \nspread premiums--these were paid to the mortgage originators to induce \nthem to sign those families they had taken into their trust into a loan \nthat was good for the lender but not good for the family, corrupting a \ntransaction at the heart of the most important financial moment in a \nfamily's experience, the moment of buying their family home.\n  This amendment addresses all three of these core pieces of \ndysfunction in the mortgage market. It ends no-documentation or liar \nloans as they are called, where income is created like writing a work \nof fiction. It sets minimum underwriting standards related to loan to \nvalue, ability to repay, and ability to repay not based on some teaser \nrate but on any rate the loan could potentially go up to in the first 5 \nyears. So you make sure, if this has a variable rate clause, that this \nfamily will be able to manage those payments in the first 5 years and \ncertainly verification of income in the process. So you have \ndocumentation and verification, essentially the sound underwriting \nprocess that was in place for decades before it all went awry over the \nlast 10 years.\n  This amendment will apply to all loans. It amends the Truth in \nLending Act or TILA, which applies to all loans. It will base broker \ncompensation on the size of the loan and on the loan value or the loan \namount and the volume of loans a broker makes, rather than on the type \nof loan. We take this impossible situation that mortgage originators \nwere put in, where their interests were 180 degrees reversed from the \nclient. Yet it is a trust relationship, it puts them in sync, where the \nbroker has no incentive to steer a family into an exploding interest \nrate, no incentive to steer a family into a loan with a prepayment \npenalty, no incentive to steer a family into a loan that has other \nhidden clauses designed to strip wealth from working families.\n  Finally, this amendment provides a safe harbor to make sure mortgage \noriginators are on sound ground if they follow this set of originating \nprinciples and, in the process, makes sure they do not do balloon \npayments or fees that exceed 3 percent, a series of sound business \npractices that serve the industry and serve the family.\n  I mentioned before that my colleague from Tennessee has a bill that \nhas many of these mortgage underwriting standards. I applaud him for \nhis long experience and concern in helping families to succeed. But we \ndo disagree about two provisions. One provision is stripping the skin \nin the game that makes sure mortgage originators have a stake in the \nquality of the mortgage. The second is to establish a solid line on a \n5-percent standard. Many families, when they are buying a modest home, \nhave a significant expenditure in all kinds of closing costs, \nindependent of their downpayment. They may well have thousands of \ndollars, $5,000, $8,000 of skin in the game before they ever get to the \ndownpayment. So we want to create the flexibility for first-time home \nbuyers and for families on the lower end of the income spectrum to be \nable to get into home ownership.\n  In fact, frankly, it is these families for whom it is so important we \nmake the mortgage process available. Because a young family who is able \nto buy that first home and do so with the responsible underwriting \nprinciples laid out in this amendment, in 5 years they will be buying \ntheir second home, maybe a bit nicer home, maybe an extra bedroom or \ntwo for the children, and maybe later on they are able to move up again \nto the sort of home they have always dreamed about having or the sort \nof yard with the trees in it that the treehouse is going into and so \nforth. That is the American dream, to be able to engage in this \nprogression. You engage in that progression because you build equity. \nYou build equity by getting into home ownership at the start. Having \nsolid underwriting standards but not an inflexible line is the way to \ngo on this.\n  I do note that the amendment Senator Klobuchar and I are offering is \nsupported by a host of organizations: The Center for American Progress, \nthe Center for Responsible Lending, the National Association of \nConsumer Advocates, the National Consumer Law Center, the National Fair \nHousing Alliance, Consumer Action, the Housing Finance Alliance, and \nMortgage Insurance Companies of America.\n  This is a bipartisan sentiment to restore solid mortgage underwriting \nstandards. I appreciate the thoughtfulness and energy that has gone \ninto it from both sides of the aisle to craft ways to approach this. \nWhen we vote tomorrow morning, I ask all my colleagues to vote yes for \nstrong underwriting standards. Vote yes for putting mortgage \noriginators in sync with their clients rather than radically oppose the \ninterests of their clients. Vote yes to end liar loans. Certainly, vote \nyes for the young families and those families with lower income who \nwish to get into that first home so they can get their share of the \nAmerican dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3759, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Hutchison-\nKlobuchar amendment, which will be in order after votes on the Merkley \nand Corker amendments. The votes will come tomorrow, but my colleague, \nSenator Klobuchar, and I are very concerned about the underlying bill \nonly putting Fed supervision over bank holding companies that are $50 \nbillion and above. One of the key parts of regulatory reform in this \nfinancial arena is that nobody wants too big to fail anymore. My \ncolleague, the cosponsor of this amendment, and I wish to assure there \nis no indication in any way that only bank holding companies that are \n$50 billion and above would be having supervision of and access to the \nFed.\n  We want to make sure of two things. First, that there is a level \nplaying field, that everyone who wants to be a member of the Fed, who \nwants to have access to the Fed, will be able to do that, including \nState banks.\n  The underlying bill would prohibit State banks from being able to be \nmembers of the Fed. That is a real concern for community bankers all \nover America. The second concern is that we have regional Feds. When \nthe Federal Reserve was established, there was a debate about whether \nwe would have regional offices or whether there would just be the \nFederal Reserve Board sitting in Washington. The decision was made to \nhave Federal banks in key parts all over the country that would be \nregional banks. The purpose was that we needed to know what was \nhappening all over the country, not only in New York, not only in \nWashington, DC, but throughout the country, because it is the community \nbanks that are the depository institutions that are the mainstay of our \neconomy and our financial community. If you take the Federal Reserve \nsupervisory authority away from all those community banks around the \ncountry and regional banks no longer have input into what is going on \nin smaller communities, we will have too big to fail in reality, and we \nwill also have a monetary policy that is going to cater to the big \nfinancial institutions, which are what utterly\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\nfailed in the last 2 years in the financial meltdown.\n  Senator Klobuchar and I have an amendment that would go back to where \nwe are today, that the Fed would have supervisory power over State \nbanks that choose to go into the Fed, and it would be universal for all \nthe holding companies and the banks in the system.\n  Before my colleague from Minnesota speaks, I wish to submit for the \nRecord a couple letters that have been written, one by the Independent \nCommunity Bankers of America.\n\n       Dear Senator,\n       On behalf of the nearly 5,000 members of the Independent \n     Community Bankers of America, I write to urge your support \n     for an amendment to S. 3217 to be offered by Senators \n     Hutchison and Klobuchar . . . that would restore the Federal \n     Reserve's authority to examine state-chartered community \n     banks and small bank holding companies.\n\n  That is the amendment we are discussing tonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Independent Community\n\n\n                               Bankers of America',\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nearly 5,000 members of the \n     Independent Community Bankers of America, I write to urge \n     your support for an amendment to S. 3217 to be offered by \n     Senators Hutchison and Klobuchar (#3759) that would restore \n     the Federal Reserve's authority to examine state-chartered \n     community banks and small bank holding companies.\n       The Federal Reserve System comprises 12 regional Federal \n     Reserve Banks overseen by a Board in Washington. The virtue \n     of this structure is that it prevents the Federal Reserve \n     from being focused exclusively on the power-centers of \n     Washington and New York. Through their examination of state-\n     chartered community banks and bank holding companies, the \n     regional Federal Reserve Banks keep their finger on the pulse \n     of a diverse range of institutions in diverse regional \n     economies and the Main Street small businesses and \n     municipalities served by these institutions. As Chairman \n     Bernanke has testified, the Federal Reserve's authority gives \n     them insight into what's happening in the entire banking \n     system. This insight is crucial not only to the Federal \n     Reserve's exercise of its monetary functions, but to its \n     ability to gauge the impact of banking regulations across \n     diverse institutions.\n       The Federal Reserve must be the central bank of the United \n     States, not the central bank of Wall Street and a handful of \n     too-big-to-fail institutions. Your support for the Hutchison/\n     Klobuchar amendment will help ensure that the Federal Reserve \n     serves the entire economy.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Camden R. Fine,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I also will include a letter from the Chamber of \nCommerce of the United States of America, signed by the executive vice \npresident.\n\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing the interests of more than three \n     million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, \n     and region, strongly supports an amendment expected to be \n     offered by Sens. Hutchison and Klobuchar to S. 3217 . . . \n     which would maintain Federal Reserve Board oversight of state \n     member banks and smaller holding companies.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2010.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, strongly supports an amendment expected to be offered \n     by Senators Hutchison and Klobuchar to S. 3217, the \n     ``Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 \n     (RAFSA),'' which would maintain Federal Reserve Board \n     oversight of state member banks and smaller holding \n     companies.\n       S. 3217 would focus the attention of the Federal Reserve on \n     just the largest institutions and could serve to limit the \n     Federal Reserve's understanding of the importance of \n     community banks. Federal Reserve supervision enhances the \n     ability of the Federal Reserve to assess credit impact in \n     local communities. Smaller banks tend to fund smaller \n     businesses, which is an important source of jobs for the \n     economy. Removing Federal Reserve supervision of community \n     banks could mean the Federal Reserve would lose timely \n     information about the flow of credit to small businesses.\n       The Chamber looks forward to working with the Senate on \n     meaningful, bipartisan legislation to ensure that the U.S. \n     financial system is protected and that small businesses \n     continue to have access to the capital they need to sustain, \n     grow, and create jobs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I also wish to read a couple excerpts from a letter \nby the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to Senator Bennet. It goes \ninto a lot of other things, but the relevant part says:\n\n       Unfortunately, if the Senate divides the oversight of the \n     [bank holding companies] between the banking regulators, it \n     will multiply and complicate this oversight significantly. \n     This is hardly an improvement. And, limiting the regional \n     Reserve Banks' source of industry information gained through \n     their contact with all institutions and bank regulators will \n     greatly compromise its ability to understand industry trends \n     and deal with future crises. This is a mistake and I hope you \n     will consider it carefully in your deliberations.\n\n  That is signed by Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve \nBank of Kansas City.\n  In addition, the President of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, \nRichard Fisher, came to my office to make this point most \naffirmatively, that he wanted to make sure he still had the supervisory \npower and the ability to learn from the State banks, the community \nbanks in the whole region where the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank sits.\n  Last, I wish to read an excerpt from the alert of the American \nBankers Association:\n\n       As you know, S. 3217, the regulatory restructuring bill, \n     contains language that would move oversight of state banks \n     that are members of the Federal Reserve and their holding \n     companies to the [FDIC]. [The American Bankers Association] \n     is strongly opposed to this provision, as this would take \n     away the Federal Reserve's ability to regulate state member \n     banks and would undermine the Federal Reserve's ability to \n     fully understand small and mid-size institutions and the \n     communities they serve.\n       As early as Wednesday, May 5, the Senate will consider an \n     ABA-supported amendment . . . by Senators Kay Bailey \n     Hutchison and Amy Klobuchar that would restore current law by \n     returning oversight of state member banks and holding \n     companies to the Federal Reserve.\n\n  It is very important that our amendment be passed by the Senate. It \nwill make a great improvement to this bill in that it will restore the \nlaw as it is today. It will not have the mixup of the varying \nregulatory bodies having control in one area, where a bank across the \nstreet does not have the ability to go to the Fed and one across the \nstreet does. We don't need that. What we want in this regulatory reform \nis to allow all the banks to be members of the Federal Reserve, to have \nthe same discounts, the same backing of that supervisory authority so \nFederal Reserve banks all over our country will have the input of the \ncommunity banks in our system rather than making monetary policy from \nNew York and Washington, DC. The last thing we need is more people who \nare out of touch with mainstream America doing the regulation of our \nfinancial industry.\n\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Klobuchar from \nMinnesota, and would like to ask her to speak at this time because I \nthink this bipartisan amendment will improve this bill greatly, and I \nlook forward to having the vote tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator \nHutchison, for her great leadership on this issue. We have worked \ntogether from the beginning on this amendment, and you can see there is \nsupport for this amendment from the Lone Star State to the North Star \nState, spanning this country--as you look at the many States across \nthis country that truly believe it is important to have the regional \nFederal Reserve involved in decisions, not have anything and everything \nconcentrated in Washington and New York City, which we believe got us \ninto lots of this trouble in the first place.\n  The amendment we have offered is important because what it does is \nseek to preserve a system that ensures that the institution charged \nwith our Nation's monetary policy has a connection to Main Street, not \njust Wall Street--Main Street in Benson, MN; Main Street in Austin, TX; \nMain Street in Denver, CO. That is what we are talking about.\n  As I have said before, Main Street banks pretty much stayed away from\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\nthe high flying, way-too-risky deals of the past decade, and when the \npavement on Wall Street began to buckle and collapse, these banks--\nthese small community banks--did not panic and run to Washington with \ntin cups and outstretched hands.\n  Like the rest of Main Street, they suffered because of bad bets made \non Wall Street. But they kept doing their work. They kept serving their \ncustomers. So now, with us debating a Wall Street reform that will \naffect how these small banks, these community banks do business, I \nthink they have a right to speak up. That is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  I would like to give a lot of credit to Chairman Dodd, who is here as \nusual in the late evening hours, as well as Ranking Member Shelby, \nalong with the rest of their Banking Committee who worked so incredibly \nhard. Chairman Dodd has been working with us on this amendment and has \nbeen working with us on many issues affecting the community banks. I \nthank him for that.\n  I think we took another important step yesterday when we passed the \nTester-Hutchison amendment that will make sure community banks pay only \ntheir fair share when it comes to Federal bank insurance.\n  But the issue my colleague, Senator Hutchison, so eloquently \ndiscussed is whether the Federal Reserve will continue to oversee our \nState member community banks. That issue still remains.\n  Like I am sure all of you have, I have heard from my community banks. \nI have heard from the Fed. I have thought about this a lot. I just want \nto give you an example of what those community banks--the bankers out \nthere in the heartland, who basically are standing out there with their \nfeet firmly on the ground, with their briefcases in their hands. They \nwere not there as these credit default swaps swallowed and swirled \naround their heads. They were there just doing their job.\n  Here is what Noah Wilcox, the president of Grand Rapids State Bank in \nGrand Rapids, MN--Grand Rapids, MN, home of the Judy Garland Museum. If \nyou ever want to go there, you can actually put your head in a cut-out \nhole of the Tin Man. Yes, you can. The Tin Man--right--needed a heart. \nThe lion needed courage. And the scare crow needed a brain. You could \ngo there to Grand Rapids.\n  Well, this is what the president of the Grand Rapids State Bank said:\n\n       All Senators should be reminded that the Federal Reserve \n     System was created to serve all of America, not just Wall \n     Street.\n\n  From the Lone Star State to the North Star State.\n  When Congress established the Federal Reserve in 1913, Congress \npurposely created a system of regional banks, overseen by a board in \nWashington, to ensure that the power of this institution would not be \nconcentrated far from these banks and the communities they serve. That \nis why I believe Mr. Wilcox's--the guy from Grand Rapids, the banker--\nstatement rings especially true. He was not just advocating for his \nbank or other banks in Minnesota or across the country. He said the \nFederal Reserve was created for ``all of America.''\n  The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis just does not supervise \nbanks, it also partners with the communities it serves by providing \nresources and sharing expertise. I will give you one example. We have \nArt Rolnick, known nationally for the work he has done on early \nchildhood development. He works with the Federal Reserve. He is one of \ntheir policy experts. He is retiring this summer. He has literally \ndevoted the last few years of his career looking at early childhood \ndevelopment--the investment. He has put out numbers. He has put out \nstudies straight from the Federal Reserve because he had that \ninformation on the ground to show the kind of return of investment you \nget when you invest in kids early on. I do not think we would see that \ncoming out of the Federal Reserve in Washington. This came out of the \nregional banks.\n  This interaction with regional banks can clearly be seen in the \ninterdisciplinary research it conducts in Minnesota with the University \nof Minnesota and in its partnerships with financial institutions and \ncommunity-based organizations to provide investment in low- and \nmoderate-income communities.\n  Together the regional banks provide a presence across this country \nthat gives the Fed grassroots connections--not just in board rooms in \nNew York, not just in the hallways of Congress in Washington, but right \nthere in Grand Rapids, MN, on Main Street--insights into local \neconomies. What is happening with the timber industry? What is \nhappening with the medical device industry? They know that on the front \nline. What is happening to the high-tech industry? What is happening \nwith the telecommunications industry in Denver? That is what the \nregional banks do for us.\n  They also provide legitimacy when they have to make tough decisions--\nwhen the Fed has to make those tough decisions--to have those regional \nbanks out there with legitimacy in the banking community and the \nbusiness community to say: This is not just about Wall Street; this is \nalso about Main Street.\n  Their geographic diversity also allows the regional banks to develop \nunique expertise. For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis \nhas a wide breadth of knowledge in the agricultural economies of \nMinnesota and the other States in its district. You are not going to \nget that in the middle of New York City. You are not going to get that \nin the middle of Washington, DC. Through the Federal Reserve of \nMinneapolis, the community banks they supervise have a better \nunderstanding of the markets that ultimately aid them in their loan \nmaking decisions.\n  Through their working relationships with community banks, the \nregional Federal Reserve banks also collect and analyze important \ninformation about the movements and trends in local economies. Because \ncommunity banks interact with so many parts of the economy--from the \nordinary folks who bank with them, to the small businesses they provide \nloans, to real estate developers, and even local governments--their \nconnections to the communities they serve provide a unique perspective \nfor the Fed to tap.\n  This relationship is a two-way street, as it also provides a voice \nfor our community banks that would be lost if the Federal Reserve were \nto only supervise the largest banks. A system like this would certainly \nlimit, and potentially distort, the picture the Federal Reserve gets of \nwhat is happening in our Nation's banking system.\n  I repeat, this crisis did not happen because of this little bank in \nGrand Rapids, MN. It happened because eyes were not watching what was \ngoing on on Wall Street. Eyes were not watching what was going on in \nthese big banks. The rest of these guys--these small banks--they were \nthe ones who were the victims of this crisis.\n  As the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis pointed \nout in a speech this past March, it would be shortsighted to conclude \nthat the Federal Reserve ``can safely be stripped of its role as a \nsupervisor of small banks.'' As he noted, disruptions in the financial \nsystem can come from all sectors and the connection the regional \nFederal Reserve banks provide to local economies can be vital in \nensuring the stability of the financial system.\n  Opponents will argue that the Federal Reserve does not need to \nsupervise banks to gain insight into them, that they can get this \ninformation by other means and through other sources. But, currently, \nmuch of the Federal Reserve's interaction with community banks comes \nfrom the supervision done by its examiners. Many of these examiners \nhave lived and worked in the districts they serve for many years, and \nthe information they provide is critical to the Fed's understanding of \nlocal economies.\n  This system--a system that serves all Americans--is threatened if we \ndo not act. Currently, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis--and I \nam sure you see this in Texas, in Missouri, in Colorado, and the \nFederal Reserve's banks all across this country--currently, the Federal \nReserve Bank of Minneapolis oversees over 600 banks in the Ninth \nDistrict. Without this amendment, it would oversee one--one--bank.\n  This is what my friend, the Senator from Texas, is talking about. You \nwould go from 600 banks--in an area that did not cause this financial \ncrisis, that was simply a victim of this financial crisis--you would \ntake 600 banks\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\nfrom them, send them out somewhere in a consolidated way to Washington \nand New York, and they would oversee one. All they would have is a bank \nholding company with over $50 billion in assets. This means connections \nto over 600 communities will be lost, not just in Minnesota, but in \nMontana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. That is \nthe region.\n  The Federal Reserve System was designed to prevent it from being \nfocused just on Wall Street, at the expense of Main Street. That is why \nthe Hutchison-Klobuchar amendment is so important, to put this bill in \na place where we not only get the great accountability of the bill, \nwith the great work that is being done in every single sector, so we do \nnot make these mistakes again that were made that brought us to the \nbrink of a financial crisis that allowed all of these banks to be on \nthe verge of collapse--and some of them, in fact, collapsed on Wall \nStreet--that is an important piece--but it is equally important to make \nsure our Main Street community banks get a fair shake and that the \nFederal Reserve in the regional areas of this country--from the Lone \nStar State to the North Star State--be allowed to continue to get the \ninformation they need to do their job.\n  I urge other Senators to join Senator Hutchison and me in supporting \nthis amendment, to make sure the voices of our community banks, the \nvoices of our small towns across the country and the local economies \nthey serve, continue to be heard.\n  Mr. President, I yield back to Senator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I call up the amendment Senator \nKlobuchar and I have just been discussing, and the amendment, as \nmodified, is at the desk.

Chairperson of the Corporation, as the \n     case may be, and the Office of Management and Budget, to be \n     necessary to reimburse the Federal Employees' Group Life \n     Insurance Fund for the cost to the Federal Employees' Group \n     Life Insurance Fund of providing benefits under this \n     subparagraph not otherwise paid for by a transferred employee \n     under subclause (I).\n       (IV) Credit for time enrolled in other plans.--For any \n     transferred employee, enrollment in a life insurance plan \n     administered by the agency from which the employee \n     transferred,

basis of prior employment by the \n     Office of Thrift Supervision; and\n       (2) may take such action as is appropriate in an individual \n     case to ensure that a transferred employee receives equitable \n     treatment, with respect to the status, tenure, pay, benefits \n     (other than benefits under programs administered by the \n     Office of Personnel Management), and accrued leave or \n     vacation time for prior periods of service with any Federal \n     agency of the transferred employee.\n       (l) Reorganization.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Comptroller of the

DISPOSITION OF AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) Authority of Director.--During the 90-day period \n     beginning on the transfer date, the Director of the Office of \n     Thrift Supervision--\n       (1) shall, solely for the purpose of winding up the affairs \n     of the Office of Thrift Supervision relating to any function \n     transferred to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, \n     the Corporation, or the Board of Governors under this title--\n       (A) manage the employees of the Office of Thrift \n     Supervision who have not yet been transferred and provide for \n     the payment of the compensation and benefits of the employees \n     that accrue before the date on which the employees are \n     transferred under this title; and\n       (B) manage any property of the Office of Thrift \n     Supervision, until the date on which the property is \n     transferred under section 323; and\n       (2) may take any other action necessary to wind up the \n     affairs of the Office of Thrift Supervision.\n       (b) Status of Director.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding the transfer of functions \n     under this subtitle, during the 90-day period beginning on \n     the transfer date, the Director of the Office of Thrift \n     Supervision shall retain and may exercise any authority \n     vested in the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision on \n     the day before the transfer date, only to the extent \n     necessary--\n       (A) to wind up the Office of Thrift Supervision; and\n       (B) to carry out the transfer under this subtitle during \n     such 90-day period.\n       (2) Other provisions.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the \n     Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision shall, during \n     the 90-day period beginning on the transfer date, continue to \n     be--\n       (A) treated as an officer of the United States; and\n       (B) entitled to receive compensation at the same annual \n     rate of basic pay that the Director of the Office of Thrift \n     Supervision received on the day before the transfer date.\n\n     SEC. 326. CONTINUATION OF SERVICES.\n\n       Any agency, department, or other instrumentality of the \n     United States, and any successor to any such agency, \n     department, or instrumentality, that was, before the transfer \n     date, providing support services to the Office of Thrift \n     Supervision in connection with functions transferred to the \n     Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Corporation or \n     the Board of Governors under this title, shall--\n       (1) continue to provide such services, subject to \n     reimbursement by the Office of the Comptroller of the \n     Currency, the Corporation, or the Board of Governors, until \n     the transfer of functions under this title is complete; and\n       (2) consult with the Comptroller of the Currency, the \n     Chairperson of the Corporation, or the Chairman of the Board \n     of Governors, as appropriate, to coordinate and facilitate a \n     prompt and orderly transition.\n       On page 459, line 17, strike ``bank'' and insert \n     ``nonmember bank, and the Board may, by order, exempt a \n     transaction of a State member bank,''.\n       On page 1045, line 19, insert after ``Currency'' the \n     following: ``, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System,''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are restoring section 605 of the \nunderlying bill. But I just think it is so important we take this \naction. Senator Klobuchar made a great statement about what would \nhappen with the Minnesota Fed going down to one bank. How are they \ngoing to have the input to talk to the Federal Reserve Board about \nmonetary policy if their supervision is over one bank? In fact, I \nunderstood they might be closing some of the local offices of the Fed \nbecause there will be nothing to supervise, and there will be no input, \nthere will be no knowledge of what is going on in some of the \ncommunities.\n  I think the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is in much the same \nsituation. It would also go down to one from about over 400. I will get \nthe numbers exactly by tomorrow. But that is just going to make a huge \ndifference in the knowledge base of our Federal Reserve Board. It would \nbe unthinkable to have monetary policy made without the input from all \nof our States that the regional banks give at this time.\n  The regional banks do a great job. I have dealt with many of the \nregional banks. They have great influence on monetary policy. The \npresidents of the regional banks rotate in the Open Market Committee \nthat makes our Fed decisions, and it is a very good system. It was \ncarefully put together so it would be a monetary system that represents \nour whole country. That is probably one of the reasons why our economy \nhas remained so stable through the years since the Federal Reserve was \ncreated.\n  So I appreciate the support of the Senator from Minnesota. This is a \ntruly bipartisan amendment. We have Republican cosponsors, Democratic \ncosponsors, and I am very hopeful we will have a vote early tomorrow in \nthis mix because I think this will add a lot of support from our \ncommunity banks to know they are not going to be shut out of access to \nthe Federal Reserve, and that the Federal Reserve banks will not be \nshut out from the community banks that are so important for the \nknowledge base of our monetary policy that is made and, frankly, is the \nmain stay of the stability of our economic system.\n  So I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for staying \nand letting us talk tonight, and I look forward to having the vote \ntomorrow on our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. First of all, let me just say regarding the Merkley-\nKlobuchar amendment to the Corker--not amendment to it, but the side-\nby-side--I wish to thank Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts and \nOlympia Snowe of Maine for cosponsoring that amendment on the \nunderwriting standards. I appreciate that very much.\n  Let me say to both of my colleagues, Senator Hutchison and Senator \nKlobuchar, as my colleagues know, I started out many months ago with \nthe idea of trying to come down to a single prudential regulator as one \nof the reforms in this bill. One of my concerns, as my colleagues know, \nwas we had some nine agencies. It was an alphabet soup out there with a \nlot of overlap in terms of actually who is responsible, who is going to \nbe accountable for things that occur. Obviously, we want to have a dual \nbanking system, the State banks and so forth, that don't want to be \ndrawn into a Federal system unnecessarily. So it began to break down \nfrom a single prudential regulator to maybe two.\n  I say this with great respect, but I would point out that the Federal \nReserve Board, of course, never implemented the requirements on \nmortgage lending that passed in 1994. A lot of the major financial \ninstitutions were basically unregulated institutions. My concern has \nbeen that the Fed did not exactly live up to its reputation during this \nperiod of time and contributed in major ways to the problems we are in \ntoday.\n  So I have great respect for their monetary function, which is the \ncore function; the payment system, which is their core function; their \nprimarily monetary function, determining the credibility of our \ncurrency. We had an earlier debate today on that very issue. The system \nwas established in 1914, 1917, almost 100 years ago.\n  At some point down the road we are going to need to think about the \nFederal Reserve System. We have two Federal Reserve regional banks in \nthe State of Missouri. The next one is in San Francisco. So I think the \nidea of thinking through how to make it more relevant is a legitimate \nissue. Obviously, we are not going to deal with\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nthat in this bill. We will leave that for a later Congress to work on \nthose issues.\n  I appreciate what my colleagues are trying to do, and I recognize the \nimportance at these regional levels that want to maintain some \ninvolvement in all of this for the reasons that Senator Klobuchar and \nSenator Hutchison have identified. Again, I know how we have been \ntalking about how to work on this a bit. Let me just make one plea. One \nof the major concerns that happened with this proliferation of \nregulators--it happened with AIG classically and in other cases; it \nhappened back in the thrift crisis days as well--is that industries go \nout and shop and they look for the regulator of least resistance, the \nones they can get away the most with. That was one of the major \nproblems that happened here.\n  So I want to avoid wherever possible this, what they call regulatory \narbitrage; that is, the shopping that goes on: Let me find the \nregulator that will let me get away with the most. Of course, the \nFederal Reserve has a lot to demonstrate in the years ahead that they \ngot the message, as they didn't do a very good job when they had the \nresponsibility.\n  So coming Congresses will have to keep an eye on this to make sure \nthey are going to not only want the job, but also to assume the \nresponsibility in doing this so we don't end up with problems running \nhaywire again. It is true, small banks didn't create a problem. Only \nabout 800 out of the 8,000 are regulated by the Federal Reserve. The \noverwhelming majority, of course, are not regulated by the Federal \nReserve. And, of course, they didn't do much in it because they didn't \nget involved in subprime lending. So it wasn't a problem. There was a \nreason they didn't get involved in subprime lending, which is for \nanother day, but nonetheless I understand they got in trouble with \ncommercial loans which was their major problem.\n  So I hope on the arbitrage issue that we try to create as much of a \nlevel playing field as possible so we don't find institutions shopping \naround because of assessment costs or other matters which can once \nagain find this migration into an area, not because it is a right place \nto be but because it is where you would prefer to be. The decision by \ninstitutions as to where they want to be ought not be the criteria by \nwhich we determine regulation. We have to have a better set of rules \nthan that or we end up back where we were before.\n  My colleagues have done a great job. They have been faithful in \nreaching out and trying to find accommodation where they can. So I am \nvery grateful to both of my colleagues and their cosponsors. We look \nforward to tomorrow having a vote. In the meantime, I have made an \nappeal to work on a couple of pieces of this thing. We would not go \ninto that right now. I thank them both and I thank my colleagues. It \nhas been a long day. We covered a lot of ground today--some major \namendments. We will vote tomorrow and move along.\n  Again, I make the point that this almost seems like a throwback. When \nI arrived some 30 years ago, this was the way we did things. We haven't \nhad a single tabling motion. We haven't had a single filibuster. I \nwould argue maybe this is one of the top two pieces of legislation to \nbe considered in this Congress on regulatory reform. It is a major \nundertaking. The patience and the involvement of my colleagues has been \nterrific, and I wish to thank them as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, can I just commend Senator Dodd and \nSenator Shelby for setting this tone. There was an article this weekend \nabout how we are working together on a major piece of legislation. As \nmy colleagues can see from the amendment, Senator Hutchison and I have \na bipartisan amendment, and I appreciate the chairman's openness to \nthis amendment and his kind words. I thank him for his work.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank you both.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would also say that this shouldn't \nbe a political bill. This should be a bill that is hammered out on the \nfloor and that does have bipartisan amendments because it is \ncomplicated. It does have to fit together a lot of different needs, \ndifferent regulatory standards, different types of banks and financial \ninstitutions and nonbank financial institutions. I hope it is going to \nbe a product that--regardless of how big the vote is--will make the \nsystem better. I think this process has been the best I have seen this \nyear in accommodating different concerns that have been raised by both \nsides.\n  So I thank the chairman and the ranking member for that. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there is no more debate this evening.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to speak \nin support of a package of amendments to the financial reform bill that \nis a result of an investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which I chair. I am submitting these amendments with \nthe support of my colleague, Senator Kaufman, who is not only a member \nof the subcommittee but also sat with me through hours of subcommittee \nhearings over a period of 2 weeks to examine some of the causes and \nconsequences of the crisis that nearly brought down our financial \nsystem, that necessitated billions of dollars in taxpayer money to \narrest, and that was a principal cause of the worst recession in nearly \na century.\n  We also are submitting the package as eight separate amendments to \nfacilitate their consideration.\n  Over nearly a year and a half, our bipartisan investigation examined \nmillions of pages of documents, conducted over 100 interviews, and \nculminated in four hearings during April, with over 2,500 pages of \nhearing exhibits and more than 30 hours of testimony. The American \npeople, having suffered so much in this crisis and having had to pay so \nmuch of their hard-earned money to keep it from getting even worse, \ndeserve to know what happened.\n  But more than establishing a record of what went wrong, we sought \ninformation to help keep us from repeating the same mistakes in the \nfuture. Like all of the subcommittee's investigations, our eye was on \nboth establishing a factual record and on using that record to support \nlegislation that would rebuild Main Street's defenses against the \nexcesses of Wall Street.\n  The recklessness, lax oversight, and conflicts of interest our \ninvestigation has uncovered cry out for legislated reform. The hearings \nrevealed that mortgage lenders such as Washington Mutual dumped \nhundreds of billions of dollars of high risk and sometimes fraudulent \nhome loans into the U.S. financial system; banking regulators, such as \nthe Office of Thrift Supervision, observed and understood the flaws and \nthe risks, failed to stop them, and even impeded the examination \nefforts of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; credit rating \nagencies, such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's, gave inflated ratings \nto risky structured finance products in an effort to keep market share \nand please their investment bank clients; and investment banks such as \nGoldman Sachs, assembled, marketed, and sold high risk mortgage-related \nproducts, while betting against the very products they created.\n  That is why I and Senator Kaufman have assembled a package of \namendments to the financial regulatory reform bill now before the \nSenate. We believe these amendments would help stop the bad loans, \nmisleading credit ratings, poor quality securitizations, and other \nproblems we saw in our investigation, as well as slow down the existing \nrevolving door for regulators. They are intended to strengthen an \nalready strong bill that so many of our colleagues have worked so hard \nto bring to this point. Let me outline briefly what our amendments \nwould accomplish.\n  Ban on Stated-Income and Negative Amortization Loans. First, in \nresponse to the hundreds of billions of dollars in high-risk mortgage \nloans that began this crisis and that were featured in our first \nhearing, our amendment would sharply limit two of the most dubious \npractices: stated-income loans and negatively amortizing loans. Stated-\nincome loans, also known as ``liar loans,'' are ones in which lenders \nallow borrowers simply to state their income on the loan applications \nwithout any confirmation of the borrower's income or assets. Negative \namortization loans\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\nare loans in which lenders allow the borrowers, for a specified period \nof time, to pay less than the monthly amount needed to cover the \ninterest, resulting in loan balances that increase rather than decrease \nover time, and then impose a much higher loan payment to make up for \nthe earlier low payments. That leads to payment shock and loan defaults \nby a large number of borrowers.\n  Washington Mutual, which was the case history in our first hearing, \nused stated-income and negative amortization loans with disastrous \nresults, leading to the largest bank failure in U.S. history. Stated-\nincome loans made up 90 percent of its home equity loans, for example, \nand 70 percent of its option ARMs, adjustable-rate mortgages, which \noften are negatively amortizing. Because both types of loans default at \nmuch higher rates than traditional 30-year fixed rate mortgages, \nlenders such as Washington Mutual quickly sold them to remove the risk \nfrom their books. But those high-risk loans did not disappear; they \nwere packaged into securities and sold to investors, spreading risk \nthroughout the financial system. Eventually, when housing prices \nstopped rising and borrowers could not refinance their mortgages, the \nloans defaulted in record numbers, the securities plummeted in value, \nand the securitization market crashed. Our amendment would ensure that \nstated-income and negative amortization loans could not again be used \nto foist high-risk, poor quality loans off on investors in \nsecuritizations.\n  Skin in the Game Securitizations. Second, our amendment would \nstrengthen an existing provision in the bill that requires financial \nfirms to retain some of the risk of the mortgage-backed securities they \nassemble. Too often, lenders such as Washington Mutual and investment \nbanks such as Goldman Sachs were in the business of packaging high-risk \nmortgages into structured financial instruments, slicing and dicing \nthem in new ways, obtaining credit ratings indicating that portions of \nthese instruments carried no more risk than Treasury securities but \nsignificantly higher returns, and then passing the risk to others, \nselling them to investors without retaining any risk on their books. In \nmany cases, as our hearings showed, these financial institutions knew \nthe products they had assembled were of dubious quality but were happy \nto sell them so long as they made a fee and knew that none of the risk \ncould come back to harm them. This short-term pursuit of profits, with \nno concern for customers or for the toxic securities polluting the \nfinancial system, so damaged the securitization markets that they are \nstill struggling to recover.\n  Our amendment would help stop these short-sighted and dangerous \nsecuritization practices by requiring financial institutions that \nsecuritize mortgages to keep some of their own skin in the game. It \nwould build on an existing provision in the Dodd bill by requiring that \nsecuritizers keep an ownership interest in the securities they create. \nWhile the existing provision would require securitizers to keep a 5 \npercent interest in the securitization as a whole, it does not specify \nwhether that 5 percent interest could be concentrated in a single \nportion, or tranche, of securities, such as the low-risk, supersenior \ntranche at the top or the high-risk equity tranche at the bottom, which \nis often what happened during the crisis. Our amendment would make it \nclear that the ownership interest would have to be distributed \nthroughout the capital structure--not just in a single tranche--so that \nthe securitizer's interests would be aligned with the interests of all \nlevels of investors buying the securities and would give the \nsecuritizer a stake in the success of all of the tranches, not just \none.\n  In addition, our amendment would make it clear that regulators could \nallow lenders to go below the 5 percent requirement only if they are \nincluding high-quality, low-risk assets in their securities, such as \n30-year fixed rate mortgages. Inclusion of this low-risk standard in \nthe provision allowing lenders to avoid the 5 percent requirement would \ncreate an enormous incentive for securitizers to use low-risk loans in \ntheir securitizations.\n  Gustafson Fix. Third, we would address the effects of a 1995 Supreme \nCourt ruling in the Gustafson case that has left investors in private \nsecurities offerings without protection from material misstatements or \nomissions in the security's prospectus. The Gustafson ruling \ninterpreted the securities laws as depriving purchasers in private \nofferings of the same protections against material misstatements or \nomissions that apply to public offerings. Our amendment would restore \ncongressional intent and close that loophole.\n  FDIC Examination Authority. Fourth, we would strengthen protections \nfor the Federal deposit insurance fund and against the need for \ntaxpayer bailouts by enhancing the FDIC's authority to initiate bank \nexams and enforcement actions. Under our amendment, the FDIC's \nchairperson would have the authority to initiate an exam, authority \nthat now rests solely with the FDIC's board, which is cumbersome and \nincludes other regulators that can prevent FDIC from acting quickly. \nDuring the subcommittee's second hearing, documents and testimony \nshowed how the Office of Thrift Supervision thwarted FDIC efforts to \nparticipate in examinations of Washington Mutual and take enforcement \naction to reduce the bank's unsustainable high-risk lending. The \nFederal agency charged with protecting the deposit insurance fund \nshould not have to jump through hoops to look at bank records or stop \nunsafe or unsound practices. Our amendment would make it clear that the \nFDIC can act decisively and quickly to deal with endangered financial \ninstitutions before their failure threatens the FDIC insurance fund or \nthe safety of the financial system.\n  Credit Rating Agencies. Fifth, our amendment would strengthen a host \nof provisions in the Dodd bill dealing with credit rating agencies. \nCredit rating agencies did not originate the bad loans or risky \nsecurities that led to the crisis. But their disastrously inaccurate \nratings made those loans and securities easy to sell and helped spread \nrisk throughout the financial system.\n  The subcommittee's third hearing showed a clear conflict of interest \ninherent in the credit rating agencies' business model: They are \ndependent for revenue upon the same financial firms whose products they \nare supposed to impartially rate. Our amendment would eliminate that \nconflict by requiring rating agencies to receive their fees through an \nintermediary to be established or designated by the SEC.\n  In addition, the amendment would strike the existing statutory ban \nthat prohibits direct SEC oversight of the credit rating models, \nmethodologies, and criteria that failed so catastrophically in this \ncrisis, and would explicitly direct the SEC to oversee them. We would \nalso require the agencies to rate as more risky products that, for \nexample, lack past performance data; that are provided by an issuer \nwith a history of issuing poorly performing instruments; that receive \nprior credit ratings already subject to downgrade; that consist of \nsynthetic instruments in which no income is being contributed by actual \nassets; or that consist of instruments whose complexity or novelty make \nit difficult to reliably predict their performance. We would also build \nupon a Dodd provision requiring that certain information be provided \nabout each credit rating issued by an agency, including a requirement \nthat ratings come with an ``expiration date'' indicating whether they \nare intended to be effective for more or less than a year. We would \nalso bar credit rating agencies from relying on due diligence reviews \nof financial products when the agencies have reason to believe that the \ndue diligence is inadequate. Together, these provisions would help \nensure that the SEC has the authority it needs to conduct vigorous and \nmeaningful oversight of credit rating agencies, instead of the current \nsystem that provides for SEC oversight in theory but denies it in \npractice.\n  Restriction on Synthetic Asset-Backed Securities. Sixth, we would \nrein in the pernicious effects of synthetic asset-backed securities on \nthe financial system. These securities contain no real assets. Their \nvalue is tied to the assets that they reference, but the securitizer \nand the investors need not, and often do not, have any economic \ninterest in those assets. Too often, these instruments have amounted to \nnothing more than bets on whether a security or other asset would go up \nor down in value. Such transactions,\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nusually embodied in collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, greatly \nmagnified the damage that resulted when poor quality mortgage-backed \nsecurities defaulted and helped bring down storied financial firms such \nas Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.\n  Under our amendment, synthetic asset-backed securities that lack any \nsubstantial or material economic purpose other than speculation on the \nvalue or condition of referenced assets could no longer be sold. Wall \nStreet firms that claim a synthetic asset-backed security has a \nsubstantial economic benefit apart from wagering on asset values will \nhave an opportunity to prove those claims to the SEC. We must end the \npollution of the U.S. financial system with these dangerous financial \ninstruments that spread risk without adding anything of substance to \nthe real economy.\n  Slowing the Revolving Door. Seventh, we would seek to slow down the \nrevolving door between financial regulatory agencies and the financial \nsector by requiring a 1-year ``cooling off'' period before a Federal \nfinancial regulator could work for a financial institution he or she \nregulated. In 2005, we enacted a 1-year cooling off period for bank \nexaminers, after Riggs Bank hired the bank examiner who used to oversee \nits operations and who took some questionable regulatory actions before \nswitching his employment. That law has been on the books for 5 years, \nproviding a healthy deterrent to bank examiners that get too close to \nthe banks they regulate. Our amendment would expand this approach to \nall Federal financial regulators, from the Federal Reserve to the SEC \nto the CFTC to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It would \nprevent a regulator who participated personally and substantially in \nthe regulation or oversight of a particular financial institution or \ntook an enforcement action against a specific financial institution \nfrom taking a job with the same institution for at least a year.\n  Foreign Bank Anti-Tax Evasion Remedy. Finally, based upon a number of \nprevious subcommittee investigations showing how some foreign banks \nhave been deliberately assisting U.S. clients to evade U.S. taxes, our \namendment would give the Treasury Department discretionary authority to \ntake measures against foreign financial institutions or foreign \njurisdictions that impede U.S. tax enforcement. Those measures include \nsuch actions as imposing additional recordkeeping requirements, \nrefusing to honor credit cards issued by a foreign bank or, in the most \nextreme cases, prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from doing \nbusiness with the offending foreign financial institution or \njurisdiction. This provision would build upon a Patriot Act provision \nthat has proven highly effective in stopping foreign banks from \nengaging in money laundering activities and would take the same \napproach in discouraging foreign banks from aiding or abetting tax \nevasion.\n  We offer this amendment in the hope of improving what is already a \nstrong bill, either as a package or divided into its separate elements. \nIt is not all that needs to be done--for example, I have joined with \nSenator Merkley in an amendment submitted to limit proprietary trading \nand conflicts of interest by financial institutions--additional \nproblems examined during the subcommittee hearings. It is clear that \nthe evidence revealed by the subcommittee's lengthy investigation and \nfour hearings requires Congress to act now to protect Main Street from \nfinancial abuses that have so damaged our economy and American \nfamilies.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of an \namendment I am offering to the Wall Street reform bill.\n  The Dodd-Lincoln bill, as currently drafted, takes major steps to \nreform the $900 trillion derivative markets. It would require every \ntrade to be reported in real time to the CFTC; require all cleared \ncontracts to be traded on an exchange or on a swap execution facility; \nrequire speculative position limits set in ``aggregate'' for each \ncommodity, instead of contract by contract; and require foreign boards \nof trade to adhere to minimum standards comparable to those in the \nUnited States, including reporting requirements--this provision is \ndesigned to address the underlying problem of the so-called London \nLoophole.\n  I very much support these provisions. However, I am concerned that \nthe bill doesn't go far enough to address the London loophole. This \nloophole has allowed for the trading of U.S. energy commodities--such \nas crude oil--on foreign exchanges without strong oversight from U.S. \nregulators.\n  This means that there is no cop on the beat to shield U.S. oil prices \nfrom manipulation or excessive speculation when they are traded in \nforeign markets, like commodities exchanges in London or Shanghai.\n  The amendment I am proposing would allow CFTC to require foreign \nboards of trade to register with CFTC, which would give CFTC the \nenforcement authority it needs. This provision was in President Obama's \noriginal proposed financial reform bill, and it is strongly supported \nby CFTC Chairman Gensler.\n  First, let me explain what has become known as the London loophole.\n  As Congress has taken steps to improve regulatory oversight of \ndomestic commodity trading markets, Wall Street traders have \nincreasingly turned to offshore markets to electronically trade U.S. \nenergy futures--in order to evade American market oversight and \nspeculation limits.\n  This new regulatory loophole earned its nickname--the London \nloophole--because America's most important crude oil contract--known as \nWest Texas Intermediate--is today traded on the Intercontinental \nExchange in London. This contract has what is called a price discovery \nimpact because it is commonly referenced as the standard market price \nof oil.\n  The practical implication of this is that U.S. traders can use \nelectronic exchanges based overseas to artificially drive up the prices \nof U.S. commodities--without any consequences from our Nation's market \nregulators. This is a major problem.\n  A 2008 CFTC report found that traders using this London exchange to \ntrade U.S. crude oil futures held positions far larger than would be \nallowed by American regulators. In fact, from 2006 to 2008 at least one \ntrader position exceeded U.S. speculation limits every single week on \nthe London exchange, and British regulators had done nothing about it.\n  The good news is that some steps have been taken administratively to \naddress this loophole.\n  In 2008, the CFTC negotiated an agreement with British regulators to \nbring greater oversight to American commodities contracts traded in \nLondon. The agreement called for speculation limits for the electronic \ntrading of U.S. energy commodities--like crude oil--on foreign \nexchanges, and required recording-keeping and an audit trail. But CFTC \nhas limited legal authority to enforce this agreement.\n  Bottom Line: We need to make sure the CFTC can oversee trading of \nAmerican commodities, whether it happens through a computer server \nlocated on Wall Street or in Shanghai.\n  The Dodd-Lincoln bill currently before us does include some important \nprovisions to help close the London loophole. As drafted, the bill will \nrequire foreign boards of trade that provide access to American traders \nto comply with comparable rules enforced by a foreign regulator, \npublish trading information daily, supply data to CFTC, and enforce \nposition limits.\n  However, CFTC may be unable to force a Foreign Board of Trade to \ncomply with these requirements.\n  This is because the CFTC's current method of overseeing foreign \nexchanges has tenuous legal underpinnings, due to a Commodity Exchange \nAct provision forbidding CFTC from ``regulating'' foreign boards of \ntrade.\n  In many instances, the CFTC can take action against a U.S. trader on \na foreign exchange to prevent manipulation or excessive speculation \nonly with the cooperation and consent of the foreign regulator. The \nother, more controversial option is for the CFTC to completely ban the \nforeign exchange from all U.S. operations. Not surprisingly, the CFTC \noften shies away from enforcement, in the face of these regulatory \nobstacles.\n  That is why I am offering a proposal to allow CFTC to require foreign \nboards of trade to register with CFTC, which would give CFTC the \nenforcement authority it needs.\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\n  Here are the benefits of this amendment:\n  First, the registration process itself would give CFTC the authority \nto impose appropriate regulatory requirements as a condition of \nregistration.\n  Second, a formal registration process would assure that foreign \nboards of trade all follow the same set of rules.\n  Third, the registration process would provide a much clearer basis \nfor CFTC decisions to refuse or withdraw permission to foreign boards \nof trade wishing to allow American traders on their exchange.\n  Finally, and most importantly, all of CFTC's existing enforcement \nauthorities apply to registered entities under the Commodity Exchange \nAct.\n  This amendment would therefore allow CFTC to enforce its own statute \nwith regard to foreign exchanges operating in the United States.\n  This is a very moderate, practical amendment to assure that we give \nCFTC the authority to enforce the statutory provisions already in the \nproposed legislation. It would only provide the CFTC with equivalent \nauthority to that held by virtually all foreign futures regulators--\nincluding the British.\n  I have worked for many years to bring about meaningful regulation of \nthe derivatives markets, and that is why I am so pleased that Senators \nLincoln and Dodd have brought forward the strongest derivatives \nregulatory proposal considered by this Congress.\n  But as we crack down on traders in our markets, we must be ever \nvigilant to assure that traders sitting on Wall Street do not avoid our \nregulations by trading on electronic exchanges with computer servers in \nLondon, or Dubai, or Singapore.\n  This amendment would improve the London loophole provisions in the \nDodd-Lincoln bill, by making those provisions more easily enforceable.\n  It is the final piece necessary to close the London loophole, \nensuring that our government has what it needs to protect American \nmarkets from manipulation and excessive speculation, no matter where \nU.S. energy commodities are traded.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, \nMay 12, following any leader time, the Senate then resume consideration \nof S. 3217, and that the time until 10 a.m. be for debate with respect \nto the following three amendments, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the leaders or their designees; that at 10 a.m., the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the amendments in the order \nlisted, with no amendments in order to the amendments prior to a vote, \nwith 2 minutes of debate prior to the succeeding votes and with the \nsucceeding votes limited to 10 minutes: Merkley amendment No. 3962, \nCorker amendment No 3955, Hutchison-Klobuchar amendment No. 3759, as \nmodified; provided further, that the next two amendments in order would \nbe the Landrieu-Isakson amendment regarding risk retention and the \nSnowe-Landrieu amendment No. 3918.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I recently declined to sign a letter \nthat is circulating, in which certain Senators pledge not to place \n``secret'' holds on legislation and nominations. The letter features a \nvery broad promise by the signers to refrain from asking the leadership \nto delay Senate consideration of a matter, without a full public \nexplanation of the request.\n  When a small minority--often a minority of one--abuses senatorial \ncourtesy and misuses anonymous holds to indefinitely delay action on \nmatters, then I am as adamant as any of my colleagues in insisting that \nSenators should come to the Senate floor and make their objections \nknown. When abuses of this courtesy have occurred, I have supported \nefforts by others, and proposed some of my own, to ignore holds after a \ncertain period of time. I am ready to support such efforts again.\n  But I also believe that there are situations when it is appropriate \nand even important for Senators to raise a private objection to the \nimmediate consideration of a matter with the leadership and to request \na reasonable amount of time to try to have concerns addressed. There \nare times when Senators put holds on nominations or bills not to delay \naction but to be notified before a matter is coming to the floor so \nthat they can prepare amendments or more easily plan schedules. These \nare courtesies afforded to all Senators. In many cases, there is \nnothing nefarious or diabolical about reasonable requests for holds. \nCertainly, public disclosures are not necessary every time Senators \nwant to slightly alter the Senate schedule for the coming week. \nCertainly, public disclosures are not necessary every time Senators \nrequest consultation or advanced notification on a matter coming to the \nfloor.\n  I appreciate that some Senators may be frustrated with what they \nbelieve are abuses of the Senate rules, but I also hope that Senators \nwill endeavor to understand--before they suggest pledges or propose \nless than well-reasoned changes--that the rules, precedents, customs, \npractices, traditions, and courtesies of the Senate have been forged \nover hundreds of years and after much trial and experience. After all, \nthe benefit of this experience is to preserve the institutional \nprotection of all Senators and their efforts to fairly represent the \npeople of their States. The Senate is not the House of Representatives \nand was never intended to function as such. The Senate's purpose is to \ncarefully and critically examine, not to expedite.\n  Unfortunately, when the Senate rules and customs are abused and \nSenators become frustrated, it can lead to ill-considered changes, and \nsometimes the pendulum can swing too far. Let us try to keep the \ninstitutional purpose of the Senate uppermost in mind. The Nation \ncertainly requires the extended debate and deliberation that those \ntime-honored rules, precedents, and customs are designed to \nguarantee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/11/senate-section/article/S3532-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3532-S3533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            LRA DISARMAMENT AND NORTHERN UGANDA RECOVERY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for more than 20 years, a group called the \nLord's Resistance Army, or LRA, has operated in central Africa, \nperpetrating some of the most horrific acts of violence one can \nenvision. The LRA began as a rebel group saying it drew its guidance \nfrom the Ten Commandments, but in the two decades since it began, it \nhas routinely violated those commandments in the most gruesome and \nunimaginable ways. Its continued campaign of violence calls out for \nCongress and the United States to act.\n  Recently the United Nations uncovered the latest of the LRA's violent \nacts, the rounding up and massacring of more than 100 innocent \nvillagers in a remote part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The \nNew York Times reported on May 1 that U.N. officials had learned of the \nmassacre, which occurred in February. U.N. officials interviewed \nseveral witnesses, including one woman whose lips were cut off by LRA \nrebels, who told the woman she was talking too much.\n  The LRA's actions were described in brutally clear terms in a recent \nHuman Rights Watch report entitled ``Trail of Death.'' In it Human \nRights Watch investigators describe the typical tactics, techniques, \nand procedures of this terrible group of people:\n\n       The LRA used similar tactics in each village they attacked \n     during their four-day operation: they pretended to be \n     Congolese and Ugandan army soldiers on patrol, reassured \n     people in broken Lingala (the common language of northern \n     Congo) not to be afraid, and, once people had gathered, \n     captured their victims and tied them up. LRA combatants \n     specifically searched out areas where people might gather--\n     such as markets, churches, and water points--and repeatedly \n     asked those they encountered about the location of schools, \n     indicating that one of their objectives was to abduct \n     children. Those who were abducted, including many children \n     aged 10 to 15 years old, were tied up with ropes or metal \n     wire at the waist, often\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\n     in human chains of five to 15 people. They were made to carry \n     the goods the LRA had pillaged and then forced to march off \n     with them. Anyone who refused, walked too slowly, or who \n     tried to escape was killed. Children were not spared.\n\n  The LRA got its start in Uganda, where it has done and continues to \ndo horrific damage. At one time, about 2 million Ugandans were \ndisplaced from their homes by LRA violence; the rebels massacred, \nmutilated and abducted civilians, and forced many into sexual \nservitude; and an estimated 66,000 Ugandan children were forced to \nfight for the group.\n  Uganda is still recovering from the LRA's campaign of violence. \nHaving been forced out of Uganda, LRA bands have moved into neighboring \nnations, including Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the \nCentral African Republic--countries already ravaged by man-made and \nnatural disasters. As the latest report shows, it is still a grave \nthreat. As John Holmes, the U.N. under secretary general for \nhumanitarian affairs, put it, ``they are still capable of wreaking \nabsolute havoc--and they still do.''\n  Because of the havoc the LRA has caused across central Africa, I am \none of more than 60 Senators who have cosponsored S. 1067, the LRA \nDisarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act, introduced by Senators \nFeingold and Brownback. The act would require that within 6 months, the \nUnited States develop a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the \nLRA, including an outline of steps to protect the civilian population \nagainst LRA violence. The act would authorize funding to provide \nhumanitarian assistance in areas affected by the LRA. And it would \nprovide assistance for reconstruction and for promotion of justice and \nreconciliation in areas of Uganda recovering from the LRA's \ndepredations.\n  This legislation would establish, as a matter of policy, a U.S. \ncommitment to working with regional governments to end the conflict in \nUganda and surrounding nations by providing support to multilateral \nefforts to protect civilians, apprehend top LRA leaders and disarm \ntheir followers; providing humanitarian assistance to relieve the \nimmense suffering the LRA has caused; and supporting efforts to promote \njustice and reconciliation in the region affected by LRA violence.\n  We have delayed too long in enacting this legislation. The Senate \npassed this important legislation in March, and the House Foreign \nAffairs Committee favorably reported the bill to the full House last \nweek. I am hopeful that the committee's approval signals the likelihood \nof approval by the full House soon. I hope our colleagues in the House \nwill move swiftly to pass this legislation and send it to the President \nfor his signature; to do anything less would be a failure to act with \nthe urgency, and the humanity, that the LRA's campaign of terror \ndemands.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a recent New York Times \narticle on this incident be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 2010]\n\n            U.N. Says Congo Rebels Killed Scores in Village\n\n                         (By Jeffrey Gettleman)\n\n       Kisangani, Congo--United Nations officials said Saturday \n     that the Lord's Resistance Army rebel force killed up to l00 \n     people in a previously unreported massacre in the remote \n     northeastern corner of this country.\n       Details are still emerging of exactly what happened. But \n     according to John Holmes, the United Nation's top \n     humanitarian official, the L.R.A. struck a small village in \n     February, two months after it killed more than 300 people \n     from several villages in the surrounding area.\n       United Nations investigators have spoken with several \n     witnesses and victims of the massacre in February, including \n     two fishermen who said they saw dozens of bodies.\n       But the investigators have been unable to reach the exact \n     location because of the difficulties of traveling in one of \n     the most rugged and isolated corners of Africa.\n       Mr. Holmes said that while recent military operations may \n     have weakened the L.R.A., ``they are still capable of \n     wreaking absolute havoc--and they still do.''\n       He said he learned about the February attack on Saturday, \n     when he met with local authorities and victims in Niangara, \n     an old trading post hidden away in the Congolese jungle that \n     has recently been ringed by roving bands of L.R.A. marauders.\n       One of the people he met was a young woman whose lips had \n     been sliced off last month. She was attacked by rebels while \n     working in her field, she said Saturday, sitting in a \n     hospital bed, her face a mask of gauze and tape.\n       ``They told me I was talking too much,'' she said.\n       The L.R.A. has been waging a brutal and bizarre rebellion \n     for more than 20 years, starting in northern Uganda in the \n     late 1980s.\n       Originally, it said it was guided by the Ten Commandments, \n     but soon it was breaking every one, massacring and mutilating \n     civilians and becoming notorious for kidnapping young \n     children and turning them into 4-foot-tall killing machines.\n       The Ugandan Army eventually drove the L.R.A. out of Uganda \n     but the rebels simply marched into neighboring northeastern \n     Congo, where they set up bases in isolated areas.\n       Recently, the Ugandan military has killed dozens of \n     fighters hiding out in Congo and the Central African \n     Republic, though the L.R.A.'s leader, Joseph Kony, who has \n     been indicted by the International Criminal Court on crimes \n     against humanity, is still on the loose.\n       In the December massacre, the L.R.A. killed more than 300 \n     people in a brutal recruitment campaign near Niangara, in \n     which a few dozen rebel fighters abducted hundreds of \n     civilians, marching them in a human chain from village to \n     village. Along the way, the fighters beat to death men, women \n     and children they did not want to keep in their ranks.\n       ``For anyone saying that the L.R.A. is finished, I would be \n     careful not to count them out,'' Mr. Holmes said. ``They have \n     an amazing capacity to regenerate themselves, especially by \n     kidnapping children.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/11/senate-section/article/S3533-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3533-S3534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL ALCOHOL- AND OTHER DRUG-RELATED BIRTH DEFECTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nAlcohol and Other Drug-Related Birth Defects Week. Substance abuse \nduring pregnancy is the leading known cause of birth defects and mental \nretardation in the United States. Each year thousands of babies are \nborn with the physical signs and intellectual disabilities related to \nprenatal substance abuse.\n  Of all the substances of abuse--including heroin, cocaine, and \nmarijuana--alcohol produces the most serious physical and mental \neffects in the fetus, according to the Institute of Medicine. Referred \nto as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, or FASD, the potential outcomes \nof alcohol abuse during pregnancy include mental retardation, growth \ndeficits, altered facial characteristics, organ defects, behavioral \nproblems, delayed motor skills, and various learning disabilities.\n  Researchers estimate that more than 3 million Americans live with an \nFASD and as many as 40,000 infants are annually born with an FASD. The \ntragedy of alcohol- and other drug-related birth defects is entirely \npreventable and must be addressed. We must increase efforts to reach \nout to all women of childbearing age and connect those most at risk to \ntreatment and counseling services. Increased awareness and education \nabout the effects of substance abuse during pregnancy is the best way \nto reduce the prevalence of devastating birth defects.\n  I recently joined Senators Murkowski, Inouye, and Landrieu in \nintroducing the Advancing FASD Research, Prevention, and Services Act, \nin an effort to improve the surveillance, identification, and \nprevention of FASD. This legislation will make grants available to \nfederally qualified health centers to provide training to health care \nproviders on identifying and educating women who are at risk for \nalcohol consumption during pregnancy and on screening children for \nFASD. Through national public and education campaigns, this bill will \nreach millions and raise awareness of the risks associated with alcohol \nconsumption during pregnancy.\n  There is no cure for FASD and other drug-related birth defects. Yet \nthe devastating effects are entirely preventable when pregnant women \nabstain from substance use. It is therefore imperative to reach at-risk \nwomen and ensure they have knowledge of the dangers of substance abuse, \nas well as access to quality reproductive and prenatal care. When we \nmove past the stigma associated with this disease, we can truly help \nthose and their families who are affected get the health, education, \ncounseling, and support services they need and deserve.\n  I have long supported efforts to put an end to this entirely \npreventable and destructive disease. In my home State of South Dakota, \nover 7,800 individuals are suspected of living with an FASD.\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\n     With the leadership of the health professionals at our \n     esteemed universities, parents, and teachers, among countless \n     others, we have made some important progress in addressing \n     this issue. However, there is more work to be done to prevent \n     alcohol- and other drug-related birth defects in South Dakota \n     and at the national level. The goal is to one day entirely \n     eliminate the heartbreaking, lifelong effects of fetal \n     alcohol and drug exposure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/11/senate-section/article/S3534-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3534-S3535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SUDAN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there are many important issues that \ndemand Congress's attention, but one that we cannot afford to neglect \nthe situation is Sudan. We are in the midst of a decisive period that \nwill determine the future of that country and shape the conflicts that \nhave long besieged its people.\n  In less than 9 months, the people of South Sudan will hold their \nreferendum on self-determination, with the option to forge an \nindependent state. There are serious challenges involved with the \nholding of that referendum and any subsequent transition to \nindependence. The potential for instability is high.\n  Meanwhile, the conflict in Darfur remains unresolved and is likely to \nget worse. Over 2 million displaced people are still living in camps, \nand earlier this week, one of the largest rebel groups in Darfur \nsuspended their involvement in peace talks after alleging that the \nSudanese Government has launched fresh attacks.\n  Finally, the peace in eastern Sudan, one of the country's most \nimpoverished regions, continues to be fragile. The dynamics in each of \nSudan's regions and the future of the country in general will have \nprofound implications for neighboring countries, as well as the wider \nregion.\n  Last month, the people of Sudan held their first multiparty elections \nin 24 years. I join the White House in commending the Sudanese people \nfor their efforts to make these elections peaceful and meaningful, and \nI am pleased that the voting witnessed no major armed violence. \nHowever, I was disappointed by statements of the U.S. Special Envoy in \nthe runup to the election suggesting that the elections would be ``as \nfree and as fair as possible.'' This was clearly not the case.\n  For months beforehand, many of us had expressed concern about the \npolitical, security, and logistical challenges to credible elections. \nThe environment was clearly not conducive for opposition parties to \nfreely operate and campaign, nor was it conducive for all voters to \nsafely and confidently go to the polls. The inability of the government \nboth in the north and in the south--to adequately address the \nsignificant infrastructure and logistical challenges resulted in \ndecreased voter access.\n  There is good reason for the international community to question the \nextent to which the results reflect the will of the Sudanese people. \nFurthermore, the fact that the winner of the Presidential election has \nbeen indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes is \nproblematic. In no way should the international community allow this \noutcome to take away from the serious charges President Bashir faces.\n  The White House statement after the Sudanese election was thoughtful \nand balanced. It acknowledged the significant problems with the process \nbut also distinguished between the credibility of elections and the \npotential still for democratic progress. These elections were seriously \nflawed, but indeed there was evidence of the beginnings of citizen \nengagement at the local levels that did not exist before. It will be \nimportant to build on that momentum going forward.\n  The White House statement rightly pointed out that continued pressure \nwill be critical to make progress for the civil and political rights of \nall Sudanese people. That pressure must come first and foremost from \nwithin the country, but there remains an important role for the United \nStates and other members of the international community.\n  Over the last year, I have been concerned at times that the Obama \nadministration has not exerted the requisite pressure to hold Khartoum \naccountable for a failure to live up to its commitments. There are too \nmany promises, commitments, and agreements broken without consequence. \nTheoretically, I am not opposed to engaging the Government of Sudan, \nbut I share Nicholas Kristof's concern that our engagement ``ends up as \na policy to go soft on [Bashir] and to reduce pressure on Khartoum to \nhonor the referendum in the south.''\n  With the election now concluded, the international community must \nredouble its efforts to prepare for South Sudan's referendum and its \noutcome, whatever that may be. It is critical that this referendum be \nheld on time and that it be held as fairly and peacefully as possible.\n  In order for this to happen, there is much work to be done both \nlogistically and politically including efforts to resolve the \noutstanding issues the CPA, as well as ambiguous postreferenda matters, \nsuch as resource allocation and citizenship rights. In the case of \nseparation, these two issues are likely to be the most inflammatory and \ndifficult to address. The international community, as well as countries \nin the region, has an active role to play in advancing related \nnegotiations and preparations for the referendum. Sudan's neighboring \nstates especially have interests at stake that could be directly \naffected by either a peaceful separation or a return to conflict.\n  We must see serious and detailed contingency planning for all \npossible scenarios, both pre- and post-referendum and they must get \nunderway now. While the most obvious tripwire for a return to war would \nbe a delay of the referendum, planning must also include clear guidance \non how to deal with the possibility that the different actors could \nseek to manipulate, or disrupt, the results of that referendum.\n  I continue to be concerned that the NCP could foment insecurity in \nthe south as it has done in the past, but I am particularly concerned \nby the internal security challenges within South Sudan. They are \nconsiderable and will not be easily resolved. Humanitarian \norganizations reported that over 2,500 people were killed and an \nadditional 350,000 were displaced by interethnic and communal violence \nwithin southern Sudan throughout 2009. The Lord's Resistance Army \ncontinues to wreak havoc on communities in the southwestern corner of \nthe country. In his testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee in \nFebruary, the Director of National Intelligence identified South Sudan \nas the area in which ``a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to \noccur.''\n  The task of transforming the army and police into modern security \norgans that protect civilians and respect human rights is daunting but \nvital. We need to roll up our sleeves and get to work on helping the \nSouth Sudanese to accomplish this task, while empowering UNMIS in the \nmeantime to better protect civilians and monitor flashpoints.\n  Of course security sector reform cannot be separated from the other \ngovernance and economic challenges facing the region. Most South \nSudanese have not seen much progress in the 5 years since the signing \nof the CPA. Communities continue to lack access to basic services \nincluding water, health, and infrastructure. It is no secret that the \nGovernment of South Sudan still has limited capacity, and in some cases \nlimited will, to provide this assistance or manage its own revenues. \nThis lack of will and capacity concerns me particularly because it is \nclosely linked with the growing problem of corruption within the \ngovernment. A lack of transparency plagues this young government by \ncomplicating and undermining efforts to distribute services and reform \nthe security services.\n  This is not cause for delaying the referendum, as to do so would be a \nretreat from our commitment as guarantors of the CPA and could be seen \nas a reason to abrogate the agreement by either party. Instead, it is \ncause for increasing our efforts in South Sudan and helping the region \nto reach a basic level of political and economic stability.\n  I am pleased that the Obama administration is in the process of \nscaling up our diplomatic and development personnel and activities in \nSouth Sudan to prepare for the referendum and its aftermath. I urge \nother governments to do the same, if they are not already. The regional \nstates and international community all have a stake in facilitating an \norderly process and preventing an outbreak of violence. It is\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\nin our interest to work together and coordinate our efforts to help the \nSouth Sudanese meet the many challenges in front of them.\n  Finally, as we do this, we should not turn our backs on the other \nconflicts within Sudan, particularly the situation in Darfur. We have \nseen in the past how the National Congress Party can effectively \nmanipulate the international community's narrow focus on one region or \nconflict at the expense of another. Despite some small successes, the \nsituation in Darfur is unresolved and the events of recent weeks have \nshown that a peace deal remains elusive. The situation could become \nmore difficult and complex to resolve over time, especially if the CPA \ncollapses and the north-south war is reignited.\n  The Obama administration must maintain its focus on building a \ncredible peace process for Darfur at the same time that it seeks to \nshore up the CPA. We need to keep the pressure on to ensure there is a \ncessation of attacks and to begin seriously addressing the legitimate \ngrievances of Darfurians.\n  Mr. President, in the critical months ahead, we need to have a bold, \ncomprehensive approach toward all of Sudan that brings resources to \nbear and ensures consistent, high-level engagement from the White House \nas well as here in Congress. To that end, I will continue to do my \npart, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/11/senate-section/article/S3535-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            RECOGNIZING THE HARRISON PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Under the leadership of superintendant Jerry \nMoody, Harrison was named the top public school district in the country \nfor markets of median home price under $100,000. Harrison was the only \nArkansas school district to make Forbes' top 10 list.\n  Harrison received this designation based on criteria including \nquality of education, affordable housing, and the unemployment rate. \nCalling Harrison a ``rural gem,'' the magazine commented that ``with \nits well-developed gifted and talented program and an intimate 12.5-to-\n1 student-teacher ratio, Harrison offers serious book learning in a \nmountain idyll.''\n  Forbes has found out what Harrison residents have known for years: \nthat hard work, dedication, and a commitment to education are integral \nto a community's success.

I am committed to restoring balance in our efforts to combat \nthe drug problems that plague our communities. While I remain steadfast \nin my commitment to continue our strong enforcement efforts, especially \nalong the southwest border, I directed the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy to reengage in efforts to prevent drug use and addiction \nand to make treatment available for those who seek recovery. This new, \nbalanced approach will expand efforts for the three critical ways that \nwe can address the drug problem: prevention, treatment, and law \nenforcement.\n  Drug use endangers the health and safety of every American, depletes \nfinancial and human resources, and deadens the spirit of many of our \ncommunities. Whether struggling with an addiction, worrying about a \nloved one's substance abuse, or being a victim of drug-related crime, \nmillions of people in this country live with the devastating impact of \nillicit drug use every day. This stark reality demands a new direction \nin drug policy--one based on common sense, sound science, and practical \nexperience. That is why my new Strategy includes efforts to educate \nyoung people who are the most at-risk about the dangers of substance \nabuse, allocates unprecedented funding for treatment efforts in \nfederally qualified health centers, reinvigorates drug courts and other \ncriminal justice innovations, and strengthens our enforcement efforts \nto rid our streets of the drug dealers who infect our communities.\n  I am confident that if we take these needed steps, we will make our \ncountry stronger, our people healthier, and our streets safer. If we \nboost community-based prevention efforts, expand treatment \nopportunities, strengthen law enforcement capabilities, and work \ncollaboratively with our global partners, we will reduce drug use and \nits resulting damage.\n  While I am proud of the new direction described here, a well-crafted \nstrategy is only as successful as its implementation. To succeed, we \nwill need to rely on the hard work, dedication, and perseverance of \nevery concerned American. I look forward to working with the Congress, \nFederal, State, and local officials, tribal leaders, and citizens \nacross the country as we implement this Strategy and make our \ncommunities better places to live, work, and raise our families.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 11, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/11/senate-section/article/S3535-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 2802.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Brown of Ohio):\n  S. 3336. A bill to amend the internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of bonds issued to finance renewable energy resources \nfacilities, conservation and efficiency facilities, and other specified \ngreenhouse gas emission technologies; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Private \nActivity Renewable Energy Bonds Act, legislation to enable low-cost \nPrivate Activity Bond financing for businesses and local governments \nwhich seek to create renewable, clean and efficient sources of energy.\n  The bill is cosponsored by Senator Brown of Ohio. In the United \nStates House of Representatives, Congressman Mike Thompson has \nintroduced a bipartisan companion bill cosponsored by Representatives \nDean Heller and Mary Bono Mack.\n  The bill is supported by a host of business and government leaders \nand renewable energy companies including the Solar Energy Industries \nAssociation, Solar Millennium, Nano Solar, the National Association of \nEnergy Service Companies, EnLink GeoEnergy, Johnson Controls, A123 \nSystems, the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, \nand the U.S. Fuel Cell Council, as well as California Treasurer Bill \nLockyer.\n  The bill provides businesses access to low interest tax free Private \nActivity Bonds, in order to fund projects that generate renewable \nenergy; produce energy or water savings, or; develop highly efficient \nvehicles.\n  To promote such activity in a fiscally responsible manner, the \nlegislation caps the value of bonds at $2.5 billion annually. This \nrepresents the investment necessary to replace at least one percent of \nU.S. electricity generation with renewable sources over the next ten \nyears.\n  Private Activity Bonds have long been used to generate private \ninvolvement and investment in critically important infrastructure for \nour Nation--from wharves to airports, intercity rail to solid waste \ndisposal facilities and hospitals.\n  In this century, however, we have new national goals.\n  Renewable, clean and efficient energy projects will produce jobs, get \nour economy back-on-track and sustain us as the global leader of a \ngreener century.\n  These projects, however, require significant front-end capital \ninvestment to which the federal government cannot be the sole provider. \nPrivate Activity Bonds can prove a critical tool in garnering private \ninvestment, because their interest rates typically run a few percent \npoints under commercially available loans.\n  Investors have long responded to this type of incentive. According to \nthe IRS, Private Activity Bond issuance in 2007 was over $130 billion--\nsupplying capital to our markets, providing the financing to get \nprojects off the ground.\n  Projects financed in part by Private Activity Bonds include additions \nto the San Jose and San Francisco International Airports, the Capitol \nBeltway High Occupancy Vehicle lanes, infrastructure improvements to \nthe Port of Seattle, and upgrades to Children's Hospital of Orange \nCounty, Catholic Healthcare West in San Francisco, and many, many \nimportant facilities and projects.\n  With proper access to capital, we've already seen partnerships \nbetween States, municipalities and businesses develop into successful \nrenewable energy programs.\n  In California, Energy Financing Districts finance residents who \nchoose to install clean energy projects such as distributed solar \npanels on their homes.\n  The cost of the solar panel installation or other device is paid back \nthrough an increase in property tax only for those property owners who \nchoose to participate in the program.\n  Now, going solar or installing a geothermal heat pump, which once \ncost tens of thousands of dollars upfront, has little or no upfront \ncost to the property owner. It is no wonder why 150 of these programs \nhave been established throughout the country.\n  This low cost solar opportunity is just one example of the type of \nprograms this bill seeks to support. In partnership, businesses and \nlocal governments will develop new and innovative was to create the new \nhigh quality jobs of the 21st century.\n  This Congress and this President have outlined goals to ensure this \ncountry leads the world in the creation of a robust, green economy.\n  This bill looks to connect that laudable goal with proven financing \ntools to get us there by aligning private sector investment power and \njob growth with good public policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to create jobs, increase energy efficiency, and \npromote technology transfer, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nNIST GREEN JOBS Act, to provide NIST Grants for green jobs, improved \nenergy efficiency, and small business growth.\n  It has never been easy to be an entrepreneur or small business owner, \nand this is especially true since the recession began 2 years ago. Many \nsmall firms in the manufacturing sector, in particular, have struggled \nduring a time of tight credit markets and reduced consumer demand. In \nthe last 2 years, the manufacturing sector lost over 2 million jobs.\n  Twenty years ago, when Americans worried about how our small \ncompanies would compete globally in the face of stiff competition from \nAsia, Congress established the Hollings Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership, MEP, Program to assist small manufacturers.\n  The MEP program has since helped thousands of small- and medium-sized \nmanufacturers across the nation increase their profit-lines and \nstreamline their business processes through lean manufacturing \ntechniques. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, \nis the Federal steward for the nationwide MEP network, which has MEP \nCenters in all 50 States.\n  The New Mexico Manufacturing Extension Partnership in Albuquerque was \none of the first such centers, and it provides small- and medium-sized \nmanufacturers with the tools they need to grow, improve productivity \nand expand capacity. Since its creation, the New Mexico MEP has helped \ncreate or maintain more than 2,600 jobs in the State and achieve $24 \nmillion in annual cost savings for partner companies.\n  Today, as the U.S. continues to emerge from the worst recession since \nthe Great Depression, the resources and expertise MEP provides \nmanufacturers are more valuable than ever. Our MEP Centers do great \nwork--and I believe they can do even more as companies look for ways to \ntake advantage of new opportunities in a clean energy economy that \npromotes energy efficiency and independence for our country.\n  Since manufacturing now plays an increasingly important role in the \nconstruction industry, there is an important opportunity for the MEP \nprogram to strengthen its support of small manufacturers while also \npromoting green jobs and energy independence.\n  Builders today already rely on manufactured components and sub-\nassemblies. Manufacturing will become even more important to \nconstruction as homes are increasingly ``assembled'' on site from \ncomponents made in a factory. Now that lean, high-quality manufacturing \nis applicable to construction, it is not a stretch for MEP Centers to \nteach the same skills to the construction industry, where small firms \nare the norm.\n  Technologies exist today for green building construction and \nretrofitting that can reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. \nYet many small firms, especially in the construction sector, do not \nhave the skills or expertise to take advantage of new technologies to \nimprove the energy efficiency. Moreover, NIST researchers at the \nBuildings and Fire Research Lab already help develop standards and \ntechnologies to improve buildings. Buildings today consume 73 percent \nof electricity and 40 percent of overall energy.\n  These companies would benefit from the type of training and business \nanalysis activities that MEP Centers already provide to manufacturers. \nThe MEP system could thus be a powerful and transformational force to \ncreate green jobs, increase energy efficiency, and promote \ntechnological transfer in the construction industry.\n  That is why I ask for the support of my Senate colleagues for the \nNIST GREEN JOBS Act, to fund MEP Center pilot projects for green jobs \nrelated to energy efficiency. This proposal builds on provisions \nalready authorized by America COMPETES legislation.\n  My bill simply broadens this existing competitive grant program for \nMEP pilot projects to include activities related to energy efficiency. \nIt also allows MEP Centers to extend services to companies in the \nconstruction industry working in these areas. Awarded on a competitive \nbasis, these pilot projects could last up to 3 years and would be \nlocated in each region of the country. The pilot projects would thus \ncreate models for new MEP activities and services that could be \nreplicated at MEP Centers regionally or nationwide.\n  The NIST GREEN JOBS Act authorizes $7 million in annual funding for 3 \nyears. This funding would allow at least one MEP Center in each region \nto conduct a pilot project. The MEP Centers would not need to provide \nlocal matching funds for these competitively awarded pilot projects.\n  I believe this modest proposal would be a positive step toward both \nhelping create and retain jobs in the manufacturing sector and \nimproving our Nation's energy independence.\n  I therefore urge the support of all my colleagues for this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3342. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to establish a demonstration project to promote collaborations to \nimprove school nutrition; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, childhood obesity is a growing concern in \nthe U.S. and I am pleased that the President and First Lady have \ndecided to tackle this issue with the goal of solving the problem in a \ngeneration. Today, one in three children is overweight or obese, which \nmeans that they are at a greater risk of developing diabetes, heart \ndisease and cancer over the course of their lives. We are spending \nnearly $150 billion a year to treat obesity-related medical conditions, \nand this problem will only become worse if we don't do something about \nit now.\n  One way that the Federal Government can play an important role in \naddressing this problem is by helping to make schools healthier. \nStudents spend an average of nearly 7 hours a day at school, and it is \none of the places where kids formally learn and then can practice \nhealthy habits related to nutrition and physical activity. While \neducation is primarily funded by the states, the Federal government \nplays a significant role in this issue as well because of its funding \nof the National School Lunch Program. This year, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, will spend $10.2 billion on the school lunch \nprogram, which serves 31 million children across the country every day. \nIn my home State of Illinois, 1.1 million students in over 4,000 \nschools participate.\n  The National School Lunch Program was started after World War II, \nbecause our leaders then understood the importance of investing in good \nnutrition to ensure that the country's youth were well nourished and \nhealthy. When President Harry Truman signed the National School Lunch \nAct, he said that ``in the long view, no nation is healthier than its \nchildren.''\n  Today, we know that the program is making a real difference in \nmillions of kids' lives, by ensuring they don't go hungry during the \nschool day and are ready to learn. We also know that there are some \nclear nutritional benefits of the program. USDA reports that research \non the school lunches consistently shows that participants consume more \nmilk and vegetables at lunch; have higher vitamin intakes; and consume \nfewer sweets, sweetened beverages, and snack foods than \nnonparticipants.\n  However, much of the difference in vegetable consumption may be due \nto a higher consumption of French fries and other potato products, and \nmany lunches contain a higher percentage of calories from fat than \ncurrently recommended. USDA's current nutrition\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\nstandards for school meals have not been updated since 1995 and are not \nin line with the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans. I think \nwe need to take President Truman's words to heart, and make long-term \ninvestments in this program to ensure that kids are eating healthy \nmeals.\n  I support the President's goal of increased funding, so that schools \ncan afford to purchase healthier ingredients to make school lunches. \nHowever I know that the nutritional quality of school meals varies \ngreatly across the country, and providing every school with adequate \nfunding to improve their meals will be challenging. Some schools have \nalready shown that even with limited resources they can make real \nimprovements in the nutritional quality of their school meals, and make \nother changes to make school environments healthier.\n  I would like to build on that concept, which is why I am pleased \ntoday to introduce the Healthy School Partnerships Act of 2010. This \nbill will create a competitive grant program at USDA to allow public \nschools to explore innovative, sustainable programs that improve the \nnutritional profile of school meals and make other improvements to make \nschool environments healthier. The bill authorizes $2 million per year \nfor 5 years to fund collaborations of academic experts, dieticians and \nnutrition professionals, community partners, and local schools to \nimplement and evaluate innovative models to improve food quality, \nstudent choices in food, and healthy school environments. This could \ninclude starting programs to improve the nutritional content of school \nmeals; providing more nutrition education; changing school policies to \npromote greater access to healthier foods and physical activity; \ntraining teachers, school administrators and nurses; or making other \nchanges to make school environments healthier. We need grass roots \ninvolvement and real-world models to solve the childhood obesity \nproblem going forward, and this bill provides the funding to develop \nthose.\n  Childhood obesity is a complex problem, and to effectively tackle it \nwe will need the commitment of the public and private sectors. The \nHealthy Schools Partnerships Act of is one part of the solution. By \ntapping local resources and expertise, we can promote collaborations \nand develop sustainable and replicable models for making systemic \nchanges that promote good nutrition and healthy living among students.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3342\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PROHIBITION ON STATED INCOME AND NEGATIVELY \n                   AMORTIZING MORTGAGES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 2008 financial crisis was caused, in part, by poor \n     quality, high risk mortgages that were included in mortgage-\n     backed securities, and that incurred higher rates of \n     delinquency and loss than traditional mortgages, damaging \n     thousands of financial institutions holding the mortgages. \n     Those poor quality, high risk mortgages included billions of \n     dollars in stated income and negatively amortizing mortgages.\n       (2) Banks that issue stated income mortgages do not verify \n     the borrower's income or assets, or ability to repay the \n     loan, thereby increasing the risk of loan default. Stated \n     income loans also encourage fraud by the borrowers seeking to \n     obtain the funding and by lenders seeking to earn fees from \n     selling the mortgages.\n       (3) Negative amortization of mortgage loans leads to \n     increased monthly loan payments for borrowers, which, in \n     turn, increases the risk of loan default. During the recent \n     financial crisis, negatively amortized loans defaulted in \n     record numbers, damaging financial institutions and other \n     investors holding those assets.\n       (4) Years ago, Federal banking regulators banned negatively \n     amortizing credit card loans as a threat to the safety and \n     soundness of banking institutions.\n       (5) Federal financial regulators and Inspectors General \n     have testified before Congress that stated income and \n     negatively amortizing loans pose a threat to the safety and \n     soundness of United States banks, and to the financial \n     markets where these high risk mortgages are sold and \n     securitized.\n       (b) Prohibition on Stated Income and Negatively Amortizing \n     Mortgages.--Section 129 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 1639) is amended by adding at the end following:\n       ``(n) Prohibition on Stated Income and Negatively \n     Amortizing Mortgages.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Any person who sells, transfers, or \n     plans to sell or transfer at least 1,000 mortgages, mortgage-\n     backed securities, or similar financial instruments within a \n     calendar year shall not include or reference in any of such \n     financial instruments any mortgage in which the borrower's \n     income was not verified or in which the loan balance may \n     negatively amortize.\n       ``(2) Joint rulemaking.--The Chairman of the Board, the \n     Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \n     the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection \n     may issue joint rules to carry out the purposes of this \n     subsection.

As \nthousands of law enforcement officers arrive in Washington this week to \npay tribute to those whose lives were lost in the line of duty, I hope \nthey all know that the Senate stands with them and honors their service \nand their sacrifice. We welcome these men and women and their families \nand friends to the Nation's Capital.\n  This year the names of two brave Vermonters who gave their lives in \nthe line of duty will be added to the Memorial: John Henry Collette of \nthe Addison County Sheriffs Office, died July 17, 1932, and Robert \nDaniel Rossier of the Vermont Highway Patrol, died September 9, 1935. \nThe inscription of their names on the National Law Enforcement Memorial \nensures that their service and sacrifice will not be forgotten.\n  Once again, I am proud that the Senate has unanimously approved this \nresolution and formally recognized National Police Week and National \nPeace Officers Memorial Day.\n  Mr. DODD.
