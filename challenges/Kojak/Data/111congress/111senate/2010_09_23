Madam President, we are now in day 2 of debate \nregarding the DISCLOSE Act--2 more days Senate Democrats have chosen to \nignore the jobs of the American people in an effort to save their own \njob.\n  Americans are speaking out, but Democrats in Congress still aren't \nlistening. At a time when Americans are clamoring for Democrats in \nCongress to do something about jobs and the economy, Democrats are not \nonly turning a deaf ear, they are spending 2 full days here working to \nsilence the voices of even more people with a bill that picks and \nchooses who has a right to political speech. This is precisely why \nAmericans are speaking out loudly--loudly--about the excesses of this \nadministration and this Congress. This is why Senate Republicans \nstrongly support the efforts Republicans in the\n\n[[Page S7368]]\n\nHouse will unveil later this morning in Virginia.\n  The proposals House Republicans will put forward today are clear \nproof that, unlike Democrats in Washington, Republicans have been \nlistening intently to Americans over the past year and a half. \nAmericans have been telling us they want us to focus on jobs first, \nfight wasteful Washington spending, repeal and replace the health \nspending bill, and shrink an exploding deficit. They have been telling \nus they want a smaller, less costly, and more accountable government.\n  The House Republican plan is a clear and forceful response to these \nconcerns, and, working together, House and Senate Republicans will \ncontinue to fight for the principles upon which it is based. Together, \nwe will focus our efforts on making America more competitive, reducing \nthe size and cost of government, keeping our Nation strong and secure, \nand reining in the massive health care costs and mandates imposed by \nthe Democrats' health spending bill.\n  This is an appropriate statement to make on the sixth-month \nanniversary of the passage of the Democratic health spending bill, \nwhich--both in its contents and in the process used to enact it--so \nclearly undermined the principles House Republicans will discuss this \nmorning.\n  Americans never wanted this massive government-driven intrusion into \ntheir health care, and virtually every day it seems we see that the \nconcerns Americans had about this bill are being vindicated. Throughout \nthe day, administration officials will tell people the things it wants \nAmericans to believe about this bill. Based on the promises the \nadministration made to pass it, Americans should be deeply skeptical.\n  They said: ``If you like your plan, you will be able to keep it.'' \nNow we know that wasn't true. As the Associated Press recently put it: \n``This is a promise that is beyond the President's power to keep.''\n  They said it wouldn't raise taxes--not by one penny. Yet even the \nadministration's own lawyers now acknowledge that it does. One report, \nfrom the Joint Committee on Taxation, says that 40 million individuals \nand families will get hit with a tax hike as a result of this health \ncare bill.\n  They said it would slow the growth of health care costs and that it \nwas essential for that reason. Yet now the government itself says costs \nwill go up as a result of the bill.\n\n  What about premiums? Well, the administration now says it knew all \nalong that insurance premiums would go up as a result of this bill. \nLess than a year after the President said Democrats had agreed to \n``reforms'' that would enable families to save on their premiums, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services now says rates will increase \nsubstantially as a result of the bill--exactly the opposite of what was \nsaid during the debate.\n  And in what may turn out to be the most thoroughly discredited pledge \nabout this bill, the President and other Democratic leaders assured \ntheir colleagues that Americans would come to like the health spending \nbill once it passed--they would come to like it. As for that claim, \nwell, I think Politico put it best this morning:\n\n       Rarely have so many strategists been so wrong about \n     something so big.\n\n  Rarely--rarely--have so many strategists been so wrong about \nsomething so big.\n  So Democrats were eager to listen to the strategists and the \nadministration officials who told them what this bill would do and how \nit would be received, when what they should have been doing is \nlistening to the American people, who never liked this bill--never \nliked it--and who knew it wouldn't deliver on the promises Democrats \nmade. So this is no anniversary Democrats should be celebrating.\n  Americans have had it. The American people have had it. They have had \nit with Democrats focusing on their own pet issues at the exclusion of \nAmerica's top priorities, and they are tired of being told that if only \nthe Democrats pass their agenda these priorities will somehow be met. \nWell, the results are in. The results are in. The Democratic agenda has \nbeen a failure for the economy and for jobs. It is time to move on. It \nis time to start listening instead of dictating. Americans are speaking \nout. It is time Democrats in Congress start listening.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I withhold the suggestion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, in the midst of all the \nstrife and partisanship and ideological rigidity that makes it so \ndifficult these days for us to bring about consensus in the world's \nmost deliberative body, there is the occasion at the first of each of \nthese meetings in the Senate that we do come together--when the \nchaplain mounts the rostrum, prays for the Senate and for the Nation, \nand then we all join together in the Pledge.\n  I think it is worthy noting the way that the great master of the \nSenate, Senator Robert Byrd, taught all of us freshmen 10 years ago to \nmount the rostrum and to call the Senate together. As the Presiding \nOfficer calls the Senate to order, he or she then announces the \nchaplain for the day and descends from the rostrum as the chaplain \ncomes to the rostrum to offer the prayer. It is a recognition of the \nDeity, it is an expression of humility, it is a little symbolic act, \nbut it is important.\n  I think it is important to note that in July, when the entire Senate \nfiled through that center door under that arch inscribed with ``In God \nWe Trust,'' we all stood silently at our seats as our Chaplain, Admiral \nBlack, gave a prayer over the flag-draped coffin of our departed \ncolleague, Senator Byrd. Each of us stood silently in reverence and \nrecognition not only of a fallen colleague but in recognition of a \nsupreme Deity. And so it is that that tradition continues. And it \ncontinues with my friend, the Reverend Dr. Joe Hunter from Florida, who \nhas shared with us his message this morning in the opening of the \nSenate with a prayer.\n  The prayer started in the early days of the Continental Congress. It \nwas in 1774, in that Congress, that a chaplain was called to open those \nsessions. Under the new government that came about as a result of the \nArticles of Confederation--which had not worked to keep a new spirited \nnation together because it didn't have a central government--they met \ntogether in that steamy room in Philadelphia to hammer out the \nConstitution, and the Constitutional Convention prayer was offered \nduring those deliberations.\n  As a matter of fact, it was Benjamin Franklin who made the comment--\nwhen the delegates wondered whether this Nation could stand, a Nation \nthat was seeking freedom, a Nation that was seeking democracy--Benjamin \nFranklin said something to the effect that if the Supreme Being knows \neven when a sparrow falls, will that Supreme Being not be involved in \nthe affairs of a young and struggling nation?\n  In the beginning of that Nation under a constitutional government, in \nlower Manhattan, the chaplain of the nearby church was proclaimed the \nChaplain of the Senate. When the government moved to Philadelphia, the \nsecond Chaplain of the Senate was appointed. When the government moved \nto this present location on the banks of the Potomac, the third \nChaplain of the Senate was appointed. In that long succession of \nChaplains, we are so pleased to have as our Chaplain now, after so many \ndistinguished ones, Admiral Barry Black, whom we all love and \nappreciate.\n  So today continues a tradition with great selectivity of certain \nministers being invited to come and pray for the Nation. Joel Hunter is \nthe pastor of one of those mega-churches. It is a big church north of \nOrlando. But it is a church that has about five churches all spread \nout, with an incredible outreach to the community. Joel Hunter is a man \nwho has reached out and ministered to Presidents, and Joel Hunter is a \nman who has done so much good for our community and our State and our \ncountry. He has suffered tragedy with the loss of a granddaughter just \nrecently. Yet out of that suffering, all the more his compassion comes \nforth.\n  Indeed, we are very privileged to have Dr. Joel Hunter as our \nChaplain for the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7369-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I come to the floor today, on the 6-\nmonth anniversary of the signing into law of what has commonly across \nthe country come to be called ObamaCare. I come as a physician, someone \nwho has practiced medicine in Wyoming since the early 1980s, taking \ncare of thousands and thousands of patients across the cowboy State--\nfamilies. I bring that experience to the Senate floor. I have a \ndoctor's second opinion, now that here we are, 6 months out. It is akin \nto looking at an x ray after something has happened, going 6 months \nlater and taking a look at the x ray to see what has occurred to the \npatient.\n  Six months ago when Obama signed his new health care bill into law, \nhe said: ``All of the overheated rhetoric over reform will finally \nconfront the reality of reform.''\n  Here we are 6 months later. The American people have been confronted \nwith the reality of the President's reform, and they do not like it. \nThe American people who listened to Speaker Pelosi say: First, we must \npass the bill before you get to find out what is in it, now have \nlearned more and more what is in it, and they don't like it. The \nAmerican people watched as this body came together, cobbled together \nlegislation with things such as the ``Cornhusker kickback'' and special \ntreats for different Senators so we would agree to vote for the bill, \nand the American people don't like it.\n  As a matter of fact, there was a Rasmussen poll that just came out \nMonday, and as of Monday this week, 6 months after the bill was signed \ninto law, 61 percent of the American people want Washington to repeal \nthis new health care law--61 percent want it repealed. Once again, \ninstead of listening to the American people, the President continues to \ntry to sell his law. He tried it again yesterday in a back yard. He \ncontinues to make promises he knows he cannot keep and that have not \nbeen kept with this new law.\n  Now that we are 6 months into the new law, I wish to walk you through \nsome of the President's promises and the reality that the people of \nthis great country are living with as they look at what has been \ncrammed down their throats. Promise No. 1 by the President: If you like \nyour current health care coverage, you can keep it. According to a new \nObama administration regulation--this is the President's own \nadministration, writing the regulation--a majority of Americans who get \ntheir insurance through work will not be able to keep the current \nhealth care plan they have. Even the White House admits it. The \nPresident keeps saying it, but the White House admits it is not true.\n  Promise No. 2: The law will bring the cost of medical care down and \nreduce the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office disagrees, saying \nit erases savings. The Actuary at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices says the new law will increase health care spending.\n  Let's look at promise No. 3. This says the law will strengthen \nMedicare. It actually cuts Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion--$500 billion \ncut from Medicare. The seniors of this country are furious.\n  To make matters worse, this money is not being used to save Medicare \nor to strengthen Medicare. The money is being used to start a whole new \ngovernment program for other people. There is a rebellion among the \nseniors of this country.\n  Let's look at another promise the President made. He said: The law \nwill create jobs. We have 9.6 percent unemployment in this country. We \ncontinue to learn about companies that want to employ people, that want \nto create jobs, but instead those companies are cutting their payrolls \nin order to deal with the massive new tax increases included in the \nlaw. If you look at the incentives that are given to small companies, \nin terms of helping them with health care costs, the incentives are the \nones that say: If you want to get something, you want to cut the number \nof employees you have and cut the salaries of the people you are still \ngoing to employ. That does not create jobs. This law does not create \njobs.\n  Then, of course, President Obama also promised that the Federal \nGovernment would not ration care. Then I would say why did the \nPresident make a recess appointment of a man to run the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid who has repeatedly acknowledged and said the \ngovernment must ration care? He has a long history, but he did not come \nto the Senate to explain a number of statements he has made about \nredistributing wealth, rationing care. He does not need to explain it \nto the Senate. He needs to explain it to the people of this country. \nThat is Donald Berwick, a physician from Massachusetts, still refusing \nto testify before Congress and the American people. He has been invited \nagain to come today. There will be people waiting in a room to which he \nhas been invited. We will see if he does arrive, but I doubt it.\n  You wonder why Americans are sick and tired of Washington. It is no \nsurprise; yesterday, when speaking at the event in Virginia, the \nPresident focused on provisions of the new law that go into effect \ntoday. As Paul Harvey used to say: ``Now the rest of the story.'' Some \nof the changes the President touted yesterday actually don't start \nright away. Many Americans will not see how these changes will impact \nthem until after January 1 of 2011. But yesterday, USA Today, the \nnewspaper, actually ran a big story--a full-page story almost--on the \nnew provisions. The thing that was so interesting about the story is, \nthe story outlined the basics of each provision--a little thing there. \nThen underneath each one of the basics it had several paragraphs of \nthings they called be aware: The basics are this, but be aware that \nthis may happen to you, and this may happen to you and this may not \napply or this may apply.\n\n  All those things are to alert the American people that there is a lot \nmore to it when you look at this over 2,000-page bill and the so many \nagencies that are being brought forth to write rules and regulations--\nso many things the American people will still learn about this bill, \nand as they learn those things they will like it even less.\n  The story outlined the basics and then the ``be awares'' of each \nprovision. I think it is very important for the Americans who are \nlistening and who are focused on this to be aware of these ``be \nawares,'' that they are so much longer than the provisions. What I \nwould like to do is walk through some of them with you.\n  The law does allow young adults to stay on and be added to their \nparents' health insurance plan until age 26. That is what we hear. Make \nsure to read the fine print.\n  One of the things the Obama administration published was the so-\ncalled grandfather regulation--not when the bill was signed into law \nbut in June. This Washington White House regulation defines the rules \nthat employers must follow if they want the health coverage they \ncurrently offer their employees to be exempt from the new law's \nmandates. It says be aware that children are not eligible to be added \nto their parents' grandfathered employer group plan if the child can \naccess coverage in other ways, if they have a job--another very \ncomplicated situation of rules and regulations.\n  Second, the law now requires insurers to cover more preventive \nservices--immunizations, mammograms, colonoscopies. It is important for \npeople to take responsibility for their health and things such as \nscreening mammograms and immunizations; those help people in the long \nrun. It says insurers cannot charge copayments or deductibles for these \nadded benefits. Then let's get to the ``be aware'' section. Be aware \nthese cost savings only apply to new health insurance plans, not the \nso-called grandfathered plans, so you have them describing the \ngrandfathered plans and who can be a part of it and who cannot.\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\nThere is more to this than meets the eye. Also, be aware--don't be \nsurprised if you see your insurance premiums go up.\n  The President wants to sell Americans on the good things in the law, \nwhat he considers the good things in the law, but he has failed to \nmention that mandating insurers to cover these extra benefits is going \nto cause premiums to go up.\n  Another: Insurance companies can no longer cap the amount they will \npay over a person's lifetime. Americans need to be aware, however, that \ninsurance plans that had lower premium costs because--they say, how do \nyou get premiums down? They did it by limiting lifetime amounts. It \nsays those people now may be forced to pay higher insurance premiums.\n  Another: The law designed new rules preventing insurers from denying \ncoverage to any child under the age of 19 who has a preexisting medical \ncondition. So what did the Washington Post say about that? What did the \nLos Angeles Times report? They both printed articles this Tuesday, 2 \ndays ago, warning consumers that major health insurance companies--what \nare they going to do about this? They are going to plan to stop selling \nnew child-only covered products completely. Is this going to help kids \nwith preexisting conditions, this law? As these insurance companies \nplan to stop selling new child-only coverage products, that is not \ngoing to help. It is because of this law.\n  The health care law allows parents to wait until their child is sick \nbefore buying a policy. When only sick people buy health insurance, \npremiums have to go up. As the rate increases, more people drop their \ncoverage. This certainly is going to hit lower income families hard. \nSome uninsured parents, while they can't afford family insurance, often \ndecide to buy a child-only policy to ensure their kids have coverage. \nBut according to these new reports, families all across America will \nhave fewer health insurance options because of the new law--fewer \noptions for families, fewer options for patients, not more.\n  This Congress had a historic opportunity to make patient-centered \nhealth care reforms to bring down the cost of medical care in this \ncountry. We had a historic opportunity, and this Congress missed it. \nThe one thing the American people wanted out of health care reform was \nlower costs. But increased Washington mandates passed by this Senate \nonly serve to produce fewer insurance choices, increased costs, and \ninsert the Federal Government between patients and their doctors.\n  It is time that we start talking honestly about how this law--even \nthe things on which Republicans and Democrats agree--affected patients \nand their families. That is why I believe this health care law needs to \nbe repealed. It should be repealed and replaced with better ideas. And \nthere are better ideas--better ideas that were rejected by the majority \nin this Senate, who refused to listen, who refused to listen to the \nAmerican people who were bringing forth better ideas, changes such as \nallowing people to buy insurance across State lines--that is going to \nbring down the cost of care, and it is going to help about 12 million \npeople who did not have insurance get insurance; offering premium \nbreaks to folks who make healthy lifestyle changes--absolutely \ncritical; dealing with lawsuit abuse to help eliminate some of this \ndefensive medicine and the increased cost of that practice. We need to \nallow small businesses to join together, to pool together in order to \noffer affordable health insurance to their workers, get better deals \nwith insurance costs. These are changes that put patients in control of \ntheir medical decisions, not the government.\n  People ask me, as a doctor, what I think about this, what I think \nabout this law. I will tell you, having practiced medicine for over 25 \nyears, we need to do something. This wasn't it. This law is bad for \npeople. It is bad for people who are patients. It is bad for people who \nare providers, the nurses and the doctors who take care of the \npatients. It is bad for payers, the taxpayers of this country who will \nfoot a significant amount of the bill. The people who get their \ninsurance through work--what is the impact going to be on those jobs \nand those businesses? This is a bill that is bad for people.\n  We can and we must fix a broken health care system, but we can do it \nwithout undermining choice, which is what this health care law has \ndone; without undermining competition, which is what this health care \nlaw has done; and without undermining innovation, which is what this \nhealth care law has done. And we need to do it without raiding Medicare \nto start a whole new government entitlement program. We can do it \nwithout raising taxes that kill jobs in a bad economy.\n  That is why, as we are here today, 6 months after the enactment of \nthis bill becoming law, the Obamacare law, 6 months later, 61 percent \nof the American people want it repealed. It is now time to repeal and \nreplace this health care legislation and replace it with something that \nwill work for the American people because that is what this country \nwants, that is what this country needs, that is what this country and \nthe people of this country have been asking for all along, but the \nmembers of the majority and the White House refused to listen.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I move to proceed to the consideration \nof S.J. Res. 30.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 hours for debate on the motion to proceed, with the time \nequally divided and controlled between the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin, and the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I yield myself up to 15 minutes of the \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, on May 11, 2010, the National Mediation \nBoard, the board that oversees labor relations in transportation--in \nthe railroad and airlines industries--finalized a regulation repealing \nthe 75-year-old majority rule. Under the majority rule, a majority of \nthe organizing unit was required to affirmatively vote yes to unionize. \nThe repeal of this rule means that now a minority in the bargaining \nunit can organize, essentially permanently, the entire organization of \nthe unit.\n  Today, I am asking this body to pass S.J. Res. 30 to undo this rule \nchange under the procedures created by the Congressional Review Act of \n1996. This law allows Congress to disapprove regulatory rules issued by \nFederal agencies by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. This \nresolution will revoke a recent regulation promulgated by the National \nMediation Board eliminating the old majority rule that had been in \nplace for 75 years under 12 Presidential administrations.\n  Under the old rules, a majority of the workers in the organizing unit \nwere required to affirmatively vote yes in order to organize. Under the \nnew rules, however, only a majority of those voting are required to \nvote yes to organize a union.\n  Let me give you an example. If an organizing unit had 10,000 \nemployees, under the 75-year-old rule, 5,001 would have had to vote \naffirmatively for a union. Under the new rule, if only 4,000 turned out \nto vote, only 2,001 would have had to vote affirmatively to be able to \nunionize. In fact, in large measure, it seems to me, it is kind of \n``card check lite.''\n\n       There is no sound legal or policy basis for hastily \n     changing a rule that has been in\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\n     place and upheld repeatedly for 75 years. Throughout this \n     time, the majority rule has furthered the primary purpose of \n     the Railway Labor Act, which is ``to avoid any interruption \n     to commerce or to the operation of any carrier engaged \n     therein.''\n\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld the rule not once \nbut twice. The National Mediation Board, under both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations, previously rejected changes to the majority \nrule on four separate occasions. In fact, the National Mediation Board, \nunder former President Jimmy Carter of Georgia, concluded that only \nCongress could make such a decision.\n  Even the Obama administration's own Labor Department defended the \nsoundness of the majority rule, writing on October 8, 2009:\n\n       For 70 years, the Board has required, when there is no \n     representative and just one organization is seeking to be \n     representative, a majority of the workers in the craft or \n     class to vote for that organization.\n\n  In so doing, President Obama's own Labor Department argued that all \npast boards ``reasonably construed'' the Railway Labor Act.\n  As former National Mediation Board Chairman Elizabeth Dougherty wrote \nin her strong dissent of the repeal of the majority rule, making this \nchange ``would be an unprecedented event in the history of the National \nMediation Board.''\n  She continued:\n\n       Regardless of the composition of the board or the \n     inhabitant of the White House, this independent agency has \n     never been in the business of making controversial, one-sided \n     rule changes at the behest of only labor or management.\n\n  The majority rule is not unfair to organizing efforts, as over two-\nthirds of the 1,850 reported elections since 1935 have resulted in a \nunion. Moreover, an average of 72 percent of airline and railroad \nemployees are represented by unions, while only 8 percent of private-\nsector workers are union represented.\n  One of the reasons the majority rule was approved is because \nrecognition of a union under the Railway Labor Act is essentially \npermanent, and I reiterate that. The decision is essentially permanent \nand irrevocable. Thus, to reference my example earlier, the minority of \n2,001 in an employee group of 10,000 could irrevocably unionize an \norganization and make it permanent.\n  Quoting the Obama administration's Labor Department again:\n\n       Unlike the National Labor Relations Act, the Railway Labor \n     Act does not provide for a decertification process.\n\n  ``Does not provide for a decertification process.''\n\n       Therefore, the union's certification continues until \n     another union makes a showing of interest to represent the \n     respective class or craft. . . . Consequently, it is of \n     utmost importance that a certified union has the support of \n     the workers it is certified to represent.\n\n  While existing practice allows for a cumbersome and slow ``straw \nman'' union disillusion process, the Railway Labor Act has no \ndecertification process as there is under the National Labor Relations \nAct.\n  The current ``straw man'' union disillusion process is Byzantine and \nnearly impossible for workers to use. This is how National Mediation \nBoard Chairman Dougherty described the process:\n\n       Employees who no longer wish to be represented by a union \n     must select an individual to stand for election (the so-\n     called ``straw man''), convince a majority of the eligible \n     voters in the craft or class to sign authorization cards for \n     that individual (while attempting to explain that this \n     individual is not actually going to represent them), and then \n     file an application with the Board. If the requisite showing \n     of interest is met, an election is authorized, and the \n     employees must either vote for the ``straw man,'' with the \n     hope that he will later disclaim interest in representing the \n     craft or class, or abstain from voting.\n\n  What a ridiculous process that is.\n  Unfortunately, the new rule allows no corollary process by which \nemployees can choose to opt out of unionization. Thus, the Obama \nadministration greatly lowers the bar for unionization, while \ncontinuing to ensure that it is nearly impossible to decertify a union.\n  In Teamsters v. BRAC, the DC Circuit Court wrote:\n\n       It is inconceivable that the right to reject collective \n     representation vanishes entirely if the employees of a unit \n     once choose collective representation. On its face, that is a \n     most unlikely rule, especially taking into account the \n     inevitability of substantial turnover of personnel within the \n     unit.\n\n  If the Obama administration truly sought to ``more accurately measure \nemployee choice,'' they would have provided a parallel process by which \nemployees could vote out a union in an election conducted in the same \nmanner as the election which resulted in certification of the union in \nthe first place. Of course, they did not do that.\n  Quoting Chairman Dougherty again:\n\n       Apparently, employee choice only matters to the Majority \n     when it relates to changing the status quo from no \n     representation to representation and not the other way \n     around.\n\n  The impact of this is dramatic in my State, and it has a dramatic \nimpact on Delta Air Lines, which is headquartered in my State.\n  On April 14, 2008, Delta and Northwest Airlines announced a merger. \nBefore the merger, Delta was a predominantly nonunion organization. Its \npilots were unionized, but flight attendants and ground personnel were \nnonunion. Delta employees--many of whom reside in Georgia--were and \nstill are some of the most dedicated employees of any company in the \nUnited States, and some of the best paid employees in the airline \nindustry, which explains why Delta employees have voted down six \nunionization drives since 2000 alone.\n  Some of the former employees of Northwest, which was a much smaller \noperation than Delta, wish the new Delta to adopt their old labor \nagreements. Those old labor agreements at Northwest led to a long \nhistory of labor strife, lower pay, and burdensome work rules.\n  I say, leave that decision up to the workers. If the benefits of \nunion representation are so great, then why the need to change the \nrule? This administration simply refuses to obey the will of the \nmajority of the class and has chosen to side with the union in the \npassing of this rule.\n  As National Mediation Board Chairman Dougherty has written, the \nboard's actions are targeted at ``40,000 employees at two major \nairlines--the largest group of elections in the history of the National \nMediation Board. I believe it is harmful to the reputation and \ncredibility of the [National Mediation] Board for it to take a position \nin favor of a change to our election rules during these elections.''\n  In short, we are here today for one reason and one reason only: The \nObama administration has chosen to tilt the outcome of unionization \nelections at Delta Air Lines in favor of the transit unions.\n  Let me discuss the integrity of this process that took place at the \nBoard.\n  Once confirmed by the Senate, revoking the majority rule was clearly \njob one for Members Puchala and Hoglander. Only 5 weeks after Mr. \nHoglander was confirmed on July 24, 2009, the AFL-CIO requested the \nrule change on September 2, 2009.\n  Two months later, on November 2, the National Mediation Board issued \nthe proposed rule. Not coincidentally, the transit unions immediately \nwithdrew their applications to organize Delta, giving Hoglander and \nPuchala more time to stack the deck in their favor. Public remarks of \nunion leaders from the Association of Flight Attendants have since \nconfirmed their insider knowledge of the proposed rule.\n  On November 6, the Democratic members of the National Mediation Board \ntold Chairman Dougherty they had prepared a ``final'' version of the \nproposed rule and she had only 1\\1/2\\ hours to consider their proposal.\n  Further, the Democratic majority told her she would not be permitted \nto publish a dissent in the Federal Register. Of course, publication of \na dissent is not prohibited by any agency.\n  Finally, on May 11, 2010, the Democratic majority issued their final \nrule, having prevented an honest and forthright debate and comment--all \nof this from an administration that prides itself on transparency.\n  Throughout their effort to repeal the majority rule, the Democratic \nmajority and the National Mediation Board intentionally left Chairman \nDougherty out of the process. As she wrote in her stinging dissent: \n``This rule was drafted without my input or participation.''\n  I am concerned this course of conduct by two former union leaders \nplainly reflects a predetermination to proceed with a course of action \nbeneficial to transit unions at the expense of fairness and sound \npublic policy.\n  Chairman Dougherty is correct when she writes:\n\n\n[[Page S7372]]\n\n\n       Independent agencies have an obligation to avoid even the \n     appearance of impropriety. The Board's failure to do so in \n     this instance has damaged the Board's reputation irreparably.\n\n  Clearly, this administration is afraid that the Employee Free Choice \nAct, which it promotes, will not pass the Senate in the near future. As \na result, President Obama has repeatedly assured union bosses in \nWashington that his administration will use the Federal regulatory \nagencies and Executive orders to implement their radical agenda on \nbehalf of labor bosses in Washington.\n  We are just beginning to see the impact that former union boss Craig \nBecker is having as a member of the NLRB. Mr. Becker was rejected by \nthis body on a bipartisan vote. The President responded by thwarting \nthe will of the Senate and extending to Mr. Becker a recess \nappointment.\n  Since assuming his position, Mr. Becker has been anything but \nimpartial to the unions. He has refused to recuse himself in cases \ninvolving his old employer, the SEIU, and is doggedly attempting to \nfoster card check campaigns at businesses throughout the country.\n  Last week, President Obama said:\n\n       What we've done instead [of getting EFCA passed in the \n     Senate] is try to do as much as we can administratively to \n     make sure that it's easier for unions to operate.\n\n  The repeal of the majority rule fits into this pattern. It is yet \nanother attempt by the Obama administration to circumvent the Congress \nof the United States and vilify American businesses.\n  As the Supreme Court wrote in Russell v. National Mediation Board in \n1985:\n\n       Employees were given the right under the (Railway Labor) \n     Act not only to vote for collective bargaining, but to reject \n     it as well.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration's two Democratic nominees to \nthe National Mediation Board, in repealing a 75-year-old rule without \ncongressional approval or adequate reasoning, have recklessly tossed \naside fairness and impartiality to benefit their former labor bosses in \nthe labor movement. In so doing, they have eviscerated the right the \nSupreme Court articulated.\n  The Congressional Review Act is the appropriate legislative vehicle \nfor Congress to undo this assault on workers' rights. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution of disapproval.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters supporting this resolution from \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Alliance for Worker Freedom, Americans for Limited \nGovernment, and Associated Builders and Contractors be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a document \nentitled ``Letters from Workers.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2010.\n     To the Members of the United States Senate:\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing the interests of more than three \n     million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, \n     and region, urges you to support S.J. Res. 30, a resolution \n     of disapproval that would repeal revisions the National \n     Mediation Board made to its regulations concerning union \n     organizing under the Railway Labor Act.\n       The Board's revisions, which were finalized on May 11, \n     2010, overturn more than 70 years of precedent and make it \n     possible for a union to be organized without the support of a \n     majority of employees in the craft or class. Strong policy \n     arguments favor the time-tested rule the Board has \n     jettisoned, including the fact that the Board has no rule \n     permitting decertification of a union should the employees \n     later decide they do not want to maintain representation.\n       In addition, the regulatory process that led to the \n     adoption of the rule was little more than a sham. The Board \n     majority not only excluded the single minority member from \n     deliberations over the rule, but it censored her dissent. \n     Furthermore, while the rule was contentious enough to draw \n     thousands of comments, the Board did not change a single word \n     of the proposed rule when it was finalized, further \n     evidencing that the regulatory process adhered to was \n     egregiously flawed. Policy differences aside, Congress should \n     not permit an agency to set policy in such a manner.\n       Due to the critical importance of this issue to the \n     business community, the Chamber strongly urges you to support \n     S.J. Res. 30. The Chamber may consider votes on, or in \n     relation to, this issue in our annual How They Voted \n     scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                               September 20, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of Manufacturers \n     (NAM)--the nation's largest industrial trade association--\n     urges you to support S.J. Res. 30, a ``resolution of \n     disapproval'' to prevent the National Mediation Board (NMB) \n     from changing union election rules under the Railway Labor \n     Act.\n       Manufacturers are increasingly concerned with efforts to \n     implement major changes to our nation's labor laws outside of \n     Congress through executive branch actions. The NMB's recent \n     decision to promulgate a new rule goes contrary to the intent \n     of the Railway Labor Act and is an attempt to circumvent the \n     legislative process.\n       The Railway Labor Act requires a majority of all eligible \n     employees to affirmatively choose to allow a labor union to \n     collectively bargain on their behalf with their employer. \n     However, in 2009 members of the NMB finalized a proposed rule \n     which allows union organizers to unionize workplaces if only \n     a simple majority of employees who participated in a union \n     representation election chose to certify the labor union \n     instead of requiring an affirmative vote for union \n     representation from a majority of all employees that would be \n     covered by the labor union seeking to be certified. This \n     approach goes counter to decades of labor law precedent and \n     skews the careful balance inherent in federal labor law.\n       The NMB failed to demonstrate sound policy justification \n     needed to implement such a sweeping change to our labor law \n     system. The final rule that has been issued is beyond the \n     legal authority of the Board and is arbitrary and capricious. \n     The NAM responded to the NMB's proposed rulemaking and \n     submitted comments highlighting these concerns. Unfortunately \n     the Board finalized the rule in May 2010 without addressing \n     our concerns--and those of many other employers.\n       The failure of a union to receive a true majority support \n     among the employees it seeks to represent is disruptive to \n     employee-employer relations and puts the stability of \n     interstate commerce in question. Labor unions covered by the \n     RLA must be able to have the support of the majority of \n     employees to provide effective representation in labor \n     negotiations.\n       In order to promote fair and equitable labor relations that \n     protect the rights of the majority of workers, an affirmative \n     change--from a non-union to union workplace--should require \n     an affirmative majority vote from those eligible to vote. \n     Employees who choose not participate in elections are in \n     effect choosing to maintain the status quo and should not be \n     required to directly participate in representation elections \n     in order to maintain their status.\n       The Senate should disapprove this rule by supporting S.J. \n     Res. 30, as it would harm positive employee relations and \n     sets a disturbing precedent for other federal labor boards \n     like the National Labor Relations Board. More importantly, we \n     believe the NMB is circumventing the proper role of Congress \n     in setting our nation's labor laws on a level playing field \n     to protect the rights of those who wish to be represented by \n     a labor union and those who do not.\n       As manufacturers face tremendous amounts of uncertainty in \n     these challenging economic times, Congress should not allow a \n     federal agency to issue regulations that harm manufacturers' \n     ability to create and retain jobs.\n       On behalf of manufacturers, we urge your support for S.J. \n     Res. 30. We look forward to continue working with you on our \n     shared goals for a strong economy, job creation and promoting \n     fair and balanced labor laws.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Joe Trauger,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Alliance for Worker\n\n\n                                                      Freedom,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Alliance for Worker Freedom \n     (AWF), I urge you to support Senator Isakson's S.J. Res 30, \n     which condemns the National Mediation Board's (NMB) decision \n     to ease unionization standards for airline and railway \n     employees.\n       Since the creation of the National Mediation Board in 1934, \n     a majority of transport workers' votes has been required to \n     form a union. Last year, the AFL-CIO viewed this traditional \n     voting practice as an impediment to their unionization \n     efforts and lobbied the NMB to amend this practice. The NMB \n     complied with the AFL-CIO's request and in May ruled that \n     union elections for workers subject to the Railway Labor Act \n     should be decided by only a majority of workers who cast \n     ballots, not total company workers. This move would make it \n     substantially easier for unions to win elections and could \n     encourage deceptive election practices.\n       Overturning seventy-five years of precedent and two Supreme \n     Court rulings, the National Mediation Board has overstepped \n     its understood authority. Although frequently challenged, \n     numerous institutions, under both Democrat and Republican \n     Administrations, upheld the ``majority rule'' practice. The \n     Supreme Court twice ruled in favor of ``majority rule'' \n     unionization election standards.\n       Furthermore, the National Mediation Board has upheld \n     challenges to majority rule four times, on grounds that: \n     ``Certification based upon majority participation promotes\n\n[[Page S7373]]\n\n     harmonious labor relations. A union without majority support \n     cannot be as effective in negotiations as a union selected by \n     a process which assures that a majority of employee's desire \n     representation.''\n       AFL-CIO's complaints that transport companies have made it \n     too difficult to unionize workers, thus necessitating the \n     NMB's change, is largely unfounded: majority rule has been \n     used in more than 1,850 elections, and unions have won more \n     than 65 percent of the time.\n       The merits of majority rule can be thoroughly weighed, \n     debated, and voted on by our legislators, not the three \n     members of the National Mediation Board.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Christopher Prandoni,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From ALG News, Sept. 21, 2010]\n\n     ALG Urges Senate to Support Isakson Resolution Against Union \n                     Organization by Plurality Rule\n\n       Fairfax, VA.--Americans for Limited Government (ALG) \n     President Bill Wilson today urged the Senate to support a \n     resolution of disapproval against a National Mediation Board \n     rule that allows for union organization at railways and \n     airlines with less than a majority of employees voting \n     ``yes.''\n       The resolution of disapproval is being proposed by Senator \n     Johnny Isakson, who in The Hill wrote ``The Obama \n     administration's decision to repeal this rule means that now \n     a minority of the bargaining unit can organize--permanently--\n     the entire organizing unit.''\n       ``The National Mediation Board simply does not have the \n     legal authority to make such a radical change without \n     Congressional authorization,'' Isakson stated in a press \n     release. ``With this rule change, a union could be \n     permanently recognized without a majority of employees having \n     ever supported representation.''\n       That is because on May 11th, 2010, the National Mediation \n     Board repealed the so-called ``Majority Rule.'' Under the old \n     rule, it took a majority of an organizing unit voting ``yes'' \n     to permanently organize a union. Now, it only takes a \n     majority of those voting, a considerably lower threshold.\n       lsakson wrote in The Hill, ``[U]nder the Majority Rule, if \n     a bargaining unit had 6,000 employees, 3,001 must have voted \n     for a union to organize the unit. However, under the new \n     rule, if only 1,000 of 6,000 vote, and 501 of those 1,000 \n     vote yes, all 6,000 are permanently unionized, even if a \n     majority of them become disenchanted with the union \n     leadership.''\n       Isakson's resolution is expected to have an up-or-down vote \n     on Thursday under expedited rules.\n       Wilson said the rule change most likely had been made to \n     accommodate the merger of Delta Airlines and Northwest. ``The \n     new company is 40 percent union, and most of that is from the \n     Northwest employees. Since they didn't already have a \n     majority, the only way to get a union for the whole company \n     was to change the rules to accommodate a decades-long effort \n     by Big Labor to unionize Delta.''\n       According to CNN Money, ``Unlike its competitors, Delta \n     employees have declined to join labor unions in the past, \n     priding themselves on having great relationships with the \n     company and enjoying the freedom to negotiate contracts with \n     managers one on one.''\n       Wilson said that the National Mediation Board had violated \n     their authority under the Railway Labor Act, urging the \n     Senate to ``uphold the original intent of the law, which \n     never included allowing a minority of workers at a company to \n     unionize. The National Mediation Board has clearly stepped \n     out of its statutory role as a neutral arbiter, and into \n     being an advocate on behalf of union organizers.''\n       Wilson's sentiments echoed those of the Chair of the \n     National Mediation Board, Elizabeth Dougherty, who in her \n     dissent wrote, ``Regardless of the composition of the board \n     or the inhabitant of the White House, this independent agency \n     has never been in the business of making controversial, one-\n     sided rule changes at the behest of only labor or \n     management.''\n       Wilson said this was ``just the latest example of an agency \n     seizing the power to legislate from Congress,'' concluding, \n     ``First it was the EPA with the carbon endangerment finding. \n     Then the National Labor Relations Board opening the door for \n     card check. And now the National MedianBoard allowing for \n     unionization with less than majority support.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Associated Builders and\n\n\n                                            Contractors, Inc.,\n\n                                Arlington, VA, September 23, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of Associated Builders and \n     Contractors (ABC), a national association with 77 chapters \n     representing 25,000 merit shop construction and construction-\n     related firms with 2 million employees, I write to express \n     strong support for S.J. Res. 30, offered by Senator Isakson \n     and urge you to vote in favor of this resolution. The \n     resolution disapproves the rule submitted by the National \n     Mediation Board relating to representation election \n     procedures (published at 95 Fed. Reg. 26062 (May 11, 2010)), \n     and would resolve that such rule shall have no force or \n     effect.\n       The May 11 National Mediation Board rule requires employers \n     governed under the Railway Labor Act to recognize and bargain \n     with a union, even where a majority of affected employees \n     have not voted to do so. This rule overturns 75 years of \n     precedent and promotes union organizing at the expense of \n     employees that do not favor union representation. Moreover, \n     this radical change injects further uncertainty into our \n     economy at a time when we can afford it least.\n       ABC believes the National Mediation Board's ruling reflects \n     a disturbing trend by the federal government to promote \n     unionization at the expense of free and open competition, \n     economic growth and employees that do not favor union \n     representation. ABC urges you to support S.J. Res. 30 and \n     vote in favor of this resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Geoff Burr,\n     Vice President, Federal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Letters From Workers\n\n       On Monday, when this vote was scheduled, we launched an \n     email address, airlines@isakson.senate.gov, and we asked the \n     real experts--the workers affected by this rule change--to \n     write us and offer their thoughts.\n       The response has been overwhelming. As of this morning, \n     we've received over 100 individual letters in three days, not \n     form letters or postcards, but carefully crafted letters \n     decrying the unfairness of the NMB's rule change.\n       One of my constituents, a proud Delta flight attendant \n     named Debi Shaw from Gainesville, Georgia contacted dozens of \n     her friends and colleagues. Ms. Shaw collected over three \n     dozen letters by herself.\n       I wish I could read all these letters into the record, but \n     I wanted to share just a sample with my colleagues in the \n     time I have.\n       One such letter came from Susan Powell of Buford, Georgia. \n     She writes, ``I have invested 31 years into a fabulous career \n     at Delta and I feel so blessed to have been able to work for \n     such a wonderful company all these years. The intentions of \n     the NMB are totally transparent and should not be tolerated \n     by Congress--or any other body or individual (including \n     President Obama) who claims to embrace honesty, fairness and \n     ethics. It is abundantly clear to me that motivation of the \n     newest Obama appointees to the NMB is to pave the way for the \n     AFA to gain entry into Delta Air Lines--I see no other \n     justification for imposing voting rules on Delta flight \n     attendants contrary to the voting rules applied to union \n     elections at all other carriers. I have loved my career at \n     Delta and I am so proud of the monumental efforts my company \n     and my fellow employees have made to emerge from bankruptcy \n     and return to profitability. I watched in horror years ago as \n     the unions at Eastern Airlines single-handedly brought their \n     own company to its knees--and I was forever grateful that I \n     had chosen to work for Delta, as opposed to Eastern. It is my \n     belief that an election in favor of the AFA will be the \n     ruination of my company and the end of the blissful career I \n     have enjoyed at Delta.''\n       Another eloquent letter came from Karla Kelsey. ``I am a 32 \n     year Delta flight attendant. I do not understand why the NMB \n     would change a rule that has been in place for 75 years. It \n     is, obviously, a decision partial to the unions, not the \n     employees. . . . I am not interested in union representation \n     and I resent how this situation has been handled. The impact \n     on my life would be hugely negative if the AFA is voted in. \n     What is fair about a union being able to come into my company \n     with only a majority of those who vote as opposed to a \n     majority of all flight attendants who would be represented?''\n       I didn't just hear from pre-merger Delta employees. I heard \n     from Avery C. Parker, who had been with Northwest Airlines \n     for 31 years. She writes, ``The NMB's decision to change the \n     75 plus year's old law concerning labor elections is very \n     disturbing to me to say the least. . . . Is this how a \n     government agency that has thousands of employees, counting \n     on them to have an un-bias opinion, should act?''\n       Several workers contacted me complaining about the \n     harassment they experience by union organizers. A flight \n     attendant from Greensboro, Georgia, Toni Holman complains \n     that ``pro-union activists are spreading really nasty and un-\n     true rumors; are using intimidation tactics; and are also \n     sabotaging the luggage, hotel rooms, etc of many flight \n     attendants who are vocal anti-union or have ``No Way AFA'' \n     bag tags on their suitcases. We are being targeted and \n     persecuted. I also feel harassed by the bombardment of un-\n     requested mail/e-mail/and telephone calls.''\n       Again, I received dozens of letters from across the \n     country. I will be including a sampling in the record of this \n     debate, so these workers know they have a voice in their \n     Congress.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I strongly oppose the resolution of \ndisapproval offered by my good friend, the Senator from Georgia. I \ntried to listen to all my friend said, but let's just keep in mind what \nthis is all about. The resolution we have before us would keep in place \noutdated and undemocratic election procedures that undermine workers' \nfundamental rights.\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nHard-working Americans deserve better, and I encourage my colleagues to \nvote down this resolution.\n  By way of background, the Railway Labor Act governs labor-management \nrelations for the rail and air industries. As the Supreme Court has \nnoted, the Railway Labor Act was expressly passed to ``encourage \ncollective bargaining.'' Under the act, a majority of employees have \nthe right to decide if they wish to be represented by a union, and they \nuse elections to make that choice. Unfortunately, for many years, the \nNational Mediation Board, which implements the Railway Labor Act, has \nhad antiquated elections procedures that place huge obstacles in the \nway of workers who are trying to exercise their basic right.\n  Under these archaic rules, a union did not win an election if it won \na majority of the votes cast. Let me repeat that. Under these archaic \nrules, a union did not win an election even though they may have won a \nmajority of the votes cast. How can that be? Well, because, instead, a \nmajority of all eligible voters, or all those who voted, a majority--\ninstead of just counting all of those who voted, it said it had to be \nall eligible voters had to cast a vote for the union. What that meant \nwas that anyone who didn't vote was automatically counted as a ``no'' \nvote. So all nonvoters were automatically and arbitrarily treated as a \n``no'' vote or a vote against unionization. So if you didn't vote, that \nequaled a ``no'' vote. Doesn't that strike you as kind of odd?\n  This procedure is not only contrary to the election rules governing \nworkers under the National Labor Relations Act, but it is contrary to \nbasic principles of democracy underlying elections held throughout the \nUnited States, from student council elections to elections for United \nStates Senators. Think about this. In virtually every election in this \ncountry, except those involving rail and aviation workers, a voter has \na right to vote one way or the other or not to vote at all. However, \nunder the archaic rules of the National Mediation Board, there is no \nright not to vote because if you don't vote you are counted as a ``no'' \nvote, whether you wanted to be a ``no'' vote or not. Maybe a lot of \npeople don't vote for one reason or another.\n  As Senators, it would be apparent to all of us that this current rule \nmakes no sense. For example, in the Senate, we cast hundreds of votes \nin each Congress. Inevitably, with one or two exceptions, most of us \nmiss a vote or two, whether there is something going on in our State \nthat we have to attend to or a family illness or whatever. We would be \noutraged if we missed a vote because of those circumstances and our \nvote was counted as a ``no'' vote when maybe we didn't want to vote no, \nbut it would be automatically counted as a ``no'' vote if we didn't \nvote. We would be outraged at that.\n  In addition, in our contests for reelection, we would be outraged if \nevery eligible voter who chooses not to vote is presumed to be a vote \nfor our opponent; in other words, a ``no'' vote on us. That is pretty \ninteresting, isn't it?\n  If you choose not to vote, you are counted as no. Well, it is no less \noutrageous to arbitrarily assign a position to nonvoters in a union \nelection.\n  Again, there are many reasons a person might not vote. As I \nmentioned, they might be ill, forgot, or maybe they are just \ndisinterested in the result, don't care one way or the other. That is \nwhy a basic principle of elections is that a voter's decision not to \nvote has no impact on an election's outcome. Again, I will repeat: A \nbasic principle of elections in our country is that a voter's decision \nnot to vote has no impact on the outcome of that election.\n  Indeed, in 1937, the Supreme Court, in Virginian Railway Company v. \nSystems Federation No. 40, in interpreting the very statute at issue--\nthe Railway Labor Act--expressly said:\n\n       Election laws providing for approval of a proposal by a \n     specified majority of an electorate have been generally \n     construed as requiring only the consent of the specified \n     majority of those participating in the election. Those who do \n     not participate are presumed to assent to the expressed will \n     of those who vote.\n\n  It makes sense. If you don't vote, what you are saying is, for one \nreason or another, whichever side wins, they win. Whatever the \nexpressed will is of the yes or the no, I give my assent to that by not \nvoting. That is what the Supreme Court said.\n  This basic system of conducting elections works for school boards. It \nworks for State legislatures. It works for Congress. It works for all \nbusinesses governed by the National Labor Relations Act, and it \ncertainly will work for rail and aviation workers.\n  Now, given the antidemocratic nature of its union election \nprocedures, in May the National Mediation Board issued a long overdue \nrule change. Under the new rules, a majority of those who actually vote \nin the election is required for the union to prevail. Under this \nprocedure, an employee, a worker, can choose to vote for a union, they \ncan choose to vote against unionization, or they can choose not to vote \nat all. The rule, very simply, recognizes that in an election, the side \nwith the most votes wins.\n  Well, I think the National Mediation Board should be commended for \nits new, more democratic rule. It is consistent with the procedure used \nin other elections in our country and will ensure fairness and equal \ntreatment for rail and aviation workers.\n  Nevertheless, my friend from Georgia and others wish to overturn the \napplication of these basic democratic principles to air and rail \nworkers. First, as I understand it, they argue that because the \nNational Mediation Board's old rules are 75 years old, they should \nremain unchanged. Well, just because something is old doesn't mean it \nshould remain forever. A rule's age is irrelevant in evaluating its \nfairness. Our country has rightly eliminated many flawed election rules \nwhen circumstances changed. It is time to discard this one too.\n  The justification for the original rule is long outdated. Rail and \naviation workers, like workers at many other businesses, are spread \nthroughout the country. Seventy-five years ago, with often poor \ncommunications, there was a legitimate concern that many employees \nwould not learn that a union campaign was taking place or that a vote \nwas scheduled. The National Mediation Board feared that a small but \ninformed minority of workers could dominate the election process and \ndictate a result for a majority of employees, many of whom may not even \nhave known an election was occurring. That is not true today. Given \ntoday's modern technology--the Internet, e-mail, cell phones--these \nconcerns are simply no longer relevant and should not dictate the \nBoard's current election procedures.\n  Secondly, I believe the Senator from Georgia is wrong when he claims \nthat the National Mediation Board has exceeded or does not have \nauthority to implement this rule change. On June 25, a Federal court \nrejected this argument, finding that the change was well within the \nagency's authority. The Railway Labor Act does not specify any \nparticular election procedures and leaves the means of conducting \nelections up to the Board.\n  The process the Board used to adopt their new rule was fair, open, \nand allowed all parties an opportunity to comment, using the same \nnotice and comment process under the Administrative Procedures Act as \nused by other Federal agencies.\n  The National Mediation Board published a notice of proposed \nrulemaking in the Federal Register on November 3, 2009, that included a \ndetailed explanation of why the Board was considering this change. It \nallowed parties 60 days to comment and provided a detailed rationale \nfor the proposal. The Board considered nearly 25,000 public comments \nand held a public meeting where over 34 members of the public \ntestified. Federal agencies issue new regulations every day following \nthe same notice and comment procedures employed by the Board in this \nprocedure, and nothing untoward happened here. It was fully open, fully \naboveboard, and in compliance, as I said, with the Administrative \nProcedures Act.\n  My friend from Georgia and others have argued that one of the \nNational Mediation Board members, Linda Puchala, may have somehow \nmisled Congress during her confirmation hearings and failed to consider \nthe new rule with a fair and open mind. There is simply no evidence to \nsupport this claim. On May 12, 2009, Ms. Puchala answered a written \nquestion from the Senator from Georgia. He asked:\n\n\n[[Page S7375]]\n\n\n       Please state your views regarding the importance of \n     honoring the Board's 60-year history of precedents in matters \n     involving representation and mediation.\n\n  That was the question. Ms. Puchala responded:\n\n       The board has a long history of precedents in matters \n     involving representation and mediation. I think it is \n     important to review each case on its merits and to \n     consider all applicable precedents when making decisions.\n\n  Sounds logical to me. It is important to review each case on its \nmerits. I would hope all individuals who have appointed positions in \nthe Federal Government would take cases on their individual merits. \nConsider precedents, of course, if they are applicable, but to consider \nit on its merits.\n  As I understand it, that is precisely what Ms. Puchala did in this \ninstance. In the almost 6 months between her confirmation and the \npublication of the notice of proposed rulemaking on November 3, 2009, \nshe had ample time to carefully consider all points of view about the \nproposed change and implemented what she considered to be a fair rule. \nAs a Federal judge wrote in rejecting these challenges:\n\n       The level of detail with which the agency considered and \n     discussed negative comments in the Final Rule belies \n     allegations that the Board rushed its consideration of the \n     new rule. . . .\n\n  That is a Federal judge.\n  Opponents have also argued--and I just heard this--that the \nRepublican National Mediation Board member Elizabeth Dougherty was \nunfairly excluded from the consideration of the new rule. While I \nbelieve the internal deliberative processes of agencies should \nappropriately be kept confidential, I am reassured by the district \ncourt's finding on this point that there was no evidence that the \nmajority board members violated any procedural rule or acted in bad \nfaith. That was the finding of the district court.\n  Finally, throughout the course of the public debate over this rule \nchange, opponents of the new rule have claimed that the National \nMediation Board is trying to ``do card check by running around the \nbackdoor.''\n  This is just pure nonsense. The National Mediation Board rule has \nnothing to do with the Employee Free Choice Act or card check. It does \nnot modify in any way the way rail and aviation workers vote. Rather, \nit simply makes clear that a decision not to vote will not arbitrarily \nbe treated as a ``no'' vote.\n  While this debate has nothing substantive to do with the Employee \nFree Choice Act or card check, there is one common thread. At the heart \nof opposition to this rule, and also at the heart of opposition to the \nEmployee Free Choice Act, is a fear on the part of some people that, \nyes, workers will exercise their fundamental right to organize.\n  I want to make it very clear. I happen to be a supporter of the \nEmployee Free Choice Act. I keep asking: Why is it that workers are \ncompelled to walk across broken glass, to go through some kind of a \nboot camp harassment to exercise what is their legal right in this \ncountry: to join a legal organization? Why should they have to go \nthrough all that? That is why I have supported the Employee Free Choice \nAct.\n  Let's be clear what we are talking about today. Let's be clear what \nthis means with this new rule. It means that rail and aviation workers \nhave a voice in the workplace. Some people may consider that awful. I \ndo not. It means fair wages and benefits. It means better and safer \nworking conditions. It means workers have the right to be heard. They \nhave the right to organize. They have the right to be heard in \ncollective bargaining.\n  Indeed--I repeat--the Railway Labor Act, as the Supreme Court noted, \nwas expressly passed to ``encourage collective bargaining.'' Maybe \nthere are some who do not want to encourage collective bargaining. I \nthink we are better off when we do have collective bargaining and we \nrespect the rights of workers in this country.\n  These are the goals I hope every Member of the body could support. I \napplaud the National Mediation Board's decision to discard an outdated, \nantidemocratic rule, and to ensure fundamental fairness to rail and \naviation workers in this country. Why should they be the only ones, \namong all the workers in this country, all those covered by the \nNational Labor Relations Act, why should these two be the only ones \nwhere if they do not vote, it is counted as a ``no'' vote. It does not \nhappen anywhere else. It is an arcane, outdated rule. It should be \nbrought into the spirit of democracy we have in this country. You can \nvote yes, you can vote no, or you do not have to vote. If you do not \nwant to vote, you should not be assigned a ``yes'' vote or ``no'' vote \nto the fact you did not vote. It should not be counted at all in the \noutcome of the election.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose this resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, let me take a moment to share a few \nalternative ideas to the distinguished Senator's representation.\n  First of all, with regard to Ms. Puchala's response to my question in \nthe confirmation hearing that all rules ought to be judged on their \nmerit, I think that is a very good response. But it is coincidental or \nironic that in one of the largest union votes in the history of \nAmerica--the vote that will take place between Delta and Northwest \nemployees on whether to unionize flight attendants--that when they were \nsworn in as board members, the previous application by the union for an \nelection was postponed to give enough time for the rule change to take \nplace in the first place.\n  I do not know if that was judgment on merit or whether it happened to \nbe just coincidental timing. I will say it was probably not based \nsolely on the merit of the decision.\n  Secondly--and I love the Senator from Iowa. He and I are dear \nfriends--if you follow his thought process on not counting ``no'' \nvotes, you have to look at this. Past practice at the National \nMediation Board dictated that an absolute majority of workers in the \nclass be required to vote to unionize, and once that union takes place \nit is a permanent decision. Yes, there is an archaic straw-man \nalternative. However, if you follow the thought of the Senator from \nIowa in its entirety, once we are elected to the Senate, we would not \nhave to run for reelection again. That is because the National \nMediation Board has no decertification process. This is essentially a \npermanent decision by the workers. I do not think it should be a \npermanent decision when one of us is elected to Congress. That is why \nwe have elections in Congress every 2 years or in the Senate every 6 \nyears.\n  Let's remember this is a decision. When we change this rule, we are \nallowing a minority to make a permanent decision for a class of \nworkers. That is a very high threshold. I think requiring a majority \nvote of all those affected not only makes sense, but the reason it was \ndone was to protect the National Mediation Board's intent in the first \nplace in terms of interstate commerce in the United States of America. \nAnother point Congress had no say in this process, even though Article \n1 of the Constitution of the United States allows only us to regulate \ncommerce.\n  I wanted to add those two points. On the case of merit, I think it is \nobvious there were some considerations specifically because of one \nvote, i.e, the vote of the AFA and IAM. That is why the unions withdrew \ntheir applications and postponed the vote, to give the National \nMediation Board an opportunity to pass the rule and affect a pending \nvote to organize.\n  I wanted to make a point with regard to current policy not allowing \npeople to be represented. Under the Railway Labor Act, 72 percent of \nthe employees are unionized versus the 8 percent for all American \nworkers. Nobody is talking about a rule preventing organization. We are \nonly talking about requiring a threshold because of the permanency of \nthe decision. That is very important.\n  We are not trying to skew the balance between labor and management. \nWe are trying to equalize that balance. To change this rule, given the \nthreshold that has been in place for 75 years, is to skew the process \nin favor of union bosses over workers' rights. That should not be the \nintent of the Congress of the United States. That is why the National \nMediation Board rules are what they are, and that is why the Supreme \nCourt of the United States has twice upheld it.\n\n[[Page S7376]]\n\n  Madam President, I am happy to yield 10 minutes of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I thank both my colleagues.\n  It has become customary to expect pendulum swings in labor law each \ntime the White House changes hands and appoints new government \nofficials to lead the Federal executive branch and independent \nagencies. Sometimes the law changes every 4 years, depending on who is \nsitting at the NLRB, Department of Labor, OSHA, EEOC, and so on. One \nyear a particular issue might favor labor, and 4 years later the very \nsame issue might favor management.\n  By analogy, at the NLRB, for example, 1 year graduate school teaching \nassistants are students not covered by the National Labor Relations \nAct. The next year they are deemed to be employees covered by the act. \nThen shortly thereafter, they are once again deemed to be students. \nSoon we may learn they will once again be employees.\n  The same is true with regard to the definition of ``supervisors'' \nexcluded from the National Labor Relations Act. One would think that \nafter 75 years, the NLRB would be able to define who is and who is not \na supervisor. Instead, the law changes as the political pendulum \nswings.\n  What has actually changed other than the people confirmed by the \nSenate to make the decisions, to call the shots? Without any evidence \nof changed circumstances in the workplace or relieving the agency's own \nadministrative burden--in fact, without any evident rationale--the only \napparent reason for the changes in the NMB's representation election \nprocess is in the people who call the shots.\n  Obviously, this is not the way to promote stability in labor \nrelations and employment law. It makes it difficult for employers, \nemployees, unions, and the lawyers counseling them to ever be assured \nwhat the law is in any given area or any given time.\n  Mercifully, for some issues and at some agencies, it does not work \nthat way. Until recently, that could be said for the National Mediation \nBoard and the process by which it conducted union representation \nelections.\n  For 75 years, the procedure which has been applied consistently by \nthe NMB for conducting union representation elections has been the \nsame.\n  Boards appointed by Democratic Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Johnson, \nCarter, and Clinton have agreed that the process through which labor \norganizations obtain certification as the representative of a majority \nof the craft or class is the cornerstone of stable labor relations in \nthe air and rail industries. That has been the law for 75 years.\n  In fact, the NMB appointed by President Carter unanimously ruled that \nit did not have authority to administratively change the form of the \nNMB's ballot used in representation elections and that such a change, \nif appropriate, could only be made by Congress. That is until now.\n  The new members of the NMB, after assuring this Senate under oath at \ntheir confirmation hearings that they had no plans to reverse \nprecedent, after only months on the job, reversed the NMB's longest \nstanding precedent.\n  By rule, the NMB now certifies representatives elected by a minority \nof the craft or class so long as they constitute a majority of those \nvoting. This is not just a minor change, this change destabilizes the \ncornerstone of stable labor relations under the Railway Labor Act and \n75 years of NMB precedent which was consistent with the plain statutory \nlanguage and congressional intent.\n  Here is how it is destabilizing. First, the former law which required \nelection of a representative by a majority of the craft or class \nquelled any doubts about the authority of the selected representative. \nThe new procedure will do nothing but foment dissent.\n  Second, the former certification procedure facilitated the process \nfor employees and their representative to work cohesively toward \nnegotiating and maintaining agreements with an air or rail carrier. The \ncarrier knew the majority of the entire craft or class supported the \nunion, not simply a majority of those voting. This gave the \nrepresentative more standing. The new procedure will undermine the \nrepresentative's authority.\n  Third, the former certification procedure discouraged raids by rival \nunions and interunion conflicts. The new procedure will encourage such \nraids.\n  Fourth, the former certification process recognized the reality in \nthe air and rail industries that, unlike the National Labor Relations \nAct, negotiations for collective bargaining agreements cover a broad \ncraft or class of employees spread over multiple, geographic locations. \nTherefore, there is a strong need to demonstrate majority support \nacross those geographic locations, not as the current procedure, \nsmaller units of employees.\n  So, if anything, the new rules are destabilizing rather than \npromoting greater stability. The result ignores the clear congressional \nstatutory mandate to maintain stability in the air and rail industries.\n  I repeat, after assuring us they would not do so, the new NMB members \noverruled 75 years of precedent which had been consistent through both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations. And how did they do it? It \ncertainly speaks volumes that the rule was developed without the input \nor participation of the sole Republican member of the three-member NMB, \nformer Chair Elizabeth Dougherty, who was notified of the existence of \na proposed rule late one morning and given 24 hours to review the rule \nand draft a dissent--24 hours to comment on a rule that scraps a \nprecedent which had existed for 75 years and which is likely to \ndiscombobulate two great industries. I thought this form of arrogant, \nrushed, exclusionary rulemaking only exists in Congress when the \nmajority wants to steamroll legislation.\n  Finally, while changing the rules for certification of a labor \nrepresentative, the NMB flatly refused to even consider the democratic \nprocedure of decertifying the labor representative should the employees \nso freely and independently choose. Now, I have heard of ``one man, one \nvote,'' but ignoring the right of the employees to decertify a union is \nmore like ``one man, one vote, one time.'' How can you have a \ndemocratic process where a minority of employees can vote a union in \nwithout having a mirror process allowing the majority of employees to \nbe able to vote the union out if a majority of employees become \ndissatisfied with their representation?\n  Today, we should stand up and say no--no, you cannot tell us one \nthing in confirmation hearings and courtesy visits and then do exactly \nthe opposite on the job. We should exercise our voting rights in the \nSenate under the Congressional Review Act to review this outrageous NMB \nrule which benefits only one group--labor unions--not employees, \ncertainly not employers, and not the public.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nI ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum be equally \ndivided between the majority and the minority.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I yield up to 6 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the resolution \nbefore us--a resolution of disapproval to prevent the implementation of \nthe recent National Mediation Board regulations. Many Americans are \nlikely unaware of the vote we are about to have today, let alone the \ncontroversial rule it concerns.\n  Last May, the National Mediation Board finalized a new regulation \nthat would turn 75 years of union voting precedent on its head. I \nbelieve a vote to support this resolution of disapproval is a vote to \nprotect our Nation's workers. Specifically, the National Mediation \nBoard has changed\n\n[[Page S7377]]\n\nthe voting rules under the Railway Labor Act. The Railway Labor Act is \nthe law that sets labor union rules for railways and airline employees. \nFor the past 75 years, under this act, a majority of employees in an \n``organizing unit'' have had to vote yes to form a union. Under this \nnew change, only a majority of employees who actually vote are needed \nto form a union.\n  How does this new rule work in practice? For example, if an airline \nhas 1,000 employees who are nonunion today, currently 501 must vote yes \nto unionize. But under this new union rule, if only 300 of those \nemployees vote, then it would require only 151 of those employees to \nunionize and speak for the entire 1,000 employees. Since there is no \nprocedure to deunionize under the Railway Labor Act, once this union is \nformed, these 1,000 employees would be permanently unionized. There is \nsimply no way to vote out a certified union in this part of the law \neven if a majority is unhappy with the union leadership. This doesn't \nmake sense given that the National Labor Relations Act--the law that \ngoverns most labor unions in this country--does allow workers to \ndeunionize.\n  It is also concerning that the National Mediation Board effectively \nblocked out the input of its sole Republican member, Chairman Elizabeth \nDougherty, during the rulemaking process. Chairman Dougherty stated:\n\n       The proposal was completed without my input or \n     participation, and I was excluded from any discussions \n     regarding the timing of the proposed rule.\n\n  That sounds like what has been going on here lately.\n  It certainly doesn't sound like the transparency on which the other \nside of the aisle campaigned.\n  The American people listening to this debate may be thinking this \nrule change sounds like nothing more than a political payback to labor, \nand in my opinion, they are right. The American people listening today \nmay also be thinking this whole debate sounds vaguely familiar, and \nthey would be right again. A proposal called card check may ring a \nbell. Recall that under the Democrats' card check litigation, American \nworkers would be deprived of the right to a secret ballot when voting \non whether to form a union. And while card check and the National \nMediation Board rule change may not be one in the same, they both lead \nto an identical outcome: undermining the fundamental rights of American \nworkers.\n  You may be asking whether this rule will help workers in the airline \nand railway industries unionize. Perhaps this rule is needed because \nthe employers have stacked the deck of cards against unionization \nefforts. But let's look at the facts. An average of 72 percent of \nairline and railway employees today are unionized, compared to only 8 \npercent in the rest of the private sector. I repeat: 72 percent in \nairlines and railways, only 8 percent in the rest of the private \nsector. So it can't be the case that this new policy is in response to \nthe failure of 75 years of voting precedent or employers blocking the \nability for employees to unionize. In fact, workers at Delta have voted \ndown six organizing drives over the past 10 years.\n  This Nation is facing unprecedented economic difficulties. I speak \nfrom experience. The unemployment rate in my State of Nevada is 14.4 \npercent. We lead the country, unfortunately. The Federal bureaucracy \nshould be working to strengthen our economy, not create an environment \nfor American businesses that leads to an uneven playing field and, at \nthe end of the day, more uncertainty. Uncertainty does not help create \njobs.\n  To conclude, the members of the National Mediation Board have not \nprovided Congress with any substantial evidence that a change in union \nvoting procedures is needed. I believe this rule change is a sign of a \ndangerous trend--a trend that runs counter to the core principles of \nAmerican democracy and the ability to choose freely through a fair \nvoting process. As such, I urge my colleagues to support Senator \nIsakson's resolution, S.J. Res. 30, and vote down the National \nMediation Board rule.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, first of all, I thank my colleague \nfrom Georgia for allowing me to come over to speak on this issue, and I \nrise to concur with the resolution introduced by my friend and my \ncolleague, Senator Isakson.\n  For more than 75 years, our labor laws governing airline and railway \nemployees have been upheld under both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations and in two Supreme Court decisions. Recently, however, \nthe National Mediation Board acted unilaterally to change a \nlongstanding statute without seeking the consent of Congress.\n  Unfortunately, this change is based more on politics than on the \nmerits of the law. Historically, if you had 100 employees who wanted to \nvote to form a union, you would need a majority of those employees--or \n51--to vote in favor of unionizing. Now, in accordance with the new \nrule change from the National Mediation Board, if 10 members choose to \nvote on whether to organize, a majority of 6 members voting yes would \nbring all 100 members under union control. That is not the way the law \nwas ever intended to operate, and it should not be changed by an \narbitrary action on the part of this Board. Not only would a minority \nof workers have a tremendous influence over other employees in such a \nworkplace, but when a union is formed, employees would not have the \nsame right to decertify the union under the new minority rule.\n  While the Obama administration is attempting to amend our labor laws \nin order to facilitate the unionization process, the old majority rule \nwas anything but anti-union because today an average of 72 percent of \nrailway and airline employees are unionized, compared to only 8 percent \nof all workers in the remainder of the private sector.\n  Not only is the new rule change flawed, but the procedure by which it \ncame about was dreadfully biased. The National Mediation Board is made \nup of three members and has existed since 1934 to coordinate labor-\nmanagement relations within the railroad and airline industries. The \ntwo Democratic appointees decided to move forward with this rule change \nwithout input or participation from the Republican-appointed Chairman.\n  What the National Mediation Board has implemented goes beyond the \nscope of its capacity as well as its jurisdiction, and it is going to \nresult in a rather lengthy court battle if this rule does come about. \nThere is no need for this rule change when 72 percent of the airline \nand railroad industry is already unionized and has had the opportunity \nto unionize under this law. The responsibility of a change in labor \nlaws of this magnitude and affecting this many workers should \nultimately rest with Congress, not with a small board of political \nappointees.\n\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the resolution of my \ncolleague from Georgia. I urge my colleagues to follow his lead on this \nissue and to agree to this resolution.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Isakson.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to reinstate the quorum call \nproviding the additional time used is equally divided between the \nmajority and minority.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I thank Senator Harkin for his \nleadership on this issue in opposing the Senate Joint Resolution 30. I \njoin him in urging my colleagues to oppose the resolution.\n  The National Mediation Board is an important entity. They have the \nresponsibility to oversee labor-management relations in the rail and \naviation industry. On May 11 of this year, they issued a final rule \nthat allowed a majority of voting employees--let me repeat that, a rule \nthat allows a majority of the voting employees--to determine the \noutcome of union representation elections.\n  I don't understand the controversy. I thought we all agreed that \nmajority rules, as far as what should happen. The rule is common sense. \nLet me explain the problem. I know it has been said before on the \nfloor.\n  Prior to this regulation, if a person did not show up and did not \nvote, it was counted as a negative. Suppose we conducted our elections \nthat way. Suppose we were to say that if a majority of people do not \nshow up to vote, you do not have an election. It makes sense that we \ncount the votes that are cast. We don't know, from who does not vote, \nhow they would vote, and to say that is a negative defies the \ndemocratic system we hold so dear in this country. Not participating \nvoters were counted as ``no'' votes, and this regulation makes it clear \nthat will no longer be the case.\n  Opponents of this rule change argue the Board does not have the \nauthority to change the rule. That is not true also. The Railway Labor \nAct gives the NMB discretion on conducting union elections and \nprocedure is not outlined in the statute. U.S. Supreme Court and \nDistrict Court decisions have confirmed that authority, so they have \nthat authority.\n  Then the opponents say this rule is about the Employee Free Choice \nAct, an issue that has some controversy among some of my Members. But \nthat is not true. This rule deals with areas where we already have \nunion representation.\n  I was proud to join 38 of my Senate colleagues in signing a letter in \nDecember of 2009, encouraging the National Mediation Board to change \nits outdated union election procedures. That is exactly what they have \ndone. The old procedure is not used in any other union elections. It \ndoes not follow the democratic norm for elections that all Americans \nvalue and respect. The old procedure does not even make any sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose S.J. Res. 30. To me, this is a matter \nof basic fairness. It is a matter of what the values of our Nation are \nall about. Those who participate get the right to decide. You cannot \nparticipate by not participating and that is what the rule makes clear. \nWe will count the votes that are cast, but we are not going to count \nthose votes that are not cast. I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will withhold the request for the quorum \ncall.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I will withhold it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 35 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. On the opposite side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 22 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have 35 minutes left on our side. I yield 10 minutes \nor however much he needs, up to 10 minutes to my friend, the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise to discuss my opposition to the \nresolution before us, the resolution disapproving the National \nMediation Board's ruling on election procedures. This ruling finally \nbrings union election rules in the rail and aviation industries in line \nwith union elections in every other industry. It also brings them in \nline with every other democratic election for public office at the \nFederal, State, and local levels.\n  Today, after the NMB rule change, a union election at an airline will \nbe like any other election. Employees who are the voters will have the \nopportunity to access a ballot. If they want union representation, they \nwill vote yes. If they do not want union representation, they will vote \nno. If they do not have a strong opinion or if they forget to vote, \nthen they do not count. Election officials count up the cast ballots \nand the category with the most votes wins.\n  Does anything about that description raise any flags? Probably not. \nBecause that is how elections work in this country. Prior to the NMB \nrule change, an airline union election worked very differently. \nElection officials counted people who did not vote as ``no'' votes. \nImagine if Senate elections worked that way for us--if, to elect a \nSenator, 50 percent of the eligible voters in the State had to vote for \na candidate. In the 2000 elections, when every single State except for \nmy home State of Minnesota had less than 60 percent turnout, what would \nhave happened?\n  Let's say, for the sake of it, that all the races had as high a \nturnout as Minnesota--60 percent. They did not, but let's say so. In \norder to capture 50 percent of the entire electorate, a candidate would \nhave to get 84 percent of the votes cast. If no Senator captured 84 \npercent under the old NMB rules, those States would not get a Senator. \nThere would be no one here or almost no one. It would be a lonely \nplace.\n  Thankfully, that is not how Senate elections work. Thankfully, \nairline elections will not work like that going forward. But that is \nhow they worked in the past. In a 2008 Delta flight attendant election, \nthe outcome was 5,306 in favor of union representation out of 5,375. \nThat sounds like a pretty strong victory in favor of the union, right? \nWrong. The National Mediation Board was forced to compute the tally by \ncounting nonvoters as ``no'' votes; thus, it ended up with 5,306 votes \nin favor of the union and 8,074 not in favor. So the vote failed, even \nthough less than 1 percent of those voting against the union \nrepresented actual cast ballots.\n  I should admit I have a special concern in this debate. My home State \nis home to thousands of Delta employees. Prior to the merger, they were \nNorthwest employees and most were unionized. Now they are facing a \nscary prospect: losing union representation after enjoying its benefits \nfor decades. Union representation has provided them with living wages, \nretirement security, and health benefits. Compare this to a flight \nattendant for a different airline who revealed she was eligible for \nfood stamps, despite working full time.\n  In professions in which full-time workers get food stamps, union \nrepresentation is even more vital. The NMB rule change will give Delta \nworkers a meaningful choice, the same meaningful choice voters have in \nevery other democratic election in this country. The claim that this \nrule change is unfair or undemocratic is simply not true. This change \nwill bring real democracy to elections in the airline and rail \nindustries. I think we can all agree that democracy has served our \ncountry well. I think we can agree on that. I urge my colleagues to \nvote against this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Before I introduce Senator Enzi, the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota asked a rhetorical question regarding this \nelection being similar to an election to the Senate. I would note one \nremarkable difference. National Mediation Board elections are unionized \nunder current law as a permanent decision. Senators are elected every 6 \nyears and then stand before the voters once again, so there is a \nsignificant difference between those two standards.\n  Madam President, I will recognize for up to 10 minutes the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this joint resolution disapproving the National \nMediation Board rule that will deprive railway and airline employees of \na voice in their representation elections.\n  For 75 years, the Board's procedure for voting on union \nrepresentation properly reflected the geographically broad workforce of \nthe rail and airline\n\n[[Page S7379]]\n\nindustries. Under this time-tested procedure, the workforce would \nbecome unionized if the majority of all the workers in a class voted to \njoin a union.\n  The new rule has changed the way employees' votes are counted in \norder to favor the union. For 75 years, not voting at all has counted \nas a no vote. Now, employees who do not vote or cannot vote will lose \nany chance to weigh in on the question of union representation. In \nfact, a minority of workers in a class could determine the fate of the \nentire workforce. This new rule conflicts with the plain language of \nthe statute. The method for selecting a union is expressly described in \nthe Railway Labor Act: ``The majority of any craft or class of \nemployees shall have the right to determine who shall be the \nrepresentatives of the craft or class for the purposes of this Act.'' \nNo matter what the Board's policy justifications for this rule are, the \nlaw is clear. Supporting this resolution will send a message to those \nwho want to change this 75-year-old rule to favor unions in an industry \nthat is already majority unionized. The only appropriate manner to \ncreate new policy here is to amend the statute.\n  Proponents of the new rule say the election procedure under the \nRailway Labor Act should mirror the procedure used under the National \nLabor Relations Act. While this procedure may work fine with smaller \nunits of workers, typically working within the same workplace, it is \nnot an equitable method for workers in the railway or airline \nindustries. The classes of railway and airline workers were \nintentionally created to be systemwide in order to allow uniform \nworkplace rules and prevent the shutdown of an entire carrier should \nthere be a strike in one local.\n  With workers geographically spread out across the country and working \non different shifts, it is difficult for transportation industry \nemployees to communicate their views with coworkers and voice their \nopinions during a union election. For 75 years, abstaining has been a \nway of saying ``not sure'' or ``need more information,'' as well as \n``no.'' In many companies, unions try year after year to gain the \nbacking of a majority of employees through elections. This rule change \nsilences those who do not vote because they don't feel like they have \ngotten enough information to decide. Instead of requiring a union to \nconvince the workforce to support the union, the Board is seeking to \nallow unions to force their way in. This is a matter of deep concern \nbecause once a union is certified, there is no way to decertify it.\n\n  Currently, the Board does not have a specific decertification \nprocess. This makes it nearly impossible for employees unhappy with \ntheir union to organize their fellow employees and vote the union out \nof their workplace. It seems logical that since the Board acted to make \nit easier for employees to join a union, it would have also simplified \nthe process for employees to get rid of their union. But, despite \nrequests to do so during the notice and comment period for the rule, \nthey did not. In fact, employees stuck in unions they do not support \nbecause of this rule will also not have the benefit of State right to \nwork laws, which would allow an employee to opt out of full union \nmembership and dues obligations. The Railway Labor Act preempts the 22 \nStates that have adopted right to work laws.\n  The Board has acknowledged that its primary duty in resolving \nrepresentative disputes is ``to determine the clear, uncoerced choice \nof the affected employees.'' I could not agree more. But that important \nduty needs to apply equally when employees seek to vote a union out of \ntheir workplace. The fact that the new rule fails to include a \ndecertification process based on the majority of votes cast, is not \nonly troubling, but evidences the true intent of the Board and this \nadministration to tilt the playing field to favor unions over \nindividual workers' rights.\n  Last year this body unanimously confirmed two nominees to the \nNational Mediation Board. Several members of the HELP Committee, \nincluding my office, specifically asked each of them about their \nposition on changing the way a majority in a unionization election is \nmeasured. In reply these nominees stated that they had no preconceived \nagenda to alter election rules that have been in place for 75 years. \nYet, practically before the ink had dried on their confirmations, these \ntwo nominees began pushing through this regulation which is a wholesale \nreversal of those rules to the benefit of labor unions. It is not as \nuncommon as it should be for nominees to say one thing in their \nconfirmation hearings and act differently once in office, but this \nexample may be one of the most concerning because of the way it was \ndone.\n\n  In their haste, the majority NMB members thoroughly disregarded the \nrights of the single minority member. The minority member was given no \nnotice about the other Board members' plans, including even the fact \nthat there was a rulemaking effort underway. Instead, she was presented \nwith the proposed rule to be published and given 1\\1/2\\ hours to review \nand determine if she would support it. They even tried to stop her from \npublishing a dissent to the rule proposal. Silencing dissenting views \nappears to be an alarming trend at the Board. And unfortunately, it has \ngone beyond the National Mediations Board.\n  Over at the National Labor Relations Board, workers' rights and \nfreedoms are similarly at risk. Just recently, at the end of August, \nthe NLRB chose to revisit a 2007 ruling known as Dana Corp. that \nprotected workers' rights to a secret ballot vote. In that 2007 ruling, \nthe Board held that card check was inferior to the use of secret ballot \nvoting in union elections. The Board concluded that when an employer \nrecognized a union in the workplace by card check, employees had the \nright to request a secret ballot vote to show whether they actually \nwanted union representation. This was an important ruling to protect \nworkers from union coercion and intimidation that can occur in the card \ncheck process. The ruling gave employees a voice in whether they \nactually wanted union representation, instead of having their employer \nand a union decide for them.\n  Now fast forward to August 2010. The NLRB has just decided to revisit \nthat 2007 ruling. Why? There has not been a major shift in management-\nlabor relations that warrants such a change. In fact, the 2007 ruling \nhas served as an important oversight mechanism. According, to the Wall \nStreet Journal, since the 2007 ruling, 1,111 workplaces have become \nunion by the card check process, of which 54 of those have demanded a \nvote. Only 15 of the 54, voted against the union. So clearly, the 2007 \nruling has not led to huge losses for the unions. But it did give \nemployees a say in their workplace.\n\n  This Congress should be very concerned about the current state of \nthese administrative boards that were intended to be independent. \nConcealed agendas cannot become the norm for Senate confirmed \npositions. If it is then we will have difficulty confirming anyone \nwhose former employer would fall under the nominee's jurisdiction.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, for offering this \nresolution to send a message to the National Mediation Board that when \nthey seek a change in policy, they must do so within their \nconstitutional and legal authority.\n  I also note that every member of our caucus has cosponsored Senator \nIsakson's resolution and joins him in sending this message. I urge all \nof my colleagues to vote for this resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I have long supported the rights of \nworkers to form unions, and I support the National Mediation Board's \nnew rule allowing those in the rail and airline industries to form a \nunion based on the votes cast by a simple majority, a basic principle \nof democracy.\n  Under the previous rule, a vote not cast was counted as a vote \nagainst the union, in spite of the fact that it is impossible to \ndiscern the intention of someone not casting a vote. The new rule \nadopted by the National Mediation Board mirrors the practice of the \nNational Labor Relations Board, which oversees union elections in other \nsectors, and it mirrors the rules by which we choose our elected \nofficials: the only votes counted are those actually cast.\n  Discontinuing this unfair and undemocratic practice was the right \nthing for the National Mediation Board to do. The new rule is fair to \nall parties, and is consistent with our democratic traditions. For this \nreason, I do not support the Isakson resolution opposing this new \nregulation.\n\n[[Page S7380]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I do not have any more speakers on our \nside. I wanted to respond on a couple of issues that have come up here \nin the remarks in the last several minutes, last hour and a half, I \nguess, since we have been here.\n  First, having to deal with the idea that somehow under the National \nMediation Board when there is an election for a union that it is \npermanent. Now, right. I mean, my friend from Georgia is right. You \ncannot kind of compare it to Senators, because we have to run every 6 \nyears. I understand that.\n  I think it is still holds, though, that should someone who does not \nvote be counted as a no or a yes either way--I would ask my friend from \nGeorgia to think about this in terms of not elections for Senators but \nhow about ballot initiatives? We have school bond issues, and school \nbond issues get, maybe, what, 30 percent of the vote out. Should all of \nthe people who do not vote be counted no against a bond issue?\n  I do not know about my friend's State of Georgia, but I know in Iowa \nwe have retention ballot initiatives for our judges. We have a very \ngood nonpartisan, nonpolitical way of getting judges. But then the \njudges come up on the ballot every so often. Yes or no, should they be \nretained? They do not have to run against anybody and no one runs for a \njudgeship. But should they be retained?\n  Well, obviously not too many people vote on that. Should people who \ndo not vote be counted automatically as a no vote? I do not think \npeople would like that. A lot of people do not vote because they may \nnot have enough information to vote one way or the other, so they leave \nit go and say, well, maybe other people who know better could have \ntheir votes counted yes or no.\n  We have had ballot initiatives for minimum wages. Should all of those \nwho do not vote be counted as no? I think it is a very fundamental \nprinciple of our system of government, as the Supreme Court has said \nmany times in the past, that a ballot not cast should not in any way \ninfluence the outcome of the election, of any election.\n  The outcome of the election is determined by the yes and no votes, \nnot by people who do not vote, a very basic principle. So that is one \npoint I wanted to clarify.\n  This old rule of the National Mediation Board that people keep \ntalking about, saying it is been the same for 75 years, I could quite \nfrankly argue that it should not have been that way in the first place, \nalthough as I said in my opening statement I understand some of the \nrationale for it, that 75 years ago, where you did not have rapid \ncommunications and things such as that, you would not want a small \ngroup that maybe had voted a union in, and other people did not even \nknow about it. But that is hardly the case today. Hardly. Everyone \nknows about it with instant communications and everything else. That is \nhardly the case today.\n  It is time to get rid of old, archaic rules that govern certain kinds \nof elections. Gosh knows, we have had a lot of old archaic rules in \nelections in this country going back to Jim Crow laws and things such \nas that. But we have moved beyond that, and those old kinds of rules \nshould not apply any longer. So we move on and we recognize that people \nought to have the right to vote, and that if you do not vote, it should \nnot be counted as a no or a yes vote one way or the other.\n  Regarding the issue of when the union is voted in, it is as though \nthey are forever, it is permanent. I have heard that argument made. \nWell, that is not necessarily true. But that is under the National \nLabor Relations Act the same thing. If a union is voted in, it is not \nvoted in for 1 year or 3 years or 5 years. It exists until such time as \nthe union is decertified.\n  There are two processes. There is a process under the National Labor \nRelations Act for decertification, and there is a process under the \nNational Mediation Board for decertification. Essentially, with the \nexception of how they start, they both rely upon an election by secret \nballot as to whether the union will continue to represent the workers \nof that plant or that industry or that association or whatever.\n  Under the National Mediation Board, if a union was voted in, the \nemployees could at some point say, look, I do not think enough people \nwant to maintain a union here. What they do is they put up a person to \nrun in a union election, a straw man. People know if they vote for that \nperson, they are voting to get rid of the union, because if that person \nwins, that person will not represent the workers.\n  This is done. There is nothing wrong with that. It is fine. So \nworkers know if they vote for this person, it ends the union. If they \nvote against this person, it continues the union. It is all by secret \nballot. The National Labor Relations Act is basically the same way. If \nan employer or employees want to decertify a union, they file a \npetition with the NLRB, and then there is an election, as to whether \nthe union will continue to represent the workers.\n  There may be a little bit of difference in structure between the \nNational Labor Relations Act and the National Mediation Board, but, in \nessence, they are the same thing. You have a secret ballot as to \nwhether the union continues. So it is not that the union is there in \nperpetuity, it is there as long as the workers want to continue to be \nrepresented by a union.\n  Lastly, I will digress a little bit from the point at hand; that is, \nthe issue at hand on the matter before us on overturning this rule, to \nsay a couple of things about unionization and workers who belong to \nunions in our country. It is a shame that union workers are somehow \nalmost degraded as not even being worthy of being citizens in this \ncountry; that somehow a union has dark overtones, that somehow unions \nare destructive or not in keeping with American society or who we are \nas a people.\n\n  If we look at the history of the country, it was unions that built \nthe middle class in America. I defy anyone to refute what I just said, \nthat it was unions that built the middle class. It was unions that \ninstituted things such as the minimum wage, such as safe working \nconditions, such as making sure they had a fair share in terms of \nwages, that they had an 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek and time \nand a half overtime--all these things were brought by unionization, \npeople collectively bargaining for wages, hours, and conditions of \nemployment. Maybe there are some who would like to undo the Wagner Act. \nIf they do, fine. I suppose some people believe we shouldn't have any \nunions at all.\n  China doesn't have any independent unions. Do we want to be like \nthat? Unions built the middle class in America.\n  Unions today do a very good job of representing workers, both in the \npublic and private sectors. Today, we have too few people in America \nwho actually belong to unions. We should have more, but we have made it \nmore and more difficult for people to freely exercise their right to \nactually join a union. I just looked at a list of countries in the G8. \nWith the exception of Russia, which I can't get figures for, the United \nStates basically is at the bottom. Canada, 27 percent of their \nworkforce is unionized; Japan, 18 percent; Italy, 33 percent; Germany, \n19 percent. Look at the economy of Germany. The United Kingdom is 27 \npercent, and the United States is 11.9 percent. We are down there at \nthe bottom. One cannot say that somehow if we have unions and we are \nhighly organized, that our economy is going to be bad. Quite frankly, \nthese other economies are doing as well or better than we are, and they \nhave pretty strong unions.\n  I digress because it seems that time after time we hear people in a \nsubtle way hinting or implying that unions, by their very nature, are \nsomehow destructive of American free enterprise and our capitalist \nsystem. I don't think anything could be further from the truth. If it \nwere not for unions, our economy would have gone down the tubes a long \ntime ago.\n  Quite frankly, I believe one of the reasons we have seen in the last \nfew years a widening gap between the rich and the poor--and it is \nhappening; no one can refute that. The gap between the very wealthy and \nthose at the bottom is growing rapidly and has grown rapidly just over \nthe last 10, 15, 20 years--is coincidental with the fact that fewer and \nfewer people belong to unions, and more and more unions are being \ndecertified or it is more difficult for people to join unions. Unions \nare\n\n[[Page S7381]]\n\nbeing busted through by one means or another.\n  I often tell the story of my brother Frank. He is now deceased. He \nwent to work for a plant in west Des Moines, IA, back in the early \n1950s. It was unionized by the United Auto Workers. My brother was \ndisabled, but the owner of the plant--it was privately held--Mr. \nDelavan, owned the plant and hired a lot of people with disabilities. \nThey had good jobs, good wages and hours. It was a great place to work. \nHe worked there for 23 years. He worked there for 10 years one time, \nhis first 10 years, and they gave him a gold watch because in 10 years \nhe never missed 1 day of work and was not late once. In fact, in 23 \nyears, he only missed 5 days of work because of a blizzard. In all \nthose years, they never had one labor strike, not one labor problem, no \nstrikes, nothing. They would have their bargaining agreement. They \nwould bargain with the owner. They would move on. They never had a work \nstoppage, never had any problems, until Mr. Delavan got old and sold \nthe plant to a group of investors.\n  The investors came in and openly bragged--and I have the newspaper to \nprove it--if you want to see how to get rid of a union, come to \nDelavan's. That was in the Des Moines Register.\n  When the contract came up for negotiation, the employer refused to \nnegotiate. They would sit down and talk for a little bit, but nothing \ncould be agreed upon. It went on and on. Finally, the union had to call \na strike, the first time ever. The new owners, the investors, brought \nin what the striking workers called the scabs, the replacement workers, \nbrought them in, kept them there. One year later, they had a vote to \ndecertify the union because the new people there didn't want to lose \ntheir jobs. They decertified the union, busted the union.\n  Why did they want to do that? Because a lot of the people, such as my \nbrother who had worked there for 23 years, had established seniority. \nThey were getting paid a good hourly wage. But the new investors \nfigured out they could get rid of all those people, hire younger \npeople, pay them a lot less, and they would make more profit. That is \nexactly what happened. Investors made more profit. But they got rid of \na lot of people and destroyed a lot of lives. People who had worked \nthere for a long time and had families basically were told they were \nused up, burned out, out on the trash heap out in back.\n  I often think about that. I think about what happened. There was no \nreason to break that union other than to have more profits for the \ninvestors and less for the workers.\n  That has been going on in this country at least for the last 25 to 30 \nyears. So is it any surprise that fewer and fewer people are getting \nmore and more wealth and more and more people are getting less?\n  I hear people talking about unions and they don't want to strengthen \nunions, don't want to help unions. I want to make sure the playing \nfield is open and level and that the secret ballot is fairly used, that \npeople should have a better chance at joining a union than what they \nhave in the United States today. That is why I am for the Employee Free \nChoice Act. It will strengthen the right of people to actually freely \nand openly join a collective bargaining unit. That would be better for \nthe country. I state that unequivocally. The more and more we denigrate \nworkers in terms of their ability to collectively bargain, we will hurt \nthe economy. When we strengthen unions, when we strengthen people and \ngive them better rights and better chances to organize and bargain \ncollectively, then more and more of our money, our national economy, \nmore of that will go to the workers, maybe less to capital. I think \nthat is the way it should be. Too much of our money is going to capital \nand not enough to labor. We need a better balance there. About the only \nway that will happen is through collective bargaining.\n  Count me as a person who is strongly in favor of collective \nbargaining and strongly opposed to this effort to overturn a rule made \nby the National Mediation Board which I believe rights an injustice, \nrights a wrong, and says that: In the future, if you have an election, \nif you don't vote, your vote is not counted one way or the other. The \noutcome of the election will be decided by those who vote yes or no in \na secret ballot.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:20 p.m., there be \n10 minutes of debate remaining on the joint resolution; that it be \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Isakson and Harkin; \nfurther, that at 12:30 p.m., the Senate immediately proceed to a vote \non the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 30, the joint resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time is on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKING. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I wish to address the remarks of the \ndistinguished chairman which in many ways validate the reason we should \nall vote for S.J. Res. 30. I wish to tell my colleagues why.\n  The chairman said unionization is permanent, but it is kind of not \npermanent if you make a decision under the National Mediation Board. I \nwish to clear that up.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the October 8, 2009, \nletter from Sandra Polaski, Deputy Under Secretary of Labor for the \nObama administration, sent to Cleopatra Doumbia-Henry, Director of \nInternational Labor Standards Department, International Labor Office in \nGeneva, Switzerland, who was asked a number of questions regarding U.S. \nlabor law as it affects aviation and transportation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Department of Labor,\n\n\n                               Bureau of Int'l. Labor Affairs,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2009.\n     Ms. Cleopatra Doumbia-Henry,\n     Director, International Labor Standards Department, \n         International Labor Office, Geneva, Switzerland.\n       Dear Ms. Doumbia-Henry: Enclosed are the observations of \n     the United States Government in Freedom of Association Case \n     No. 2683 concerning the procedures and practices of the \n     National Mediation Board, with particular reference to flight \n     attendants at Delta Airlines. I trust that this information \n     will be brought to the attention of the Governing Body \n     Committee on Freedom of Association.\n       Per your request, we invited the U.S. Council for \n     International Business to submit their views, and those of \n     Delta, on the complaint. We will transmit these observations \n     as soon as they are available.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sandra Polaski,\n                                            Deputy Undersecretary.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will quote from her answer to question 15.\n\n       Unlike the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the \n     [Railway Labor Act] does not provide for a decertification \n     process.\n\n  This is the Under Secretary of Labor for the Obama administration.\n\n       Therefore, the union's certification continues until \n     another union makes a showing of interest to represent the \n     respective class or craft. In this circumstance, as this \n     showing requires authorization from at least a majority of \n     the class or craft, the alleged disadvantage of NMB \n     certifying method works to the advantage of the incumbent \n     union.\n\n  I didn't say that; the Under Secretary of Labor said that.\n  With regard to the examples the distinguished chairman used with \nregard to bond issues and the Missouri plan and things of that nature, \nI wish to make a few points.\n  When you do vote for a bond issue, you vote it up or down. Most \ngovernment bond issues are 20- to 30-year terms, which means in 20, 30 \nyears, they are over. Organization under the National Mediation Board \nis in perpetuity. Then the distinguished chairman talked about what I \nthink is called the Missouri plan, which is judges, where you can vote \nup or down on whether to continue a judge. You do that about every 4 \nyears in the State of Iowa; right? Whatever the judicial term is, it is \nnot in perpetuity. This is in perpetuity, with the narrow exception \nstated.\n  Then, the chairman talked about the minimum wage. The minimum wage \nhas risen from $1 to its current level because we periodically had \nelections to change it. This is permanent.\n\n[[Page S7382]]\n\n  So when we take the arguments he made about being anti-union or not \nin favor of unions, the National Mediation Board organization \nessentially guarantees the organization of a union remain in \nperpetuity, which is why it ought to require a majority of all people \ncovered.\n  The chairman talked about an Iowa union that had been decertified. \nThose employees work under the NLRA. We can't have it both ways. The \nRailway Labor Act should be like the National Labor Relations Act, \nunder which the decertification process is parallel to the organization \nprocess.\n  I am honored and privileged to represent the State that is home to \nDelta Airlines. I know what kind of an employer they are, and they do \nnot deserve to be vilified by the Obama Administration. I have a letter \nI have already asked to be printed in the Record, but I would like to \nread a part of this letter from a Delta employee by the name of Susan \nPowell of Buford, GA. She writes:\n\n       I have invested 31 years into a fabulous career at Delta \n     [Air Lines] and I feel so blessed to have been able to work \n     for such a wonderful company all these years. The intentions \n     of the National Mediation Board are totally transparent and \n     should not be tolerated by Congress--or any other body or \n     individual (including President Obama) who claims to embrace \n     honesty, fairness and ethics. It is abundantly clear to me \n     that motivation of the newest . . . appointees to the \n     National Mediation Board is to pave the way for an \n     Association of Flight Attendants to gain entry into Delta Air \n     Lines--I see no other justification for imposing voting rules \n     on Delta flight attendants contrary to the voting rules \n     applied to union elections at all other carriers.\n\n  That is a key point.\n\n       I have loved my career at Delta and I am so proud of the \n     monumental efforts my company and my fellow employees have \n     made to emerge from bankruptcy and return to profitability. I \n     watched in horror years ago as the unions at Eastern Airlines \n     single-handedly brought their own company to its knees--and I \n     was forever grateful that I had chosen to work for Delta, as \n     opposed to Eastern. It is my belief that an election in favor \n     of the AFA will be the ruination of my company and the end of \n     the blissful career I have enjoyed at Delta.\n\n  I have tons of letters from Delta employees--including from many who \nwere employed by NMA before the merger--that are just like the remarks \nmade by Susan Powell. This is a great company, a company where, on one \nof its anniversaries, its employees raised the money internally to buy \nthe company an anniversary jet for their fleet. Delta Air Lines is a \ngreat company that has operated under the National Mediation Board's \nregulations since it was incorporated as an airline carrier in the \nUnited States of America. Those regulations should continue without \nthis pro-union change by the Obama Administration, as they should for \neverybody else in the 75-year history who has been granted their rights \nunder a National Mediation Board regulation, which has served the \nindustry well, served commerce in the United States of America well, \nand served transportation well. We should not allow two members of an \nappointed board to overturn 75 years of history and 75 years of \nprecedent.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, are we at 12:20 p.m., the time where we \nhave 10 minutes divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes until that appointed time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will take 3 minutes.\n  First of all, in response to my friend from Georgia--and he is my \nfriend; he is a great guy--this person, Ms. Polaski, Under Secretary of \nLabor, may have written a letter, but as Under Secretary of Labor she \ndoes not work for the National Mediation Board. She does not \nnecessarily have the experience of interpreting its laws or procedures. \nThat is the job of the National Mediation Board itself and of Federal \njudges, which, I have to remind you, upheld the Board's actions 100 \npercent in this matter.\n  Secondly, on the matter of decertification, I strongly disagree with \nmy friend from Georgia. There is a procedure under the National \nMediation Board, as under the National Labor Relations Act. If a person \nwants to get rid of the union under the NMB, they can file a petition, \nif they can get 50 percent plus one person to show an interest--quite \nsimilar to the National Labor Relations Act. If they can get 50 \npercent, they can file a petition with the NMB. The NMB then has an \nelection. If that person wins, that person is not represented by any \nunion, so the union is gone. There is just a little bit of a difference \nfrom the National Labor Relations Act, but the outcome is basically the \nsame.\n  So there is a way. The Senator is right. I would say my friend is \nright; it is not a formal decertification. But it is a way of getting \nrid of the union, one way or the other. It may not be formal \ndecertification, but it is a way that the union can be gotten rid of \nunder the NMB.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time now is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as an agreement between the Senator from \nGeorgia and myself, we have agreed that since he is the author of this \njoint resolution, he will close out the debate. I think that is proper.\n  I will just take a little bit of the remaining time on this side \nagain to reiterate why this resolution of disapproval should be \ndefeated.\n  No. 1, as has been adequately stated many times, it is time to get \nrid of antiquated, outdated rules that say if you do not vote, it is \ncounted as a ``no'' vote. That does not make any sense.\n  Again, this idea that it is in perpetuity--it is not. There are ways \nfor people to get rid of unions under the NMB, as under the NLRB. So it \nis not in perpetuity at all. It is just, again: How should ballots be \ncounted? Should a person who does not vote be counted as a ``no''? That \nshould not be so.\n  Even if you accept the argument that it is in perpetuity, why should \nsomeone who does not vote be counted as a ``no'' vote? On the judges, \nwe say that every 4 years they are up. That is true; they are not kind \nof in for perpetuity. But why should someone who does not vote be \ncounted as a ``no'' vote? It does not make sense in any system. I do \nnot care what the length of time is or whether it is in perpetuity or \nfor 2 months or 2 days; those who do not vote should not be counted no \nor yes, one way or the other.\n  Secondly, the National Mediation Board went through proper procedures \nin giving notice and comment in rulemaking. As I said, they published \nit on November 3 of last year, a detailed explanation of why they were \nconsidering it. They had 60 days of comment, 25,000 public comments, a \npublic hearing. Thirty-four members of the public testified.\n  Well, this is what Federal agencies do. They follow the \nAdministrative Procedures Act in doing this, and that is exactly what \nthe Board did.\n  So no one was misled. No one was kept out of it. There was no \nevidence to support any claims that one member somehow was excluded or \ndid not have an opportunity to have input into this process.\n  Again, I understand why this resolution has come up. I understand \nthat for whatever reason, Delta Air Lines does not wish to be \nunionized. Well, that is fine. That is their right. But there ought to \nbe a process whereby the workers have a fair, open chance to organize, \nif they want to. It is not illegal in this country to belong to a \nunion--perfectly legal. The National Mediation Board has set up rules \nand procedures under which workers who work for Delta or for \nNorthwest--the combined group now--can decide whether they want to have \na union. To me, that is the American way.\n  So why should we now say: Well, no, we want that old rule that if you \ndo not vote, it is counted as a ``no'' vote? That is what this is all \nabout. Stripped to its essence, if you vote for the resolution \nintroduced by my friend from Georgia, what you are saying is, if a \nperson does not vote, it is counted as a ``no'' vote. You are also \nvoting to override the National Mediation Board's decision, which has \nalready been upheld by Federal courts.\n  But, in essence, that is what it is. If you believe a person who does \nnot vote\n\n[[Page S7383]]\n\nshould have their vote counted as a ``no'' vote, you probably ought to \nvote for my friend's resolution. I do not think we should.\n  I think we should uphold good democratic principles, principles by \nwhich, I say, bond issues or other ballot initiatives are always done. \nYou do not count someone if they do not vote. We do not do it here. We \ndo not do it anywhere in this country, and it should not apply here any \nlonger. So I ask for a ``no'' vote on the resolution of disapproval so \nwe can have free, fair, and open elections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I keep hearing the argument that you \nshould not count a ``no'' vote; it is undemocratic. Today, at 2:15, the \nSenate will vote on a cloture motion, and everyone who does not vote is \ncounted as a ``no'' vote as it requires 60 votes out of 100 to get \ncloture. So we have to make that point from the outset, No. 1.\n  No. 2, this is not about being antiunion or against unions or \npromanagement. This is about a 75-year-old history in the United States \nof America for the essential service of commerce in terms of railroads \nand airlines. We have historically had the National Mediation Board \nrule that required a majority of the people who would be affected in \nthe class rather than just a simple majority of those voting for a very \nprecise reason: because it is a permanent decision, as referenced by \nthe quotes in letters from the Under Secretary of Labor.\n  While I understand the chairman's remark that the Under Secretary of \nLabor is just the Under Secretary of Labor, she is the Under Secretary \nof Labor appointed by the President of the United States.\n  While the chairman says the courts have ruled in favor of this \nparticular ruling of the National Mediation Board, the Supreme Court \nhas twice said they are wrong. Granted, those were in other cases. But \ntwice the National Mediation Board authority has gone to the U.S. \nSupreme Court, and twice the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld it.\n  Even all the way back to 1976, President Jimmy Carter, from the State \nof Georgia, spoke eloquently about the importance of National Mediation \nBoard rules and what it takes to unionize under that versus the NLRB.\n  So I appreciate very much the arguments the Senator has made, but the \nfacts are quite clear that it is better for the United States of \nAmerica, it is better for workers in the transportation industry, and \nit has been historically upheld by the highest Court in the land that \nthe rules of the National Mediation Board serve the people of the \nUnited States of America better than any other alternative that was \npresented.\n  So with all due respect, I would quote that letter, once again, from \nthe Delta flight attendant who talked about their 31-year experience. \nWhy would you, in the cause of a merger, have a union request for an \nelection pulled out to give a board enough time to change the rules \nunder which that election would take place? It is not fair.\n  I wish to also say the 1996 Congressional Review Act is very \nimportant. Congress ought to have a say-so in the action of boards of \nthe executive branch. We do have a system of three branches of \ngovernment. We do have a system of checks and balances. But it has \nobviously been, apparently--as in this case and in others--that this \nadministration has attempted, where it can, to go around the authority \nof the Senate in advice and consent, by appointing czars or, in this \ncase, to go around the Senate of the United States by using the \nNational Mediation Board.\n  I would respectfully submit this is a legitimate question--not of \nwhether you are for a union or against one or prefer management and do \nnot prefer a union--this is a debate about extending a 75-year-old \nprecedent which has served the United States of America well and has \nbeen upheld in 12 administrations and by the Supreme Court twice. It \nhas been argued favorably by those 12 administrations every time it has \nbeen challenged and by the current administration's documentation, \nwhich I submitted, which has shown this is a permanent decision at the \nNational Mediation Board.\n  I would submit, the right thing for us to do is to join together \ntoday and vote yes in favor of the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 30. I \nrespectfully urge my colleagues to do that.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 30.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nFinance Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n4994, taxpayer assistance, and the Senate then proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the \ntext of the Baucus substitute amendment, the text of Calendar No. 572, \nS. 3793, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the substitute amendment be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the title \namendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, will the \nSenator from Washington modify her request to substitute a Thune \namendment regarding extenders, the text of which is at the desk?\n\n[[Page S7384]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Washington modify her \nrequest?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I am sorry. I was distracted. Is there a \nUC request pending before the Senate at this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Might I ask, who is propounding the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is offered by the Senator from Washington. \nThe Senator from South Dakota has asked for her to modify this request.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, who has been a true champion in helping us \nget some critical tax extenders passed. I am deeply disappointed that \nthe Republicans have again objected to us moving forward.\n  Middle-class families in my home State of Washington are struggling. \nI have heard from so many of them who have lost their jobs, who have \nseen their life savings disappear, who told me they were doing \neverything they can to pay their bills and keep their homes and get \ntheir lives back on track. And they are asking for just a little bit of \nhelp. So it is for these families and many others across Washington \nState that I come to the floor today.\n  Over the last few months, we have tried to pass legislation that \nwould extend critical tax cuts for our middle-class families across the \ncountry who are struggling today and need some support. But every time \nwe try to pass this bill, as we just tried to do, Senate Republicans \nblock it. They said no to a commonsense proposal that will cut taxes \nfor innovative companies that expand and create jobs. They just said no \nto a bill that will help our clean energy companies compete and expand. \nThey said no to our plan to extend the critical sales tax deduction \nthat would put more money into the pockets of families in States such \nas Washington. They said no despite the fact that these tax cuts are \nfully paid for.\n\n  So, Madam President, I want to focus on a few pieces of this \nlegislation that middle-class families and small businesses in my home \nState of Washington are counting on us to pass.\n  First of all, I want to spend a few minutes on one of the tax credits \nthat has just been blocked that is truly a matter of fundamental \nfairness for families in my home State of Washington. As all of my \ncolleagues know, State and local governments across the country use a \nnumber of different tools to raise revenue. Some have income taxes, \nsome use the sales tax, others use a combination of both. Families who \npay State and local income taxes have long been able to offset some of \nwhat they pay for by receiving a deduction on their Federal taxes. But \nuntil 2004, taxpayers didn't have the ability to deduct their State \nsales tax, which meant families and small businesses in States where \nthat was their main revenue source were paying more than their fair \nshare. That was wrong. Back in 2004, I fought hard, along with Senator \nCantwell and others, to change that provision and finally level the \nplaying field for Washington State.\n  I am proud to say that change saved families and small businesses in \nmy State hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Unfortunately, \nhowever, the State sales tax deduction is due to expire this year. \nUnless we act--and we were just blocked from doing so--families across \nmy State are going to suffer. They are going to have less money in \ntheir pockets, and they are going to have more uncertainty in the Tax \nCode.\n  I have heard from a lot of my constituents who have told me they are \nnow holding off making major purchases simply because they are not sure \nif that tax deduction will be there for them. They are putting off the \npurchase of cars, of home appliances, and that is hurting our State's \nbusiness climate, just as our small businesses are struggling to \nrecover.\n  So this is not just about removing a bias in the Tax Code that is \nfundamentally unfair to States such as mine, it is also about \nencouraging spending and boosting our economy, helping our small \nbusiness owners, and providing some long-awaited certainty so taxpayers \nin my State can plan for their financial future. In other words, it is \nabout helping middle-class families and supporting Main Street \nbusinesses.\n  I also want to talk about another tax credit that just got blocked. I \nrecently visited a clean energy company in Seattle, WA, called Propel \nFuels. This business has been fighting to market domestically \nproduced--domestically produced, right here--low-carbon biodiesel, but \nthey depend on a critical biofuels tax that expired. The bill I just \nattempted to pass--blocked by Republicans--would extend that critical \nprovision.\n  Propel Fuels represents the future of our economy. They are the kind \nof company that will help make sure our country remains at the \nforefront of innovation and growth. It is a company working to drive \nour economy forward and create new 21st-century careers. But they can't \ndo it alone. After years and years of subsidies and tax breaks for the \noil industry, companies such as Propel Fuels depend on the clean energy \ntax credits in this bill to be able to compete on a level playing \nfield. These credits support companies that are working on new, \ninnovative, and renewable energy sources, and they will help them \ncontinue their work to unshackle this economy, tap the creative energy \nof our workers, and create good, high-paying jobs in my home State of \nWashington and across the entire country.\n  This is exactly what our economy needs right now--jobs right away and \na strong investment for the future. That is why it is so important the \nbiodiesel tax credit be extended, along with the R tax credit and \nother tax cut extensions that are in the bill I just offered to move \nand which was blocked, once again, by Republicans. These companies want \nto expand, they want to create jobs, and they were just told no.\n  This should not be a partisan issue. It is common sense. We put \ntogether a bill that would extend tax credits to individuals and to \nsmall businesses--tax credits that have been supported in the past by \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. It is a bill that will provide \nincentives for clean energy companies to expand and create jobs, and we \nneed that badly now. It would allow families in my home State of \nWashington to deduct their local sales tax from their Federal returns, \nand that would support companies that are innovative and creative and \nhelping our economy get back on track.\n  It is fully paid for, as this country has told us we must do. It is \nresponsible, and it is the right thing to do.\n  In my home State of Washington, families are hurting. Many of them \nare fighting every day just to stay on their feet. This bill isn't \ngoing to solve every problem overnight, but it will put money back in \ntheir pockets and help our local businesses expand and create jobs so \nwe have hope for the future. It pays for those tax-cut extensions \nresponsibly by closing corporate loopholes.\n  So Senate Republicans have again opposed this, as they have in the \npast, and the question is, Are they going to stand with middle-class \nfamilies and innovative businesses such as Propel Fuels to cut their \ntaxes; or are they going to continue to stand with large corporations \nto protect their unfair tax loopholes?\n  Mr. President, I hope Senate Republicans have a moment to pause and \nthink about the impact they are having on jobs and families--middle-\nclass families and businesses that are trying to create new jobs and \nexpand for the future. I hope they remind themselves before we head \nhome this is good politics. It is good politics to help our families \nand our small businesses. It is good politics to help our clean energy \ncompanies.\n  Right now, when our economy is trying to recover, we should not go \nhome without extending these tax cuts, and I am going to keep working \nto stand up for our middle-class families and our\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\nMain Street businesses and keep working to try and pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we have had a lot of conversation about \nthe DISCLOSE Act. I am a member, indeed the ranking member, of the \nRules Committee where the DISCLOSE Act, if it had been referred to \ncommittee, would have come for consideration. Unfortunately, the \nDISCLOSE Act was not referred to committee. We in the committee have \nhad no opportunity to amend it, no opportunity to hold hearings on it, \nno opportunity to hear from witnesses who may have differing opinions \nfrom the version that passed the House. It has been brought to the \nfloor in such a manner that the committee has simply been bypassed.\n  For that reason, therefore, any objections we might have with respect \nto the way the bill is currently worded have to be raised on the floor. \nAny concerns we have as to the inequities in the bill have to be raised \non the floor. It has made the whole thing more contentious than it \nneeds to be.\n  The DISCLOSE Act, by name, suggests that all it is is disclosure. It \ndoesn't address any other issue than how people who are going to \nexercise their rights under the first amendment do so, the specifics of \nhow they do that, and the specifics of who is behind the advertising \nthat takes place in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court. \nI pointed out in the past and repeat as a reference that prior to the \nSupreme Court's decision, it was possible for Michael Moore to produce \na movie that would attack George W. Bush and be completely acceptable, \ncompletely legal. But it was not possible for the people who formed \nCitizens United to produce a movie that attacks Hillary Clinton and \nhave that be legal. The difference was Michael Moore was acting as an \nindividual. These people were acting collectively. Because they chose \nthe corporate form of organization for their collective action, the \nprevious law said: You cannot do this.\n  The Supreme Court ruled--I think accurately--that if Michael Moore \nhas a right to make a movie, so does Citizens United. If Michael Moore \nhas a right to attack George W. Bush, Citizens United has the right to \nattack Hillary Clinton. I frankly think Michael Moore's movie probably \nhad more to do with moving votes than the Citizens United movie did.\n  But be that as it may, neither one of them seems to have had that \nmuch impact on the body politic.\n  But that is not the point. The point is, the Supreme Court ruled \nfreedom of speech means freedom of speech, and if it is OK for one \nmovie to be made under one set of circumstances, it is equally OK for \nanother movie to be made under a slightly different set of \ncircumstances.\n  There are those who say: No, no, no; this opens up the world for \ncorporations to fund advertisements to distort and destroy and affect \nour elections.\n  I have several reactions to that; the first one being, I have seen \npolitical ads that have been funded by rich individuals through the \nmechanism of a 527. If I were on the other side of the issue--and, \nindeed, in many cases I was--I would like to keep those ads running \nbecause the individuals who put up the money for the ads did not know \nhow to write an effective ad. They were exercising their freedom of \nspeech, but they were doing it in an amateurish kind of way, and under \ncurrent law--and the Supreme Court decision did not change this--they \ncould not give the money to the political parties that know what they \nare doing. They had to express themselves on their own, and many of \nthem did not know how to do that very well.\n  So all of this excitement about the airwaves are going to be flooded \nwith tremendously persuasive advertisements from national corporations \nthat are going to distort our political process is making some \nassumptions about the voters that I think are not true. They are making \nassumptions about the ability of a corporation to enter this field and \ndo something very dramatic that I think is not true.\n  But missing from this discourse about how terrible it is going to be \nif corporations start doing this--and we are not seeing any signs of \nhow terrible this is happening in the real world--is any mention of \nanother group that received exactly the same kind of green light from \nthe Supreme Court as corporations did, another group that is barred by \nthe same law that says corporations cannot contribute directly to a \npolitical party that will benefit enormously, and a group that has \ndemonstrated it has the capacity to create a political advertisement \nthat is effective.\n  I am talking about unions. Unions have the same kind of freedom that \ncorporations have under this decision from the Supreme Court. Unions \ncan now spend money speaking freely about candidates and using their \nnames in ways that presumably they could not have done before.\n  Are we going to assume that the Supreme Court decision is going to \nunleash a flood of millions and millions of dollars of corporate money, \nbut that the unions are going to sit quietly on the sidelines with \ntheir hands folded across their chests doing nothing?\n  If, indeed, there is going to be an avalanche of political spending \ncoming as a result of this decision, I guarantee it is going to come \nfrom the unions every bit as much as it is going to come from the \ncorporations. Indeed, it is my expectation it will come far more from \nthe unions than it will come from the corporations.\n  Think about the big corporations in America. How do most of them make \ntheir money? They make their money by selling products to the American \npeople, and they are good at advertisements to sell products. If I were \non the board of one of these major corporations, and someone came to me \nand said: All right, we want to spend corporate money to put together \nan ad or put together a movie or put together any kind of political \nspeech and put our corporate name on it, I would say: Now, wait a \nminute. Are you sure you want to run the risk of offending the \ncustomers of our product who may not agree with our political position? \nLet's be a little careful about this.\n  I think there are going to be some very circumspect conversations in \nthe boardrooms of America's largest corporations before they come \nrushing in to the political arena in the fashion our friends across the \naisle are predicting.\n  On the other hand, do the unions care? Do the unions feel it will \ndamage their public image if they are seen advertising with tremendous \nexpenditures under the decision the Supreme Court handed down? No. They \ndo not worry about selling products to the American people. They exist \nin many instances primarily because of favors they received from the \ngovernment. For those who talk about the DISCLOSE Act, saying this will \nopen the floodgates for corporations and never mentioning unions is to \ndemonstrate they are ignoring what the situation really is.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would be honored.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I recall correctly, this is not the first election \nunder which independent groups have been extraordinarily active in \nadvertising in political campaigns. In fact, I recall quite precisely \nthat independent groups aligned with the other side of the aisle, \naccording to those who keep the statistics on this, spent twice as much \nin 2006 and a similar amount in 2008 as outside groups that might be \ntypically aligned with Senators such as Bennett and McConnell. Where \nwas the outrage a couple cycles ago?\n  I would ask my friend, did Citizens United in any serious way change \nthe landscape, in any event?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the leader for his question, and the leader's \nrecollection is entirely correct. I remember when we passed the \nCampaign Finance Act we were told this will get big money out of \npolitics. I remember the first elections fought after the passage of \nthat bill saw the greatest amount of spending we have ever seen in \nAmerican history, and the amount of spending has only gone up.\n  All we did--and I am quoting from the minority leader's own comments \nat the time in the debate--all we did was\n\n[[Page S7386]]\n\nredirect how the money was going to go. In my view, all the Supreme \nCourt did in their decision was to be fair in saying if a group gets \ntogether and organizes themselves, as Citizens United, they have \nexactly the same right to speak as Michael Moore had. If he makes a \nmovie, they could make a movie. The Supreme Court said both movies are \nlegitimate. I do not think we are going to see any kind of the \nconsequences of the sort we have heard.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the leader is on the Senate floor, and I \nwill yield the floor so he might continue whatever it is he has to say \non this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before the leader speaks, may I pose a \nquestion? What is the status of time in terms of the minority and the \nmajority on this issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority is out of time, and the minority \nhas retained just under 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the \nleader be allowed to speak for as long as he chooses and that I be \ngiven 5 minutes after that to conclude for the majority, and the vote \nbe delayed until after that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, I do not need the Senator \nfrom New York to intervene. I am happy to use my leader time, which may \nbe the solution to the time problem.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That would be fine with me, if that works. Does that \nstill----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed under my leader \ntime, and then Senator Schumer can ask his consent if it is necessary. \nHe may have enough time to close.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the past 2 days, Democratic leaders \nhave demonstrated once again their total lack of interest in the \npriorities of the American people.\n  At a time of near double-digit unemployment and skyrocketing debt, \nAmericans would like to see us focus on jobs and the economy. Yet for \nthe past 2 days, Senate Democrats have forced us to return once again \nto a debate we have already had on a bill the Senate has already \nrejected--a bill that focuses not on creating jobs for the \nAmerican people but with saving the jobs of Democratic politicians in \nWashington.\n\n  That is what this debate is about. Our friends on the other side \nwould have the public believe this bill is about transparency. It is \nnot. Here is a bill that was drafted behind closed doors, without \nhearings, without testimony, and without any markups--a bill that picks \nand chooses who gets the right to engage in the political process and \nwho does not; a bill that seeks, in other words, to achieve an unlevel \nplaying field; a bill that is back on the floor for no other reason \nthan the fact that our friends on the other side have declared this \nweek ``politics only'' week in the Senate.\n  The only thing transparent here is the effort this exercise \nrepresents to secure an electoral advantage for the Democrats. So this \nis a completely distasteful exercise.\n  At a time when Americans are clamoring for us to do something about \nthe economy, Democrats are not only turning a deaf ear, they are \nspending 2 full days working to silence the voices of even more people \nwith a bill that picks and chooses who has a full right to political \nspeech.\n  Let's face it, what our friends on the other side want is what they \nhave always seemed to want: more government control. They want the \ngovernment to pick and choose who gets to speak in elections, and how \nmuch they speak. That is why they are also pressing at the same time \nfor taxpayer-funded elections--something the assistant majority leader \ncalled for once again just yesterday.\n  So Democrats have spent the past year and a half taking over banks, \ncar companies, insurance companies, the student loan business--you name \nit--and now they want the taxpayers to foot the bill for their campaign \nads as well.\n  Earlier today, the House Committee on House Administration marked up \na bill that would stick taxpayers with a bill for House elections \nnationwide. Think of that: taxpayer money for attack ads, for buttons, \nfor balloons and bumper stickers.\n  Have they no shame? Have they no shame? Our cumulative debt now the \nsize of our economy, and they want to spend tax dollars on political \ncampaigns.\n  I mean, even if they do not agree with the principled arguments \nagainst this kind of an effort, I would submit that in a time of \nexploding deficits and record debt the last thing the American people \nwant right now is to provide what amounts to welfare for politicians.\n  Think about it. One recent estimate puts the annual cost to taxpayers \nof funding every Federal election at about $1.8 billion each year. That \nis $1.8 billion more that taxpayers would have to shell out than they \nalready are. For what? For what? For politicians to throw campaign \nevents and run ads that taxpayers may not even agree with or which they \nfind downright outrageous.\n  One of the groups that supports this scheme calls it ``an incredibly \ngood deal for taxpayers.'' Well, I strongly suspect that most taxpayers \nwould not share that view. Americans want us to stop the wasteful \nspending. Another $1.8 billion on balloons and bunting is not their \nidea of a step in the right direction.\n  So why are Democrats doing this? Why are they proposing taxpayer \nfinancing of political campaigns and the DISCLOSE Act right now, at a \ntime when Americans want them to focus on jobs and the economy?\n  I think it is pretty obvious. This is pure politics--pure.\n  After spending the past year and a half enacting policies Americans \ndo not like, Democrats want to prevent their opponents from being able \nto criticize what they have done. After spending a year and a half \nenacting policies the American people do not like, they want to silence \nthe voices of critics of what they have done. They want to prevent \ntheir critics from speaking out.\n  So here we are, 2 days debating this partisan, political, dead end \nbill that does not do one thing to help the economy, reduce the \ndeficit, or create a single job.\n  Americans deserve a lot better. Americans are speaking out. But \nfocusing on this bill shows that Democrats in Washington still are not \nlistening. So, once again, I will be voting no on this legislation, and \nI encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate once again has an opportunity to \ndefend the public's confidence in our democratic system. In July, we \nmissed this opportunity by failing to approve a motion to proceed to \nthe DISCLOSE Act, a vital step in preserving the transparency and \nintegrity of our elections. I urge my colleagues not to repeat that \nmistake. We should take up, debate, and pass the DISCLOSE Act.\n  Nearly a year ago, the Supreme Court discarded decades of precedent \nand concern for the health of our democracy when it decided on a 5-4 \nvote to eliminate regulations on corporate expenditures on elections. I \nstrongly disagreed with that decision, but it is now the law of the \nland, and we are left with the task of trying to preserve the ability \nof individual Americans to be heard in a political process that could \nbe swamped by a flood of corporate money.\n  The DISCLOSE Act requires corporations, unions, or advocacy \norganizations to stand by their advertisements and inform their members \nabout their election-related spending. It imposes transparency \nrequirements, requires spending amounts to be posted online, and \nprevents government contractors, corporations controlled by foreigners, \nand corporate beneficiaries of TARP funds from spending money on \nelections. I am an original cosponsor of the act because I believe it \nis essential to protect public confidence in the integrity of our \nelections.\n  By establishing these requirements, we will not prevent corporations \nfrom engaging in the activities the Supreme Court has allowed. We are \nsimply giving Americans the ability to see how these companies, unions \nand other groups are seeking to influence the political process. This \nshould not be an issue of Republicans and Democrats.\n\n[[Page S7387]]\n\nWe should all agree that our democracy is best served when its election \ncampaigns are conducted transparently.\n  The American people are depending on us to defend the integrity of \nthe political process. We should not fail to uphold that \nresponsibility. I urge my colleagues to debate and adopt adopt this \nvital legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly support the DISCLOSE Act and \nI believe the Senate should be allowed to consider it. I am pleased to \nsee this bill get such strong support from my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side, and I urge my Republican colleagues to think long and \nhard before again blocking it even from coming to the floor. I have a \nlong history of bipartisan work on campaign finance issues. I am not \ninterested in campaign finance legislation that has a partisan effect. \nThis bill is fair and evenhanded. It deserves the support of Senators \nfrom both parties.\n  As the name suggests, the central goal of this bill is disclosure. It \naims to make sure that when faced with a barrage of election-related \nadvertising funded by corporations, which the Supreme Court's decision \nin the Citizens United case has made possible, the American people have \nthe information they need to understand who is really behind those ads. \nThat information is essential to being able to thoughtfully exercise \nthe most important right in a democracy--the right to vote.\n  It is no secret that the Senator Schumer and I, and all of the \noriginal cosponsors of the bill, were deeply disappointed by the \nCitizens United decision. We don't agree with the Court's theory that \nthe first amendment rights of corporations, which can't vote or hold \nelected office, are equivalent to those of citizens. And we believe \nthat the decision will harm our democracy. I, for one, very much hope \nthat the Supreme Court will one day realize the mistake it made and \noverturn it.\n  But the Supreme Court made the decision and we in the Senate, along \nwith the country, have to live with it. The intent of the DISCLOSE Act \nis not to try to overturn that decision or challenge it. It is to \naddress the consequences of the decision within the confines of the \nCourt's holdings. Congress has a responsibility to survey the wreckage \nleft or threatened by the Supreme Court's ruling and do whatever it can \nconstitutionally to repair that damage or try to prevent it.\n  In Citizens United, the Court ruled that corporations could not \nconstitutionally be prohibited from engaging in campaign related \nspeech. But, with only one dissenting Justice, the Court also \nspecifically upheld applying disclosure requirements to corporations. \nThe Court stated:\n\n       \"[P]rompt disclosure of expenditures can provide \n     shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold \n     corporations and elected officials accountable for their \n     positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether \n     their corporation's political speech advances the \n     corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can \n     see whether elected officials are ``in the pocket'' of so-\n     called moneyed interests.\n\n  The Court also explained that disclosure is very much consistent with \nfree speech:\n\n       The First Amendment protects political speech; and \n     disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the \n     speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This \n     transparency enables the electorate to make informed \n     decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and \n     messages.\n\n  The Court also made clear that corporate advertisers can be required \nto include disclaimers to identify themselves in their ads. It \nspecifically reaffirmed the part of the McConnell v. FEC decision that \nheld that such requirements are constitutional.\n  The DISCLOSE Act simply builds on disclosure and disclaimer \nrequirements that are already in the law and that the Court has said do \nnot violate the first amendment. For years, opponents of campaign \nfinance reform have argued that all that is needed is disclosure. Well, \nin a very short time we will find out whether they were serious, \nbecause that is what this bill is all about.\n  If the Senate is allowed to proceed to the bill, there will be time \nto discuss its provisions in more detail, and perhaps to amend them. \nOne amendment that obviously will need to be made is to the effective \ndate. Any bill that passes at this point is not going to apply to the \nupcoming election, and we should amend the bill to make it applicable \nonly to elections beginning in 2012. But I do want to comment on one \nprovision that has caused controversy, which was added in the House--\nthe exception for large, longstanding groups, including the National \nRifle Association.\n  I am not a fan of exceptions to legislation of this kind. I would \nprefer a bill, like the one we introduced, that does not contain this \nexception. But the fact is that the kinds of groups that are covered by \nthe exception are not the kinds of groups that this bill is mostly \naimed at. Knowing the identity of individual large donors to the NRA \nwhen it runs its ads is not providing much useful information to the \npublic. Everyone knows who the NRA is and what it stands for. You may \nlike or dislike this group's message, but you don't need to know who \nits donors are to evaluate that message.\n  The same cannot be said about new organizations that are forming as \nwe speak to collect corporate donations and run attack ads against \ncandidates. One example is a new group called American Crossroads. It \nhas apparently pledged to raise $50 million to run ads in the upcoming \nelection. Can any of my colleagues tell me what this group is and what \nit stands for? Don't the American people have a right to know that, and \nwouldn't the identity of the funders provide useful information about \nthe group's agenda and what it hopes to accomplish by pumping so much \nmoney into elections? Even Citizens United, the group that brought the \ncase that has led us to this point, is not known to most people. Why \nshouldn't the American people know who has bankrolled that group, if it \nis going to run ads and try to convince people to vote a certain way?\n  Disclosure is the way we make this crucial information available to \nthe public. But if a group is around for 10 years, has members in all \n50 States, and receives only a small portion of its budget from \ncorporations or unions, there is less reason for the kind of detailed \ninformation that the DISCLOSE Act requires. So while I would prefer \nthat this exception wasn't in the bill, I understand why the House felt \nit was necessary, and I don't think it undermines the bill's purpose or \nmakes it fundamentally unfair.\n  Most of the complaints about the DISCLOSE Act are coming from \ninterests that want to take advantage of one part of the Citizens \nUnited decision--the part that allows corporate spending on elections \nfor the first time in over 100 years--and at the same time pretend that \nthe other part of the decision--the part upholding disclosure \nrequirements--doesn't exist. But the law doesn't work that way. As the \nold saying goes, ``you can't have your cake and eat it too.''\n  Once again, I very much appreciate the leadership of the Senator from \nNew York and look forward to working with him and all my colleagues to \npass this bill. I urge my colleagues to support the motion for \nreconsideration and vote for cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first I would simply note that the bill \nbefore us has nothing to do with public financing of campaigns; it \nsimply has to do with disclosure.\n  I rise today in support of DISCLOSE, the Democracy Is Strengthened by \nCasting Light on Spending in Elections Act, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  This bill is in direct response to Citizens United v. FEC in which \nthe Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Roberts and its activist \nmajority, overruled almost a century of law and precedent and held that \ncorporations have the same first amendment rights as people. As I have \nsaid before, because of this decision, the winner of every upcoming \nelection won't be Democrats or Republicans; it will be special \ninterests. And it will come at the expense of the voice of the ordinary \nAmerican. The Court's decision lifted well-established restrictions on \ncorporate and union spending in elections. This created a loophole in \nwhich these entities can now create anonymous groups to serve as a \nconduit to anonymously funnel money. The intent is to deceive the \npublic and hide the real motives of those spending on these ads.\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\n  We have worked within the contours of the Court's decision in order \nto draft the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I ask those who support sunlight in campaign spending to work with us \nto pass this bill.\n  You think we are using this bill as a political tool to influence \nelections? OK. We will change the effective date to January 2011 so it \nwon't apply to this November's election. We will welcome this change \nand encourage Republican amendments and debate on this bill because it \nis essential to the health of our democracy. We are also willing to \nconsider paring the bill down, per the suggestion of my colleague, \nSenator Snowe, in her statement, and limiting it to the core provisions \nregarding enhanced disclosures and disclaimers.\n  Both disclosure and disclaimer were proclaimed to be constitutional \nand effective ways to regulate corporate and union spending by eight of \nthe nine Justices in Citizens United and were upheld in a later \ndecision, Doe v. Reed. The Court specifically stated that disclosure \nrequirements ``do not prevent anyone from speaking''--do not prevent \nanyone from speaking--and found that there was strong governmental \ninterest in ``providing the electorate with information about the \nsources of election-related funding.'' The Court also concluded that \n``disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech \nof corporate entities in a proper way'' and to ``give proper weight to \ndifferent speakers and messages.'' To be clear, disclosure does not \nchill speech. We do not want to chill speech. We merely want the \nAmerican public to have details about who is speaking. These disclosure \nand disclaimer provisions allow the American public to know exactly who \nis bankrolling campaign advertisements. The American public deserves \nnothing less.\n  I would note that a strong majority of the American public--\nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents--disapproved of the Supreme \nCourt's opinion in Citizens United and support disclosure and \ndisclaimer provisions.\n  In removing the restrictions on corporate and union campaign \nspending, the Citizens United decision has opened a door for the \ncreation of shadow groups whose spending is not clearly regulated. \nNeither the IRS, which has jurisdiction for nonprofits, nor the FEC \nprovides oversight for these groups. That is a scary thought. In fact, \none such group, American Crossroads, the leader in campaign spending in \nthe Senate, was created by Karl Rove, who pledged to spend $50 million \non just the 2010 election cycle. In fact, since our last vote on this \nissue, it has been reported that these shadow groups have raised $20 \nmillion.\n  A former Republican FEC Commissioner, Michael Toner, stated on the \nfront page of the New York Times this week that, from his personal \nexperience, ``the money is flowing.'' It is clear to us that the money \nis flowing; we just aren't permitted to know from whom it is coming. It \nis clear that this money isn't coming from the average voter. These \ngroups are created, funded with secret donations, and then they \ndisappear just as quickly as they appeared, all with no real \ndisclosure. They are not created to be a voice of the people. It has \nbeen reported that the vast majority of American Crossroads funding is \nfrom four billionaires. Why are we letting the voice of these four \npeople drown out the rest of America? This is outrageous.\n  In conclusion, the American people deserve to know what each and \nevery one of us in this Chamber truly believes. Are we for openness, \ntransparency, and giving the voters information they need to make their \nchoices in the voting booth or do we really believe, despite our \nrhetoric, that it is OK for special interests to spend freely on all \nkinds of political advertising but keep the voters in the dark about \nwho is paying for it?\n  The Supreme Court's decision this year has made it imperative for us \nto act now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest that will extend FAA authority until December 31 of this year. \nThis is another extension. We have had extension after extension of the \nFAA Reauthorization Act, which expires, so we extend it.\n  Let me in 1 minute say we have worked on a bill that would \nreauthorize the FAA. It has many component parts dealing with safety \nand other issues. It deals with the modernization of our entire air \ntraffic control system. The Europeans are going full steam, and we need \nto work on this for a wide range of reasons: safety in the skies, \nbetter environment, more direct flying routes, less time in the air, \nand a whole series of things. Yet this piece of legislation that \nrepresents the investment in airport infrastructure, modernization of \nour air traffic control system, and so many other things is continuing \nto be blocked, and it is a profound disappointment to me.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and others \nhave worked to write this legislation. It is bipartisan. It passed \nthrough the Commerce Committee, passed through\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\nthe full Senate, and now we are trying to negotiate an agreement with \nthe House. Someone said to me as I came in today, I understand FAA \nreauthorization is dead for this session. I said: That is not the case. \nSenator Rockefeller and I remain hopeful that between now and the end \nof the year we will be able to solve those remaining few points and get \nthis done. It is critically important--very important--that we get this \ndone.\n  So I make this unanimous consent request with the understanding that \nI am continuing to work on it, as is Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nHutchison and many others to try to get the FAA reauthorization bill \ndone through the House and the Senate and get it resolved.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 324, H.R. 4853.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4853) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to extend the funding expenditure authority of the \n     Airport and Airway Trust Fund, to amend title 49, United \n     States Code, to extend authorizations for the airport \n     improvement program, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I also want to add my support for the FAA\n\n[[Page S7390]]\n\nreauthorization bill which the Senator from North Dakota talked about. \nIt is important that we get this done. We have been operating without \nan authorization since 2007. We had a bill pass through the Senate by a \nvote of 93 to 0 back in March, and this is something that needs to be \ndone.\n  So I hope we can get floor time scheduled for this and that we can \nget on that bill, get a conference report, and get it through and \nenacted because there are a number of important improvements that need \nto occur, and that legislation provides for that to happen. It has been \nkicking around here for way too long, so I hope we can get to that bill \nand quit having to do these month-to-month or--in this case, as it ends \nup being--the end-of-the-year extensions, which keeps us from doing \nwhat we need to do, and that is get a long-term reauthorization in \nplace that provides some certainty and predictability for the users of \naviation in this country.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I ask, through the Chair, that the \nSenator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wanted to ask him--because we have to ask questions \naround here--isn't it a good idea for us to have more permanence and \nnot pass so many short-term extensions in Congress, just as a general \nprinciple?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say to the Senator, through the Chair, one of the \nthings I think is hurting business and economic development in this \ncountry is a lack of certainty.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Is the Senator aware, if my calculation is correct, that \nthere are about 130 extenders that we have to extend at the end of \nevery calendar year--approximately 130? Did the Senator know the number \nis that great?\n  Mr. THUNE. I didn't know the precise number, Mr. President. I will \nsay to my colleague from Montana if it is not, in fact, 130--and I will \ntake his word for that--I know it is a lot. There are lots of \nprovisions in law that need to be extended and lots of communities in \nthis country that depend on that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. One final question: Does the Senator agree it is about \ntime this Congress does something about that; that we pass fewer \nextenders and more laws that are a little more permanent?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say, through the Chair, to my colleague, I think \nit is important that this Senate act in a way that provides some \ncertainty and predictability for people in this country who depend upon \npublic policy coming out of here that has some permanence to it. Right \nnow, we continue to act on short-term extensions in so many different \nareas. So I don't dispute at all the statement of the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my good friend from South Dakota for mentioning \nthat.\n  Mr. THUNE. If I might continue, Mr. President, let me just say with \nregard to the observations of the Senator from Montana that I couldn't \nagree more that we need to get these things done, and we need to \nprovide some long-term certainty for those in this country who rely \nupon decisions that come out of the Congress. I know the Senator from \nMontana has offered an extenders bill that would provide at least some \nnear-term relief for many of these provisions of law that expire and \nthat impact so many across this country.\n  I would say through the Chair to my colleague from Montana that I \nagree with his premise. I think it comes down to how we go about doing \nthat. The Senator from Montana has offered up a proposal that would \nextend many of these expiring tax provisions, but he does it in a way \nthat raises taxes. I have a proposal I offered earlier in response to \nthe majority leader's unanimous consent request to move a tax extenders \nbill that would substitute my bill for that one because my bill does \nall the same things the Senator from Montana wants to accomplish. But \nit does it with spending reductions--reducing spending--as opposed to \nraising taxes.\n  There are a number of things my bill would do, one of which is to \nextend the $215 million tax break for teachers to purchase books, \nsupplies, computer equipment, and other materials for the classroom.\n  It also includes the biodiesel tax credit, which supports our \nNation's budding biodiesel industry. It provides $854 million in tax \nrelief for these biodiesel manufacturers to invest in our clean energy \nfuture.\n  The bill reinstates the State and local sales tax deduction, which \nprovides $1.8 billion in tax relief to residents of States such as \nSouth Dakota who pay State and local sales taxes but are not allowed to \ndeduct these taxes from their Federal income taxes. It also allows for \nthe deduction of State and local property taxes, which saves taxpayers \n$1.5 billion as well.\n  My bill reinstates the research and development tax credit, which the \nPresident has supported for 2010. This important tax credit \nincentivizes important research and development across the country.\n  It also provides a number of needed tax credits for businesses to \ninvest and create jobs, including refundable AMT credits for \ncorporations, and it provides a generous doc fix. One of the things we \ntalk about around here is the doc fix. On the doc fix, we continue to \ngo month to month or quarter to quarter. Now we are good to the end of \nNovember. But at the end of November we are going to be dealing with \nthis issue again. If we do not, physicians across the country are going \nto experience a significant and dramatic pay reduction, which will \nimpair their ability to serve patients across this country who depend \nupon Medicare.\n  My doc fix provides a 2-percent increase for 2011 and another 2-\npercent increase for 2012. The current doc fix, as I said, is set to \nexpire later this year, on November 30.\n  The way I do this is I fully offset this by spending cuts, including \nmedical malpractice reform, a freeze on Federal salaries, reductions in \nwasteful, duplicative, and excessive government spending, rescinding \nunspent Federal funds including the stimulus, an expansion of the \naffordability exception to the individual mandate that was included in \nthe recently passed health care reform bill and by disposing of unused \nand unneeded Federal property.\n  I also add in my proposal a new deficit reduction trust fund, where \nrescinded balances and money saved through this amendment will be \ndeposited for the purposes of paying down the Federal debt. It does not \ninclude job-killing tax hikes on carried interest income, which would \ndiscourage investment and hurt our Nation's productivity, and does not \ninclude a 70-cent-per-barrel increase, a tax hike on oil, nor does it \ndouble count the revenues from that tax by saying it both offsets the \ncost to the bill and also adds money to the Oil Spill Liability Trust \nFund.\n  I concur entirely with the premise the Senator from Montana was \naddressing, that we need to get these things extended. We need to \nprovide some permanence. But there is a difference in the approach on \nhow we deal with that. The Senator from Montana proposed one way, I \nproposed another. I obviously would love to get a vote on this proposal \nbecause I think what we ought to be focused on right now, rather than \nraising taxes at a time when we have a very fragile economy in an \neconomic downturn and making it more difficult for businesses to create \njobs, that we ought to be looking at what we can do to reduce spending \nin our Federal budget and offset the cost of these extenders and pay \nfor this 2-year extension of the doc fix, which also provides for a \nmodest increase, not the significant reduction they are going to \nexperience otherwise. We do this through spending reductions in the \nFederal budget. I hope we get an opportunity to vote on this.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my good friend \nfrom South Dakota. I hope we can find some reasonable accommodation, \nsome compromise. There are 100 Senators here. Each has his or her own \nview as to what the right solution should be. Without sounding too \ntrite and corny, we are a democracy, we have to live together. I hope \nwe could find a way to get these provisions extended in a way with give \nand take, back and forth. Clearly, if I bring up a bill and it is my \nway, it is not going to pass. With all due respect to my friend from \nSouth Dakota, if he brings up his bill his way, it is not going to \npass. The only way to get something to help the people whom we are here \nto represent is to find a\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\ncompromise, working together in accommodation. I know the Senator looks \nforward to that. I hope we can achieve that result.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I say in \nresponse to that, that is absolutely true. Around here I think, \ntraditionally, tax extenders have been something both sides have worked \non. Generally, it tends to be kind of noncontroversial. I think our \nside is very open to discussions and would welcome an opportunity to \nsit down with the majority and the Senator from Montana and others, \nwhoever they feel necessary, to work something out. We stand ready and \nwilling to have that discussion and hopefully to get this thing put \nbehind us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would add a final point to these remarks; that is, the \napproach I take. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I try not to \nbring up these extenders bills until they have been worked out. With \nsufficient work on both sides, I believe that leaves at least 60 votes \navailable, and I hope we can achieve a result quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7391-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today marks 6 months since Congress \nenacted the new health care reform law.\n  Americans have reason to celebrate.\n  The new law put America on the road to a more sustainable consumer-\nfriendly health care system.\n  The new law put America on the road to a healthcare system in which \nall Americans have access to quality, affordable health insurance.\n  And the new law put America on the road to a health care system in \nwhich patients and their doctors--not insurance companies--control \npatient care.\n  These transformative changes will not happen overnight. But we heard \nthe distressed cries from American families and businesses for \nimmediate relief from insurer abuses. Congress included in the new \nhealth reform law many consumer protection provisions that take effect \ntoday, September 23, 2010.\n  These provisions--a new Patient's Bill of Rights--put an end to some \nof the worst insurance company abuses. The new law puts consumers in \ncontrol of their health care decisions. And the new law extends \nimportant new coverage benefits under insurance plans.\n  Starting today plans cannot discriminate against children with \npreexisting conditions. No longer will insurance companies be able to \ndeny tens of thousands of families insurance each year for their \nchildren because of a preexisting condition.\n  Starting today insurance companies are banned from canceling your \ncoverage due to an unintentional mistake on your application. No longer \nwill insurance companies be allowed to arbitrarily drop your coverage \nwhen you get sick and need it the most.\n  Starting today insurance companies can no longer place lifetime or \nrestrictive annual limits on coverage. No longer will families need to \nworry that their coverage will run out when they need it the most.\n  Starting today when you purchase or join a new insurance plan, you \nhave the right to choose your own doctor in your network. No longer \nwill insurance companies be able to arbitrarily decide which doctor you \nhave to see.\n  Starting today, if you purchase or join a new insurance policy, you \nwill be guaranteed the right to appeal insurance company decisions to \nan independent third party. No longer will consumers find themselves \nwith nowhere to turn when insurers deny them coverage or restrict their \ntreatment.\n  Starting today, providers and suppliers--that is doctors and medical \nequipment manufacturers--who fail a fraud screening will be denied \neligibility for payments under government programs like Medicare and \nMedicaid. No longer will providers and suppliers be able to defraud the \ngovernment and taxpayers instead of provide quality health care.\n  There is more. Starting today, young adults will be allowed to remain \non their parents' plan until their 26th birthday, unless they are \noffered coverage at work. No longer will young adults be without \naffordable coverage options. Now they will have choices to transition \nthem into their adult lives and protect them from financial ruin.\n  And starting today, if you purchase or join a new insurance plan, you \nwill be able to receive free recommended preventive care. No longer \nwill Americans have to forgo valuable preventive care until it is too \nlate.\n  All of the benefits that begin today are in addition to the benefits \nthat families and businesses already enjoy as a result of the new \nhealth reform law.\n  Already because of the new law, across the Nation, federally \nsubsidized preexisting condition insurance plans are available for \nAmericans with preexisting conditions who have been denied coverage by \ninsurance companies.\n  Already because of the new law up to 4,000 small businesses are \neligible for tax credits this year if they provide health insurance for \ntheir employees.\n  Already because of the new law, more than 2,000 businesses have \nqualified to receive reimbursement for the retiree coverage that they \nprovide.\n  And already because of the new law, more than a million seniors have \nreceived rebate checks to reduce their prescription drug out-of-pocket \ncosts in the donut hole.\n  Today, with this 6-month mark, we pass a key milestone on our road to \nproviding quality, affordable health care to all Americans.\n  This milestone is just one of many along the road. But this milestone \nis one that signals an end to the insurance companies' worst abuses. \nThis milestone signals the beginning to patient-controlled health care, \nand that is something to celebrate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss an \nissue that is vitally important to North Carolina's economy, and to the \nheritage and cultural identity of more than 40,000 Americans. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the Lumbee Recognition Act.\n  The Lumbee Indians are among the earliest North Carolinians. They \ndescended from the coastal tribes of North Carolina and lived along the \nLumber River before our Nation was founded.\n  During that time, the Lumbee have maintained a distinct community in \nwhat is now Robeson County, NC, with more than 40,000 current members \nin and around the county seat of Lumberton.\n  Tribe members have worked diligently throughout the generations to \nsustain a strong tribal society.\n  Each and every Lumbee can trace his or her ancestry to the tribe's \nbase roll, which is comprised of school and church records and early \n20th-century census data. This common ancestry has bound the tribe for \ngenerations and established the Lumbee as a longstanding, distinct \ncommunity in southeastern North Carolina.\n  Nearly two-thirds of the tribe live within 15 miles of the city of \nPembroke, where they start families and businesses, run for tribal \noffice, and attend the annual Fourth of July parade.\n  The Lumbee fought alongside the American Colonists during the \nRevolutionary War, and helped shape North Carolina's history.\n  But because the tribe lacked a formal treaty relationship with the \nnew United States, the tribe has worked for over 120 years to win the \nrecognition that they so clearly deserve.\n  As has been noted by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, ``The \nLumbees have a longstanding history of functioning like an Indian tribe \nand being recognized as such by State and local authorities. Since \n1885, the Lumbees have maintained an active political relationship with \nthe State of North Carolina.''\n  The State officially recognized the tribe in 1885, and established a \nseparate school system for Lumbee children.\n  With initial enrollment limited to children who could demonstrate at \nleast four generations of Lumbee descent, this autonomous school system \nhas remained in place for over 100 years.\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\n  And in the late 1800s, the State of North Carolina established the \nIndian Normal School to train Lumbee teachers for the tribe's school \nsystem. This school has been in continuous operation since that time \nand has grown into the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.\n  The university is obviously now open to enrollment for all Americans, \nbut continues to serve as an anchor of the Lumbee community.\n  Despite generations of uninterrupted self-governing, the Lumbee still \nhave not received full recognition by the Federal Government.\n  Instead, Congress in 1956 enacted the Lumbee Act, which \nsimultaneously recognized the tribe, but denied tribal members access \nto Federal services.\n  The Lumbee Recognition Act, which I have introduced with my colleague \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Burr, would rectify this longstanding \ninequity, and provide the Lumbee with the full recognition that they so \nclearly deserve.\n  Beyond simple fairness, the issue of Lumbee recognition is critically \nimportant to the North Carolina economy, and to counties and \ncommunities that have been hardest hit by the recent economic downturn.\n  Because the 1956 Lumbee Act forbade the Lumbee from pursuing the \nFederal resources available to every other recognized tribe in the \ncountry, the tribe does not have access to critical services through \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service.\n  The Harvard School of Public Health has found that residents of \nRobeson County have a lower average life expectancy due to persistent \npoverty and limited access to affordable health care. Our bill will \nenable the Lumbee to combat these trends through sustained economic \ndevelopment and quality health services.\n  It will allow members of the Lumbee tribe to access critical programs \nthrough Indian Health Services, and will help treat and prevent chronic \nillnesses that negatively affect the quality of life in the region.\n  With a healthier population, and access to Federal programs, the \ntribe can focus on economic development. Robeson County has an \nunemployment rate above 12 percent, and the surrounding counties of \nScotland, Hoke, Cumberland, Bladen, and Columbia continue to experience \nunemployment rates that are among the highest in North Carolina.\n  Economic development programs through the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nwill allow the tribe to create jobs where they are needed most, and \nwill support a true economic recovery in this distressed region.\n  The Lumbee Recognition Act was introduced in the House by my North \nCarolina colleague, Congressman Mike McIntyre, who has been a tireless \nchampion for the Lumbee since coming to Congress.\n  Due largely to Congressman McIntyre's efforts, the House has passed \nthe Lumbee Recognition Act with a strong bipartisan majority twice in \nthe last 3 years.\n  Here in the Senate, the bill has been approved by the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, and now awaits consideration on the Senate floor.\n  Some have also argued that the cost of providing BIA and Indian \nHealth services to the Lumbee will be too high, and that Lumbee \nrecognition will draw down funds that are currently going to other \ntribes. I certainly understand these concerns.\n  But, I want to be clear, the Lumbee do not want recognition on the \nbacks of other tribes, and this bill will not increase the Federal \ndeficit. This bill simply ensures that the Lumbee are eligible for the \nsame services as their peers. Funding for these services will be \nsubject to future appropriations, and the Lumbee will not dilute \nsupport for tribes that currently receive Federal resources.\n  I want to stress again that this effort is about one thing, providing \nthe recognition that the Lumbee need to improve their quality of life \nand create jobs in their community.\n  The tribe is not seeking Federal gaming rights, and, in fact, this \nlegislation explicitly denies the tribe's ability to operate casinos.\n  Some have also argued that the Lumbee do not need Federal recognition \nbecause they can apply for acknowledgement through the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs administrative process. But let me be clear about this: the \nLumbees have been prohibited from being considered by this process.\n  This is because the Lumbee were unfortunate enough to win partial \nrecognition during a time when the BIA was actively working to \nterminate longstanding relationships with tribes and roll back Federal \nservices for Native Americans across the country.\n  The 1956 Lumbee Act expressly precludes the tribe from pursuing \nFederal acknowledgment through the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nadministrative process. Thus, while the Lumbee were identified in \nFederal legislation as a tribe more than 50 years ago, existing law \nstrictly limits the group's ability to access vital services otherwise \navailable to a federally designated tribe.\n  As the Senate Indian Affairs Committee has noted, Congress placed \nonly one other Indian tribe in a similar position. In 1965, the Tiwa \nIndians of Texas won recognition in Congress, but were prohibited from \npursuing BIA and other Federal services.\n  Congress recognized this problem, and in 1987 passed legislation \ngranting full recognition to the tribe. This has left the Lumbee as the \nonly tribe in America that is at once recognized by the Federal \nGovernment and forbidden from accessing critical programs that are \navailable to every other tribe in the country.\n  The administration has recognized this basic inequity, and at a House \nhearing on the bill last year, George Skibine, Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for Policy and Economic Development for Indian Affairs, \ntestified that, ``There are rare circumstances when Congress should \nintervene and recognize a tribal group, and the case of the Lumbee \nIndians is one such rare case.''\n  I could not agree more. I urge my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation with no further delay.\n  Lumbee Chairman Purnell Swett is here in the Senate Gallery, and has \nbeen meeting with a number of Senators to discuss this effort. I thank \nhim for joining us, and encourage my colleagues to take time to hear \nfrom him how vital this bill is for his community and his people.\n  Federal recognition is about more than Federal resources and creating \neconomic development opportunities for this community. It is about \ntribal identity.\n  The Lumbee have fought for the recognition they deserve for over 100 \nyears. Truly, this recognition is long overdue.\n  We must ensure the Lumbee are no longer treated as a second-class \ntribe, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Lumbee \nRecognition Act.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7392-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7392-S7404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 510\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon, in the \npresence of Senator Coburn of Oklahoma and Senator Harkin of Iowa, to \ndiscuss an issue I have worked on literally for my entire congressional \ncareer--food safety. This is an issue which has haunted me since my \ndays in the House of Representatives when I received a letter from a \nwoman in Chicago, far outside of my central Illinois congressional \ndistrict, who told me the story of her 6-year-old son Alex. She brought \nhome a pound of hamburger from the local grocery store and fed it to \nher son, and he was dead 3 days later from food contamination that led \nto a very painful, horrible death which has haunted her to this day. \nHer name is Nancy Donnelly. She has focused her life on making food \nsafety laws better in America. I have joined her in that effort. I was \ninspired by her tragedy and by the many people who came to me and \nexplained how they had been through similar circumstances.\n  For almost 20 years now, I have been taking on this issue. I have \ntried from the very beginning to bring to the attention of Members of \nCongress the fact that there are at least 12 different\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\nfood safety agencies in our Federal Government. When we look to the \norigin of these, the U.S. Department of Agriculture got started because \nUpton Sinclair wrote ``The Jungle,'' which told about the horrible \ncircumstances in the packinghouses of Chicago. That novel led Congress \nto pass the first food safety law with the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture as the lead. Over the years, the Food and Drug \nAdministration expanded its role in this area, and many other agencies \ndid as well.\n  I have always argued that we need better coordination. In fact, we \nneed one single food safety agency that uses science and tries to reach \nnew efficiencies by avoiding overlap in deciding what is the safest \napproach to food in America. I haven't had much luck. Rarely do I find \na bipartisan cosponsor, find anybody who will join me in this effort. \nBut I understand the Senator from Oklahoma said yesterday he is \ninterested in it, and I welcome him to be part of this conversation. I \nwant to see the day when we have a single food safety agency that gets \nthe job done in a professional way.\n  What do we do before then? Knowing that this will take some time, and \nit has taken time already, what do we do? I think we should clearly \nlook at the weaknesses in the current food safety system and address \nthem directly.\n  If I said to the Presiding Officer, before he was in the Senate and \nbefore he became conversant with most of the laws of the land, if I \nasked, do you believe there is a Federal law which allows the Federal \nGovernment a mandatory recall of contaminated, deadly food products on \nthe shelves of America, he would say, of course, that is why we have \nfood safety agencies. The answer is no, there is no such law. The \ngovernment has no power to recall deadly and contaminated food products \non shelves across America--amazing, but it is a fact. This bill we are \ntrying to call before the Senate will give the government the power to \nrecall deadly food. That is a major step forward. If we did nothing \nelse in this bill, it is a major step forward.\n  The bill also gives the Food and Drug Administration the authority to \nexpand their inspections, not just here in the United States, where \nthere is plenty to be done--we are seeing an FDA inspector once a year \nas a novelty--but overseas, where there is literally no inspection. As \nfoods come in from all over the world, we don't know the standards they \nare using. Unfortunately, our people are vulnerable as a result.\n  Should we have mandatory recall? Should we have more inspections? \nAbsolutely. I think that is a must to make sure we don't run into the \ntragedies we have seen repeated over and over again. Hardly a week goes \nby that there isn't some new food tragedy--peanut butter, spinach, \ntomatoes, eggs. People get sick--and some die--week after week, month \nafter month. So the question is, Will we do something about it?\n  I went to Senator Harkin, chairman of the committee, and asked him to \nlead, with Senator Enzi, his Republican counterpart, in a reform bill \nthat will make this system better, really fill in some of the gaps, \nmove us forward. He took that challenge and handled it very \nprofessionally and very quickly. In fact, we have 19 Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans, in a bipartisan effort, after hearings in \nhis committee, after markup in his committee, bringing this bill to the \nfloor.\n  For the first time since I have been engaged in this debate, we have \nthe support not only of consumer groups, which we would expect, we have \nthe support of the industry--the food processors, the grocery \nmanufacturers. Why? Because they understand that once we lose \nconfidence in our food supply, it hurts them as businesspeople.\n  So here we are, a moment, an opportunity we have worked for for \nyears--literally years--a bill we have been working on for months in a \nbipartisan fashion, and all we are asking for is a chance to bring it \nto the floor. That is all. Bring it to the floor, entertain amendments, \ndebate it, deliberate, and vote. People who come and visit Washington \nthink that is what the Senate does, right? An important issue, a life-\nand-death issue for families, something we all care about when we put \nfood on the table--thank goodness the Senate is finally going to take \nup something that affects their lives, and it is going to do it in a \nprofessional, bipartisan way. Thank goodness all the games are over.\n  No. Welcome to the U.S. Senate. When we bring the matter to the floor \nand ask for a chance to debate and deliberate it, 1 Senator, who is on \nthe floor today, says no--not 99 Senators, 1 Senator says no.\n  We said to the Senator: If you object to the bill, you can vote \nagainst it.\n  He said: Not good enough.\n  We said to the Senator: If you want to offer an amendment to this \nbill, offer an amendment.\n  Not good enough. He says: No, I don't want the Senate to take up this \nbill and debate it. I don't want them to vote on this bill. I want this \nbill to die right now. I don't want it to go forward.\n  From my point of view, we are all entitled to our opinion. We are all \nentitled to our political position. In the Senate, one is entitled to \nspeak their mind. In the Senate, one is entitled to debate and \ndeliberate, to offer an amendment and have a vote. But at the end of \nthe day, if there is any fairness in this body, the majority will \ndecide what goes forward.\n  In this case, one Senator has said no. Nineteen Senators, Democrats \nand Republicans together, are not enough, putting this together after \nthe years of work that have gone into it. It is not enough. That \ntroubles me because I think this issue is a life-or-death issue. This \nmorning's Washington Post talked about what has happened to \nunsuspecting people across America who ate the contaminated eggs. Think \nabout it. Eggs are supposed to be wholesome and nutritious and good for \nyou, but thousands of these eggs contaminated with salmonella, sold \nacross America, have made people sick, and for some their lives will be \ncompromised forever.\n  I would think that when we consider the medical problems which will \nbe created if we stop this debate, when we think of the victims across \nAmerica of food contamination, for goodness' sake, shouldn't we err on \nthe side of moving forward? Who argues against a mandatory recall of \ncontaminated food from shelves across America? Who argues against \ngiving the Food and Drug Administration the power to move forward to \nmake sure there are more inspections done on a scientific basis? That, \nto me, is basic.\n  When a customer goes into a store across America, they assume \nsomething: They assume the government is involved in this decision, \nthat somebody, somewhere took a look at what they are about to buy and \nsaid it is safe to sell it in America. I have to tell you, in most \ninstances, they are mistaken. The inspections are not frequent enough. \nThe inspections, sadly, do not take place in many instances.\n  Well, the argument on the other side is, come on, Senator, everybody \ncan dream up a new way to spend money. You have dreamed up a new way to \nspend money. You want to have more inspections. You want to send \ninspectors out to make sure our food is safe. Well, great. I can think \nup a way to spend money too. The argument is, if you are going to spend \nmoney and add to our deficit, the answer is no, no matter what you say, \nor you have to come up with some way to pay for it now.\n  What I have to remind the Senator from Oklahoma--and he and I have \nhad this debate over and over--this is an authorization bill. It does \nnot spend money. In order to spend the money, you have to go through an \nappropriations bill that actually spends it. In other words, you are \ngiven a finite amount of money and you decide: What is a priority? I \nthink this is a priority. Something else may not be funded. This should \nbe funded. It is an authorization bill.\n  What about the cost of this bill? How do we put the cost of this bill \nin comparison to some other issues? Modernizing the food safety system \nof America costs us $280 million a year. That is less than $1 for every \nAmerican. Providing tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America: $400 \nbillion a year. That is Senator McConnell's plan to extend the Bush tax \ncuts for the wealthy. So $400 billion unpaid for, adding to the \ndeficit, versus $280 million to protect families from contaminated \nfood.\n  Let's take a look at what happens when you do not spend the money and\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\nhave the inspection. In 2006, an E. coli outbreak cost spinach growers \nacross America $350 million in 1 year. That means that industry lost \n$70 million more than the entire cost of food safety inspection in the \nbill for 1 year. Would those growers rather have seen people not be \nvictimized by a contaminated product and not seen their own operations \ndestroyed for an inspection? I think they would have. They are not the \nonly ones. In 2008, the salmonella outbreak linked first to tomatoes \nand then to peppers cost the Florida tomato industry over $500 million. \nIn a single year, tomato and pepper growers lost nearly twice as much \nas this food safety bill costs. Doing nothing is not only cruel to the \nunsuspecting customers and consumers across America, it is devastating \nto the food industry. That is why they support this bill. They \nunderstand they would rather be subject to inspection so the consumers \nhave more confidence in their product and they do not run the risk of \nhaving their livelihood devastated by a food contamination outbreak.\n  The cost of doing nothing can also be measured in lost quality of \nlife. Each year, 76 million Americans suffer from a preventable \nfoodborne illness. For some of them, it is an upset stomach or \ndiarrhea, but for others it is more; 325,000 people are hospitalized, \naccumulating large medical bills, each year, and 5,000 people pay for \nfood contamination with their lives. That is the reality of what they \nface.\n  I know I take this bill personally because of the fact that I have \ncome to know some of the people who are involved in food contamination. \nI want to show you the photos of just two people before I propound a \nunanimous consent request and turn this over to my colleague from Iowa.\n  Marry Ann, shown in this photograph I have in the Chamber--this \nlovely lady--is an 80-year-old grandmother who contracted E. coli from \nspinach just before she left to meet with her family at the park for a \nLabor Day gathering. She is from Mendota, IL, a small town near my \nhometown. She is alive today, thank God, but the kidney failure, \nviolent vomiting, and uncontrollable diarrhea are constant reminders \nthat her quality of life will never be the same. She is 80 years old, \nand she struggles now to get by every day because of food \ncontamination. She is standing with us in this fight to improve our \nfood safety system so that no one else has to endure what she has been \nthrough.\n  Now I would like to introduce you to a young man. I hope I do not \nmispronounce the name of his hometown. Senator Coburn will know it \nbetter than I. His name is Richard, and he is from Owasso, OK. At age \n15, Richard joined the unfortunate ranks of foodborne illness victims. \nAfter he returned home from a camping trip, Richard began experiencing \nheadaches, diarrhea, and his urine turned black. He was later diagnosed \nwith E. coli contamination For 8 years, Richard has endured pain and \nsuffering because of it--migraine headaches, dry heaving, high blood \npressure, and, after a series of dialysis treatments, kidney failure--\nkidney failure. Last year, Richard was having a kidney transplant while \nthe House was debating and passing the food safety bill.\n  Richard and his mother Christine are following this food safety \ndebate because of their own family experience. They are following it \nfrom Richard's hospital room. Days ago, Richard was moved to the \nintensive care unit due to swelling in his brain and his inability to \nspeak.\n  On the day the Senator from Oklahoma was informing the press of his \nobjections to the food safety bill, Christine, Richard's mom, was \nmaking an airline reservation and making her way back to her son's \nhospital bed in Oklahoma. When Christine learned that her home State \nSenator was blocking food safety reform because of the cost, she \nimmediately thought about the hundreds of thousands of dollars her \nmiddle-class family has spent on Richard's medical care.\n  On behalf of her son, Christine stands with 89 percent of the \nAmerican people who want Senator Coburn to stop blocking this food \nsafety bill. She said she has a simple question:\n\n       As the Senate is debating on S 510, I am taking an \n     emergency flight to the hospital to be with my son. He's been \n     admitted again with complications stemming from his E. coli \n     infection. We can delay this legislation no more.\n\n  She writes:\n\n       Something must be done. The time is now. How many more \n     victims must there be?\n\n  That is the critical question.\n  Is this a perfect bill? As I have said before and will say again, the \nonly perfect legislation that I am aware of was tapped out on stone \ntablets and carried down a mountain by ``Senator Moses.'' We can \nimprove this bill. We can entertain amendments that may improve this \nbill. But to stop us in our tracks and tell us we cannot even debate it \nor deliberate it while the Senate sits empty doing nothing is \ninexcusable while people are suffering and dying across America.\n  We have a bill that has the support of the industry and the \nconsumers. We have come forward to this point. We cannot turn back.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader, following consultation with \nthe Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 247, S. 510, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, and \nthat when the bill is considered, it be under the following \nlimitations: that general debate on the bill be limited to 2 hours, \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Harkin and Enzi or \ntheir designees; that the only amendments in order other than the \ncommittee-reported substitute be those listed in this agreement, with \ndebate on each of the listed amendments limited to 30 minutes, with the \ntime equally divided and controlled in the usual form; further, that \nwhen any of the listed amendments are offered for consideration, the \nreading of the amendments be considered waived and the amendments not \nbe subject to division; Harkin-Enzi substitute amendment; Tester \namendment regarding small farms and facilities; Harkin-Enzi amendment \nin reference to technical and conforming changes; and that once \noffered, the technical amendment be considered and agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; Coburn amendment in \nreference to offset for the cost of the bill; Feinstein amendment in \nreference to BPA; Leahy amendment in reference to criminal penalties; \nthat upon disposition of the listed amendments up or down and the use \nor yielding back of all time, the Harkin-Enzi substitute amendment, as \namended, be agreed to, the committee-reported substitute amendment, as \namended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and \nthe Senate then proceed to vote on passage of the bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I object and ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized after the majority whip finishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  And the objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Coburn \nactually sees, as I do, the need for us to coordinate the food safety \nagencies and is proposing that we ask for a study for that purpose. I \nwish to join him in that effort. Asking for a study is a good thing, \nbut while a study is underway and we are waiting for the report, people \nwill be dying from food contamination.\n  I hope we can engage in this study and move toward a single food \nsafety agency. I am with him all the way. Let's save money in the \nprocess. And I think we can. We can come up with a professional, good \nagency in a bipartisan way. But unless and until that is done, we have \nto make reference to the obvious; that is, the current system is not \nsafe enough for American families. As good as our food supply may be in \nAmerica, we can do better. To stop now, after all of this work has been \nput into this effort, with the objection of only one Senator, strikes \nme as unfair--unfair to the people across America who desperately need \nour protection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what is unfair in this country is the fact \nthat we label bills to fix things and fix a lot of the symptoms, but we \ndo not fix the underlying problem. We are going to spend several \nhundred million dollars\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\nwhen the bill ultimately goes through, and much of it will be well \napplied, but the underlying problem will never be fixed.\n  The Senator mentioned we have 12 agencies--12 agencies across this \ngovernment--responsible for food safety. What I would contend to my \ncolleagues is that the same amount of money we spend now, if we spent \nit wisely, would give us a much safer food supply.\n  All through the course of this debate, I have had staff at every \nmeeting raising the consistent objections I have raised. At every \nmeeting, one of my staffers has been there. They were ignored. I am not \nstopping this bill because it was ignored; I am stopping the bill \nbecause I do not think we are fixing the true underlying problem.\n  Let me give you an example. Here is what Dr. Hamburg said. This is on \nthe egg rule.\n\n       We believe that had these rules been in place at an earlier \n     time it would have very likely enabled us to identify the \n     problems on this farm before this kind of outbreak occurred.\n\n  How long did it take them to develop the rule? Ten years. It started \nwith President Clinton asking that this be addressed. Robert Reich went \nand inspected and said it is unbelievable what has happened. And what \nhappened is, he initiated it with the FDA, the start. Somebody ought to \nask the question and hold accountable FDA taking 10 years to get a rule \nso we have safe eggs in this country. We did not ask that question. So \nthe next thing that comes up after we pass a bill like this is that we \nare going to see another problem because we are not fixing the core \nproblem.\n  Let me read to you from the oversight hearings the Senate has \nconducted on food safety. I think I have them here. There was a full \ncommittee hearing on October 22, 2009, ``Keeping American Families \nSafe, Reforming the Food System.'' There was a full committee hearing \ndeveloping a comprehensive response to food safety on December 4, 2007. \nAnd there was a Senate Appropriations Committee oversight hearing on \nHallmark/Westland meat recall--a special hearing. There was not one \nhearing that said: FDA, what are you doing, how are you doing it, and \nwhy are you doing it that way? There was not one hearing that said: \nUSDA, why in the world can't you get your act together? We did not do \nthe structural oversight that is necessary to fix these problems.\n  I am not denying that this bill will have some positive effect. But \nit will not solve the problem. So we will pass a bill, and then we will \nstill have contaminated food, but we will have answered the questions \nof late. We can't keep running government that way.\n\n  I appreciate sincerely Senator Durbin's efforts. We come from vastly \ndifferent backgrounds. I don't question his integrity, his desire, or \nhis goodwill to try to solve the problem. As he told me on the phone, I \ncan't be involved in everything, so, therefore, I shouldn't participate \nin this. That is the implication. I am not saying the Senator said \nthat, but the implication is, you can't be involved so, therefore, you \ncan't know enough to be involved. Well, having run a $70 million-a-year \nbusiness in the health care field, having managed hundreds upon \nhundreds upon hundreds of people, and being trained as a physician in \npractice for 25 years, I know a heck of a lot about food safety. What I \ndo know is if you don't fix the problems in the underlying agencies \nthat are responsible for food safety, it doesn't matter how many bills \nwe bring up.\n  There is a prohibition in this bill. Section 403, Jurisdiction \nAuthorities:\n\n       Nothing in this act or an amendment made by this act shall \n     be construed to alter the jurisdiction between the Secretary \n     of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     under applicable statutes, regulations, or agreements \n     regarding the products eligible for voluntary inspection \n     under this agreement.\n\n  We actually are doing something wrong here--not just right. We are \ntelling them they can't shift stuff around to solve the problem. Not \nonly do we not do the vigorous oversight that is required to actually \nfix the real problems; we put up a roadblock, a silo back up and say, \nBy the way, you can't do any of this together. That is in the bill.\n  What has happened? The FDA Commissioner says had we put this rule \nout, this probably wouldn't have happened on the egg recall, salmonella \nenteritis. It wouldn't have happened. Where is the answer from the FDA? \nWhere is the oversight hearing of the FDA on why it took them 10, \nalmost 11 years to get a rule out on egg safety? That is my core \nobjection.\n  I want us to solve the problems. I don't have any problem with the \nissues about foreign inspection. Mandatory recall I don't have a \nproblem with, although we have never had a food supplier in this \ncountry that has not recalled when asked to recall. So having a \nmandatory authority is a false claim because nobody has ever not \nrecalled when they were asked to, because it is in their best interests \nto recall.\n  My problems are characterized by this chart, when you think about the \negg recall. The USDA knew what was happening on the farms in Iowa but \nsaid nothing to the FDA. The FDA didn't look to see, and Congress \ndidn't want to hear about it. So we have a bill before us that does a \nlot of good things, but it doesn't fix the real problem. That is my \nbasic complaint. We are treating the symptoms of the disease. My \ncolleagues have heard my analogy before, but I am going to make it \nagain. If you come in to see me, as a practicing physician, and you \nhave fever and chills and cough and body aches and are short of breath, \nand I give you something to take care of your fever and chills; I give \nyou something to suppress your cough; I actually make you feel better, \nbut I don't diagnosis the fact that there is a pneumonia in your lung, \nyou are going to get better for a little while and then you are going \nto get really sick. Then you come back. I have treated your symptoms \nthe first time, and then I treat your pneumonia and I get you over \nthat. Then I don't follow up after that to see what the real cause of \nthe pneumonia is, which was a little tumor in your lung that caused \nblockage which caused the pneumonia. If I continue to treat symptoms, \nall I do is delay the time in which we get to the final fix for your \nproblem. My analogy is I think that is what we are doing. I believe we \nhave not been thorough enough. The intentions are great, but I don't \nthink we have been thorough enough. I understand foodborne illnesses. I \nhave treated a lot of them. I have had a lot of them. When I was in \nIraq for 30 days, I had it for most of the time I was there.\n  The other question this has raised is we can't keep doing this. We \ncan't afford to keep doing this. We have more than enough money at the \nUSDA and the FDA to do everything you want to do in this bill--more \nthan enough. That is one of the things the American people are asking \nof us. We are going to make this point on a food safety bill, and I am \nfine with the heat I will take from the groups and the press on it, \nbecause I think the underlying principle is more important. It is easy \nto pass a bill that looks as if it does something. And even if it does \nsomething, if it passed on what we are going to spend when we don't \naddress what we are spending wisely, we will never get out of the jam \nwe put our kids in.\n  To Senator Durbin's point: Yes, it is an authorization bill. The \nSenator from Illinois and Senator Harkin, as well as every member of my \ncaucus and every member of your caucus, get a letter the first of every \nCongress saying I would absolutely object to any bill that increases \nauthorizations in this Congress that are not offset with a reduction in \nless important, less priority items. I offered to do that to the \nmajority leader. I offered to give that to him 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago. He \nhung up the phone on me; wouldn't even say goodbye. I said, I will give \nyou a list. How about the $500 million the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture pays out to dead farmers in crop payments--to dead farmers \nwho have been dead 6, 7, 8 years, still paying crop payments. We have \nplenty of money to pay for it. We don't want to do the hard work of \ngetting rid of the things we should.\n  What America is screaming for now is they want food safety, but they \nwant security for their kids as well. If we continue this bad habit of \nignoring the actual idea that there is a limitation on how much we can \nspend, we will never solve any of the critical problems, whether we \nhave clean food or not.\n  I do honor my two colleagues who are in the Chamber. They are men of \ngreat\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\nintent, honest intent, caring hearts, but I disagree on how we have \ngone about this. This isn't the first time I have heard the wonderful \neloquence of Senator Durbin. He is great at what he says and how he \nsays it. He is a very bright man. He makes his case well. But there are \nimportant things in this country that we are ignoring, and this bill is \nan example of it.\n  Why in the world won't we fix the real problem? Why won't we ask--you \nknow, the one thing that should happen--it amazes me. There is not a \nhearing scheduled on why it took 10 years to have an egg safety \nstandard. We have allowed this. We have allowed it.\n  The other point I wish to make is, yes, the money has to get \nappropriated. I agree with that. But we are going to spend this money. \nSenator Durbin, we are going to spend it, aren't we?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not unless we appropriate it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Does the Senator have every intent to make sure it is \nappropriated?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If we can find the money.\n  Mr. COBURN. So wait a minute. If we can find the money.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If we can find the money.\n  Mr. COBURN. The earlier statements of this will solve the problem, \nbut yet we are not going to find the money. It should be 100 percent \nthat we are going to find the money to do this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to continue my point, if you don't mind. You have \nalways been courteous to me and I will be courteous to you, but I wish \nto continue for a few minutes and then I will give my colleague the \nchance to respond.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator, I was going to ask him a \nquestion.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will allow that in a few minutes.\n  If this bill is that important, and the majority whip says we will \nfund it if we can find the money, rather than saying we are going to \nfund this because this is a priority--and he has the power to make sure \nthat gets done. Don't let anybody kid you. If he wants this bill \nfunded, he can get it funded. So the point is, either it is going to be \nfunded and it is going to get spent and the argument about \nauthorizations is bogus or there is going to be a real question on \nwhether it is going to get funded. If there is a real question about \nwhether it is going to get funded, then the importance of the issue \nisn't nearly as great as we have explained it to be, which goes back to \nan argument we have had for the 6 years I have been here.\n\n  I understand you don't agree. I am a hardheaded guy from Oklahoma who \nactually believes we ought to make hard choices, we ought to downsize \nthe government rather than grow it; and when we have an issue such as \nfood safety, what we ought to do is hold accountable the agencies--let \nme say it again--we ought to hold accountable the agencies, because I \nam not sure that we don't have enough rules now. What I think we have \nis not enough effectiveness of the agencies and the dollars they spend. \nWith the exception of foreign inspections, which I fully support--I \nfully support--anybody who wants to sell food in this country ought to \npay for the inspections and we ought to be able to certify that it is \nsafe. I have no problem with that. There are a lot of components of \nthis bill I agree with. But I refuse to agree to a unanimous consent \nrequest until we start looking at the real problems underlying not just \nthe FDA and USDA but the Pentagon, Health and Human Services, the \nDepartment of Justice. The waste in this government and our refusal to \nlook at that waste and eliminate it so we can do good things is one of \nthe reasons--not the only reason, one of the reasons--we find ourselves \n$13.4 trillion in debt.\n  Ideally, how would we go about this? Because one of the complaints \nis: Coburn, you stop things in their tracks. How would I have done it \ndifferently? So I think I owe you an explanation. First of all, the \ntomatoes were never contaminated. They were thought to be contaminated. \nIt was the jalapenos. So we, our agencies, identified falsely a food \nthat wasn't contaminated. So the agency is responsible for the $350 \nmillion cost for the tomatoes. That is a very important point. The \nincompetency of the agency cost $350 million, which is a very different \nstory than my colleague from Illinois talked about. It was jalapeno \npeppers.\n  So how should we go about this? Before we do one other thing on food \nsafety, every one of those agencies ought to know we are looking over \ntheir backs all the time. That is the first thing. We should have \nroutine oversight hearings on the appropriate committees three to four \ntimes a year. The second thing we ought to do is we ought to say, GAO, \nwe want to know everybody who has anything to do with the quality of \nfood in this country as far as a Federal agency and we want to know \ntheir line responsibilities, we want to know their authorities, we want \nto know X, Y, and Z, and their effectiveness. Because a GAO study at \nthe Department of Agriculture, as well as the FDA, says they are \nincompetent at most of this stuff. I will be happy to give my \ncolleagues the quotes. They lack the competency to carry out--how else \ndo you explain that the FDA cost the State of Florida $350 million by \nfalsely claiming that tomatoes weren't any good? That is incompetence. \nThere is no excuse for it. There was no hearing held to hold them \naccountable. It is ignored in this bill.\n  So how would we go about it? We would find out everybody who has \nanything to do with food safety. Then we would do what Senator Durbin \nwants to do. We would eliminate the duplication. We would make one line \nauthority: This agency is responsible for all the food safety in this \ncountry. That is a marvelous goal, Senator Durbin. This bill delays \nthat happening. He is on to the right thing.\n\n  We need to get there, I agree. But when you go to Piggly Wiggly or \nHomeland, as we have in Oklahoma, and you go to the freezer section and \nbuy a pizza for Friday night when--in Oklahoma, you are going to play \ndominos after high school football is over. If you buy a cheese pizza, \nthe Department of Agriculture is responsible for that. But if you buy a \npepperoni pizza, it is the FDA. I may have them reversed. I do have \nthem reversed. The FDA is responsible for cheese pizzas. How does that \nmake sense?\n  It is a symptom of the disease in Washington. First of all, it is \nstupid. Second of all, it is inefficient. Third of all, it guarantees \nthe two agencies are not going to be talking to each other.\n  The Food and Drug Administration and the USDA have--I think my number \nis correct; I may be wrong--187 agreements for how they work across the \nfield. Except you know what happened with regard to the egg situation. \nNobody paid attention to the agreements. We have the rules. USDA did \nnot tell the FDA. Then, finally, we have an egg producer--the State of \nIowa has done tons of stuff to say this guy's quality is poor. Did USDA \ndo anything about it? No. Did the FDA do anything about it? No.\n  USDA knew there was a problem. It did not need any more inspections. \nThey knew there was a problem. They did not communicate it to the FDA \nas per their protocol.\n  What do we have going on here? We have a mess. As well-intentioned as \nthis bill is and as hard as the Senators have worked on it on both \nsides of the aisle, it does not fix the cancer in the lung that caused \nthe pneumonia that caused the fever, cough, chills, and malaise of the \npatient. Until we start drilling down to get to the real problems, the \nreal issues of food safety, we are going to spend a lot of money. We \nare going to create a whole lot more regulations. We are going to have \nanother 200-plus page bill.\n  What we ought to say is, time out. Let's do some things. Let's have a \none-page bill that can pass by UC today that says we are going to do \nsafety inspections on foreign foods. Done. We can do it. That takes \ncare of our foreign food.\n  A good portion of our seafood is imported. It is farm raised. It is \nimportant. We can do that tomorrow. We can have sanctions and penalties \nand criminal penalties for Federal bureaucrats who do not follow the \nrules of their own agencies.\n  Everything was in place on the egg situation. We did not execute. We \ndid not carry the ball down the field. Here is what we know about the \nDeCoster Egg Farms. They are a habitual violator. They have had eight \nknown run-\n\n[[Page S7397]]\n\nins or citations from State and Federal regulators. They were \ndesignated by the State of Iowa as a ``habitual violator.'' Robert \nReich called the state of the farms simply atrocious.\n  USDA inspections--I have a copy of the inspections--routinely noted \nunsafe and unsanitary conditions without communicating any of those \nconcerns to the FDA.\n  What we had was a failure to execute. It was seen. It was known. What \nwe had in place did not work. But this bill does not fix that. It does \nnot fix that.\n  I have treated a lot of people with toxic e. coli in my life. That is \nwhat causes kidney failure. Salmonella hardly ever does that. It is not \na fun disease to have. There is nothing in this bill that says we are \ngoing to prioritize pathogens. You see, e. coli, compared to all the \nrest of the pathogens, is much more important in terms of \nhospitalization, death, morbidity, and mortality. So any food safety \nbill ought to work on the most ravaging problem first, not treat them \nall the same. Yersinia pestis, shigella, and salmonella cause \nenteritis, that is true. Rarely will you have long-term effects from \nthose. But from toxic e. coli, it is a whole different actor.\n  We ought to prioritize what we do in food safety through the food \nsafety problems that cause the major problems. We do not do that.\n  I know I have disappointed my colleague from Illinois. I know he has \nworked hard on this bill. We have some very stark philosophical \ndifferences about how to make the government work better. I hope \nthrough the next few years to convince him more often than not to go in \na different direction.\n  I know Senator Harkin's heart is one of the softest and best in our \nbody. If somebody has a problem, I don't care what it is, he is \ninterested in it. For disappointing my colleague, I sincerely \napologize. For standing on my principles and what I believe, I do not. \nI do not see a great future for our country if we do not start changing \nthe way we do things, whether it is drilling down and looking at what \nthe real problems are with the agencies and doing the appropriate \noversight and taking priorities and getting rid of things that do not \nwork and making things that do work work better.\n  I worry about my grandkids, and I worry about all of our grandkids. \nWith them at $43,702 today per man, woman, and child in this country, \nwe cannot do it anymore. I am not going to do it anymore. I will be as \ncompliant as I can be living within my principles, but I am just not \ngoing there. For that, I apologize. I apologize for disappointing my \ncolleagues, but I sincerely regret we could not have solved some of \nthese problems along the way.\n  I yield the floor and yield to the Senator for a question, if he \nwishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am going to yield to the Senator from \nIowa in just a moment.\n  I would like to offer to the Senator from Oklahoma a compromise and \ntell him I have spent much of the time he was speaking reading S. 3832, \na one-page bill, which calls for a plan within 60 days from USDA and \nFDA and within 1 year a joint report from Congress, a GAO report. I am \ngoing to join him on this issue.\n  What I would like to suggest is the following: Because I am as \ncommitted as he is to food safety, I would like to amend my request and \nmake this a Coburn-Durbin amendment which will be offered, which I \nguarantee I will work night and day to get passed, so we address the \noverall issue. In the meantime, while we are spending 6 months or a \nyear moving toward this goal, let's at least make the current system as \nsafe as we can. Let's do everything we can to protect the people of \nthis Nation.\n  The Senator does not have to apologize to me. I will be here \ntomorrow. But this poor man in ICU in Oklahoma may not be, and other \npeople like him.\n  What I suggest to him is, I will join in a compromise. I will add an \namendment to the bill and cosponsor his language in S. 3832 and ask my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle--all of them--to join us in voting \nfor them if the Senator from Oklahoma will remove his objection so we \ncan go forward on this important historic debate.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's offer, but I \ncannot do that. I also want him to know that this bill is not going to \nsolve the problem of that gentleman from Owasso, OK. This bill is not \ngoing to solve that situation because we are not fixing the real \nproblem.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I must reclaim my time and say to the \nSenator from Oklahoma, he cannot tell me how badly he feels for these \nvictims and then stop the bill with which we are trying to protect \nthem.\n  The Senator cannot tell me he wants reform and then reject it. The \nbottom line is the description he has given is about the USDA, and this \nbill is not about that agency. It is about the FDA.\n  I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, I agree with him. I want to help \nhim. But if he will not allow us to bring to the floor a bill on which \nwe worked for a year and a half, if he will not offer an amendment \nalong the lines suggested, then all he is doing is saying no.\n  If he is saying we cannot afford safe food in America, I disagree. I \nthink we can afford it, and I am willing to cut other spending to pay \nfor it. That is the only way it can get through the appropriations \nprocess.\n  But to just say no after all the work that has gone into it because \nhe does not happen to like it--if the Senator from Oklahoma does not \nlike it, offer his amendment. If it is a good idea, the Senate will \naccept it. If he does not have an amendment, then he is like me on \nMonday night watching football when the Bears play the Packers deciding \nwhat Jay Cutler should be doing as quarterback. It is pretty easy from \nthat armchair.\n  I want the Senator from Oklahoma to come down to the field and offer \nhis amendment, be part of the conversation. Don't just stand there and \nsay no. As he says no, people will suffer and some will die. I think \nthat is fundamentally unfair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, again, if I truly felt this bill was \ngoing to solve those problems, I would be out here supporting it. I do \nnot think so. We have an inherent disagreement.\n  The Senator from Illinois can file a cloture motion any time he wants \nto proceed to this bill. He can file it today, and we can have a \ncloture vote next week--we are not going to be doing anything next week \nanyway--and we can go to the bill. File the cloture motion, if that is \nhow he feels about the bill and he thinks I am dead wrong. File the \ncloture motion, get the votes, and do it.\n  What we are hearing is we want it to pass in a short period of time \nso there cannot be the real debate there needs to be on the problems in \nthis country on food safety. That is what we just heard.\n  We have been talking about this issue. We could have been here \ntomorrow debating this bill. The fact is, they did not file a cloture \nmotion. They filed cloture motions 179 other times this Congress, more \nthan any other Congress in the history, and the vast majority of them \nless than 24 hours after the bill was introduced.\n  If the Senator really wants to have the debate, put the bill on the \nfloor, file cloture, and have the debate. I will debate this for 30 \nhours.\n  Washington is great about saying they are fixing things. They are \ngreat about passing bills. They are not great about fixing things \nbecause they fix the symptoms, not the real disease. That is the \nproblem with this bill. It does not drill down and fix the real \ndisease.\n  My hope is that we can fix the real disease and that we will have the \nlegitimate, tough hearings on why and how and what is needed to be \nchanged in the agencies, not more regulations, not more money, but \nholding the agencies accountable, which we have not done. That is how \nWashington works. If there is a problem, we do not look at what we are \ndoing already, we just create an answer for what we think needs to be \ndone rather than holding people accountable. That is why we have a $3.9 \ntrillion budget. That is why our kids are bankrupt or getting ready to \nbe because we continue to make the same mistakes.\n  I do not apologize for my principles on this issue. If, in fact, we \nwill ever get to where we fix the real problems in the Congress, my \ncolleague will find me as docile and compliant as any other Member of \nthe body. But do not\n\n[[Page S7398]]\n\ntell me to treat pneumonia with an aspirin because that is exactly what \nwe are doing with this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, first of all, to my friend from Oklahoma \nbefore he leaves the floor, I thank him for his kind words. I \nappreciate that very much. He is a very valuable member of our \ncommittee. We have done work together in the past.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I agree with a lot of what he said. \nThis bill is not going to solve all our problems. It may not solve a \nmajority of our problems. It will solve some of them.\n  The Senator is right. We read about these crazy pizza things--\nAgriculture has one, FDA has the others. It is a crazy quilt work of \nthings.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I am about as frustrated as you \nare. I have been chairman of Ag and I am chairman of HELP. When I am on \nAg and they want to get some stuff to have jurisdiction over, then the \npeople at Health and Human Services step in and they say no. Now I am \non HELP and we want to get more jurisdiction for FDA and Ag says no. It \ndrives you nuts sometimes. So you have these interlocks that have been \nbuilt up over the years, and, yes, we have a crazy patchwork quilt.\n  I would say forthrightly that what we need in this country, I \nbelieve, after having been through this for 35 years on the Ag \nCommittee in both the House and Senate and now in the HELP Committee \nfor 22 or 23 years there, we need a single food safety agency in \nAmerica that would pull from Ag and pull from FDA and set up a food \nsafety agency.\n  I would say to my friend that agriculture has a lot of things on \ntheir plate. They have exports, they have farms, they have a lot of \nstuff on agriculture. FDA, they have drugs and all the stuff with drugs \nthat they have to do--new drugs and investigational new drugs and all \nthis other stuff and then they have some foodstuff. Foodstuff always \ngets kind of left behind. I see the same thing in agriculture. They \nhave so many other things on their plate that takes so much money, the \nfoodstuff gets kind of left behind.\n  So I think what we ought to do, if you want to drill down, is to get \nrid of all that and put it in one food safety agency. I have proffered \nthis in the past, but I don't find much support for that. The \ninstitutional biases against that are tremendous. So I say to my \nfriend: You are right. This bill will not solve all our problems, but I \nthink it is a good step. I think it is a good step forward. It has \nstrong bipartisan support. It has the support of industry and \nconsumers, and that doesn't happen too often around here.\n  There is that old saying: Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the \ngood. I hear my friend from Oklahoma, and what he is saying is we ought \nto have a more perfect system than what we have. I agree. We ought to \nhave a more perfect system, but I can't get that done. We can't get \nthat done here. But we can do some good things and we can take some \nsteps to make it better than what it is and that is what this bill \ndoes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I would just \nsay that I think we ought to fix the real problems. By fixing the \nsymptoms, we delay the time in which we fix the real problems, and I \nthink that is what we are doing.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I agree we are not getting to the nub of it, but it \nis a good step forward. I mean, sometimes you do have to treat the \nsymptoms before you can get to the underlying cause. I am not a doctor. \nI don't want to practice medicine without a license.\n  I would just say again--to repeat--this bill is a major step forward. \nIt will not solve all the problems. I can understand that, and I think \nthere is a lot of other things we need to do, but you have to do what \nis possible around here. Politics is the art of the possible--to try to \nmove the ball forward, to make changes that are more beneficial than \ndetrimental, and I believe that is what this bill does.\n  We have worked long and hard. I see my colleague, Senator Enzi, is on \nthe floor. I couldn't ask for a better friend and a better ranking \nmember to work with. We reported this bill out last November without \none dissenting vote--a voice vote.\n  I am sorry the Senator from Oklahoma had to leave, but I would just \nsay that he did not object. He is on our committee, and he did not \nobject to reporting out the bill. We had hearings, a markup, and we \nwent through all the right and normal procedures. Then, since last \nNovember, our staffs--Senator Enzi's staff, my staff, and others, \nSenator Gregg's staff, I know, Senator Burr's staff--have been \ninvolved, and we have too personally--the Senators have been involved \nin this since at least the first of the year--working out the problems \nand trying to get down to a bill that would have widespread support on \nthe floor.\n  Again, on something such as this, where we want to tackle a problem \nthat is certainly not in any way partisan, you would like to get broad \nsupport for it. We kind of like to get something that would have a lot \nof folks, rather than a few, in order to send a strong signal that the \nCongress wants to make changes in the way we inspect food in this \ncountry.\n  I would say this bill we have--if this bill were to come to the \nfloor--would get over 90 votes. I bet it would get over 90 votes. Maybe \nit would get 95, maybe 98, I don't know, but there would certainly be \nover 90 votes. So we have strong bipartisan support. As I said, we have \nthe industry that supports it and the consumers. That doesn't happen a \nlot around here.\n  I can understand why both sides support it. Senator Enzi, Senator \nGregg, Senator Burr, myself, Senator Durbin's staff, Senator Dodd, and \nothers on our side have been working together, and I think we have a \ngood bill. Is it perfect? No, it is not perfect. Is it going to solve \nevery single problem the Senator from Oklahoma brought up? No, it is \nnot. I am not Pollyannaish about this. But we do what is the art of the \npossible. We do what we can to make the system work better, to make \nsure we have less foodborne illnesses than what we have today. This \nbill will do that, not 100 percent, but it will sure cut down on the \nnumber of foodborne illnesses in this country.\n  This is long overdue. It is long overdue. My goodness, the last time \nwe addressed this issue on food inspection, under the jurisdiction of \nthe FDA, was 1938. If I am not mistaken, it was in 1938. I wasn't born \nuntil 1939, and we haven't even visited this since 1938. Think of the \nchanges that have taken place in our country in the way we process and \nship food. My gosh, when these were passed in 1938, my own family had \nour own garden, we canned our own vegetables, we canned our own meat. \nYes, we canned meat, in glass jars, by the way.\n  We process food differently now. We didn't buy food from other \ncountries or halfway across the country. We ate locally. We grew our \nown food. But times have changed, and we like it now. I like the fact \nthat I can buy strawberries in the middle of the winter in Washington \nor I can buy a mango sometimes when I want one or bananas and things \nsuch as that. It is a wonderful system of making food available. What \nis not so wonderful is how that food is inspected as it goes through \nthe growing, the picking, the processing, the shipping, the packaging, \nand then on to the consumer. That is what is not working well, and that \nis what this bill does address.\n  Again, the objection the Senator had in terms of it not being paid \nfor, this is an authorization bill, not a spending bill. I wish to \nclear up a few things. I know my friend from Wyoming is here, and I \nwant to hurry up to give him the floor, but just a couple of things I \nwish to cover for the record.\n  No. 1, on the deficit, there has been some talk about this increasing \nthe deficit. I wish to make this very clear, precisely clear, that \naccording to the CBO there will be no deficit increase for 10 years on \nthis bill. I wish to make that point. In fact, we added language, at \nSenator Coburn's request, to have Health and Human Services review its \nown programs to trim any fat to help ensure fiscal responsibility and \nwe have a reporting system and other things the Senator from Oklahoma \nwanted and we put in the bill.\n  The next-to-the-last thing I wish to say is this. The food industry \nwants this bill. Why do they want it? Well, on the one hand, people get \nsick and people die. On the other hand, the food industry suffers too. \nFirst of all, a lot of\n\n[[Page S7399]]\n\ntimes they get sued and they have to pay out big compensations. But, \nsecondly, the disruption costs them a lot of money. When salmonella led \nto the recall of tomatoes, the entire Florida industry suffered, losing \nover $500 million in revenue--$500 million. When we had E. coli in \nspinach, growers lost $350 million. So they have an interest also in \nmaking sure we have a good food inspection system, and that is why they \nare for this bill.\n  I have letters from the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, National Restaurant Association, Consumers Union, \nPEW Charitable Trust, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, \nTrust for America's Health.\n  It is a rare thing when I can say that both the Chamber of Commerce \nand the Center for Science in the Public Interest are on the same page. \nYou have pretty broad support. So it is a shame we can't move this bill \nforward. It is needed.\n  I wish to also pay my respects to Senator Durbin. He has been working \non this issue, literally, I know for the last 10 years. He has been \nbugging me about it for 10 years, and I didn't even have the power to \ndo anything about it. So I know he has been insistent we work on this \nfor a long time. Our committee has taken it up under Senator Enzi's \nleadership, then later under Senator Kennedy, and now it falls to me, \nas chairman, to work together on it in a very good bipartisan way.\n  Madam President, on November 18, 2009, the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions reported out S. 510, the FDA \nFood Safety Modernization Act, without a single dissenting vote. Since \nthat time, the bipartisan group of cosponsors--Senators Durbin, Dodd, \nand I on the Democratic side, and Senators Enzi, Gregg, and Burr on the \nRepublican side--have continued to work with Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle to refine and improve this much needed legislation.\n  Legislation to reform our Nation's outdated food safety system is \nlong overdue. And that is why I am so deeply disappointed that after \nall of this work, the Senator from Oklahoma has decided he will not \nallow us to move the bill forward.\n  I understand that Senator Coburn's primary objection to the \nlegislation is that it is not paid for. I think that objection is \nmisguided, for reasons that I will explain. But I would also like to \nemphasize that the unanimous consent agreement proposed yesterday by \nthe majority leader, and objected to by Senator Coburn, would have \nallowed the Senator to have an up or down vote on an amendment to \noffset the cost of the bill, notwithstanding the fact that the bill \ncontains no mandatory spending.\n  I know Senator Coburn states that this bill will contribute to the \nfederal deficit. However, I have to respectfully disagree. In fact, as \nthis chart clearly shows, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nhas indicated that this legislation does not contribute to the Federal \ndeficit.\n  Our bill has no mandatory spending--only authorized spending. This \nlegislation, like countless others that have passed this year, will be \nsubject to the annual budget and appropriations process.\n  Furthermore, during the negotiations on the bill, we added language \nat Senator Coburn's REQUEST to have HHS review its own programs to trim \nany fat to help ensure fiscal responsibility. The Secretary is required \nto annually report her findings to Congress on these programs' \neffectiveness in achieving their goals.\n  Conservative Republicans like Senators Gregg, Enzi, and Burr all \nsupport this bill. I am again disappointed that Senator Coburn won't \neven let us consider it on the Senate floor, even though we have agreed \nto give him an opportunity to offer his amendment to the bill.\n  While I am here on the floor today, I would like to address some \nother misstatements that I have heard about this legislation as we have \nworked over these past weeks and months to bring it to the floor. \nFirst, there are claims that this bipartisan legislation is harmful and \nburdensome to the food industry. I find that very hard to believe. This \nlegislation has widespread support amongst industry and consumer \ngroups. The reality is that every time there is an outbreak of \nfoodborne illness, the food industry suffers, as consumers lose \nconfidence in the safety of our food supply.\n  When salmonella contamination led to the recall of tomatoes, the \nentire Florida tomato industry suffered, losing over $500 million in \nrevenue.\n  And during the 2006 spinach e. coli contamination that originated at \na single farm, the spinach industry lost $350 million.\n  The good actors in the food industry already take steps to prevent \nfood borne illness, but the entire industry suffers when FDA does not \nhave sufficient authority to ensure that all processors will sell safe \nfood.\n  I have received letters from the Grocery Manufacturing Association, \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Restaurant Association, The PEW \nCharitable Trust, Consumers Union, Center for Science in the Public \nInterest, and Trust for America's Health, to name a few. It is a rarity \nwhen I can say that both the Chamber of Commerce and CSPI are on the \nsame page. Here are several letters of support by both groups and a \njoint letter that both industry and consumer groups have signed. Let me \nread an excerpt from the joint letter:\n\n       Our organizations--representing the food industry, \n     consumers, and the public-health community--urge you to bring \n     S. 510 to the floor, and we will continue to work with \n     Congress for the enactment of food safety legislation that \n     better protects consumers, restores their confidence in the \n     safety of the food they eat, and addresses the challenges \n     posed by our global food supply.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Beverage Association, American Frozen Food \n           Institute, American Public Health Association, Center \n           for Foodborne Illness Research & National Restaurant \n           Association, The PEW Charitable Trusts, Trust for \n           America's Health, Snack Food Association, S.T.O.P.

Well, food safety is literally \na ``kitchen table'' issue. And it couldn't be more urgent or overdue. \nIt is shocking to think that the last comprehensive overhaul of \nAmerica's food safety system was in 1938--more than seven decades ago.\n  On the whole, Americans enjoy safe and wholesome food. The problem is \nthat ``on the whole'' is just not good enough.\n  As you can see from this chart, recent food-borne outbreaks in \nAmerica have been wide in scope and have had a devastating impact on \npublic health.\n  When kids die from eating peanut-butter sandwiches their mothers pack \nfor lunch, we have a problem. When people get sick--and many die--from \neating bagged spinach and lettuce, we have a problem. When cookie dough \nsold in supermarkets contains deadly E. coli, we have a problem. When \n1,000 Americans get sick from eggs that have been recalled for possible \nsalmonella contamination, it is undeniable that we have a problem.\n  As you can see from this chart, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention estimate that foodborne illnesses cause approximately 76 \nmillion illnesses a year, including 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 \ndeaths.\n  According to Georgetown University, these foodborne illnesses costs \nthe United States $152 billion per year in medical expenses, lost \nproductivity, and disability.\n  Those numbers are just staggering. This is like learning that, each \nyear, nearly 200,000 people in the United States die because of medical \nerrors and hospital-acquired infections--most of them totally \npreventable.\n  As this chart shows, the cost of foodborne illnesses in my home State \nof Iowa alone is nearly $1.5 billion per year.\n  These aren't just numbers, these are real people. Real people like \nKayla from Monroe, IA. On October 22, 2007, Kayla turned 14 and passed \nher driver's\n\n[[Page S7400]]\n\ntest. The next day she stayed home with a foodborne illness and was \nadmitted to Pella Community Hospital when her symptoms worsened. She \ndid not respond to antibiotics and within a week her kidneys began to \nfail. Kayla was transferred to Blank Children's Hospital for dialysis, \nbut her condition continued to deteriorate. She suffered a seizure and \nbegan to have heart problems. Just a few days later Kayla's brain \nactivity stopped and her parents made the painful decision to take \ntheir beautiful 14-year-old daughter off life support.\n  These things are totally intolerable. And yet, apparently, we \ntolerate them.\n  Well, no more. We can no longer tolerate the unnecessary pain, \nsuffering, and death caused by America's antiquated, inadequate food \nsafety system.\n  Let's put it plainly: Our current regulatory system is broken. It \ndoes not adequately protect Americans from serious, widespread \nfoodborne illnesses.\n  Bear in mind that, at the beginning of the 20th century, Americans \nate a much simpler fare--and, most of the time, they prepared meals \nfrom basic ingredients in their own homes, with their own hands.\n  Today, our meals have grown more complex, with much more varied \ningredients and diverse methods of preparation. By the time \nraw agricultural products find their way to our dinner plates, multiple \nintermediate steps and processes have taken place. Food ingredients \ntypically travel thousands of miles from farms to factories to fork and \nthey are intermingled and mixed together along the way.\n\n  We love today's broader selection of fresh foods available year-\nround. But this brings with it major new food safety challenges. For \ninstance, we rely more on foods imported from countries with less \nrigorous inspection rates and different production standards and \nconditions than our own.\n  Yet despite dramatic changes in our tastes, as well as in methods of \nproduction and distribution, our food safety laws have not changed. The \nU.S. regulatory system has failed to incorporate the latest scientific \nresearch on ways to make and keep food safe. Another shortcoming: Food \nsafety agencies are still encumbered by methods that often allocate \ndisproportionate resources to activities that do little to make our \nfood safer. FDA's own subcommittee on Science and Technology concluded \nin 2007 that FDA does not currently have the capacity to ensure the \nsafety of our food.\n  OK, so what do we need to do?\n  For starters, we need improved processes to prevent the contamination \nof foods and improved methods to provide safe food to consumers. To \nachieve this, more testing and better methods of tracking food can be \nutilized to verify that the processes are working.\n  Thirty years ago, the Nation had 70,000 food processors and the FDA \ninspectors made only 35,000 visits a year to cover these processors. \nEven that level of oversight was inadequate. But today, a full decade \ninto the 21st century, we have 150,000 food processors, twice as many \nplants, and the problem has grown far worse. Today FDA inspectors make \njust 6,700 visits each year; only one-fifth as many visits as they made \nthree decades ago. This is absurdly inadequate. It is a wide-open door \nto an endless series of outbreaks of foodborne illness.\n  As this chart shows, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act overhauls \nour food safety system in four critical ways:\n  It improves prevention of food safety problems, improves detection of \nresponse to foodborne illness outbreaks when they do occur, enhances \nour Nation's food defense capabilities, and increases FDA resources.\n  With the most recent recall for possible Salmonella contamination in \nat least 550 million eggs, we have yet another example of how this food \nsafety bill, had it been in place, could have improved the FDA's \nability to prevent and respond to the outbreak. This bill includes the \nfollowing provisions that would have been beneficial to respond to this \ncontamination and prevent future contamination:\n  It requires stronger trace back provisions so the contamination \nsource and affected egg products could have been more readily and \nquickly identified.\n  It provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority in the event that \nbusinesses do not voluntarily recall products.\n  It requires retailers to notify consumers if they have sold food that \nhas been recalled so consumers may have been aware of the contamination \nsooner.\n  It provides stronger disease surveillance so the outbreak may have \nbeen discovered earlier. It includes stronger enforcement provisions \nthat would generally deter producers from cutting corners on food \nsafety so the contamination may have been prevented or detected sooner.\n  It gives the FDA increased access to company records to identify \ncontaminated foods so the likelihood of contamination may have been \nminimized.\n  The bill before the Senate today will also dramatically increase FDA \ninspections at all food facilities. And it does much more. It will give \nFDA the following new authorities:\n  It requires all food facilities to have in place preventive plans to \naddress identified hazards and to prevent adulteration; and it gives \nFDA access to those plans.\n  It expands FDA's access to records in a food emergency.\n  It requires importers to verify the safety of imported food.\n  It strengthens surveillance systems to detect foodborne illnesses.\n  It requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices to establish a pilot project to test and evaluate new methods \nfor rapidly tracking foods in the event of a foodborne illness \noutbreak.\n  And, as I previously mentioned, this bill gives FDA the authority to \norder a mandatory recall of food.\n  I want to say a word about the impact of this legislation on farms \nand small processors. I have long said that our new regulations should \nbe effective, but not excessively burdensome. I am proud to say that \nthis legislation comprehensively modernizes our food safety system, but \ndoes so without injury to farms and small processors. There are \nrequirements throughout this bill to assure that the compliance burdens \non farms and small processors are minimized to the extent practicable, \nand the legislation directs FDA to exempt both small processors and \nfarms from certain provisions of this bill if they are engaged in low-\nrisk activities.\n  As this chart shows, this bill makes several accommodations to \naddress the concerns of small businesses. We have included language to \nensure that state and federal personnel help educate small businesses \nabout the new regulations and help folks comply with these regulations. \nThis approach is tied to risk, grounded in common sense, and set up to \nhelp everyone succeed. I am confident we have addressed the legitimate \nconcerns we have heard from small business owners\n  This food safety bill has been bipartisan from the beginning. It is \nan important, measured, and necessary effort to modernize our food \nsafety system and protect American consumers across the country from \nfoodborne illness.\n  I hope we can find a path forward and move this critical legislation \nas soon as possible.\n  I have some letters here, Madam President, and I also ask unanimous \nconsent to have these printed in the Record at the end of my comments \nin support of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is a shame we can't move this forward. Like I said, it \nwould get over 90 votes. I think we could dispose of a couple \namendments fairly rapidly. I don't think it would take much time at all \nto move this legislation. So I am hopeful that even though we can't \ntake it up now, maybe we can work with the Senator from Oklahoma, \nperhaps work something out to get some kind of agreement to get this \nmoving forward.\n  As I yield the floor, Madam President, I will recognize and thank my \ncolleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, who has also worked diligently \nfor a long time, and his staff. I will tell him we will continue to \nwork on this bill. We will continue to try to see what we can do to \novercome some of these bumps in the road and try to get this bill \nthrough.\n  So I thank my friend from Wyoming for his great leadership and his \nworking relationship specifically on this bill but on a lot of other \nthings too.\n\n[[Page S7401]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               September 15, 2010.\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Office of the Senate Majority Leader, Capitol Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Office of the Senate Minority Leader, Capitol Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     Our organizations are writing to urge you to schedule a vote \n     on S. 510, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009, at \n     the soonest possible date. The HELP Committee approved a \n     strong, bipartisan bill in November, and we believe that a \n     vote would keep the momentum going for enactment of landmark \n     food-safety legislation.\n       Strong food-safety legislation will reduce the risk of \n     contamination and thereby better protect public health and \n     safety, raise the bar for the food industry, and deter bad \n     actors. S. 510 will provide the U.S. Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) with the resources and authorities the \n     agency needs to help make prevention the focus of our food \n     safety strategies. Among other things, this legislation \n     requires food companies to develop a food safety plan; it \n     improves the safety of imported food and food ingredients; \n     and it adopts a risk-based approach to inspection.\n       Our organizations--representing the food industry, \n     consumers, and the public-health community--urge you to bring \n     S. 510 to the floor, and we will continue to work with \n     Congress for the enactment of food safety legislation that \n     better protects consumers, restores their confidence in the \n     safety of the food they eat, and addresses the challenges \n     posed by our global food supply.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Beverage Association, American Frozen Food \n           Institute, Center for Foodborne Illness Research & \n           Education, Center for Science in the Public Interest, \n           Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Food \n           Marketing Institute, Grocery Manufacturers Association, \n           International Bottled Water Association, International \n           Dairy Foods Association, National Association of \n           Manufacturers, National Coffee Association of U.S.A., \n           Inc., National Confectioners Association, National \n           Consumers League, National Restaurant Association, The \n           PEW Charitable Trusts, Trust for America's Health, \n           Snack Food Association, S.T.O.P Safe Tables Our \n           Priority, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Public \n           Interest Research Group.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Center for Science\n\n\n                                       in the Public Interest,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2010.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin and Gregg: The Center for Science in \n     the Public Interest (CSPI) supports the bipartisan agreement \n     on a manager's amendment to S. 510, the FDA Food Safety \n     Modernization Act, and urges the Senate to pass S. 510 (as \n     amended) at the earliest possible date. CSPI is a nonprofit \n     health advocacy and education organization focused on \n     nutrition, food safety, and alcohol issues, and supported by \n     the 900,000 member/subscribers to its Nutrition Action \n     HealthLetter.\n       The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act is a critically \n     needed update to our 70-year-old food safety laws. Today, \n     millions of consumers suffer preventable food-borne \n     illnesses, hospitalizing hundreds of thousands and causing \n     thousands of pre-mature deaths. Our member/subscribers, \n     seeing recurring news of outbreaks and recalls, identify the \n     need for Congress to fix our food safety system as a top \n     priority. Your legislation would do this by providing the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a mandate to prevent \n     foodborne illness, requiring companies to implement food \n     safety plans, setting standards for high-risk foods, \n     establishing more frequent inspections, giving FDA authority \n     to recall dangerous foods, and ensuring imported food meets \n     the same standards as food produced here. These changes \n     provide FDA with the modern tools it needs to assure \n     consumers that food they buy is safe to eat.\n       We appreciate the hard work by the bipartisan cosponsors of \n     the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act to reach agreement on \n     legislation that will protect the public from foodborne \n     disease. We urge the Senate to complete work on this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     David W. Plunkett,\n       Senior Staff Attorney.\n     Caroline Smith DeWaal,\n       Food Safety Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Food Marketing Institute,\n\n                                Arlington, VA, September 13, 2010.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg\n     Russell Senate Office Bldg,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin and Senator Gregg: On behalf of the \n     Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and its 1,500 food retail and \n     wholesale member companies, I would like to express our \n     strong support for S. 510, the FDA Food Safety Modernization \n     Act.\n       FMI members operate approximately 26,000 retail food stores \n     with combined annual sales of roughly $680 billion, \n     representing three quarters of all retail food store sales in \n     the United States. The most important goal for these \n     companies is ensuring that the products they sell are safe, \n     affordable and of the highest quality as possible. As the \n     purchasing agent for the consumer and the final link in the \n     supply chain, the supermarket industry continually seeks ways \n     to work with our suppliers and government to enhance the \n     safety of the food supply.\n       We applaud your leadership and the sponsors of this \n     legislation for working in a bipartisan manner to develop a \n     bill that will help assist us in this endeavor by ensuring \n     that FDA has the necessary authority, resources and \n     commitment to its food protection responsibilities.\n       We are particularly pleased with the legislation's \n     aggressive focus on prevention. Preventing food safety \n     problems from occurring by mitigating risk will have the \n     greatest impact on improving food safety. In addition we \n     support:\n       The requirement to have food safety plans in place;\n       The granting of mandatory recall authority to the FDA;\n       FDA working with industry to develop enhanced traceability \n     systems;\n       The recognition of accredited third-party programs to help \n     supplement FDA efforts; and\n       The flexibility provided to help prevent one-size-fits-all \n     solutions to improving food safety.\n       Each of these provisions are important building blocks in \n     creating a more effective and efficient food safety system. \n     FMI values the public-private relationship that we share with \n     the government to protect the nation's food supply and look \n     forward to continuing to work with you and your colleagues to \n     enact meaningful food safety legislation.\n           Regards,\n                                                 Jennifer Hatcher,\n     Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Food & Water Watch,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2010.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin and Gregg: On behalf of the non-profit \n     consumer organization Food & Water Watch, I am writing to \n     urge the U.S. Senate to pass S. 510, The FDA Food Safety \n     Modernization Act, as soon as it reconvenes this week so that \n     it can be conferenced and reconciled with its House companion \n     bill, H.R. 2749, The FDA Food Safety Enhancement Act.\n       The bill that you have authored contains many strong \n     features that will strengthen the Food and Drug \n     Administration's (FDA) ability to regulate food safety for \n     the products it regulates:\n       It will require food processors to establish food safety \n     plans that will include preventive control measures to \n     mitigate the possibility of adulterated food from entering \n     the food supply;\n       The bill will improve FDA's ability to police the safety of \n     the ever-growing volume of food imports;\n       S. 510 gives the FDA the authority to establish performance \n     standards on the food industry to achieve pathogen reduction \n     targets;\n       The bill gives FDA the authority to recall adulterated food \n     items when a company refuses to do so voluntarily.\n       We are concerned, however, with the inspection frequency \n     that is included in the Managers Amendment that will be \n     offered as a substitute to the version of S. 510 that was \n     reported out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \n     Pensions Committee last fall. While the language in the \n     Managers Amendment may in fact reduce the time between FDA \n     inspections of food facilities, we still believe that an \n     inspection frequency of once every five years for high-risk \n     food plants and every seven years for low-risk plants is \n     woefully inadequate. We remain unconvinced that had all of \n     the other provisions in S. 510 had been in place at the time \n     of the massive Wright County Egg and Hillandale Egg Companies \n     recalls that we would have not had a similar food borne \n     illness outbreaks occur because these two firms would not \n     have been receiving FDA inspections frequently enough to \n     ensure that they were complying with the law. Only with \n     adequate enforcement of food safety laws and regulations will \n     we see compliance with those standards by industry.\n       We are also sympathetic to the calls from small processors \n     and small farmers who are fearful, that some of the \n     provisions of S. 510 will cause undue burdens on them. We \n     applaud the inclusion in the Managers Amendment of a \n     technical assistance program for small processors and farmers \n     and direction to FDA to take into account the impact on small \n     business when the agency drafts its food safety regulations. \n     We also believe that there are merits to the provisions in \n     the amendment that has been crafted by Senator Jon Tester \n     that those small processors and farmers who sell most of \n     their products directly to consumers, restaurants, and other \n     local businesses should not be subject to all provisions of \n     the bill in light of the fact that the supply chain is very \n     short. It is our understanding that additional consumer \n     protections have been added to Senator Tester's\n\n[[Page S7402]]\n\n     amendment, so we strongly urge your support for its inclusion \n     in the final bill passed by the Senate,\n       We commend your efforts to bring this bill to the Senate \n     floor, This bill has enjoyed bipartisan support from its \n     inception and it is a credit to those who have taken a \n     leadership role in this legislation's development.\n       Should there be questions regarding this letter, please \n     feel free to contact me,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Wenonah Hauter,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Trust for America's Health,\n\n                                                September 8, 2010.\n     Senator Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin and Gregg: Trust for America's Health \n     (TFAH), a nonprofit, nonpartisan public health advocacy \n     organization, would like to express our strong support for \n     immediate Senate passage of the FDA Food Safety Modernization \n     Act (S. 510). Although every American depends on the safety \n     of the food they serve to their families, the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) lacks the tools to ensure that safety. \n     S. 510 would finally help bring the FDA into the 21st \n     century.\n       Approximately 76 million Americans--one in four--are \n     sickened by foodborne disease each year. Of these, an \n     estimated 325,000 are hospitalized and 5,000 die. A recent \n     study by Ohio State University found that foodborne illnesses \n     cost the U.S. economy an estimated $152 billion annually. \n     With multiple severe food outbreaks in recent years, it is \n     urgent that the Senate take this step to keep Americans safe.\n       The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act would place more \n     emphasis on prevention of foodborne illness and give the FDA \n     new authorities to address food safety problems. Under this \n     legislation, food processors would be required to identify \n     potential hazards in their production processes and implement \n     preventive programs to eliminate those hazards. Additionally, \n     the bill would require FDA to inspect all food facilities \n     more frequently and give FDA mandatory recall authority of \n     contaminated food. S. 510 is a bipartisan bill, with \n     widespread support from industry, consumer groups, and public \n     health organizations. The bill passed the Senate HELP \n     Committee with a unanimous voice vote, and food safety \n     legislation passed the House last year with overwhelming \n     bipartisan support.\n       We thank you for your strong leadership on this \n     legislation. If you have any questions, please do not \n     hesitate to contact TFAH's Government Relations Manager, Dara \n     Alpert Lieberman.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Jeffrey Levi, Ph.D,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Department of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                               September 10, 2010.\n       Dear Member of Congress, The events of the past two weeks \n     have illustrated a pattern that is all too familiar. Local \n     health officials around the country begin to see an uptick in \n     illnesses from a particular source. As they notify the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, epidemiologists \n     begin to see a pattern in the illness and outbreak reports, \n     identify a food as the likely cause, and notify the Food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA). FDA, state health and local \n     officials then deploy investigators across the country, \n     furiously searching for the source of the illness, knowing \n     that every day more people are getting sick, some seriously. \n     In the meantime, the public must be warned to avoid the food \n     of concern, creating anxiety for consumers and economic \n     losses for farmers, food processors and retailers.\n       This time we're seeing this pattern play out with \n     Salmonella Enteriditis in eggs, with illnesses in 22 states \n     and more than half a billion eggs being recalled. But in \n     recent years it has been spinach, salsa, peanut butter, bean \n     sprouts, cookie dough, green onions--the list goes on and on, \n     covering many of our most common foods. Many people are left \n     wondering: heading into the second decade of the 21st \n     century, why can't we prevent and react more effectively to \n     the threat from foodborne illness?\n       Sadly, the answer is simple. As President Obama said during \n     last year's peanut butter outbreak, caused by a different \n     form of Salmonella, we have a food safety regulatory system \n     designed early in the 20th century, one that must be \n     overhauled, modernized and strengthened for today.\n       Under the current system, FDA is often forced to chase food \n     contaminations after they have occurred, rather than \n     protecting the public from them in the first place. \n     Difficulties in tracking the movement of food from its origin \n     to its eventual sale to the public (often far across the \n     country) can frustrate efforts to identify contaminated food. \n     The biggest surprise to most people: FDA cannot order a \n     recall of contaminated food once it is found in the \n     marketplace. Although government has a crucial role in \n     ensuring the safety of our food supply, strong regulation has \n     been missing. An overhaul of our antiquated food safety \n     system is long overdue.\n       Proposed food safety legislation would give FDA better ways \n     to more quickly trace back contaminated products to the \n     source, the ability to check firms' safety records before \n     problems occur, clear authority to require firms to identify \n     and resolve food safety hazards, and resources to find \n     additional inspections and other oversight activities. \n     Pending legislation would also give the agency mandatory \n     recall authority, and other strong enforcement tools, like \n     new civil penalties and increased criminal penalties for \n     companies that fail to comply with safety requirements. In a \n     world where more and more food is imported, the legislation \n     also would strengthen FDA's ability to ensure the safety of \n     imported food.\n       The good news is that a bipartisan majority in the House of \n     Representatives passed major food safety legislation last \n     year that would move the United States from a reactive food \n     safety system to one focused on preventing illness. Likewise \n     in the Senate, a bipartisan coalition has developed a strong \n     food safety bill that is ready for the Senate floor. This \n     legislation has the support of a remarkably broad coalition \n     of public health, consumer and food industry groups. We \n     commend both chambers for their hard work.\n       Now it's time to finish the job. We encourage Senators to \n     support a critical and commonsense piece of public health \n     legislation. And, we urge the House and Senate to quickly \n     deliver a modern food safety bill to the President's desk. \n     It's time to break the pattern of foodborne illnesses and \n     economic loss. It's time to give FDA the modern tools and \n     resources it needs to meet the challenges of the 21st \n     century.\n\n                                            Kathleen Sebelius,\n\n                                   Secretary, Department of Health\n                                               and Human Services.\n                                        Margaret A.

Enzi,\n     Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi: On behalf of \n     the membership of the American Feed Industry Association \n     (AFIA), I write to commend your bipartisan efforts to craft \n     well-reasoned, science-based legislation to enhance FDA's \n     regulation of U.S. food safety. AFIA wishes you to know of \n     its strong support for S. 510, the FDA Food Safety \n     Modernization Act of 2009, as reported by the Senate \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions (HELP), a \n     bill we believe will provide FDA with authorities identified \n     as necessary to help prevent and, when necessary, deal with \n     food safety episodes.\n       AFIA is the only national trade association representing \n     the manufacturers of livestock, poultry and pet foods. Our \n     more than 500 member companies also include feed and pet food \n     industry ingredient suppliers, the animal health industry, \n     equipment manufacturers and those firms providing goods and \n     services to the industry. In addition, AFIA membership \n     includes more than two dozen state, regional, national and \n     international trade associations representing various facets \n     of the commercial feed and pet food industries.\n       Food safety is AFIA's number one priority. We strongly \n     support science-based approaches to improve the safety of \n     America's food system. Our commitment is reinforced through \n     AFIA's Safe Feed/Safe Food program, as well as through the \n     industry's third-party Feed Certification Institute (FCI), \n     efforts which help the industry consistently operate well \n     above FDA requirements. AFIA believes enhancements as \n     contained in S. 510 will help make a very good federal food \n     safety system even better.\n       AFIA pledges its effort to help you to quickly pass S. 510 \n     in the Senate, and will continue these efforts through \n     conference committee action with the House. AFIA looks \n     forward to working with Congress to enact this important food \n     safety legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Joel G. Newman,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2010.\n     Hon. Dick Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin and Senator Gregg: Consumer Federation \n     of America strongly supports passage of the FDA Food Safety \n     Modernization Act (S. 510). CFA is an association of nearly \n     300 nonprofit consumer organizations that was established in \n     1968 to advance the consumer interest through research, \n     advocacy and education.\n       Foodborne illness strikes tens of millions of Americans \n     each year, sends hundreds of thousands to the hospital, and \n     kills approximately 5,000 of us. The diseases are more than \n     ``just a bellyache.'' Many victims suffer long-term chronic \n     health problems including reactive arthritis, kidney failure \n     and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Children under the age of 5 are \n     the most frequent victims of foodborne illness. People over \n     age 60 are most likely to die after contracting a food-\n     related illness. The economic costs are enormous. A recent \n     study estimated the annual cost of all foodborne illnesses to \n     be $152 billion.\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\n       The suffering and heartbreak and deaths are pointless. \n     Foodborne diseases are almost entirely preventable. They \n     continue to rage because our nation's primary food safety \n     agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, operates under \n     the constraints of a 70-year-old law that is largely \n     extraneous to current threats to food safety. The Food, Drug \n     and Cosmetic Act does not give the FDA a specific statutory \n     mandate, appropriate program tools, adequate enforcement \n     authority or sufficient resources to stop foodborne disease \n     before it strikes us and our loved ones.\n       S. 510 changes the paradigm for fighting foodborne illness, \n     directing the FDA to prevent foodborne illness rather than \n     just reacting to reports of illnesses and deaths. It requires \n     food companies to establish processing controls to avoid food \n     contamination, gives the FDA authority to set food safety \n     standards, and requires the Agency to inspect food processing \n     plants regularly to assure controls are working as intended.\n       On behalf of CFA's millions of members, we thank you for \n     your strong leadership in developing S. 510 and your \n     determination to ensure its passage. We look forward to \n     continuing to work with you to get a final bill to the \n     President as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carol L. Tucker-Foreman,\n       Distinguished Fellow, Food Policy Institute.\n     Chris Waldrop,\n       Director, Food Policy Institute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, \nfor his kind words and also for his great leadership on the HELP \nCommittee. We have a big area we cover--health, education, labor, and \npensions--and we have a lot of bills we are working on. I am pleased at \nthe bipartisan way we are able to work on them, his staff and my staff. \nActually, the members of the committee are very engaged on the issues \nwe are covering, and they are very important issues for America.\n\n\n                              MINE SAFETY\n\n  Madam President, I came to the floor to talk about a little different \nissue than what we have been talking about, but it is another issue for \nthe HELP Committee. This one comes under that category of labor. It is \nsafety--mine safety.\n  The reason I am on the floor is, I have seen some articles appearing \nin different parts of the United States that are inaccurate on what is \nhappening on mine safety, and so I wish to take a moment to clear up \nsome of that confusion that has been caused by a breakdown in \nbipartisan negotiations on the mine safety legislation in this last \nweek.\n  The terrible tragedy that occurred in West Virginia this past April \nagain focused us on the strength of our Federal mine safety laws and \nregulations. My State leads the Nation in coal production. We do about \n40 percent of all the Nation's coal, and my county accounts for most of \nthat. We have 92 trains a day that leave our county. That is over 1 \nmillion tons of coal a day.\n  I have always considered workplace safety as one of the most \nimportant missions of the HELP Committee. The first bill I did was on \nOSHA. I have been pleased to work across the aisle to improve safety, \nand that is exactly what I have tried to do this year, as well, with my \ncolleagues from West Virginia and members of the committee under the \ndirection of Chairman Harkin, who has been very helpful on this.\n  As my colleagues well know, negotiations had been making significant \nprogress until we ran into the stumbling block known as the election \ncycle. The staffs of seven Senators have been meeting several times a \nweek for over 2 months, and all through the recess period. Agreements \nhad been formed on over a dozen important proposals. I think there were \n14 that they were in agreement on, 7 more we were waiting for approval \nto see if there was agreement or if there were more changes needed. \nThen there were five or six that the Senators themselves had to work \nout. Several of those important ones were right on the brink of \ncompromise or agreement when the talks were abruptly called off until \nafter the election.\n\n  Despite what has been said in the press and on the floor, the simple \nfact is that we might well have had an agreement right now if all the \npeople were to have stayed at the table and decided this did not need \nto be an election issue. This very process of requesting unanimous \nconsent on a bill, which could happen, would not even be on the bill we \nhave been working on. It would be on one that was introduced before \nthis process came into being. Everyone knows that would not have \nsufficient support to pass as part of political theater.\n  Certainly it is not for me to consult on the political calculations \nof my colleagues, but it seems to me that political theater and failure \nto work together to get important things such as this done is exactly \nwhat the American people are so frustrated about this year. That is \nwhat all the passions are about.\n  We are serving this Nation best when we work together to accomplish \nthe people's business. The formula is not that complicated. Anybody can \ndo it. You just have to bring both sides together for discussions, you \nhave to establish agreed-upon goals and work toward agreement on those \ngoals, you have to consult with stakeholders who will be affected by \nthe changes being discussed--that is anybody who is going to be \naffected. Then, once substantial agreement has been reached, you have \nto determine which issues the sides will never be able to agree upon \nand set those apart for another day's debate. That is what I call my \n80-20 rule.\n  There are some issues in every topic we talk about here that have \nalready been talked about so long that both sides are already so \npolarized that if you mention one word with that particular issue, \neverybody plunges into the weeds and states the same arguments they \nhave always done without listening to what the other side is saying. I \nhave found you can work through those issues as well, as long as you \ncan get people back up to the surface, out of the weeds, and get them \nto figure out something that allows both sides to save face. Yes, there \nis that problem around here, too. This formula has worked in the past \nfor the very issue we are discussing today, which is mine safety.\n  In 2006, when I was the chairman of the HELP committee, we were faced \nwith a string of tragic mine accidents in West Virginia. In response to \nthe first one, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Kennedy and I organized \na trip to the Sago mine in West Virginia to meet with the miners, to \nmeet with the victims' families, and to meet with the investigators. \nThe three of us, along with Senators Isakson, Murray, and Byrd, then \nbegan negotiations. We were able to come up with an agreement in less \nthan 2 months. It was called the MINER Act. It was the first major \nrevision of the Mine Safety and Health Act since 1977. That has to be \nsome kind of a record around here, but it was important and it was \nworked in a bipartisan way. That was done through a recess period as \nwell.\n  Agreements have been formed on over a dozen important proposals, as I \nmentioned. Others are very close to an agreement. I am hoping that \npeople will come back to the table, work through the time until \nelections are over and get this finished.\n  The MINER Act made important improvements to the emergency \npreparedness of underground mines--this one for the Sago mine--and has \nfostered tremendous improvements, particularly in communications \ntechnology adaptability to the underground environment. We are talking \nabout being able to talk through several hundred feet, in some cases \n1000 feet of granite. If you ever try to get a cell phone to work \nthrough a mountain or building, you will see what kind of problem they \nhave. But tremendous improvements have been made because there is a \nmarket for it, mining is increasing, and the safety is essential. And \nwe made it a part of that Miner Act.\n  One of the reasons I am so proud of the Miner Act is that we wrote it \nin the way I believe all legislation should be drafted. We brought in \nall of the stakeholders. We brought in the union, we brought in the \nnonunion people, we brought in the industry, we brought in the safety \nexperts, and we brought in the investigators. The Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration and all of these people sat around a table and \nworked through the biggest safety concerns and the best way to approach \nthem. Because of the bipartisan nature of the bill, it sailed through a \ncommittee markup, it was passed by the Senate\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\nunanimously a week later--that is as bipartisan as you can get--and it \npassed the House 2 weeks later, and there were only 37 House Members \nout of 435 opposing it. One more week later it was signed into law. \nThat is how laws get done and make a difference.\n  During my tenure as the chairman of the HELP committee we were able \nto move 27 bills to enactment that way. In total we reported 35 bills \nout of committee and of those 35, 25 passed the Senate. We ran out of \ntime on the others or we would have gotten those, too. That is the kind \nof cooperation and accomplishment Americans are demanding, especially \non an issue as important and timely as workplace safety. Every day, \nthousands of Americans go to work in the energy production industry. \nThe work they do benefits every single one of us and underpins our \nentire economy. This year, major accidents in the energy producing \nsector have taken the lives of 29 men in West Virginia, 6 in \nConnecticut, 7 in Washington State, 3 in Texas, and 11 off the coast of \nLouisiana.\n  If there were ever a time to work together to actually enact \nlegislation, as opposed to playing political theater, this should be \nit.\n  It can be done. There is progress being made. My staff has not walked \naway from the table and I resent any articles that say that. I am \nimpressed and in agreement with the agreements that have been made so \nfar. I keep constant track of those. It should not take very long to \nfinish the six or seven that are very close to being resolved and then \nit should not take very long for the Members to sit down and resolve \nthe ones that are left after that.\n  We can have a mine safety bill. We cannot have it this week. I am \nsure we cannot have it next week. The House has already done a mine \nsafety bill so we have to conference that. It is going to take a little \nbit of time, although for the bill we are working on, I think, and in a \nbipartisan way, it could be done unanimously on this side. The Senate \nwould then do it unanimously, and it is very likely for the House to \nfollow very closely--follow suit and finish it up very well. I think \nthat is what the American people expect.\n  Articles about things falling apart are not nearly as useful as \nkeeping people together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7404-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7404-S7405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FOOD SAFETY\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, as I listened to my friend from \nWyoming, I was thinking, ``Ditto for the food safety bill.'' This is a \nbill for which there is vast bipartisan support. There always has been, \nfrom the moment it was introduced with four Democratic Senators, \nincluding myself, and four Republican Senators. Of course, the bill has \nbeen led by Senator Durbin from the very beginning, and Senator Harkin \nhas played a key role. This has been a bipartisan bill. Given that we \nhave only seen more foodborne illness outbreaks over the last few \nmonths, there is no reason we should not pass this bill. I rise today \nto urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I have stood here many times in support of the food safety bill. Part \nof this is because we had a very tragic thing happen in our State. We \nhad three people die after the peanut butter that came out of Georgia, \nthat peanut plant in Georgia. Three of the people who died were from \nMinnesota. One of them was named Shirley Almer. Her family expected her \nhome for Christmas in 2008. She was a strong-spirited 72-year-old \ngrandmother from Perham, MN. She had survived 2 bouts of cancer but she \nwas actually recovering and doing quite well in recovery with a brief \nstay in a nursing home.\n  But she didn't make it home for Christmas that year. She died on \nDecember 21, 2008. It wasn't the cancer that killed her. She had \nbattled that cancer. In fact, it was a little piece of peanut butter on \nher toast that 72-year-old grandmother ate. She didn't know it, but the \npeanut butter was contaminated with deadly salmonella bacteria. Shirley \nAlmer and two other Minnesotans are among the 9 deaths officially \nrelated to peanut products, which also sickened nearly 700 people \nnationwide, many of them children. Shirley's son Jeff has stepped \nforward as a strong voice calling for reform of our food safety system.\n  Whether it is jalapeno peppers or peanut butter or, most recently, \neggs, these outbreaks of foodborne illness and nationwide recalls of \ncontaminated food highlight the need to better protect our Nation's \nfood supply.\n  The good news is we know how to protect our Nation's food supply and \nwe have legislation sitting on the table, literally sitting on the \ntable, that could go a long way toward doing that. Sadly, that \nlegislation has been stalled in the Senate since last November and now, \nas far as I understand, our colleague from Oklahoma has some concerns \nand at this late hour it is still stalled.\n  We know we can not afford any more delays. As one of the lead \nsponsors of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, I believe the Senate \nhas every reason to pass this legislation. It is comprehensive. It \ncovers everything from ensuring a safe food supply at the front end to \nensuring a rapid response if tainted food gets into the supply chain. \nAs I mentioned, it is bipartisan. You know what else about this \nlegislation, which doesn't always happen with food safety consumer \nprotection legislation? This has the support not only of consumer \ngroups, not only of health groups, it has the support of many in the \nfood industry including SUPERVALU, a very large food chain including \nCub Foods, located in Minnesota.\n  I did an event back in Minnesota with the CEO of SUPERVALU a few \nweeks ago on this issue. Why do our businesses care? Of course they \ncare because they want to have safe food for the consumers. They also \ncare because this is hurting their bottom line, when there are these \nscares that encompass food and people are scared. We were standing \nthere and a woman went by and said, I don't know if I want to buy eggs \nand the CEO said, you know what, not one egg was recalled from our huge \nfood stores all over the country--Cub Foods, SUPERVALU--not one egg, \nbut consumers don't always know that. But when you have a bad actor, \nwhen you have one company, one factory as you had in Georgia, it can \nruin it for everyone--consumers, obviously tragic for them, tragic \ninjuries, but it also hurts the bottom line for these businesses that \nhave not done anything wrong.\n  Hormel, the maker of Spam, was standing with us at SUPERVALU that \nday, talking about how important it was. General Mills, Schwans support \nthis bill. We have widespread support in our food industry because they \ndon't want to see another person get sick from tainted food.\n  Finally, we all know this legislation addresses a very serious issue. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, foodborne disease causes \nabout 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths \nin the United States each year. Yet, for every foodborne illness case \nthat is reported, it is estimated that as many as 40 more illnesses are \nnot reported or confirmed by a lab because people simply don't know why \nthey got sick. The annual costs of medical care, lost productivity, and \npremature deaths due to foodborne illnesses is estimated to be $44 \nbillion.\n  There is a lot at stake here, a lot at stake for human life, and \nthere is a lot at stake for the economy. As you know, 2 years ago, \nhundreds of people across the country suddenly got sick with \nsalmonella. Once it hit Minnesota, and once people died in Minnesota, \nsadly, it took only a few days before the University of Minnesota and \nthe Minnesota Health Department, our ``food detectives'' as they are \ncalled, or ``team diarrhea''--which my staff didn't want me to say on \nthe Senate floor but that is what we call them--worked together and \nthey were able to solve this. How do they do it? Simple detective work. \nThey simply called the families and homes of people who had gotten \nsick, people who had gotten very sick, they talked to their loved ones: \nWhere did they eat? When did they eat? What did they eat?\n  They literally solved it in a matter of days. One State solved the \njalapeno pepper problem--Minnesota. One state solved the Georgia peanut \nproblem. That was Minnesota. That is why there is something to be \nlearned from the model we used in our State.\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\n  That is why I included it in the Food Safety Modernization Act and \nwhy it is supported by so many people and so many grocery stores across \nthe country as well as consumer groups, the bill I introduced with \nSenator Chambliss of Georgia, the Food Safety Rapid Response Act. \nBuilding on successful efforts at detecting and investigating foodborne \nillnesses, this will strengthen the ability of the Federal and State \nand local officials to quickly investigate and respond to foodborne \nillness outbreaks.\n  I am proud to have Senator Chambliss, from the State of Georgia, that \nhad to have this experience. When it was finally discovered where this \ncame from, it was from one company, one bad actor in their State. He \nwas willing to come with me on this bill because we said enough is \nenough. We have to put prevention in there, which is in this bill, to \nstop these things from ever happening. But if it does happen, you want \nto solve it as quickly as possible so you don't get more people getting \nsick and dying.\n  What this part of the bill does, the part Senator Chambliss and I \nintroduced, it directs the CDC to enhance the Nation's foodborne \nsurveillance systems by improving collection, analysis, reporting, and \nusefulness of data on foodborne illness.\n  This includes better sharing of information among Federal, State, and \nlocal agencies, as well as with the food industry and the public. It \ndirects the Centers for Disease Control to work with State-level \nagencies to improve foodborne illness surveillance.\n  Finally, the legislation establishes food safety centers of \nexcellence. The goal is to set up these food safety centers at select \npublic health departments and higher education institutions around the \ncountry. It takes the Minnesota example across the country, first with \nfive centers--not to directly tell each State exactly what to do but to \nbe an example of best practices for a region of the country.\n  Not many bills that come before Congress enjoy such a wide range of \nsupport from some important stakeholders. Not only do consumers \nrecognize the critical need for this major bill, but the legislation \nhas received support from major brand-name food companies. They know \nwhat is at stake. Their reputation and their bottom line depends on the \ntrust of their customers, the trust that everything possible is being \ndone to make sure their food is safe.\n  As a former prosecutor like yourself, Mr. President, I have always \nbelieved the first responsibility of government is to protect its \ncitizens. In this most basic duty, our government failed Shirley Almer \nand many others who have been harmed by recent recalls. We owe it to \nthem and all Americans to fix what is broken in our food safety system.\n  We can do a lot better with our food safety system. That is why we \nneed to pass this legislation now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico.) The Senator from \nOhio is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7405-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7405-S7407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              OUTSOURCING\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I appreciate the comments of Senator Klobuchar, \nwho has been a leader on moving forward on this legislation on food \nsafety. It is so important to our country. I am so sorry that pretty \nmuch one obstructionist, or a whole party of obstructionists, \nunfortunately, have blocked this bill, and one Senator in particular \nhas kept us from moving on this bipartisan bill. It is one of the sad \nchapters of this Senate that a small minority, again, can block us from \ndoing the things we ought to do in our jobs, what we ought to be doing.\n  I want to talk for a moment about some positive developments in my \nState. A couple of weeks ago I went to Lordstown, OH. It has a General \nMotors plant. I believe Governor Strickland was asked to drive the \nfirst red Cruze, Chevy Cruze, their highest mileage new car, off the \nline, followed by a white Cruze and a blue Cruze. You know the \nsymbolism of that and the beauty of that and the inspiration of that in \nmany ways was all about what has happened in the last 18\\1/2\\ months to \nthe auto industry.\n  I am particularly proud. I do not come to the floor and endorse one \nparticular company ever. I am not doing that. I am proud of this \nbecause of what it looked like a year and a half ago.\n  Now, 18 months ago we remember what happened: Barack Obama took the \noath of office. The banks had about imploded. We knew the financial \nsystem was close to collapse. We knew the auto industry was facing \nbankruptcy.\n  President Obama took office in the midst of losing 700,000 jobs a \nmonths. President Bush was leaving office, having left us--the largest \nin history at that time--the largest budget deficit in the history of \nthe United States of America. That is what we started with 18\\1/2\\ \nmonths ago.\n  When you think about what it meant in the auto industry--I know my \nState is considered an auto State. New Mexico may not be, but New \nMexico has some number of component manufacturers and a lot of car \ndealerships.\n  The car dealerships in Taos or Albuquerque or Truth or Consequences \nor anywhere necessarily in the State are often so involved in the \ncommunity: helping Little League, helping scholarships, all of the \nkinds of things the good citizens, especially auto dealers, do. But I \nthink about what this meant.\n  So 18 months ago when this auto industry was about to crash, \nliterally--pardon the pun--what it would have meant in my State, it \nwould have meant tens of thousands of retirees would have possibly lost \nsignificant amounts of pension and health care they had as 25-, 30-, \n40-year employees of General Motors or Chrysler.\n  We know it would have meant a huge number of lost jobs, thousands of \nlost jobs, just in the auto companies, let alone all of the suppliers, \nwhat are called tier 1 suppliers, tier 2 suppliers, those small \ncompanies, small- and medium-sized companies that are suppliers. They \nare machine shops, tool-and-die makers, stamping plants, all kinds of \ncompanies that make components that go into the auto industry, that go \ninto the trucks and the cars. They would have gone out of business.\n  We knew all of this was about to happen. Because of the Recovery Act, \nand because this government decided, President Obama and the Democrats \nin the House and Senate--in spite of the naysayers, in spite of the \npeople out there who said: Let the market work; if the auto industry \ncollapses, it is the market speaking. Just let the market work. Let the \nfree market work. If we had listened to them, listened to the \nnaysayers, listened to the people who are the doom-and-gloom crowd, my \nState would have gone into a depression. We would have lost thousands \nof auto jobs. Senior citizens relying on those pensions and health care \nwould have been, in many cases, abandoned. The dealerships, the \ncomponent manufacturers, and the auto company employees themselves \nwould have been out of work.\n  As I said, we did not listen to the conservative politicians and say: \nLet the market work. We did not listen to the naysayers. We did not \nlisten to the doom-and-gloom crowd who said: It is not our problem. The \nFederal Government has no business.\n  Well, the fact is, the Federal Government invested in the auto \nindustry. Instead of losing 700,000 jobs a month, as we were when \nPresident Obama took office 18, 19 months ago, we are now gaining jobs. \nWe have gained jobs in this country in the private sector for 7 or 8 \nstraight months. Not enough, not even close to what we want to do in \nNew Mexico or Ohio or any other State, but clearly we have seen some \ngood things happen.\n  What has happened in the auto industry is particularly interesting. \nAt this GM plant in Lordstown, right where I was--and I have been there \nmany times, where I was a couple of weeks ago with Governor \nStrickland--we have seen--there are 4,500 people working in that plant \nnow. They just added 1,100 jobs to do the third shift of the Chevrolet \nCruze. But what is particularly great about that, if you are the \nSenator from Ohio, is in Defiance, OH, western Ohio, near the Indiana \nborder, is where they make the engines for the Chevy Cruze.\n\n  If you travel northeast of there to a Toledo suburb called Northwood, \nthat is where they make the bumpers for the Chevy Cruze. If you go into \nthe city of Toledo, that is where they make the transmission for the \nChevy Cruze. Then you go east to Parma, OH, that is where they stamped \nmost of the components for the Chevy Cruze.\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\n  Then you drive east to the Youngstown area, Mahoney Valley to \nLordstown. They do some of the stamping, and that is where they do the \nassembly. So hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of new jobs were \ncreated--well, thousands--up and down the supply chain, from the most \nbasic bolt, the most basic component in an engine or the most basic \ncomponent in a car door or anywhere else in that car, to the ultimate \nassembly in Lordstown. It means thousands of jobs.\n  Again, if we had listened to the doom-and-gloom crowd and the \nnaysayers, it never would have happened. We also need to learn from \nhistory. When government is in partnership with the private sector, \nwith private businesses and communities, some pretty good things can \nhappen. Just take this for a moment.\n  For 8 years, January 1993 to January 2001, President Clinton, during \nhis time as President, we saw a 22 million private net increase, 22 \nmillion job increase.\n  We also saw wages go up in this country, and President Clinton left \nus with the largest budget surplus in American history: 22 million \njobs, an increase in wages, largest budget surplus in American history.\n  In the next 8 years, January 20, 2001, to January 20 at noon, 2009, \nthose 8 years of President Bush, 1 million jobs increased, 1 million, \nnot even enough to take care of our sons and daughter who have \ngraduated from high school and are entering the workforce, coming out \nof the Army, coming out of high school, coming out of college, not even \nenough to absorb the population growth.\n  Wages were actually flat or went down for the great majority of \nAmericans during those 8 years, and President Bush left us with record \nbudget deficits. So 22 million jobs, 1 million jobs, incomes went up, \nincomes flat and went down, biggest budget surplus in American history, \nrecord budget deficit under the Bush years.\n  So if you go back further, you hear the Republicans, my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, talk about this philosophy: Cut taxes on \nthe rich, and you cut taxes on corporations, you are going to have job \ngrowth. Well, nice try. It is not what happened.\n  After the Ronald Reagan tax cuts for the rich in 1981, the next 16 \nmonths we had declining employment in this country, 16 months in a row \nof lost jobs after this tax cut, which was going to make the economy \ntake off. Fast-forward 1993, President Clinton. He had some tax \nincreases on the wealthiest taxpayers. He also had some budget cuts, \nand he moved toward a balanced budget.\n  Employment took off--22 million jobs. President Bush, 2001, big tax \ncuts for the rich in 2001, big tax cuts for the rich in 2003, basically \nno real significant increase in jobs during those 8 years. Now, the \nmantra of the Republicans, those who are on the ballot this year and \nthose who sit across the aisle from me, again, is, let's do more tax \ncuts because that increases jobs.\n  It does not. What increases jobs is investment in education, \ninvestment in health care, investment in infrastructure, reducing the \ndeficits--all the things that Republicans pay lipservice to but in the \nend simply do not deliver on.\n  We have an opportunity next Monday. This coming Monday, we are going \nto bring a bill to the floor that is the other part of this: How do we \ncreate jobs? That is, we are going to begin to finally move to fix some \nof our tax laws, and then next will be some of our trade laws so that \nwe quit losing so many jobs to China.\n  Mr. President, 30 percent of our GDP in 1980 was manufacturing, \nalmost 30 percent. Now it is down to 11 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. A big part of that is trade policy, which the Presiding \nOfficer opposed when he was in the House of Representatives, PNTR with \nChina and the Central American Free Trade Agreement, and before that, \nwhen I was in the House, my first year, the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, which we opposed.\n  Those trade agreements, coupled with tax law, has encouraged \ncompanies to move overseas. Those days have to be behind us. What we \nare going to do on Monday night is vote on legislation that will begin \nto turn the corner, will begin to take away those tax incentives for \ncompanies to go overseas and replace them with tax incentives for \nbusinesses that manufacture in Shelby, OH, and in Ravenna, OH, and \nZanesville, Ohio, and all over this country.\n  At the same time, President Obama, the first President in years in \neither party, is beginning to enforce trade law. We know what that \nmeant in Findlay, OH, when he enforced trade laws with the \nInternational Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, on \nChinese tires that had been dumped, sold illegally into this country.\n  When President Obama enforced those trade rules against the breaking \nof the law that the Chinese Government did, immediately we saw several \nhundred jobs created--100 of them in Findlay, OH--several hundred jobs \ncreated all over the country.\n  When the President did the same thing on something called oil country \ntubular steel--it is the steel, the seamless steel pipes, these tubes \nthat are used for oil and gas drilling--we immediately saw a \ncommitment, an investment, which will result in 400 jobs in Mahoning \nValley in northeast Ohio, and a good many jobs in Lorain, OH, a city I \nlived in for a decade west of Cleveland on Lake Erie.\n  We were able to do that because, finally, it is the Democrats, \nworking with President Obama, who are enforcing trade law and beginning \nto change tax policy so we see job creation.\n  I do not care where you live in this country. People are just sick \nand tired of not being able to find American-made products. This is \nmade in China. This is made in India. This is made in Brazil. This is \nmade in Honduras. This is made in Bangladesh. Nothing against those \ncountries, but oftentimes, especially the Chinese, their government is \ngaming the system. They are not playing fair on trade. We need a whole \ndifferent trade regimen. We need a whole different tax system so \nAmerican companies are no longer going to China to find cheap labor, \nweak environmental rules, unenforced worker safety rules, and can \nproduce and then send it back to America.\n  I think this is the first time since colonial days where the business \ncommunity, where a lot of large manufacturing companies--and I make the \ndistinction between large and small because small manufacturing \ncompanies do not do this but the large manufacturing companies. Ten \nyears ago they came to lobby Congress to pass the permanent normal \ntrade relations with China. Ten years ago this month the Senate, for \nall intents and purposes, sold out American manufacturing. They passed \nPNTR, it was called. It used to be called most favored nation status \nwith China. They changed the name because it did not sound very good.\n  Congress passed that 10 years ago. What that has meant is our trade \ndeficit with China has almost tripled in that period of time. What the \nbusiness community has done, the large companies have done, is this: \nThey lobbied to change the rules. Then they moved production from St. \nClairsville, OH, and Portsmouth, OH, and Springfield, OH, to Shanghai \nand Wuhan and Beijing, and Huang Jo, China, to make those products. \nThen they sold them back to the United States.\n  I don't think since colonial times that large companies in one \ncountry have adopted that kind of business plan where you move \nproduction out of your country, make it somewhere else, add all that \nvalue to those products, and then sell them back into the home country \nwhere the corporation headquarters is located. It doesn't make sense \nfor us. It means far too many lost jobs.\n  I will give an example. There is an industry in which many Ohio \ncompanies are involved, the paper industry. There is a specific kind of \npaper called a glossy paper used in magazines. China didn't have that \nindustry. It is called coated paper. Twelve years ago China did not \nhave a coated paper industry. They began it similar to the last decade \nwhen they built wind and solar, clean energy industries, and somehow \nstarted to lead the world, as we have unilaterally disarmed. Now they \nbuy most of their pulp in Brazil. So they grow the trees, cut down the \ntrees in Brazil. They ship the wood to Chinese paper mills. They \nmanufacture the coated paper in China. They ship it back to the United \nStates. They underprice American paper companies\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\nwhich buy the wood sometimes within a few miles or a few hundred miles \nof where they are, which tells me, even though wages are less in China, \neven though they don't have much enforcement of environmental rules or \nworker safety rules, they are gaming the system with currency, with \nsubsidies, free land, all the kinds of things the Chinese Communist \nGovernment does.\n  Until we enforce trade laws so we play fair and compete, we will \ncontinue to lose manufacturing jobs. That is why Monday night is an \nimportant first step as this Senate moves forward on dealing with the \nproblem of outsourcing jobs. There are few things we can do in this \nbody more important than beginning to rebuild manufacturing. We know \nhow to make things. My State is the third largest manufacturing State \nin the country, behind only California and Texas, which are two and \nthree times the size of Ohio in population. We know how to make big and \nlittle things. We have the largest ketchup manufacturing plant in the \nworld in Freemont. We have the largest insulation company making \nfiberglass anywhere in the United States in Newark. We know how to make \nthings in our State. We just need the opportunity, a level playing \nfield, tax law and trade law that puts the United States of America on \na level playing field. We know we can compete with anybody. We just \nneed the opportunity.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7407-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7407-S7409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about two basic topics \ntoday. But first, for today, in light of the news that so many people \nhave been discussing today and reporting on today, which is the \nimplementation today of some parts of our health care bill, the \nAffordable Care Act, which we passed back in March after many months of \ndebate and work on that legislation, one of the most popular but \nessential elements to that bill was a whole series of consumer \nprotections which in some ways does not fully describe what they are. I \nwould rather use the phrase ``family safeguards,'' to give families \nsome peace of mind not just on the broader question of insurance \ncoverage for those who get sick and need coverage. We all need health \ninsurance at some point in our life, sometimes more than others, but \nespecially if you are a child with a preexisting condition.\n  For so many years we have allowed a system to say to that child and \nto his or her family: We know you have a preexisting condition. It \nmight be something serious and life threatening, but the system does \nnot allow you to be covered for one reason or another.\n  Finally, at long last, in 2010, we said no to that denial. So now we \nare able to say that fear that a child would feel, especially his or \nher family, can now have peace of mind to know that if a child in the \nUnited States has a preexisting condition, that will not be a bar to \ncoverage, therefore, to treatment. Of course, it also impacts adults. \nWe have seen stories about adults who will benefit from the bill on the \npreexisting condition problem that so many people find themselves in. \nThe implementation of the children's provisions goes into effect now. \nThe adults will come later. But even in the short run, the bill allowed \nfor and developed a high risk pool, even for adults with preexisting \nconditions. Of course, the full protection won't be in effect for a \ncouple of years. But at least and at long last children will have that \nprotection.\n  The other protections among what I call family safeguards are some \nbasic protections that we should all have a right to expect but, \nunfortunately, a lot of families haven't had these protections. For \nexample, preventing insurance companies from arbitrarily throwing \npeople off their insurance coverage or denying them coverage for \nreasons that do not make a lot of sense, but I guess they made sense to \nbig profitable insurance companies over many years. They won't be able \nto do that any longer. They will not be able to put lifetime limits on \none's coverage or treatment. The limits annual in nature will be more \nlimited. It will be more difficult for insurance companies to place \nannual limits.\n  One of the provisions that has received a lot of attention and speaks \nright to a need a lot of families have is when a young person, say \nsomeone who is finishing college and needs some coverage between the \ntime they are in college and the time they reach the age of 26, they \nwill now be covered. So if we go down the list, it is a long and \nsubstantial and significant set of consumer protections which does \nprovide some degree of safeguard and some degree of peace of mind to \nour families.\n  Unfortunately, in the midst of all that, in that ocean of good news \non these consumer protections, we have some bad news which is \ndisturbing. When we were debating health insurance in Washington and \naround the country, we would have a lot of fights with insurance \ncompanies. Some of them came around and worked to pass the bill. Some \ndid not.\n  But there was an attempt to work together constructively to develop \ngood legislation.\n  Well, unfortunately, a few--not all but a few--took a step the other \nday which was outrageous, insulting, egregious, and harmful to what we \nare trying to do to make sure children and families have that peace of \nmind I spoke of earlier.\n  Several health insurance companies have announced they are going to \nstop offering child-only health insurance plans because they are no \nlonger allowed to discriminate against children with preexisting \nconditions, such as, for example, asthma, just to name one.\n  Why would insurance companies do that? Right before this provision \ngoes into effect, at the eleventh hour so to speak, they start dropping \nthis kind of coverage. It puts hundreds of thousands of children at \nrisk. The Obama administration estimates that 100,000 to 700,000 \nchildren could be affected by these changes.\n  I believe it will be outrageous if one child is affected by this--\nliterally one child--when we have provisions going into effect that are \ngoing to at long last protect kids; that a couple insurance companies \nthat make a tremendous profit--which I will get to in a moment--take \nthis step to change their strategy as it relates to kids. Many of the \nchildren who will be affected by this adverse decision by these few \ninsurance companies are in families who are struggling just to get by \nnow and cannot afford to pay for insurance for their whole family, but \nthey are trying to keep their kids insured.\n  A lot of parents do that all the time. They forego their own coverage \nand their own health care and sometimes, literally, their own health in \norder to protect their children, in order to provide a child with some \ntreatment, some care, some protection. Yet we have these few insurance \ncompanies that are taking this action, which is outrageous and \ndisturbing, and that is an understatement.\n  Several of the companies that have decided to take this action--this \naction that is harmful to America's children--some of these companies \nhave operations in States such as Pennsylvania. Aetna is one of them. \nThe companies that have decided to stop offering health insurance to \nchildren are few. I mentioned Aetna. Another is Cigna and another is \nAnthem Blue Cross. As we know, Anthem Blue Cross is owned by WellPoint.\n  Listen to this: In 2009, these three health insurance companies that \nare discontinuing their child-only plans had $7.3 billion in profits. \nThat is not gross revenue, folks. That is profit, $7.3 billion. \nWellPoint, which owns Anthem Blue Cross, $4.7 billion in profits; \nAetna, $1.2 billion in profits; and, finally, Cigna, $1.3 billion in \nprofits. They are firms that are doing this, taking this action just \nbefore today's provisions to protect kids on preexisting conditions \ntake effect.\n  So it is my hope--and I believe they will do this--the Department of \nHealth and Human Services will take every step necessary to have this \ndecision by these companies reversed. I hope there is some way to \nsanction or punish insurance companies that do that. I am not sure that \nis possible. There are a lot of debates about what can be done. But I \nwould hope--short of action by a\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\nFederal agency or short of action by a State government authority or \nagency--these insurance companies would rethink their policy, rethink \nthe action they took, which will be harmful to children because if they \ndo not, it calls into question their commitment to what we have been \ntrying to do in this country for a long time. We finally got over the \nhump, so to speak, and passed legislation not only to cover more than \n30 million Americans but at long last to provide coverage and support \nfor children.\n  Of course, one thing we found out in the health care debate last year \nwas, this is not just a debate about the uninsured--the more than 30 \nmillion who will be covered--this is as much a debate about the \ninsured, the more than 80 percent of Americans who had insurance \ncoverage but not the protections they should have a right to expect. \nThat is why we needed these consumer protections on preexisting \nconditions, on protecting families from being thrown off arbitrarily--\nthe annual limits, the lifetime limits--all of those features that we \nhad to get enacted into law because that was the way to protect people \nwith insurance coverage who thought they had more protection than they \nreally did.\n  So I hope this is just an egregious example and a decision that was \nimplemented by these health insurance companies that will be, in fact, \nreversed because, as I said before, if it is not reversed, it does call \ninto question what these insurance companies that are taking this step \nare all about.\n  Are they for record profits or are they going to try to help our \nfamilies in a reasonable way?\n  We are not asking them to do something that is unreasonable or \ninconsistent with their business model or inconsistent with having a \nprofit. We are just saying: Why don't you do what all the others are \ntrying to do? Why don't you do what the American people expect you to \ndo, which is to take every step necessary to protect our kids, \nespecially children who are vulnerable and do not have lobbyists \nstanding up to fight their battles and do not have a lot of campaign \nmoney in the middle of an election year? Vulnerable children--unless \nsomeone in one of the two Houses of Congress stands up to fight for \nthem, or somebody in the administration--do not have much power around \nhere. So I would hope these insurance companies would rethink that \ndecision, and we are waiting and watching to see what they will do.\n\n\n                              Unemployment\n\n  Mr. President, let me just shift gears quickly. I know we have \nlimited time, but I did want to talk a little bit about the job \nsituation that confronts so many families, so many communities in our \ncountry, as well as some steps that have been taken recently to help \ndeal with the unemployment rate and the economic circumstances we find \nourselves in.\n  In Pennsylvania, we have hovered around 590,000 people out of work \nfor many months now. Fortunately, it has dipped a little below 590,000. \nBut when you are getting close to 600,000 people out of work in a State \nsuch as Pennsylvania, people are really hurting. Our rate does not tell \nthe story. We have been below 10 percent for a while, but almost \n600,000 people out of work is a horrific nightmare for those families \nin a lot of communities.\n  I spent, as a lot of Members in the Senate, several weeks in August \nand September traveling to many communities in Pennsylvania. I got to a \nlittle more than 30 counties, and it was remarkable but also disturbing \nto see the breadth and the scope of the unemployment problem in a State \nsuch as Pennsylvania.\n  Some parts of the State are doing better than others in keeping us \nbelow 10 percent unemployment, but there are so many communities where \nthere is a very high rural population--a lot of small towns--having \nvery high unemployment rates.\n  Just to give a couple examples of places I visited that are smaller \ncommunities or smaller counties and to some degree or another largely \nrural--sometimes 100 percent rural or at least half by the way they \ncategorize them demographically--Cambria County, where Johnstown, PA, \nis, always has had a high unemployment rate. They are at 10 percent, \npersistently at that level. In that county that means 7,000 people were \nout of work, and that is as of the July numbers. I have not seen the \nlatest, but it is in that category; Clarion County, a place I visited \nas well, almost 10.5 percent, with 2,200 people out of work in that \ncommunity; Forest County, a very small county by way of population, \nright in the north central region of our State, 10.6 percent \nunemployment; Jefferson County, a larger but still not a big urban or \nmetropolitan community, that county has almost 2,500 people out of \nwork, over 10 percent unemployment; Lawrence County, Lehigh County, \nLuzerne County--all above 10 percent unemployment. Luzerne County is \nright next to Lackawanna County, where I live. It is approaching 11 \npercent.\n\n  But then here are the ones that probably tell the story best.\n  Philadelphia is now at about 12 percent unemployment. The rate is \nvery high. When we are hovering around 12 percent in that city, we have \nalmost 75,000 people out of work--in just one city in Pennsylvania, \n75,000 individuals out of work.\n  Then we go to north central Pennsylvania and visit Potter County, a \ncounty which is categorized as almost 100 percent rural, with a very \nsmall population, under 20,000 people. They have almost the same \nunemployment rate that Philadelphia has--a little less, but it is about \n11.5 percent. As of July, it was at about 11.2 percent. So it has \nhovered between 11 and 12 percent.\n  So in Philadelphia, having an 11- or 12-percent unemployment rate \nmeans 75,000 people; in Potter County that translates into just about \n900 people, just hovering around 1,000 people. So even in a very small \ncounty, the loss of one business, one factory, one plant can mean \ndevastation for that county and that community. That is whether you are \nin urban Pennsylvania or rural Pennsylvania, even in suburban areas, \nwhich got accustomed to 5 percent unemployment or maybe 4 percent \nunemployment and are now at 7 percent or 7.5 percent or 8 percent. Of \ncourse, Pennsylvania's rate is not nearly as high as some across the \ncountry.\n  So people might say: Well, what has the Congress been doing about \nthis over the last 18 months, and especially over the last couple \nmonths? Well, we could point to the Recovery Act, which I realize has \nnot been popular around the country. But the Recovery Act created 3 \nmillion jobs. It was one way to directly and positively impact the job \nsituation. When we lose 8 million and create about 3 million in the \nRecovery Act, that is a good start but not nearly enough.\n  One of the best things we did was just a couple days ago--and we \nshould be able to have it signed into law in a few days--was the Small \nBusiness Jobs and Credit Act, which, by the way, had no deficit impact. \nIn fact, it will save a little bit of money over the next 10 years. But \nthere is no adverse impact on the deficit.\n  Mr. President, there will be $12 billion directly to small business, \na $30 billion loan fund for our smaller banks, our community banks. \nMost banks in the country are at that level. They are not the big banks \non Wall Street. They provide direct help to small businesses in \ncommunities across States such as Pennsylvania and throughout the \ncountry.\n  That bill alone, according to the community bankers, will create \n500,000 jobs. That got voted on last week. Sometimes when things like \nthat get voted on, we move on to something else and people do not \nalways notice it. I think it is very important for people to know we do \nnot believe--I do not believe, and I think a lot of people in this \nChamber do not believe--we are out of the ditch yet. We are still \npushing and pushing to get this economy back to a position where we are \ngetting the kind of robust growth we need. We are in positive \nterritory. We are not losing 700,000 jobs a month or 600,000 jobs a \nmonth like we were in December of 2008 and January of 2009 and February \nand March and April--month after month, every single month for many \nmonths losing that many jobs.\n  So we are moving in the right direction. But we have a ways to go. I \nwould hope that not only next week but when we come back in November \nthe other side of the aisle would present some job creation strategies. \nI have not heard much. I think 39 out of 41 members of the Republican \ncaucus voted against the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act: $12 \nbillion of tax breaks for small business, a $30 billion loan fund which\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\ncan leverage hundreds of billions in economic activity and job creation \nactivity across the country.\n  So we have more to do, and we have a ways to go. We have to keep \nfocused and stay focused on strategies that will create jobs in the \nnear term and certainly over time, but especially those strategies that \nwill create 50,000 jobs or 75,000 jobs or 100,000 jobs. As we go, we \ncan continue to create jobs and grow the economy. When we do that--as \nwe learned in the 1990s--we can grow the economy and make good \ninvestments in health care and in our infrastructure and in education \nand in our workers and their skills. We can also do deficit reduction \nand debt reduction over time. But we cannot do those three things until \nwe are growing in a way that is substantial enough to do at least those \nthree: grow enough to create jobs, reduce the deficit, and even to \nreduce debt.\n\n  So we have a way to go, but I think we are headed in the right \ndirection. I am looking forward to seeing the Small Business Jobs and \nCredit Act enacted into law, working to help our small businesses and \nour smaller communities, especially those I have highlighted across \nPennsylvania and across the country that have had tremendous and \nhorrific job loss over the last 2 years to 18 months.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7409-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7409-S7410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come because we are coming to the \nend of our workweek. Many of our colleagues are gone already, and \nothers are preparing to go. Another week has gone by in which the \nSenate has taken no action whatsoever with respect to the continuing \npollution of our atmosphere by carbon, which we subsidize by allowing \nour biggest polluters to do it without cost or consequence. The effects \nof that on our world continue to manifest themselves. This is one of \nthose issues where we can come to an impasse in the Senate and the foes \nof doing anything about moving to clean energy jobs and requiring \ncarbon polluters to actually pay a price for their pollution can stop \nall that. It may seem like a victory, but the problem is there is a \nreal cost to continuing to pollute our atmosphere with carbon. It does \ntrap heat. It does warm the planet.\n  Those are scientific verities that are unavoidable and the \nconsequences continue to cascade through our world, through the \nenvironmental systems of which it is made up. The evidence of that \ncontinues to emerge.\n  Frankly, Mother Nature does not care about what happens in the \nSenate. She is not subject to our law. She is not subject to our \nopinion. She will continue to do her thing. It is up to us to be \nprudent and thoughtful caretakers of our planet and sensible men and \nwomen and take the appropriate steps so we can head off the disasters \nshe is loudly signaling are coming our way.\n  I thought I would share just some of the continuing cascade of \nevidence and news that is coming out on this subject.\n  The first thing I will mention is a report from Science Daily that \ncame out about a week ago. According to NOAA, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, the U.S. Government agency's recent state \nof the climate report, the lower 48 States, as a whole, experienced the \nfourth warmest summer on record, with average August temperatures 2.2 \ndegrees above the last century average.\n  The American Southwest experienced its warmest summer ever. The \nMidwest experienced its third warmest summer. The Northeast, where I \ncome from, where my home State of Rhode Island is, experienced its \nfourth warmest summer ever recorded. Indeed, Rhode Island experienced \nits hottest ever July on record.\n  The increase of temperature in our weather systems has the effect of \nadding energy into those weather systems which suggests that storms are \nmade more frequent and more powerful. Sure enough, the facts confirm \nthat as well.\n  In 2007, Environment America analyzed rainfall data and determined in \na report that came out more recently that extreme precipitation events \nhad increased across the United States by 24 percent between 1948 and \n2006. The region in which the extreme precipitation events--these major \nstorms with extreme levels of rain or snow--faced the greatest increase \nwas in New England, with a 61-percent increase from 1948 to 2006. \nWithin New England, the State that faced the greatest increase was my \nhome State of Rhode Island, with an 88-percent increase in extreme \nprecipitation events.\n  One of those extreme precipitation events was the March flooding in \nmy home State, in which our rivers--the Pawtuxet, Blackstone, and \nPawcatuck--some of them went above 100-year floodplain levels. Some of \nthem reached areas beyond 500-year flood levels.\n  Clearly, something is changing. Actually, there were two floods that \nhappened back to back, just weeks apart. I visited homes in West \nWarwick, where the mud and the flooding had brought into people's homes \nand basements thick muck they had to dig out and clean up. As soon as \nthey had dug it out and cleaned it up, boom, it happened again. It was \nabsolutely heartbreaking for them. One can imagine how frustrating it \nis to go into your home, your basement, to see what used to be a nice \narea, what used to be clean, what used to be dry, where your children \nkept their photo albums, you might have kept old papers, things that \nwere important to you, televisions, sofas, and now just a sea of filthy \nmud that you are going to have to figure out how to clear out and clean \nup, cutting out all the wallboard, cutting out everything that is wet, \nhaving to rebuild. The frustration of having to do that--people lead \nbusy lives, they do not need that--and then, boom, to have it happen a \nsecond time as soon as it was done is unbelievably frustrating and \ndisheartening.\n  Those are the kinds of extreme and unpredicted weather events that \nare associated with a warming planet and the heating of the atmosphere.\n  It also changes the way different animals can live and migrate. One \nof them is the bark beetle. Earlier this month, the U.S. Forest Service \npredicted that outbreaks of spruce and mountain beetles in Western \nStates will increase in the coming decades because of climate change. \nThese beetles historically had their range kept in check by cold \nwinters, which basically kill off the larvae, and that limits the \nreproduction of the beetles and it limits their geographic range. As \nthe winters become warmer, then the beetles have survived--because the \nwinters aren't as cold--so they continue to go out and do their thing. \nTheir thing to do is to kill pine trees. The beetles have already \naffected more than 17.5, I believe, million acres of Western forests.\n\n  I have traveled out West. I was in Idaho a few summers ago, and you \ncould fly over the mountains of Idaho and see entire forested \nmountains, as far as the eye could see from the plane, and it was dead \nand brown and it was because the beetle had gone in there and killed \nthem.\n  These changes are going to continue. I can't estimate what cost it \nwas to the industry or to Idaho's economy to have that massive die-off \nof pine trees, but, clearly, it is no good thing.\n  The ocean continues to send us warnings as well. According to the \nUniversity of Colorado's National Snow and Ice Data Center--this again \nearlier this month--for only the third time in satellite history, ice \nhas covered less than 5 million square kilometers of the Arctic Ocean. \nAs a result of the trend that these researchers see, they warn that \nglobal warming could leave the Arctic sea ice free by 2030--20 years \nfrom now. Many of us will be around then to see that.\n  An ice-free Arctic Ocean has very significant repercussions for our \nworld because it is the ice that reflects a great deal of the heat back \nout of the atmosphere in what is called the albedo effect--the \nreflection of it. If that is not there, instead there is a dark ocean \nabsorbing the heat. It accelerates the warming and begins the feedback \nloop that makes the problem worse.\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\n  So it is significant that the Arctic sea ice is continuing to shrink \nand for only the third time in satellite history now has covered less \nthan 5 million square kilometers.\n  If you go from the far north to the tropic seas, there are signs of \ndistress there as well. On September 20, the New York Times reported \nthat in 1998, 16 percent of the world's shallow water reefs died as a \nresult of record warm temperatures. It is estimated that the die-off \ncould be even worse this year. In May, more than 60 percent of corals \noff the coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province bleached and died after \nAndaman Sea temperatures reached 93 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  It may not seem significant that corals are dying. It may seem indeed \ninsignificant to many of my colleagues. But these coral areas are the \nnurseries for tropical seas. Many species depend on them to basically \ngrow and feed in their early stages, and if they die, it creates a \ncascading effect through the food chain that has potentially \nsignificant effects for our kinds of species--set aside the local \neconomy wanting to be able to support snorkelers and people such as \nthat who go to see these rare and special beauties.\n  Finally, the Scientific American reported earlier this summer that \nthe average phytoplankton population in our oceans has dropped about 1 \npercent a year between 1889 and 2008, resulting in a 40-percent drop \noverall in phytoplankton.\n  What is a phytoplankton? It is one of the tiny plant--almost \nmicroscopic--species that grows in the ocean and floats free in the \nocean. Is that important? It is important because zooplankton and \nphytoplankton--animal and vegetable plankton--represent the base of the \noceanic food chain. They are what the little fish feed on, and the \nlittle fish are what the big fish feed on, and up you go.\n  We have never had a situation in which the bottom of the food chain \nbegan to collapse. But we have been seeing it over the past century, \nand we anticipate seeing a lot more because the carbon our polluters \nrelease into the atmosphere with impunity--subsidized by all the rest \nof us--ends up being absorbed by the ocean--80 percent gets absorbed, \nif I am not mistaken--and that changes the pH level of the ocean, how \nacidic it is.\n  The ocean, right now, is more acidic than it has been in 8,000 \ncenturies, and 8,000 centuries is a long time. We are engaged in a \nchemical experiment with our oceans that has potentially vast \nconsequences for them by just injecting all this carbon and waiting to \nsee what happens. Now we are out, far enough outside the range of \nwhere, in human experience, there has been a pH that we are 8,000 \ncenturies away from it being at this level. All that--the acidification \nof the ocean--makes it more difficult for these plankton to survive. So \nthe crash we are seeing is consistent with the damage that carbon \npollution does to our oceans.\n  I say this because I know we are not going to get anywhere with \nenergy before the election. Maybe nobody cares. But again, we can be as \nignorant as we please. We can be as pleased with ourselves that we have \ndelivered for interest groups and special interests as we please. We \ncan suggest to Americans that climate change isn't real or isn't \nhappening. We can participate in the propaganda battle the big \npolluters are sponsoring to try to raise doubt about the established \nscience. We can do all those things and we can claim victory and block \nlegislation and we can serve our special interest supporters. We can do \nall those things to prevent any serious legislation from coming through \nthis body for years and years and years and, you know what, the Earth \nwill not care.\n  You cannot legislate our environment. King Canute could stand in the \noceans and order that the tide not come in, and he could have all his \ncourtiers and all his supporters around him. He could have all the \npeople who keep him in office and provide campaign contributions and it \nwouldn't make a darned bit of difference. The tide comes roaring in.\n  Our job in this body is not just to represent special interests, not \njust to achieve temporary political victories, not just to block \nprogress of bills that interests that support us disagree with. We have \nanother job as well; that is, to look out for the welfare of our \ncountry and of the American people and to prepare when the Earth \nplainly warns us of coming dangers. It is in the service of that job \nthat I intend to continue coming to the floor to remind my colleagues \nthat no matter what their opinions are, no matter what their politics \nare, no matter what the interest groups that support them are, the \nfacts continue to announce themselves, and the announcement they are \nmaking to us is a warning. If we are not smart enough--with our God-\ngiven intelligence and foresight--to read the warnings nature is giving \nus and respond appropriately before it is too late, then it will be on \nus that we failed to do so.\n  People will look back from 20 years hence, from 30 years hence, from \n40 years hence--the young pages who are here in the well, when they are \nmy age, will look back at this generation that sat in this Senate, in \nthis year, on this occasion, at this time--and they will say: How could \nyou have been so negligent? How could you have allowed the politics of \nthe moment to put you on this march of folly that failed to protect us \nwhen you knew--when you knew?\n  So I intend to continue because this is an issue that will not go \naway. Nature's warnings to us are persistent, and I intend to be \npersistent as well.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7410-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7410-S7412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPIRING TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be mercifully brief. I wished to \ncome to the floor to briefly speak about a couple issues.\n  First and foremost, the raging debate that is occurring in the \ncountry about the expiring tax cuts--the so-called Bush tax cuts that \nwere enacted in the year 2001 that cut taxes across the board. They cut \ntaxes more generously for the wealthiest Americans, but nonetheless \nthey cut taxes for all Americans as well, and they were designed, in \n2001, to expire this year.\n  I did not vote for them in 2001. I voted in 2001 against those tax \ncuts and not because I wouldn't want to provide tax cuts to the \nAmerican people, but the proposition, I thought, was flawed. The \nPresident inherited the last year of President Clinton's fiscal policy, \nwhich produced the only budget surplus we had had in 30 years. From \nthat budget surplus that year, the projection by economists was that we \nwere going to have budget surpluses for the next decade. As a result of \nthat, Mr. Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had an \napoplectic seizure. He said he couldn't sleep because he was worried we \nwere going to pay down the debt too fast.\n  The Bush administration said: If we are going to have these \nsurpluses, we must return surpluses to the American people. We have to \ndo that through these tax cuts.\n  I stood on the floor, at my desk, and I said: Why don't we be \nconservative? Let's decide to wait and see what happens. If we do, in \nfact, have surpluses, let us provide some tax cuts. But all we have are \n10 years of projections. We don't have the real surpluses; we just have \nprojections.\n  The response was: No, we are not going to do that. We are not going \nto wait. We are going to have big tax cuts, with the biggest tax cuts \ngoing to the wealthiest Americans.\n  So they were enacted. I did not vote for them, but they were enacted \nnonetheless.\n  Almost immediately, we were in a recession. Almost immediately after \nthat, our country was attacked, on 9/11, by terrorists. Then we were in \na war in Afghanistan. Then we were at war in Iraq and a war against \nterrorism generally. We began sending soldiers overseas in harm's way, \nand thousands were killed and tens of thousands were injured in war. \nStill the question has always been and remains now, even while we are \nwatching our soldiers walk into harm's way, when do I get my tax cut? \nWill I continue to get my tax cut next year?\n  Let me read something Franklin Delano Roosevelt said at a time of \nwar. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\n\n       Not all of us can have the privilege of fighting our \n     enemies in distant parts of the world. Not all of us can have \n     the privilege of working in a munitions factory or a \n     shipyard, or on the farms or in the oil fields or the mines, \n     producing the weapons or raw materials that are needed by our \n     Armed Forces. But there is one front and one battle where \n     everyone in the United States--every man, woman and child--is \n     in action. . . .That front is right here at home, in our \n     daily lives and in our daily tasks. Here at home everyone \n     will have the privilege of making whatever self-denial is \n     necessary, not only to supply our fighting men [and women], \n     but to keep the economic structure of our country fortified \n     and secure. . . .\n\n  ``Everyone will have the privilege of making whatever self-denial is \nnecessary.'' We all know self-denial when we see it. We go to the \nevents when the soldiers and National Guard organizations mobilize to \nleave our country, leave their families, leave their jobs, and go to \nAfghanistan to fight, go to Iraq to fight. In the morning, they strap \non ceramic body armor, load their weapons, and go on their way. \nYesterday, nine of them were killed in Afghanistan.\n  The question here at home is not are we going to pay for the costs of \nwar, because we have not, never have in years. And President Bush, who \npushed the tax cuts, said: You will not pay for them. Some of us stood \non the Senate floor and said: If we are at war, how about paying for \nthe costs of war? Why do we send soldiers to war and charge it and say \nto the solders: You come back and pay the bill.\n  We are still at war, we have a $13 trillion debt, not having paid for \na penny of the war, having put all the debt on the shoulders of those \nwho will come home, then, to assume this debt. And now the question is, \nCan we extend the tax cuts for everyone?\n  Here is what I think we should do. I understand this economy is weak. \nI am not going to give a speech about what caused that. I have done \nthat many times. This economy is still weak. I understand the virtue of \nsaying to those earning under $250,000: We will continue to extend that \ntax cut. I would extend it for 2 years. That is what I think we should \ndo in terms of being able, 2 years from now, to take a look at what is \nhappening in our country, what are our needs in order to lift our \ncountry's economy back up. We need to tighten our belt on spending. We \nneed to cut some spending. We also are going to need some additional \nrevenue.\n  The question is, for those who are making $1 million a year in income \nand getting an $80,000 tax cut from the 2001 tax bill that was passed \nby this Congress, should they continue to get that $80,000-a-year tax \ncut at a time when we have a $13 trillion debt and we are still sending \nmen and women to war, when they are risking their lives and we are not \npaying for any of it? Should we still do that? The answer, in my \njudgment, is no.\n  The American people are waiting and watching for some semblance of \nseriousness here, some serious approaches that will begin to address \nwhat ails this country. I think what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said is \ndead-on accurate: Not all of us can have the privilege of fighting our \nenemy in distant parts of the world, but for most of us, the front is \nright here at home in our daily lives and daily tasks, and here at home \neveryone would have the privilege of whatever self-denial is necessary, \nnot only to supply our fighting men but to keep the economic structure \nof our country fortified and secure.\n  Is anyone going to think about the economic fortunes of America or is \nit just about ourselves individually? Isn't there a higher calling and \nhigher purpose here in terms of making judgments about these things?\n  I think it would be wonderful if no one had to pay any taxes. That \nwould be wonderful. But that is not the case. Who is going to pay the \ncosts of some of the things that make this a great country? Who is \ngoing to build the roads? Who is going to build the schools and \nmaintain the schools? Who is going to pay for the Centers For Disease \nControl? How about the Department of Defense? How about the U.S. Forest \nService? It goes on and on. We can tighten our belt. Yes, we can spend \nless in a number of areas. I support that. But we have to have a fiscal \npolicy that is serious. How on Earth, at a time when we are at war, can \nwe decide that our priority is to give an $80,000-a-year tax cut beyond \nnext year--an $80,000-a-year tax cut to someone making $1 million a \nyear? That makes no sense to me.\n  I think it is time for our country to understand that our national \nsecurity is not just about our soldiers who are fighting in the field. \nIt is a requirement that we support them, not just by saying we support \nthem but by at least some semblance of self-denial, at least by those \nwho are making millions of dollars a year. The proposition is only to \nask that they pay at the same tax rate that they paid throughout the \n1990s when the country was booming, sufficiently booming that we had a \nbudget surplus. That is the tax rate the wealthiest in America paid \nback then. It did not diminish the economy; it lifted up the economy, \nthe fact that we had a fiscal policy that was not moving us deeper into \ndebt but a fiscal policy, rather, that was leading us toward a balanced \nbudget and finally a budget surplus.\n  I think there is a higher purpose, and all of us need to be called to \nthat higher purpose. It is not about, will we get our tax cut tonight, \ntomorrow, or next month? Will the wealthy get it? Will everybody get \nit? That is not what is of interest. What is of interest to everybody \nin this country, I hope, is, what kind of a future will our children \nhave in the United States of America? Will we allow them to inherit a \ncountry that is growing and expanding and providing opportunity for our \nkids?\n  I think it is very disappointing that we end this year having done so \nlittle because so much has been blocked in the Senate.\n  I noticed yesterday that another billionaire died in America. Boy, \nlet me make sure I say that when someone makes $1 billion in this \ncountry, in most cases I say: You know what, you are extraordinary. \nThat is a pretty extraordinary thing. Many of them have great talents, \nand good for them. But when billionaires die today, they pay zero \nestate tax. Think about that. Five billionaires died this year, and \nthis is the year the estate tax went to zero. Some said it is the \n``Throw Mama From the Train'' year. This is the year in which there is \nno estate tax on the assets of billionaires who have never borne a tax. \nSome of the wealthiest people in this country who have billions of \ndollars of assets have it through growth appreciation of stock, and \nthey have never borne a tax on that to help pay for a kid to go to \nschool or build a road or help support our Department of Defense and \nour national security. What a disappointment.\n  This country deserves better from all of us, to get this done. Again, \nI believe the best approach at this point is to say, yes, let's go \nahead and extend these tax cuts for middle-income workers up to \n$250,000 a year. Let's do it for 2 years, and then let's see where we \nare and let's see what the needs of this economy are in order to be \nsure we have the opportunity to lift this country going forward and \nprovide some economic opportunity in the future.\n  I wanted to mention one other issue. That is something that I and \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Brownback, and others introduced yesterday. \nIt deals with something called RES. That is not a foreign language, it \nis a renewable electricity standard. It is a policy that many other \ncountries have and many of our States have. I believe there are 29 \nStates and the District of Columbia that have renewable electricity \nstandards saying it is our policy that electricity shall be produced \nfrom renewable sources for a certain percentage of the electric load.\n\n  We proposed 15 percent. We passed that on a bipartisan basis out of \nthe Energy Committee. Why is this important? Because if we are going to \nbe less dependent on foreign oil, move to less dependency on oil from \ncountries that do not like us very much in many cases, if we are going \nto be less dependent on that, we have to change our energy mix. That \nmeans we have to produce more energy from renewable sources. We have to \ngather energy from the wind and the Sun, where the wind blows and the \nSun shines, put it on a wire, and move it to the load centers. That \nchanges the energy mix in our country. The way to do that is the way \nother countries and the way many of our States have already done it: \ndrive it with a 15-percent renewable electricity standard. I prefer 20, \nbut 15 is what we passed out of that committee, the Energy Committee.\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\n  It appears to me that now we are not going to get a larger energy \nbill in this Congress. That is too bad because we passed a bipartisan \nbill that would provide greater energy security for our country out of \nthe Energy Committee. At the very least, let's pass a renewable \nelectricity standard that is bipartisan, that will drive the production \nof new capability in wind and solar and other renewable sources.\n  In the second quarter of this year, we had a 70-percent reduction in \nwind energy production--that is the production of facilities to build \nwind energy. From last year, a 70-percent reduction. The reason? \nBecause we do not have a renewable electricity standard. There was an \nexpectation that we would, and we do not.\n  Let's not leave this Congress this year with so much unfinished \nbusiness that I believe is essential to this country.\n  While I am speaking about it, let me make one additional point, and \nthat is on another piece of legislation that must pass by the end of \nthis year. It rests now in the Senate Finance Committee and it \nreauthorizes the Special Diabetes Program in this country that is so \nunbelievably important. The Special Diabetes Program helps all \nAmericans, but it is especially targeted at Native Americans, who in \nsome cases have rates of diabetes that are 10 and 12 times the rate of \nthe national average. We must reauthorize the Special Diabetes Program. \nIf my colleagues could walk into a dialysis center and see the number \nof people--on Indian reservations especially--hooked up to a dialysis \nmachine, in some cases with only one leg or having lost an arm--the \nravages of diabetes are unbelievable, and the number of new cases of \ndiabetes among children of this country is just startling.\n  I want to show one chart about this. This chart shows the number of \npeople in America over the past 30 years who have been diagnosed with \ndiabetes. This is a full-blown, full-scale, unbelievable epidemic.\n  The Special Diabetes Program that I and Senator Domenici and Senator \nCollins and so many others have worked so hard on for a long time has \nto be reauthorized. I hope very much my colleagues will understand that \nthis is not optional. Go to an dialysis center. Go to an Indian \nreservation and go to a dialysis center and talk to the people hooked \nup to those machines and see the amputations and talk to the relatives \nof people who have died in circumstances where people, over 50 years \nold on average, 50 or 60 percent of them are affected by diabetes. \nEspecially take a look at the rate of diabetes among children on Indian \nreservations--and children all across the country. Then say to yourself \nthat this bill doesn't matter. You cannot possibly say that. We must \naddress this issue.\n  This Congress has done some big things, some important things, and \nthere are some things yet to be done. It is not the end of the year. We \nhave some additional time. My hope is that our colleagues can attempt \nto give us the best of what both political parties have to offer rather \nthan the worst of each. The American people expect more and deserve \nmore from us.\n  I wonder sometimes how the majority leader is able to have the \npatience to try to find a way to steer almost anything through this \nChamber. I said yesterday that even a Mother's Day resolution would \nlikely engender a filibuster. It is very hard because we have people \nwho see themselves as a set of human brake pads, whose only destiny is \nto try to stop everything. The problem is that there are a number of \nthings that must get done for the economic health of this country and \nfor the health of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7412-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7412-S7415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SIXTH MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today marks exactly 6 months since the \nAffordable Care Act became law. And this truly is a banner day, because \na key feature of the new law, the Patient's Bill of Rights, goes into \neffect--cracking down on the worst abuses of health insurance companies \nand giving Americans important new protections. These reforms are long \noverdue, and represent a new day in American health care. We are \ncreating a reformed health insurance system that works in the interest \nof working Americans and their families--the healthy and the sick--and \nnot just to boost the profits of insurance companies and the bonuses of \ntheir executives.\n  Starting today, insurance companies will no longer be allowed to \ncancel your policy if you get sick. They must end their abusive \npractice of scouring your health records for an excuse--any excuse--to \ncancel your coverage and leave you high and dry when you need insurance \nthe most. One major insurer actually targeted women who were newly \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. No longer will insurance companies be \nallowed to reward employees with bonuses for cancelling policies in \norder to pad company profits. This cruel practice, at long last, is \nillegal.\n  Starting today, children with preexisting conditions can no longer be \ndenied health insurance. This will ensure that all children receive \naccess to preventive care and needed treatments and healthy start at \nlife.\n  Beginning today, lifetime benefit limits on your health insurance \nplan will be banned, and annual benefit limits will be restricted. Over \n100 million Americans have health plans that include a lifetime limit, \nwhich, in times of serious illness, can cause the loss of coverage when \npatients need it the most. No longer will a diagnosis of an acute \nillness such as cancer or ALS lead a patient to rapidly max out their \nhealth benefits.\n  Starting today, parents will no longer have to worry that their \nchildren will be kicked off their health insurance plan when they turn \n19 or finish college. Today, millions of American families with young \nadult children who don't receive health insurance through their \nemployer will be able to keep their children on their family plan until \nage 26. I know that in my State of Iowa, this will help over 8,300 \nyoung adults this year.\n  Today, Americans receive yet another protection against health \ninsurance company abuses. Starting today, if an insurer refuses to pay \nfor your test or treatment, you are guaranteed the right to appeal that \ndecision. If your appeal through the company is not favorable, you have \nthe right to an independent appeal by a third-party reviewer. This is \none of many new reforms that will keep insurance companies from \nboosting profits at the expense of sick patients.\n  And finally, today is a landmark day in the effort to transform our \ncurrent sick care system into a true health care system--one focused on \nwellness, prevention, and public health--keeping people out of the \nhospital in the first place. That is why I am particularly pleased \nthat, starting today, health plans must cover proven preventive \nservices at no cost to the patient. This means that, starting today, \nyou can visit your doctor for tests such as mammograms and \ncolonoscopies for prenatal care, or for immunizations such as the \nseasonal flu shot, without paying a deductible, co-pay, or coinsurance. \nThis represents an enormous benefit to the health of Americans, and to \nthe well-being of this country. Because there is no better way to bend \nthe cost curve downward than by keeping people healthy and catching \nillness in its earliest stages.\n  As I travel around the country, I hear from so many folks who have \nalready benefitted from health care reform, and look forward to the \nmany additional improvements still to come. I hear from mothers who are \nrelieved their children can no longer be denied coverage for their \nasthma, from working families who will no longer have to worry about \nthe cost of a co-pay for their annual flu shot, and from seniors who \nhave received a $250 rebate check to help with the cost of their \nprescription drugs.\n  Starting in January, seniors will also receive free preventive \nservices--plus an annual wellness visit--through Medicare.\n  I talk to small business owners who have benefitted from the tax \ncredits that make providing health coverage to their employees more \naffordable.\n  I would like to take a moment to share how health reform is helping \neveryday Americans by putting people ahead of profits. I recently \nlearned about the case of a young Iowan from Cedar Falls, Sarah \nPosekany. She is just one of millions of Americans who have been \nplunged into financial ruin because their insurance company cut them \noff after they got sick.\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\n  Sarah was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when she was 15 years old. \nDuring her first year of college, she ran into complications from \nCrohn's, forcing her to drop her classes in order to heal after \nmultiple surgeries. Because she was no longer a full-time student, her \nparents' private health insurance company terminated her coverage.\n  As Sarah puts it: ``They didn't want to help, so I had to let the \nmedical bills pile up.''\n  Four years later, she found herself $180,000 in debt, and was forced \nto file for bankruptcy.\n  Sarah has undergone seven surgeries. And here is what is most \ndisturbing: Two of those surgeries came as a direct result of her not \nbeing able to afford medication.\n  Sarah said: ``When I don't have any insurance, and can't afford to \ntreat myself, the disease progresses to the point where I need \nsurgery.''\n  Sarah still wants to pursue her dream of becoming a nurse. But her \nbankruptcy and crippling debt will follow her wherever she goes, all \nbecause her parents' insurance company cancelled her coverage exactly \nwhen she needed it most.\n  Today is the day that we put a stop to these kinds of tragedies--\nexperiences like Sarah's, that are a stain on our past. Today, our \nhealth system takes another giant step toward working not just for the \nhealthy and the wealthy but for all Americans.\n  These reforms represent such enormous progress, such a dramatic \nimprovement in the daily lives of millions of Americans. Frankly, I am \nastounded that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to \ncall for the repeal of these historic reforms.\n  In fact, just this past weekend, a major contender for their party's \nPresidential nomination publicly stood up for insurance companies to \ndefend one of their most egregious practices: discriminating against \npeople based on preexisting conditions. He said that health insurance \ncompanies shouldn't be obligated to cover preexisting conditions--and \nlet's not forget that insurers include pregnancy and domestic violence \non their list of preexisting conditions--because paying for the care of \nthe sick is like insuring a building that is on fire.\n  If that's how they characterize the millions of Americans with heart \nconditions, the millions of Americans who are cancer survivors, and the \nmillions of Americans born with health conditions they have no control \nover--comparing them to burning buildings--then I can understand why it \nis so easy for them to lock arms with insurance companies and defend \ntheir discriminatory practices.\n  What this sort of thinking indicates to me is that many Republicans \nare sadly out of touch with the priorities of the American people. They \ncontinue to argue for repeal of a bill that puts an end to the most \nappalling health insurance company abuses.\n  They want to drag us back to a day where a bad diagnosis not only \nmeant a health challenge but potential financial ruin.\n  They have spent months using scare tactics like claiming the bill \ncuts Medicare and hurts seniors when it actually strengthens Medicare. \nSo far this year, seniors have seen prescription drug price relief, and \nvery soon they will enjoy free preventive care and lower Medicare \nAdvantage premiums.\n  Do my friends on the other side of the aisle really want to repeal \nthe ban on denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions?\n  Do they want to overturn the provision allowing children to stay on \ntheir parents plan until they are 26 or can receive coverage through an \nemployer?\n  Do they really want to turn to our youth at a time when they are most \nvulnerable and starting out in life and say, ``Sorry, when you get \nsick, you're on your own?''\n  Do they want to repeal the ban on insurance companies cancelling your \npolicy if you get a serious illness like cancer or heart disease?\n  Do they want to repeal the ban on lifetime benefit limits and allow \ninsurance companies to cut off your coverage when they determine your \ncare hurts profits too much?\n  I can't for the life of me understand why Republicans think that \nrepealing these new protections and benefits, and going back to the bad \nold days when health insurance companies held all the cards, is what \nAmericans want.\n  And what about the health reform law's reduction of the deficit? I am \njust at a loss as to why Republicans are calling for the repeal of a \nlaw that ends insurance company abuses, expands access to care, and \nreduces the deficit by $143 billion in the next 10 years, and by nearly \n$1 trillion in the years after that.\n  There are so many good things in the health reform law, and there is \nmuch more to come. Just this week, a Families USA report highlighted \nthe benefits this law will bring to my State of Iowa. When the full law \nkicks in, in 2014, over 261,000 Iowans will qualify for tax credits to \nhelp them purchase health insurance. These tax credits, which amount to \none of the largest middle-income tax cuts in American history, will \nreduce Federal income taxes for Iowans by $974 million in the first \nyear alone. And these tax breaks are targeted toward working families \nwho have long struggled with the increasing cost of health insurance.\n  We have reached a historic moment in the history of American health \ncare. A moment where the promise of health reform is becoming a reality \nfor Americans. A moment where all patients--not just the healthy and \nthe wealthy--have the rights and protections they need and deserve.\n  The Patient's Bill of Rights--the critical new protections that take \neffect today--is a giant step forward for the health and economic \nsecurity of the American people.\n  Health reform is off to a very strong start. As many predicted, the \nnew health reform law is growing increasingly popular as people get \nbetter acquainted with its broad array of benefits and protections. \nThey like the new law's sharp emphasis on wellness and prevention. They \nwant every American to have access to quality, affordable health care. \nThey like the tax cuts to help working families afford health coverage.\n  And make no mistake: the American people are not going to allow these \nbenefits and rights to be taken away.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for each of us, our health is among the \nthings we care the most about. Certainly one of the most common \nrequests any of us regularly make in prayer is for good health. And of \ncourse it is not only our own health we worry about; we also want good \nhealth and proper medical insurance for our children, our parents, our \nsiblings--for all those who are important to us.\n  Medical knowledge and technology have advanced tremendously during \nthe past two and a half centuries of American life, and the pace of \nmedical progress is accelerating. But health insurance models have not. \nThe deck has been stacked in favor of the insurance companies, and \nagainst the practical needs of ordinary Americans. For much of the last \ncentury Americans have pointed to the obvious need for insurance \nreform, yet the problems have only grown worse and more urgent, leaving \nmillions of Americans exposed to the ravages of sudden illness and the \nwasting effects of declining health.\n  Six months ago today, President Obama signed into law the Affordable \nCare Act, which will extend health insurance coverage to more than 30 \nmillion uninsured Americans in the next few years. Reform based on good \nquality, affordable health insurance that has been talked about for \ndecades is finally becoming a reality. Over 15 months starting last \nyear, Congress debated and then passed the most sweeping and \ncomprehensive reforms to improve the everyday lives of every American \nsince Congress passed Medicare in 1965. It was an arduous process, but \nin the end the achievement proved that change is possible and that \nvoices of so many Americans who over the years have called on their \nleaders to act have finally been heard.\n  Americans are already beginning to see some of the benefits of \ninsurance reform. First, in states where individuals and families are \nexcluded from health coverage because of preexisting medical \nconditions, these Americans can now buy insurance through special \ninsurance plans overseen by the states and delivered by private medical \nproviders. Second, employers across the country already have applied \nfor and have been awarded early retiree reinsurance grants that will \nreimburse employers for retirees' medical claims.\n\n[[Page S7414]]\n\nThird, seniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions typically \nfall within a coverage gap known as the ``doughnut hole.'' Beginning \nrecently, beneficiaries who fall within the gap will receive $250 \nchecks to help cover the cost of their prescription drugs.\n  And today, more benefits of real insurance reform go into effect that \nwill help consumers take control of their own health care decisions. \nKnown as the Patients' Bill of Rights, these new rules protect \nconsumers against the worst health insurance industry abuses that have \nprevented millions of people from receiving the health care they need. \nGoing forward, insurance plans can no longer deny children coverage \nbecause of a preexisting health condition; insurance plans are barred \nfrom dropping beneficiaries from coverage simply because of an illness; \ndozens of preventive care services must be covered at no cost and with \nno co-pay; Americans will have access to an easier appeals process for \nprivate medical claims that are denied; and adult children can stay on \ntheir parents' plans until their 26th birthdays.\n  Yet another major reform now protects everyday Americans from one of \nthe most egregious insurance industry practices: setting lifetime or \nannual limits on health insurance coverage. Wherever I travel in \nVermont I am often stopped in the grocery store, at church, on the \nstreet or at the gas station to listen to personal, wrenching stories \nfrom Vermonters who can no longer get medical treatment because they \nhave met their annual or lifetime maximum. Many of these Vermonters \nwere perfectly healthy before being diagnosed with cancer or diseases \nthat can cost well beyond their means for treatment. Instead of being \nable to focus on getting healthy, patients instead must worry about \nwhether or not their next doctor's visit will shove them above the \ninsurance company's arbitrary limit.\n  Each of these stories is anguishing. Let me describe just one of \nthem. A master's student from Saint Michael's College's graduate \nschool, Ned wrote my office during the health care reform debate to \nshare his story. A car accident when Ned was nine left him a \nquadriplegic. His health care costs since then have necessarily been \nhigh. In fact, recently Ned found that he had nearly met his lifetime \nlimit on coverage from one plan and his only remaining option for \nhealth insurance coverage not only contained a lifetime cap on coverage \nbut also a cap on expenses for durable medical equipment, which he uses \nfrequently because of his wheelchair. But beginning today, Ned and \nmillions of other Americans who fear reaching their coverage limits can \nrest easier knowing that their insurance will be there when they need \nit the most. Ned, and we, can look forward to a lifetime of the \ncontributions that he will make to his community and our country.\n  In addition to improvements to our health insurance system that we \nwill see this year, over time the Affordable Care Act will insure 95 \npercent of our population and make a substantial investment in our \neconomic vitality in the years ahead. In addition to ending the \ndiscriminatory insurance company practices of denying coverage because \nof a preexisting condition or canceling coverage when beneficiaries get \nsick, the new law will lower costs for small businesses and individuals \nwho simply cannot afford health coverage. And despite the specious \narguments from opponents of reform, this bill is the largest deficit \nreduction measure upon which many in Congress will ever cast a vote. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that comprehensive reform \nwill reduce the federal deficit by $143 billion through 2019, and by \nmore than $1 trillion in the decades to come.\n  The Affordable Care Act is a tremendous achievement that will improve \nthe lives of Americans for generations to come. For decades, we have \nheard heartbreaking stories about the enormous challenges Americans \nface because they are uninsured or underinsured. With each new \nimplementation date of the features of the Affordable Care Act, these \nstories are becoming fewer and fewer and are being replaced by stories \nof the success of these reforms, one family at a time, all across \nVermont and all across America.\n  There is still much more to accomplish, and there are still millions \nof Americans who are struggling to buy or keep adequate health \ninsurance coverage for their families or themselves. As these reforms \nare implemented over the next few years, I will continue to work with \nVermonters and the Department of Health and Human Services to help \nAmericans have the access to the quality, affordable health insurance \nthat each American needs and deserves.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an important \nmilestone in the effort of delivering meaningful health reform for all \nAmericans. Six months ago, President Obama signed the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act into law, and the first major \npatient protections now take effect to help Americans obtain and keep \nmeaningful health care coverage.\n  I am reminded of all the South Dakotan families and businesses that \nhave contacted me to voice their thoughts about health care, share \ntheir personal experiences, and find out how reform will help them. \nReforms in place today end some of the worst insurance industry abuses \nby implementing a Patient's Bill of Rights. These provisions protect \nchildren with a preexisting condition from being denied coverage, allow \nparents to provide insurance for their children through their young \nadult years, prohibit profit-driven insurance companies from rescinding \nbenefits as soon as someone becomes sick and eliminate lifetime limits \nand restrict annual limits on benefits.\n  As more provisions of the Affordable Care Act are implemented, it is \nimportant we do not forget the health care crisis facing our Nation and \nthe consequences of inaction. The latest U.S. Census report confirms \nthat, while some were spinning mistruths about a government takeover of \nhealth care, more and more Americans were losing their health insurance \ncoverage. Last year, the number of insured individuals and families \ndropped for the first time the Census starting tracking that data in \n1987. Nearly 51 million Americans are uninsured, compared to 46 million \nthe previous year. The Affordable Care Act puts in place assurances \nthat no more Americans will be priced out of the private health \ninsurance market or denied coverage by discriminatory insurance \npractices. Americans will no longer pay more every year for fewer \nbenefits, be denied coverage for a preexisting medical condition, or \nlose coverage altogether just for getting sick.\n  The Patient's Bill of Rights taking effect today eliminates the worst \npractices of the insurance industry that took advantage of American \nfamilies for far too long. But insurance market reforms alone will not \naddress all shortcomings of our health care system. The Affordable Care \nAct also includes important investments in strengthening and growing \nour health care workforce, improving access to preventive and wellness \nprograms, and addressing waste, fraud and abuse.\n  I supported health care reform to give our Nation the best chance of \nimproving our system and reigning in costs. One of our biggest \nchallenges remains the fact that we spend more on health care than any \nother country, 50 percent more per capita than the next highest \nspender, and yet have poorer health outcomes than most. Health reform \ncannot change that fact overnight, but it does provide us with a path \nforward and the tools to improve the way our system works for everyone. \nHealth economists have noted that reform finally implements a myriad of \nbipartisan proposals to rein in costs that have been circulating for \ndecades. These commonsense changes to our health care delivery system \nwill ensure we are getting our money's worth and ensure citizens have \naccess to affordable health care. Health reform has made a significant \nstep forward in addressing the drivers behind increasing health care \ncosts and placing us in a more fiscally sustainable direction.\n  The new law isn't perfect--few major pieces of legislation are--and \nthe work is not finished in delivering meaningful health reform for all \nAmericans. But with inaction not an option, the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act laid the foundation for improving the American \nhealth care system. The new law is a product of compromise and in that \nsame spirit I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure health \nreform is delivering for South Dakotans and all Americans.\n\n[[Page S7415]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7415-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nDREAM Act amendment to the 2010 National Defense Administration Act. \nThis is bipartisan legislation that provides sound economic and \nnational security benefits to our Nation.\n  I have long supported the DREAM Act primarily because it provides a \npathway forward for young men and women who have played by the rules \nall of their lives, graduated high school and now want to give back to \nthis country. These are young people who had no say in how or when they \ncame to our country, but somehow, their parents or other relatives \nbrought them here to live a better life.\n  Now, we could spend an infinite amount of time debating what to do \nwith the undocumented adults who have come to the U.S.--and I hope that \nwe do eventually get to that debate--but the focus of this measure is \nthe children. We are talking about the innocent children, who, for the \nmost part, have known no other home than America and deserve a way \nforward now that they are reaching adulthood.\n  Every year, thousands of undocumented students who live in the United \nStates graduate from high school. Among these students you will find \nvaledictorians, honor roll students, and community leaders who are \ncommitted to the United States and their local communities. It is \nestimated that there are 65,000 such young people who graduate from \nhigh school in the United States and find themselves unable to work, go \nto college, or serve this country in the military.\n  The young people who would be DREAM Act eligible would have graduated \nhigh school, passed a background check and be of good moral character. \nIt is why the DREAM Act is supported by the Secretary of the Department \nof Education, the National Education Association, the Association of \nAmerican Universities and many others. Leading businesses like \nMicrosoft endorse the DREAM Act because they recognize these young \npeople are talented and can be a benefit to U.S. businesses in this \nglobal economy. DREAM Act-eligible young people are exactly the type of \nindividuals we want to be part of our great society.\n  The DREAM Act is a smart, targeted piece of legislation that will \nonly benefit children who were brought to this country before the age \nof 16 and have been living here for at least 5 years.\n  From an economic perspective, the DREAM Act provides clear fiscal \nbenefits to our local communities and our Nation. State and local \ntaxpayers have invested time and money in these young people through \nelementary and secondary education expecting that eventually they will \nbecome contributing, tax-paying members of our society. With education \nbudgets as tight as they are, why would any community throw away such \nan investment?\n  Take this for example: a young immigrant who graduates from college \nwill pay $5,300 more in taxes and cost taxpayers $3,900 less in \ngovernment expenses each year than if he or she dropped out of high \nschool. Additionally, our own Department of Defense recommended in \ntheir 2010-2012 strategic plan the passage of the DREAM Act to help the \nmilitary ``share and maintain a mission-ready All Volunteer Force.'' \nThe former Secretary of the Army, Louis Caldera, stated ``the DREAM Act \nwill materially expand the pool of individuals qualified, ready and \nwilling to serve their country in uniform.'' The DREAM Act provides a \nsmart and narrow pathway for eligible young people to go on to college \nor enter our military.\n  Lastly, supporting the DREAM Act is the proper next step toward \ntaking up comprehensive immigration reform. The American people have \nspoken on this issue. They would like Congress to step up and deal with \nthis issue. According to a recent Fox News poll, 68 percent of voters, \nincluding Republicans, Democrats and Independents, say that efforts to \nsecure the border should be combined with reform of Federal immigration \nlaws. I agree, which is why I voted in favor of providing $600 million \nfor 1,500 new border patrol agents, additional monitoring and \ncommunications equipment in August. That funding and those resources \nwere an important step to ensure our Nation's borders are secure; just \nlike passing the DREAM Act is an important step to ensure our country \nhas the best and brightest individuals contributing to our economy and \nsociety.\n  Additionally, the DREAM Act has traditionally been a bipartisan \neffort. During this Congress Senator Durbin and Senator Lugar \nintroduced the legislation. But in the 108th Congress the legislation \nhad the support of Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, Senator Kyl and \nSenator Cornyn. During the last Congress, 23 Republican Senators voted \nin favor of this legislation when it was offered as an amendment to the \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill. There is a strong bipartisan \nhistory to this legislation and strong public support.\n  No child should be held accountable for the sins of their parents. \nThis targeted, bipartisan legislation recognizes this fact and shows \ncompassion to the innocent. It provides a pathway forward for young men \nand women who have played by the rules all of their lives, graduated \nhigh school and now want to give back to this country. These are young \npeople who truly deserve a second chance. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7415-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7415-S7416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REMEMBERING STAFF SERGEANT HAROLD ``GEORGE'' BENNETT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of U.S. \nArmy SSG Harold ``George'' Bennett. In the jungles of Vietnam, this \nyoung Arkansan displayed courage and honor while serving his Nation in \nuniform. Tragically, he became the first American prisoner of war \nexecuted by the Viet Cong. This year marks the 45th anniversary of his \ndeath, and I am proud to join his family later this month to \nposthumously honor him with the Silver Star, the third highest military \ndecoration that can be awarded to a member of any branch of the U.S. \nArmed Forces.\n  George Bennett was born on October 16, 1940, in Perryville, AR, a \nsmall town that rests just northwest of Little Rock in the foothills of \nthe Ozarks. His father, Gordon, was a veteran of World War I, and he \ninstilled in his sons the values and rewards of service to country. All \nfour would follow his footsteps into the U.S. Army.\n  SGT George Bennett was trained in the Army as an airborne infantryman \nand served with the famed 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, made up of \nsome of the finest soldiers in the world. He earned his Master \nParachute Wings and Expert Infantry Badge before volunteering in 1964 \nfor service in what was a relatively unknown area of Southeast Asia \ncalled Vietnam.\n  While deployed, Sergeant Bennett served as an infantry advisor to the \n33rd Ranger Battalion, one of South Vietnam's best trained and toughest \nunits. On December 29, 1964, they were airlifted to the village of Binh \nGia after it had been overrun by a division of Viet Cong. Immediately \nupon landing, Sergeant Bennett's unit was confronted by a well-dug-in \nregiment of enemy forces, and despite fighting furiously and \ncourageously throughout the afternoon, their unit was decimated and \noverrun. Sergeant Bennett and his radio operator, PFC Charles Crafts, \nfell into the hands of the Viet Cong.\n  Before being captured, Sergeant Bennett twice called off American \nhelicopter pilots who were attempting to navigate through the combat \nzone to rescue him and his radioman. Displaying a remarkably calm \ndemeanor, his focus seemed to be on their safety and not his own. His \nlast words to his would-be rescuers were, ``Well, they are here now. My \nlittle people [his term for the South Vietnamese soldiers under his \ncommand] are laying down their weapons and they want me to turn off my \nradio. Thanks a lot for your help and God Bless You.''\n  As a prisoner of war, the only thing more remarkable than the \ncourageous resistance he displayed throughout his captivity was his \nsteadfast devotion to duty, honor, and country. His faith in God and \nthe trust of his fellow prisoners was unshakable. Sadly, the only way \nhis captors could break his spirit of resistance was to execute him. \nToday, Sergeant Bennett lies in an unmarked grave known only to God, \nsomewhere in the jungles of Vietnam.\n  Mr. President, Sergeant Bennett was a selfless young man who answered \nhis Nation's call to service and placed duty and honor above all else. \nAlthough he may no longer be with us, the example and selflessness of \nthis brave young Arkansan will forever live on in our\n\n[[Page S7416]]\n\nhearts. While a grateful nation could never adequately express their \ndebt to men like George Bennett, it should take every opportunity to \nhonor them and their families for the sacrifice they have paid on our \nbehalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7416-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER LAWSON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week the Vermont Department of \nEducation announced that Jennifer Lawson of Waltham, VT, has been named \nVermont's 2011 Teacher of the Year. I am proud to call her selection to \nthe Senate's attention, and I offer hearty congratulations to Ms. \nLawson and thank her for her dedication to the students of Vermont.\n  A graduate of the University of Vermont with a bachelor's degree in \nelementary education and a master's degree in education from \nConnecticut College, Jennifer Lawson has spent 12 years in the \nclassroom. Prior to her current role as a social studies and language \narts teacher at Vergennes Union High School, she taught as an \nelementary school teacher in Vergennes. Her success as an educator \nstems from her ability to inspire students to challenge themselves and \ntheir peers in a positive learning environment. She champions her \nstudents' individuality and encourages them to bring their life \nexperiences into the classroom.\n  In Vermont, schools are at the core of our communities. Our kids are \nthe seed corn of the future that we want for our state and its people. \nVermonters understand the importance of giving our children a quality \neducation, and they understand that a child's education begins well \nbefore their first day of school and will continue long after their \nlast graduation day. Jennifer Lawson brings this philosophy into \npractice every time she enters the classroom. She recognized quickly \nthat educating students involves so much more than just talking about a \nsubject.\n  Even outside the classroom Jennifer is involved in improving the \neducation in her community. She serves on several of her school's \ncommittees, including the Adequate Yearly Progress Team for Literacy; \nshe is a coleader of the Afterschool Program for Reading and Math; and \nshe serves as a member on the assessment design and research team. \nAlong with her efforts close to home she has been published nationally \non alternative energy sources for schools and has given a presentation \non Expeditionary Learning Schools for Outward Bound. I am glad that she \nwill expand her role within our State even further this year as she \nconsults with other educators throughout Vermont in her role as Teacher \nof the Year.\n  As I told Jennifer when I called her this week, Marcelle and I are \nproud of her and the extraordinary work she does on behalf of Vermont \nchildren. Vermont will be superbly represented in the national \ncompetition for Teacher of the Year next spring. I congratulate her on \nthis honor, and I hope she spends many more years inspiring young \nminds.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of an \narticle in The Burlington Free Press about Ms. Lawson.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Burlington FreePress.com]\n\n    Vergennes Teacher Is State's Best, Jennifer Lawson Plays To Her \n                          Students' Strengths\n\n                            (By Lynn Monty)\n\n       Teacher Jennifer Lawson looked classy--but cool--dressed in \n     tall green leather boots that matched her mohair vest and \n     nail polish this morning as she guided her class through a \n     lesson called ``echoes.''\n       One student said, ``They say I'm spoiled'' as another \n     echoed back, ``I say I'm fortunate.''\n       Another said, ``They say I'm a geek,'' as another echoed \n     back, ``I say they don't know me.''\n       The students wrote each statement and echo. The exercise is \n     just one of the many tools 38-year-old Lawson, of Waltham, \n     uses to empower her students and is part of the reason she \n     was chosen 2011 Vermont Teacher of the Year.\n       Lawson is a middle school language arts and social studies \n     teacher at Vergennes Union High School. As winner of the \n     state award, she will travel across Vermont to work with \n     other teachers and compete for the National Teacher of the \n     Year award. In the spring, she heads to Washington for a \n     reception at the White House. Lawson is a native Vermonter \n     who has worked at VUHS for six years.\n       ``It's amazing, humbling and flattering,'' Lawson said. \n     ``It's an award for my students more so than for me because \n     it's the students who get me excited.''\n       Lawson said it's important to her to know students \n     individually and to recognize who they are. She said her goal \n     as a teacher is to celebrate her students and broaden their \n     perspective of the world. ``In a lot of ways school is home \n     away from home,'' she said. ``The experiences here should be \n     celebrated and connections should be made with their life \n     experiences outside of school.''\n       Lawson taught at Vergennes Union Elementary School prior to \n     taking the position at the high school. She has 12 years of \n     classroom experience and holds a master's of education from \n     Connecticut College and a bachelor's in elementary education \n     from the University of Vermont.\n       Lawson's father, Robert Lawson, recently retired from the \n     University of Vermont after 44 years of teaching. He has \n     observed his daughter in the classroom on many occasions.\n       ``It's a wonderful recognition,'' he said of the award. \n     ``Jennifer is very fond of this community. She gives from her \n     heart and mind and she teaches her students to problem-solve, \n     to be cooperative, to read and to be friendly. I am just very \n     happy for her today.''\n       As students left the soft lighting and comfy couches in \n     Jennifer Lawson's classroom to attend the assembly being held \n     in her honor, eighth-grader Dana Ambrose, 13, praised his \n     teacher. ``She's really great and helps us a lot. Personally \n     I don't read that great, but she has helped me improve. I am \n     thankful for that. She's a great teacher and just loves to \n     help everybody.''\n       Vermont Education Board Chairwoman Fayneese Miller said \n     that when the Department of Education chooses a teacher of \n     the year, the goal is to choose someone who has the ability \n     to excite young people, to encourage them to use their \n     imagination and to think about possibilities. ``I think \n     that's what she embodies,'' Miller said. ``She cares about \n     her students and loves learning and encourages learning in \n     her students. She's a highly effective teacher.''\n       But it's not only the students that Lawson is teaching. \n     Para-educator Erika Lynch is a newly licensed teacher who has \n     been working alongside Lawson for two years.\n       ``Being in rooms with her is really good for me because I \n     can learn from her,'' Lynch said. ``I am picking up things \n     that hopefully I can use one day in my own classroom. Jenn \n     creates a learning community where kids feel safe and take \n     chances, where they are challenged but they are able to meet \n     those challenges. It's because she meets kids at their level. \n     She does a great job of creating an environment that makes it \n     easier for kids to learn.''\n       Miller introduced Lawson at the assembly. ``By the round of \n     applause it is obvious Jennifer Lawson is someone who is \n     revered, respected and loved,'' she said.\n       As Lawson accepted the crystal apple that Miller handed \n     her, she received a standing ovation from the packed \n     auditorium and said above the din, ``I love my job and I love \n     you guys.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7416-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            ARKANSAS'S FINALISTS FOR ``TEACHER OF THE YEAR''\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, today I celebrate the 25th \nanniversary of the\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n\nArkansas Blues and Heritage Festival, a beloved, time-honored tradition \nin my hometown of Helena, AR.\n  The Arkansas Blues and Heritage Festival, formerly known as the King \nBiscuit Blues Festival, is one of the Nation's foremost showcases of \nblues music. Held for 3 days annually in October, tens of thousands of \nblues enthusiasts converge on historic downtown Helena. This year's \nfestival features legendary blues musician B.B. King, along with nearly \n50 other blues performances. The event will be held October 7 to 9, \nwith projected attendance figures of nearly 80,000.\n  I have often joined my fellow Helena residents to celebrate and enjoy \nthis annual tradition, and I am proud of the community's efforts to \nkeep alive the history and heritage of blues music.\n  Founded in 1986, the first festival was a 1-day event, with a small \ngathering of local residents and a flatbed truck as a stage. Since \nthen, the festival has grown to a 3-day event, with three stages and \nseveral activities, such as the Kenneth Freemyer 5K Run, the Blues in \nSchools program, and the Tour da' Delta bicycle tour.\n  I congratulate the organizers and leadership of the Arkansas Blues \nand Heritage Festival, along with all my fellow Helena residents. I \nwish them all the best as they celebrate 25 years of the Arkansas Blues \nand Heritage Festival.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7417-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING DIRK LEACH RUSTIC ARTS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as lobster bakes and vacations along \nthe picturesque northeastern coast fade with the summer months, today I \nhonor a craftsman and small business owner in my home State of Maine \nwho keeps the feeling of the season alive by marrying function, \ncomfort, beauty, tradition, and love of the outdoors--quintessentially \nMaine characteristics--with the iconic Adirondack chair.\n  Located along the Saco River in the town of Buxton, Dirk Leach Rustic \nArts is a one-of-a-kind business devoted to one man's dream of creating \nthe perfect Adirondack chair. The company's owner, Dirk Leach, \nmaintains the tradition of ``rustic artistry'' by walking through \nMaine's woodlands in late fall and winter to gather materials for one \nof his Shaker creations. An artist and an innovator, Mr. Leach \ndescribes himself as ``obsessed with the Adirondack chair form,'' and \ndraws inspiration from the simple, functional forms of Shaker design. \nMr. Leach's sketches help him translate his varying ideas into unique \nprototypes and, finally, innovative seating pieces with wide seat \nplanks, thick arm rests, and clean lines.\n  Since the mid 1990s, Dirk Leach has fashioned Adirondack chairs and \nsettees from a variety of trees native to Maine, such as red oak, white \nash, yellow birch, and sugar maple. Perhaps most creatively, Mr. Leach \ntransforms pin cherry and gray birch into hand-hewn candlesticks and a \nnumber of accessories. Mr. Leach lovingly builds, paints, signs, and \ndates his exceptional and unique creations, which are all beautifully \nhandcrafted and guaranteed for life. While his most popular designs \ninclude the traditional Weekender chairs to the more eclectic \nNor'easter chairs, Mr. Leach has pledged to design 100 variations of \nthe outdoor classic by alternating back height, seat angles, hardware, \nand color. Moreover, chairs can be built to withstand even the coldest \nof Maine's winters, as they are constructed of weather tight white oak \nand finished in the finest exterior house paint on the market.\n  And although Mainers have come to anticipate traditional white \nAdirondack chairs assembled along campfires and lazily arranged in the \nbackyard, Dirk Leach is renowned for applying layers of paint in colors \ninspired by nature itself, from colors such as iris, prairie grass, and \nwarm earth, to vivid shades of crocus, coral, and pistachio.\n  Touted as the ``Best Maine Adirondack Chair'' by Down East Magazine \nin July 2010, Dirk Leach Rustic Arts has been working to keep up with \ndemand since the Maine publication hit newsstands. And when he wasn't \ndrawing up his newest designs, Mr. Leach has spent time traveling to \nWisconsin, New York, and throughout Maine--from July to September--\ndemonstrating his rustic woodworking craftsmanship and techniques.\n  While small businesses are most notably touted as drivers of our \nnational economy, and rightly so, they can sometimes be overlooked for \ntheir often more subtle contributions to design, quality, and \ninnovative vision. Whether his customers utilize these chairs to gaze \nout at the ocean or sit around a campfire, Dirk Leach's designs are \nfunctional works of art meant to last for generations. I commend Dirk \nLeach on the passion he lends to his craft, and I wish him nothing but \nsuccess in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7417-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7417-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7417-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7417-S7418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:38 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2923.

A bill to prohibit the Secretary of Education from \npromulgating regulations or guidance regarding gainful employment for \npurposes of titles I or IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Education for \nAll Act in order to preserve educational and economic opportunities for \nall Americans.\n  The U.S. Department of Education is proposing new ``gainful \nemployment'' rules that would deny federal financial aid to students \nwho attend proprietary colleges and vocational certificate programs. \nThese rules would disqualify students from receiving federal education \nloans if their chosen programs do not meet a complex formula comparing \nstudent debt to future earning potential. Why should students be \ndiscouraged from attending a school they want or a profession they \nchose because of Washington bureaucrats?\n  The bill I am introducing today would prohibit these regulations from \ngoing into effect.\n  The ``gainful employment'' rules could deny hundreds of thousands of \nstudents access to the training and skills development they need to \nsecure a job in today's troubled economy. There is high demand in some \nsectors for highly skilled workers and propriety schools are uniquely \nqualified to meet the training needs of these employers. It is simply \nirresponsible for the government to throw roadblocks in front of \nstudents and institutions at a time when job creation in America should \nbe the administration's number one priority.\n  Further, the ``gainful employment'' rules will disproportionately \nharm low-income and minority students. These students often depend more \nheavily on education loans regardless of the type of institution they \nattend and take longer to repay.\n  The rules would also significantly impact health care programs. \nNearly half of all healthcare workers are trained at proprietary \nschools. With an aging baby boom population, demand for trained health \ncare providers is already critical and will only get worse. President \nObama's healthcare law adds to this burden as well. We ought to be \nexpanding educational capacity for health care workers, not enacting \nregulations that threaten access.\n  In short, this legislation will preserve educational and economic \nopportunities for all Americans.

Res. 640\n\n       Whereas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \n     was founded in 1967 ``to strengthen further the existing \n     bonds of regional solidarity and cooperation'';\n       Whereas ASEAN membership has now expanded to include 10 \n     countries, which together span over half the size of the \n     continental United States, with a total population of nearly \n     600,000,000 persons;\n       Whereas ASEAN is an important contributor to stability and \n     prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas ASEAN partners with the United States Government \n     and others in the international community to address \n     transnational problems like terrorism, environmental \n     degradation, the international financial crisis, and maritime \n     security;\n       Whereas the ASEAN Charter, approved by Southeast Asia's \n     leaders in November 2007, codified norms for the behavior of \n     ASEAN member-states toward their own citizens, covering such \n     subjects as individual rights, democracy, the rule of law, \n     and good governance;\n       Whereas the combined economy of ASEAN's member countries, \n     valued at approximately $1,500,000,000,000 in 2008, \n     constitutes the fourth largest market for United States \n     exports, and two-way United States-ASEAN trade in goods and \n     services totaled over $200,000,000,000 in 2008;\n       Whereas Southeast Asia is the largest destination for \n     United States foreign direct investment in Asia;\n       Whereas almost 40,000 students from ASEAN countries studied \n     in the United States in 2008, and an increasing number of \n     United States citizens are studying abroad in these \n     countries;\n       Whereas the United States Government recognizes the \n     centrality of ASEAN to regional cooperation and problem-\n     solving in the Asia Pacific;\n       Whereas the United States was the first country to appoint \n     an Ambassador to ASEAN;\n       Whereas the United States acceded to the Treaty of Amity \n     and Cooperation in Southeast Asia during the July 2009 ASEAN \n     ministerial meetings in Thailand;\n       Whereas the United States launched a new collaboration with \n     the Lower Mekong Countries--Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and \n     Vietnam--in the areas of the environment, health, and \n     education in July 2009 in Thailand;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama stated at the first meeting \n     of the leaders of ASEAN and the United States held in \n     Singapore in November 2009, ``The United States is committed \n     to strengthening its engagement in Southeast Asia both with \n     our individual allies and partners, and with ASEAN as an \n     institution.'';\n       Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at the July \n     2010 ASEAN ministerial meetings in Vietnam that the United \n     States was ``committed to assisting the nations of Southeast \n     Asia to remain strong and independent, and [to helping \n     ensure] that each nation enjoys peace, stability, prosperity, \n     and access to universal human rights'';\n       Whereas Secretary of State Clinton and Secretary of Defense \n     Robert Gates have stated the intention of the United States \n     to increase participation in regional institutions, including \n     the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting \n     Plus Eight, both to be held in October 2010 in Vietnam; and\n       Whereas the second meeting of ASEAN and United States \n     Government leaders, and the first to be hosted by the United \n     States, will take place in New York City, New York on \n     September 24, 2010: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to welcome the leaders of ASEAN to the United States \n     for the second ASEAN-United States summit meeting;\n       (2) that the decision to host the second ASEAN-United \n     States summit in New York City reflects the importance of \n     ASEAN and its member-states to the United States, and the \n     importance of the United States to ASEAN and its member-\n     states;\n       (3) that the United States Government should continue to \n     seek ways to broaden and deepen its economic, political-\n     security, social, and cultural engagement with the countries \n     in Southeast Asia toward a closer partnership with ASEAN and \n     its member-states,\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\n     as well as other regional institutions in the Asia-Pacific \n     region;\n       (4) that the United States Government is committed to \n     working with all ASEAN member-states to encourage the \n     development of open and free democratic institutions in Burma \n     that allow for the full participation of political opposition \n     and ethnic minority groups; and\n       (5) that a stronger, more integrated ASEAN serves shared \n     interests in regional peace, stability, and prosperity.\n\n                              S. Res. 641\n\n       Whereas on September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita made landfall \n     as a Category 3 hurricane just east of the Texas-Louisiana \n     border, between Sabine Pass and Johnson's Bayou, with wind \n     speeds of 120 miles per hour, and further devastated the Gulf \n     Coast, which had already been hit by Hurricane Katrina;\n       Whereas Hurricane Rita caused 7 deaths, forced 3,000,000 \n     residents to evacuate their homes, caused flooding and \n     tornadoes in the States of Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, \n     and Alabama, and, according to the National Climatic Data \n     Center, left 1,000,000 people without electricity;\n       Whereas damages from Hurricane Rita are estimated at \n     $11,300,000,000;\n       Whereas in 2005, Hurricane Rita was the second hurricane to \n     reach Category 5 status in the Gulf of Mexico, which, \n     according to the National Climatic Data Center, is only the \n     third time that more than one Category 5 storm has formed in \n     the Atlantic in the same year;\n       Whereas the storm surge from Hurricane Rita was as high as \n     15 feet near the landfall site and, according to the United \n     States Geological Survey, traveled as far as 50 miles inland, \n     causing disastrous flooding and massive loss of property;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the \n     States of Louisiana and Texas were destroyed by the flooding; \n     and\n       Whereas the National Wetlands Center of the United States \n     Geological Survey indicates that 217 square miles of the \n     coastal land of the State of Louisiana were transformed to \n     water after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) observes the 5th anniversary of the date on which \n     Hurricane Rita devastated the coasts of the States of \n     Louisiana and Texas;\n       (2) expresses the support of the Senate to the survivors of \n     Hurricane Rita and the condolences of the Senate to the \n     families of the victims of Hurricane Rita;\n       (3) commends the courageous efforts of those who assisted \n     in the response to the storm and the recovery process;\n       (4) recognizes the contributions the affected communities \n     in the States of Louisiana and Texas have made to the United \n     States; and\n       (5) reaffirms the commitment of the Senate to rebuild, \n     renew, and restore the Gulf Coast region.\n\n                              S. Res. 642\n\n       Whereas, in 1983, the Institute of Medicine recommended \n     that nursing research be included in biomedical and \n     behavioral science research;\n       Whereas the Health Research Extension Act of 1985 (Public \n     Law 99-158; 99 Stat. 820) established the National Center for \n     Nursing Research (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Center'') within the National Institutes of Health to \n     disseminate information related to basic and clinical nursing \n     research;\n       Whereas the National Center for Nursing Research excelled \n     in carrying out the purpose of the Center to provide research \n     training and fellowships in the areas of disease prevention, \n     health promotion, and nursing care for individuals with acute \n     and chronic illnesses and the families of those individuals;\n       Whereas Congress, recognizing the contributions of the \n     National Center for Nursing Research to improving quality \n     care and health, redesignated the Center as the National \n     Institute of Nursing Research (referred to in this preamble \n     as the ``NINR'') through the enactment of the National \n     Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law \n     103-43; 107 Stat. 122);\n       Whereas the research focus of the NINR for the 25 years \n     prior to the approval of this resolution has resulted in \n     advances in nursing science at all stages of the lifespan of \n     an individual;\n       Whereas the mission of the NINR is to promote and improve \n     the health of individuals, families, communities, and \n     vulnerable populations of the United States;\n       Whereas the NINR views nursing science as the cornerstone \n     for integrating biological and behavioral sciences, exploring \n     innovations, and improving research methods;\n       Whereas research funded by the NINR has improved the health \n     outcomes and enhanced the quality of life of the people of \n     the United States by managing disease and relieving symptoms \n     of disease;\n       Whereas the NINR is committed to helping to eliminate the \n     health disparities facing minority and disadvantaged \n     populations across the United States;\n       Whereas the NINR holds the principal responsibility for \n     end-of-life research conducted at the National Institutes of \n     Health; and\n       Whereas the NINR spends a remarkable 7 percent of the \n     budget of the NINR on training new researchers, ensuring that \n     the number of nurse scientists and the faculty educating the \n     next generation of professional nursing students continues to \n     grow: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the National Institute of Nursing \n     Research on the occasion of its 25th anniversary; and\n       (2) commends the National Institute of Nursing Research for \n     its ongoing support of nursing research, which is integral to \n     the health of the people of the United States.\n\n                              S. Res. 643\n\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are nonprofit \n     community-based health care sites that offer primary care and \n     wellness services based on the nursing model;\n       Whereas the nursing model emphasizes the protection, \n     promotion, and optimization of health as well as the \n     prevention of illness and the alleviation of suffering along \n     with diagnosis and treatment;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are led by advanced \n     practice nurses and staffed by an interdisciplinary team of \n     highly qualified health care professionals;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offer a broad scope of \n     services that may include treatment for acute and chronic \n     illnesses, routine physical exams, immunizations for adults \n     and children, disease screenings, health education, prenatal \n     care, dental care, and drug and alcohol treatment;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics have a proven track \n     record, as the first federally funded nurse-managed health \n     clinic was created more than 30 years prior to the date of \n     approval of this resolution;\n       Whereas, as of the date of approval of this resolution, \n     more than 200 nurse-managed health clinics provide care \n     across the United States and record over 2,000,000 client \n     encounters annually;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics serve a unique dual \n     role as both safety net access points and health workforce \n     development sites, given that the majority of nurse-managed \n     health clinics are affiliated with schools of nursing and \n     serve as clinical education sites for health professions \n     students;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the health \n     care safety net by expanding access to primary care and \n     chronic disease management services for vulnerable and \n     medically underserved populations in diverse rural, urban, \n     and suburban communities;\n       Whereas research has shown that nurse-managed health \n     clinics experience high patient retention and patient \n     satisfaction rates, and nurse-managed health clinic patients \n     experience higher rates of generic medication fills and lower \n     hospitalization rates when compared to similar safety net \n     providers; and\n       Whereas the use of nurse-managed health clinics offering \n     both primary care and wellness services will help meet this \n     increased demand in a cost-effective manner: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 3, 2010, as \n     ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week'';\n       (2) supports the ideals and goals of National Nurse-Managed \n     Health Clinic Week; and\n       (3) encourages the expansion of nurse-managed health \n     clinics so that nurse-managed health clinics may continue to \n     serve as health care workforce development sites for the next \n     generation of primary care providers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "23", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/23/senate-section/article/S7427-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
