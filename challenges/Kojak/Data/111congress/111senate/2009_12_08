The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past several days, Americans \nhave seen in vivid detail what some supporters of this plan plan to do \nfor the Medicare Program for seniors. They plan to use it as a giant \npiggy bank to pay for an entirely new government program. Yesterday, we \nheard floated, for the very first time, that they want to radically \nexpand Medicare. So what is becoming abundantly clear is that the \nmajority will make any deal, agree to any terms, sign any dotted line \nthat brings them closer to final passage of this terrible bill. They \nentertain adding new experiments without any assessment of the impact \nthis backroom deal-making will have on the American people or our \neconomy. They are, for lack of a better term, winging it on one of the \nmost consequential pieces of legislation affecting our country in \nmemory.\n  Let me suggest to the majority, Americans would much rather we get it \nright than scurry around, throwing together untested, last-minute \nexperiments in order to get 60 votes before Christmas. Let me say that \nagain. Americans would much rather we get it right than scurry around, \nthrowing together untested, last-minute experiments in order to get 60 \nvotes before Christmas.\n  Over the past several days, our friends on the other side repeatedly \nvoted to preserve nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts to finance \ntheir vision of reform, a vision that includes cutting nearly $8 \nbillion from hospice care, $40 billion in cuts to home health agencies, \n$120 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage, $135 billion in cuts to \nhospitals that serve Medicare patients, and nearly $15 billion in cuts \nto nursing homes. What these cuts really illustrate is a lack of vision \nbecause cutting one troubled government program in order to create \nanother is a mistake. I will say that again: $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to \nMedicare for seniors is not reform.\n\n  But Medicare cuts are just one leg of the stool holding up this \nmisguided vision of reform. Let's take a look at another. Let's look at \nhow this bill punishes not only seniors but how it kills jobs at a time \nwhen 1 in 10 working Americans is looking for one. This bill doesn't \njust punish seniors, it punishes job creators too.\n  That is the message we got yesterday from small businesses across the \ncountry. They sent us a letter opposing this bill because it doesn't do \nthe things proponents of this bill promised it would. It doesn't lower \ncosts, it doesn't help create jobs, and it doesn't help the economy. \nHere are just some of the groups that signed that letter: the \nAssociated Builders and Contractors, the Associated General \nContractors, the International Food Service Distributors Association, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, the National Association of \nWholesale Distributors, the National Retail Federation, Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Here is what these groups had to say about this bill. I am reading \nfrom their letter dated December 7, 2009, a letter that was addressed \nto every Member of the Senate:\n\n       In order to finance part of its $2.5 trillion price tag, HR \n     3590 imposes new taxes, fees and penalties totaling nearly \n     half a trillion dollars. This financial burden falls \n     disproportionately on the backs of small business. Small \n     firms are in desperate need of this precious capital for job \n     creation, investment, business expansion, and survival.\n\n  The letter goes on to detail all the ways in which this bill punishes \nsmall businesses, thus making it harder for them to retain or hire \nworkers. These groups point out that under this bill, small businesses \nin the United States would see major cost increases as a result of new \ntaxes on health benefits and health insurance, costs that would be \npassed on to employees and which would make health insurance more \nexpensive, not less.\n  Under this bill, self-employed business owners who buy coverage for \nthemselves could see a double-digit jump in their insurance premiums. \nFor other small businesses, the bill won't lead to a significant \ndecrease in cost--something they were promised as a result of the bill.\n  Under this bill, jobs would be lost and wages depressed as a result \nof a new law that would require businesses either to buy insurance for \ntheir employees or to pay a fine.\n  Needless to say, this is not the kind of legislation the American \nworker needs or wants at a moment of double-digit unemployment. Perhaps \nthat is the reason that poll after poll after public opinion poll shows \nthat the American worker opposes this bill.\n  Some business groups may have supported this plan earlier in the year \nbecause they thought it was inevitable.\n\n[[Page S12649]]\n\nThey didn't want to be critical of a bill they thought they had no \npower to stop. But something happened between then and now: The \nAmerican people realized what this bill meant for them. They realized \nwhat it would mean for seniors, for business owners, for the economy, \nfor our future as a country. Americans stood up, they made their voices \nheard, and now the tide has turned. The American people oppose this \nbill. They want us to start over. They want us to make commonsense, \nstep-by-step reforms that everyone can support, not some backroom deal \nto have the government take over the health care system that is then \nforced on the American people without discussion.\n  Our friends on the other side can read the writing on the wall. They \nknow the American people oppose this bill. But they have apparently \nmade a calculation to force it through Congress over the next several \ndays before the American people even have a chance to absorb the \ndetails. The only thing that can stop them is the realization by \nDemocrats themselves that this plan would be a tragic mistake for \nseniors, for the economy, and for our country and that a better path \nwould be the kind of step-by-step reforms Americans have been asking of \nus, reforms Americans really want. Americans don't think reform should \ncome at the expense of seniors, and they don't think it should come at \nthe expense of jobs. They don't think it should make current problems \nworse.\n\n\n                                  TARP\n\n  Mr. President, we are now hearing talk that the administration is \nthinking of using the bank bailout TARP money that taxpayers \nreluctantly handed over during last year's credit crisis on another \nspending spree like the stimulus which they said would stop \nunemployment at 8 percent but hasn't. One trillion dollars later, \nunemployment is now at 10 percent. This is not only irresponsible, \nsince the purpose of these emergency funds was to prop up the credit \nsystem in the midst of a crisis, it also violates both current law and \nthe pledge we made that every dollar we got back would be returned to \nthe taxpayer to reduce the national debt. That is the pledge we made \nwhen we passed the TARP proposal.\n  This proposal from the administration is completely wrongheaded, but \nit is perfectly illustrative of the way Democrats in Congress have been \ndealing with taxpayer money all year--by throwing it at one problem \nafter another without much regard for the consequences. Whether it is \nthe stimulus, Cash for Clunkers, or the health care bill that is \ncurrently on the Senate floor, Americans are running out of patience \nwith politicians who promise jobs but who deliver nothing but more \ndebt, higher taxes, and longer unemployment lines.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, I would \nlike to take a moment to lay out today's program. It has been more than \n2\\1/2\\ weeks since the majority leader moved to proceed to the health \ncare reform bill, and this is the ninth day of debate. The Senate has \nconsidered 18 amendments or motions. We have conducted 14 rollcall \nvotes.\n  Today, the Senate will debate the amendment by the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Nelson, on a woman's right to choose. At the same time, \nwe will debate the motion by Senator McCain on Medicare Advantage.\n  The time between now and the caucus lunches is for debate only. The \nmajority will control the first hour of debate this morning; the \nRepublicans will control the second hour.\n  We are hopeful the Senate will be able to conduct votes on or in \nrelation to the Nelson amendment, a side-by-side amendment to the \nMcCain motion, and the McCain motion sometime this afternoon.\n  Thereafter, we expect to turn to another Democratic first-degree \namendment, which is likely to be the amendment by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, on drug reimportation, and another Republican \nfirst-degree amendment. We are working on lining up those amendments.\n  I note that the pending McCain motion is the third such effort by the \nRepublicans to defend the private insurance companies that run the \nprogram called Medicare Advantage. That is the same so-called Medicare \nAdvantage Program that the nonpartisan MedPAC says is overpaid--\noverpaid by 14 percent--compared with traditional Medicare, which does \nthe same thing.\n  That is the same so-called Medicare Advantage Program whose \noverpayments add $90 to the Medicare premiums of a typical retired \ncouple, even though that couple gets nothing in exchange.\n  That is the same so-called Medicare Advantage Program that has been \nthe major source of strong profits for the private insurance companies \nthat receive those overpayments. And that is the same so-called \nMedicare Advantage Program that helps those private insurance companies \nto pay their CEOs $8 million a year, $9 million a year, and in one \ninstance more than $20 million a year in compensation.\n  So that is the same so-called Medicare Advantage Program that, in our \nview, needs a healthy dose of competition. That is all our bill would \ndo. Our bill would move to competitive bidding in the private insurance \nMedicare market. It is high time we did so.\n  This morning we are going to have a colloquy among many new Senators, \nthe group of Senators who were just elected last year, which is a very \nactive group. I have met with them many times. They are very \nthoughtful, very active, and they have a lot to say.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be very brief because we want to take \nthe time to hear from our colleagues. I, too, want to commend them. A \nnumber of them serve on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee and were tremendously valuable in helping us craft the \nlegislation we now have before us in this compromised, melded bill.\n  I also want to make a note. I listened to the Republican leader this \nmorning--and I will talk more about this later--but you would almost \nbegin to believe that 300 days ago Barack Obama arrived as President of \nthe United States, and all these problems emerged miraculously. The \nfact is, in the previous 8 years we watched the Nation accumulate more \ndebt in one administration than all prior 43 administrations combined.\n  The situation we find ourselves in economically did not happen \novernight. It happened over a number of years of carelessness, with a \nlack of regulation and a lack of the enforcement of the regulation that \nexisted. We have been grappling with these problems. In December of \nlast year, more than 700,000 people lost their jobs--in that 1 month \nalone. In January, almost 700,000 again, and the same was true in \nMarch. Almost 3 million jobs were lost before the ink on the \ninauguration papers was dry.\n  We are now finding ourselves--while still too high an unemployment \nrate--with a vastly improved economic condition in this country. Much \nmore needs to be done. Yet we hear the same sort of ``Chicken Little'' \narguments. Just say no, every time, to an idea that might make a \ndifference to this country getting back on its feet again.\n  Certainly the decisions made a year ago to provide the stabilization \nof major financial institutions contributed directly to the benefits we \nare seeing today. Certainly the efforts of taking some of these \nresources that have gone to bail out major financial institutions now \nbeing used to try to create jobs in the country is something I think \nwould be welcomed by the American people--not rejected by Members of \nCongress who seem only to be interested in whether we are going to take \ncare of those large firms that got us into this mess in the first \nplace.\n  So I welcome the President's ideas in this area. We welcome \nparticularly this effort on health care, to make a difference not only \nfor individuals but for our economy, to reduce those costs, reduce \nthose premiums, and make those insurance products available to all \nAmericans who worry every night about whether they are going to fall \ninto that abyss because of a health care crisis that happens to a \nfamily member or a loved one.\n  So today we are going to hear from a number of our colleagues who \nhave been deeply engaged in these issues over the last several years \nand in their new membership in this wonderful body of the Senate. I \nwelcome tremendously their efforts.\n\n[[Page S12650]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to allow them to discuss their \nideas. I believe the first one to speak is our new colleague from \nDelaware.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I want to start by agreeing--and I \npractically always agree with the Senator from Connecticut--with his \nsummation as to how we got to where we are, and why it is important we \ndo something about it. He is right. The chairman of the Finance \nCommittee is right too.\n  The freshman Senators who come from all over this country got \ntogether and, frankly, with the leadership of Senator Warner from \nVirginia, put together a package which I think is a very constructive \npackage for the Health Care Reform Act we have to pass.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to join with the other freshmen, \nincluding the Acting President pro tempore, to discuss the unique \nopportunity we have to finally enact meaningful health care reform.\n  Make no mistake, we need health care reform now. When you look out \nthere and you see everything from rising premiums to insurers denying \ncoverage for people with preexisting conditions, the health care system \nis failing individual Americans. There is no doubt about that.\n  Not only is it doing that, it is threatening the fiscal solvency of \nour country. Medicare and Medicaid are swallowing up more and more of \nour Federal spending. If we do not act soon, it will become the largest \ncontributor to the deficit.\n  The time for reform is now. We cannot wait any longer. As the Senator \nfrom Connecticut said, this is not something that just came out of \nnowhere. It has been there for a long time. But we cannot let any more \ntime go by. We have to act now.\n\n  Thanks to the hard work of Senators Reid, Baucus, Dodd, and Harkin \nand their staffs, we have a bill before us that can finally reform our \nhealth care system. It is a good bill. It is a bill that truly protects \nwhat works in our system and, at the same time, fixes what is broken.\n  No longer will Americans be denied coverage on the basis of \npreexisting conditions. No longer will their coverage be revoked when \nthey get sick and need it the most. This bill will help protect seniors \nby offering new preventive and wellness benefits.\n  It will extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by an \nadditional 5 years. It will also help our economy by significantly \ncutting health care costs and reducing the Nation's deficit by $130 \nbillion.\n  You hear a lot of numbers. You see a lot of numbers. You read about \nit in the newspaper. Especially, you hear about it on the other side of \nthe aisle. This will cut the deficit by $130 billion for the first 10 \nyears and maybe up to $650 billion in the second 10 years. This will \ntruly bend the cost curve, which we have to do if we are not going to \ngo into insolvency.\n  It is interesting, when the other side talks about deficits, \ndeficits, deficits--the thing that is driving the deficit is health \ncare costs because what drives Medicare and Medicaid costs is health \ncare costs.\n  This bill makes quality, affordable health care within reach of all \nAmericans. But there is always more we can do. That is why I am pleased \nto join my other freshman colleagues to support a very promising \namendment to the bill.\n  So much of what is broken in our present health care system revolves \naround basic inefficiencies that drive up costs, while simultaneously \ndriving down quality. That is right. Costs go up, quality goes down. \nThat is not the way we want to have it. We want costs to go down and \nquality to go up.\n  Even worse, inefficiencies in the system often give way to the waste, \nfraud, and abuse that drains somewhere between $72 and $220 billion \nannually from doctors, patients, private insurers, and the State and \nFederal Governments. This is significantly increasing health care costs \nfor Americans. These are inefficiencies that can and will be curbed.\n  By seeking creative ways to encourage innovation and lower costs even \nfurther--and more quickly--for Americans across the country, this \namendment complements the underlying health care bill.\n  It adopts the full spectrum of 21st-century technologies and \ninnovative methods of delivery to further cut through the redtape that \ncontinues to plague our system and stifle innovation. It provides \ncommonsense, practical solutions that help contain costs, improve \nvalue, and increase quality. It increases penalties for health care \nfraud and enhances enforcement against medical crooks and utilizes the \nmost sophisticated technology to better detect and deter fraud in the \nhealth care system.\n  It quickens the implementation of uniform administrative standards, \nallowing for more efficient exchange of information among patients, \ndoctors, and insurers. It provides more flexibility in establishing \naccountable care organizations that realign financial incentives and \nhelp ensure Americans receive high-quality care. It provides greater \nincentives to insurers in the exchange to reduce health care \ndisparities along racial lines.\n  These are just a few examples of the provisions in the amendment that \nI believe will mesh well with the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act. As I have said before, it is time to gather our collective \nwill and do the right thing during this historic opportunity by passing \nhealth care reform now. I think this amendment can help us reach that \ngoal. We cannot afford to wait any longer. We need to act now. We can \ndo no less. The American people deserve no less.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from Delaware, for his comments and \nfor his leadership on this issue. I also thank all of the freshmen. \nThis is, I think, the seventh time the freshmen have come to the floor \non this very important issue. Our colleagues have had to now endure 65 \nspeeches from the freshmen on the subject of health care.\n  Before I get into my remarks, I want to personally thank Senator \nBaucus, Senator Dodd, the majority leader, and their staffs, for \nworking with the 11 freshmen Members who have come together today to \nunveil a package of health care amendments focused on the issue of cost \ncontainment.\n  We have been working on this now for close to 3 months.\n  Let me say at the outset, I am proud of the enormous broad-based \nsupport we are receiving for this package of amendments. The Business \nRoundtable has endorsed the amendments. Companies such as Walmart, \nIntel, Target and Quad/Graphics endorse this package. Groups such as \nthe AARP and the AFL, and important think tanks such as the New America \nFoundation have endorsed this package. We also have support from Mark \nMcClellan, who was the head of CMS under President Bush. While the \nmerged bill starts to move us in the right direction in addressing \nhealth care spending in this country, this package strengthens that \nmovement. Our package further moves us away from a current system that \nmakes no financial sense--one that rewards volume over quality and one \nthat reimburses hospitals for higher, rather than lower, readmission \nrates.\n  We are taking the payment reform aspects of the health care bill--\nsections that increase accountability, and focus on data mining and \nadministrative simplification--and accelerating them. We are giving the \nSecretary, as we move forward, the ability to take pilot programs and \nbroaden their approach and appeal. And if it works, we'll bring that \nreform to our whole system.\n  While we anticipate a very good score from CBO in terms of lowering \nhealth care costs overall, another thing we focused on with this \npackage is not just health care reform in the context of government-\nrelated programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, but also how we \npartner with those in the private sector.\n  One of the reasons the Business Roundtable is so supportive is the \nfact that our package recognizes that well over half of the American \npublic still receives their health care through private insurance or in \nconjunction with their employers. With these amendments, we look at how \nwe take the best of the private sector, and the lessons we've learned \nfrom them, and bring those into health care reform.\n\n[[Page S12651]]\n\n  My friend, the Senator from Delaware, has raised this point. There \nare still issues to be resolved in this bill.\n  I still have some concerns, particularly with the public option \nportion. But I know that with a good-faith effort, we are going to get \nthose issues resolved.\n  One thing that needs to be reaffirmed, time and time again, is what \nhappens if we don't enact health care reform. Not acting is a policy \nchoice; it is every bit as much of a policy choice as moving forward on \nthis bill. What many don't realize is that the largest driver of our \nFederal deficit is not education funding, transportation funding, and \nnot even TARP funds or the stimulus. The largest driver of our Federal \ndeficit is health care spending.\n  If we fail to act now, Medicare, which provides health care to \nmillions of senior citizens, will go bankrupt in the next 8 years. If \nwe fail to act now, an average Virginia family will see their health \ncare costs eat up 40 percent of their disposable income in the next \ndecade.\n  One of the reasons we are seeing so much broad-based business support \nfor our amendment package is business understands that if we can't \ndrive down overall health care costs, the ability of the United States \nto come out of this recession and remain competitive in a global \nmarketplace will be seriously undermined. As long as American business \nhas to pay twice as much per person--as much as $3,000 to $4,000 more \nper employee--for their health care costs than any of our industrial \ncompetitors around the world, regardless of how productive the American \nworkforce is, American businesses will be at a serious disadvantage.\n  Our amendment package is complex. It is a bit dense. There are some \n30-odd different provisions that take very good parts of the merged \nbill and move them faster. It increases price transparency in health \ncare pricing, and increases our ability to take programs and pilots \nthat work and roll them out on a wider basis. My good friend, the \nSenator from Colorado, has been working hard on the administrative \nreform portion.\n  This is a good package of amendments. I was asked yesterday by \nsomebody in the press how I would describe the package. I guess I would \nsum it up--because some of this stuff gets fairly dense--with two \nthings that this package of amendments is trying to do.\n  I think we all remember, years back, in the travel industry, when you \ncalled up and tried to get an airline reservation and depending on whom \nyou called and what time you called, you might get a totally different \nprice on your airline ticket. Well, this package of amendments is \ntrying to do for health care what Travelocity did for the airline \nbusiness. And that is bring some true pricing transparency to the \nhealth care system.\n  Our package of amendments will move us--it will not get us all the \nway there--but it will move us further down the field. I say this \nmodestly, again, to the originators of the bill--it is a very good \nbill, a very good framework. But humbly I might say, as some know, I \nwas lucky enough in the old days to fall into the cell phone industry. \nI managed to eke out a small living in that industry. I like to think \nabout the cell phone industry as a metaphor for this package of \namendments. If we think of the original bill as creating the cell phone \nof the 20th century, our package of amendments is basically the iPhone \nversion to your Motorola flip phone original version. We literally \nprovide dozens of new applications on a good, basic framework that has \nbeen provided by this merged bill. And we take these applications a \nlittle bit further into the 21st century.\n  I am very proud of the work all these freshmen Senators and their \nstaffs have done over the last 3 or 4 months. Again, I thank the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, the chairman of the HELP Committee, \nthe majority leader and their staffs for helping us work through this \npackage, and I look forward to its adoption.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I believe the junior Senator from \nColorado will speak next.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to thank our colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, for his extraordinary leadership throughout \nthis process of the freshmen coming together to see what we can do to \nmove this legislation forward to improve it. I think a lot has been \nsaid about how the bill that was drafted by the HELP Committee, by the \nFinance Committee, and now by the majority leader is directionally \ncorrect in its efforts to get a handle on these skyrocketing costs. I \nthink this amendment package will move us much further in the right \ndirection of trying to hold down costs for our working families and \nsmall businesses across the country.\n  Throughout this entire debate and going back to the very beginning, \nwhat I have said is, no matter where you are on many of the issues, \nthere can't be any disagreement that the current system, with respect \nto costs, is completely insane. Our families in Colorado faced double-\ndigit cost increases every year over the last decade. Their median \nfamily income has actually gone down by $300, and the cost of health \ncare has gone up by 97 percent over that period of time. Our small \nbusinesses are paying 18 percent more for health insurance than large \nbusinesses just because they are small. As the Senator from Virginia \nwas mentioning, we are spending, as a country, more than twice what \nalmost any other industrialized country in the world is spending as a \npercentage of our gross domestic product on health care. We are \nspending roughly 18 percent, going to 20 percent in the blink of an \neye. We can't hope to compete in this global economy if we are devoting \na fifth of our economy to health care and everyone else in the world is \ndevoting less than half that. Finally, as the Senator from Virginia \nalso said, if you have any concern about these deficits we are facing \nin Washington becoming completely untenable, what you need to know is, \nthe biggest driver of those is rising Medicare and Medicaid costs and \nthe biggest driver of those is, of course, health care costs.\n  So my view has been, from the start, no matter what your entry point \nwas into this debate, cost was the central question for our working \nfamilies and for our small businesses. We have stressed the need over \nand over for health care reform to contain the rising costs that are \nplaguing our current system. That is why I think the Senate needs to \nadopt the freshman amendment package, which would cut costs, save \ntaxpayers money, and in this bill it can make our health care system \nfunction more efficiently.\n  This package of amendments will help strengthen the reform proposal's \nability to deliver affordable, quality health care to all Americans, \nwhether they are in private plans or whether they are in public plans. \nThese provisions will remove much of the redtape that, for so long, has \nslowed the delivery of care. Doctors from all over Colorado have told \nme, time and time again, their medical practices are mired in paperwork \nand their staffs spend far too much time and money jumping through \nadministrative hoop after hoop. The time our doctors and nurses spend \non unnecessary paperwork is time they can't spend becoming better \nprofessionals and, most importantly, providing quality care to their \npatients. This amendment will require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to adopt and regularly update a single national standard for \nsome of the most basic electronic transactions that occur between \ninsurers and providers, and meeting these standards will be enforceable \nby penalties if insurance providers don't take steps to comply. My \nprovision will make sure that as we implement health care reform, we \nare consistently identifying and implementing new standards.\n  There are also terrible inefficiencies in the way we pay health care \nproviders and allow them to deliver care to patients. This package \nhelps eliminate bottlenecks so patients are cared for in a reasonable \namount of time.\n  This package of amendments also expands the Senate bills reforms \nbeing made to Medicare and Medicaid. There is a provision that will \nallow accountable care organizations to work with private insurance \ncompanies to better craft strategies for Medicare and Medicaid and \nprivate sector plans to improve care. In the current system, doctors \nare forced into requesting a multitude of tests to confirm a diagnosis \nthey have already made. This creates\n\n[[Page S12652]]\n\nunnecessary work for doctors, their administrative staffs, lab \ntechnicians, and so on. It is time we create a system that empowers \ndoctors to practice medicine and do their jobs efficiently.\n  Under the current broken system, doctors have to endure needless \nhurdles to even set up a practice. It is no wonder the number of \nprimary care doctors has been steadily declining for some time now.\n  This package of amendments would create an environment that attracts \ndoctors back to the field rather than make it more difficult for them \nto provide care. Along with the savings this bill already creates, \nthese amendments will help doctors remove the redtape that has limited \ntheir ability to help patients in a timely manner.\n\n  We cannot go on allowing the middle class to absorb the rising costs \nof our Nation's health care system. We need health care reform that \nwill control costs and put us back on a path toward fiscal \nresponsibility. This package of amendments will help us do that.\n  I wish to, again, say thank you to my colleagues from the freshman \nclass for their work. This sometimes has seemed tedious and sometimes \nhard to describe, but these amendments are very critical if we are \ngoing to get hold of costs as we go forward. That is the relief working \nfamilies in this country need more than anything. In order to have \nstability in their lives, we have to get hold of our rising health care \ncosts.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KIRK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With great joy and enthusiasm, I can say that today we are closer \nthan ever to guaranteeing that all Americans, at long last, will have \nfull access to quality, affordable health care. The Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act, which our colleague and fellow freshman \nSenator Jeff Merkley of Oregon suggests, as Senator Kennedy of \nMassachusetts would have subscribed to, that this is the health care \nbill of rights. It will help fix a health care system that is failing \nto meet the needs of the American people. I am extremely proud to join \nwith Majority Leader Reid, with Senator Baucus, with my good friend, \nSenator Dodd of Connecticut, and with my fellow freshman Senators. I \nwish to single out, if I may, the Senator from Virginia, Mark Warner, \none of the more enlightened business leaders of our time, who brought \nhis wisdom and innovation and skills and practices of the private \nsector to help improve the important challenge we have in the public \nsector. I thank the Senator for his leadership on this effort, in \ncontributing to legislation that will mark a historic stride forward \nfor the American people.\n  I wish to say a word as well, a particular word, about the chairman \nof the Finance Committee who has enormous responsibilities in the \nSenate chairing the effort to reform our financial regulations and our \nfinancial systems so the American people will understand we are one \ncountry, with one important financial system and not somehow second \ntier, unrelated and unconnected to the decisions made on Wall Street \nand elsewhere. When Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts was stricken, \nSenator Dodd of Connecticut stepped forward, not only because Senator \nKennedy was his very close friend but because the Senator from \nConnecticut understood the enormity of the challenge and important \neffort that is being made in the Senate. I wish to salute him for \nsharing his wisdom and his strength and his leadership, not only in the \nareas of financial reform but in this important area as well.\n  As I said, this is nothing less than a bill of rights for the \nAmerican people on the issues of health care. With this legislation, \nall Americans, finally, will be guaranteed access to the affordable \nhealth care coverage they deserve. Families who need a helping hand to \ncare for an aging relative will be protected. Insurance companies will \nbe prohibited from arbitrarily refusing coverage and from stopping \nbenefits when they are needed the most. Doctors will be given the \nsupport they need to practice the best medicine possible. That is why \nthey took their oath. With the help of the measures in this total \nlegislation and some of the particular reforms suggested by our \nfreshman colleagues, that best medicine will be practiced. The American \neconomy will be protected from the skyrocketing costs of health care, \nwith which every American family is now inflicted.\n  Over the past month, I have had the privilege of working with my \nfellow freshman colleagues on a series of amendments that we are \ndiscussing this morning to make this health care bill of rights even \nstronger. These amendments plant the seed for an innovative 21st-\ncentury health care system that offers what American families want \nmost: better results for lower costs. It is as simple as that. These \namendments focus on the root causes of our skyrocketing health care \ncosts to provide Medicare the support it needs to become a leader in \nmoving away from the reimbursement models that increase costs without \nimproving care.\n  Public-private arrangements will be established to smooth reform and \nprevent private insurance from shifting costs onto public plans. The \nredtape, with which we are all familiar, which weighs down the current \nhealth care system in both the public and private sectors will be \nreduced. All of this will contribute to lower costs and higher quality \nin our health care system.\n  One focus that is particularly of interest and important to me is the \ndelivery system reform. We must move toward a system of paying \nhospitals and doctors for the quality of care they provide rather than \nthe quantity of tests and procedures they perform. Our amendment \nrewards providers of Medicare who give high-quality care rather than \nhigh-volume procedures. We will also allow Medicare to test promising \nnew models to reduce costs, increase quality, and improve patient \nhealth. We must make these changes for the sake of our patients and for \nthe sake of our economy.\n  In short, our amendments strengthen the reforms of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act. I urge all my colleagues to support \nthese amendments and take these important steps with us to bring \nAmerica's health care system into the 21st century.\n  I thank the leadership once again, and I thank the Senator from \nVirginia and my other freshman colleagues for their good work on this \nhistoric health care bill of rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, my freshman colleagues and I \nhave come to the floor on a regular basis over the last few months to \nmake clear to both sides of the aisle just how critical it is that we \nsucceed in reforming our health care insurance system.\n  Right now, too many Americans lack the freedom to move to a new job, \nfurther their education, or start a small business because doing so can \nput them at risk of losing health care coverage for their family. If \nyou think about it, freedom is, after all, about choices. What \nmotivates me--and I know it motivates my freshman colleagues--is the \ndesire to preserve and enhance the freedom of all Americans.\n  This legislation we have been debating and amending over the past 2 \nweeks can and should be a vehicle that we use to enhance freedom for \nall of our American citizens. We are going to repair and modernize a \nbroken health care system. If we fail to do so, we perpetuate an \nantiquated status quo that stalls economic growth, stifle the \nentrepreneurs who make up the American business landscape, and keep \nstability and security out of reach for millions of American families.\n  The package of amendments we present today is designed to inject more \ncost containment into the bill, cut down on regulatory and bureaucratic \nredtape, and push us more aggressively toward a reformed health care \nsystem that rewards better patient care rather than simply more care.\n  In developing these ideas, my fellow freshmen and I have relied upon \nthe input of people back home. And through my discussions with \nconstituents, health care providers, and businesses from all over \nColorado, a common theme has emerged: They want a health care system \nthat tackles costs, while keeping the focus on patients and quality. I \nbelieve we have accomplished that with our freshman proposal because \nmore than 30 groups have come out in the past few days in support of\n\n[[Page S12653]]\n\nour efforts. This is a wide-ranging number of groups, including \nconsumer champions such as AARP, business leaders such as the Business \nRoundtable, and health providers such as Denver Health in my home \nState.\n  My freshman colleagues have spoken about individual pieces of this \neffort that combine to make the whole. I will single out a section that \nI think will have a particularly strong influence on the future of our \nhealth care system.\n  Senator Rockefeller has authored an important provision that creates \nthe independent Medicare advisory board. This board would be tasked \nwith keeping down the costs in the Medicare system by issuing proposals \nto cut spending and increase the quality of care for beneficiaries.\n  I applaud this contribution to the bill, but I have wondered why we \ncannot take it a step further by looking at the whole health care \nsystem and not just Medicare in isolation. If we are going to tackle \nspiraling health costs across the country, we need to push each area of \nour health care system to be smarter and more efficient in dealing with \ncost growth.\n  One of my contributions to the package is a provision to expand the \nscope of the Medicare advisory board to examine not just Medicare but \nthe entire health care system and task the board with finding ways to \nslow down the growth of health costs across the country. This would \ninclude providing recommendations on the steps the private sector \nshould take to make our delivery system more efficient. Health care \nleaders and economists agree that such an approach can help push our \nsystem toward a more streamlined and coordinated way of delivering \nhealth care to all Americans.\n  In sum, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership, the \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley, and Senator Shaheen from New \nHampshire. It has been a delight to work with 11 of my fellow Senators. \nThis is a bold contribution to the package that I know we will pass out \nof the Senate. We come from varying parts of the country and have \nvaried political outlooks and backgrounds. This will attract broad \nsupport in our Chamber. It is a winning addition to health care reform, \nand I encourage all Senators to support our efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am so pleased this morning to join my \nfreshman colleagues in introducing our innovation and value package.\n  For the last several months, the freshmen in the Senate have been \ncoming to the floor to help make the case for health care reform, to \ntell our colleagues and the public about what we have heard from our \nconstituents, and to come together as one voice in support of reform.\n  Today, we back up that rhetoric with action. Today, we propose \nsomething concrete. We have talked about the importance of reforming \nthe way we deliver care, about how we need to slow down the \nskyrocketing costs of health care, while improving quality, and about \nthe need to provide incentives to make the changes happen. Today, we \ndeliver on that talk. Our proposals are about containing costs, about \nlooking into the future, thinking about our delivery system, and \nfinding ways to make small but very important changes that will make a \ndifference.\n  Throughout this debate, I have been talking about the importance of \nincreasing the quality of care while reducing the cost. This amendment \npackage does just that.\n  This amendment package matters. It matters to all the health care \nconsumers who are interested in reducing costs and increasing the value \nin our health care system. It especially matters to business. The high \ncost of health care and insurance coverage eats away at the bottom line \nfor businesses. If we can reduce waste and inefficiency, attack fraud, \nand simplify our system, we can reduce costs. The innovations in this \npackage attract business because business understands that we need to \ntake steps in our public and private health care systems to lower costs \nand deliver value.\n\n  I am proud that, with this amendment, we are able to promote the good \nwork of Elliot Fisher and his colleagues at the Dartmouth Institute for \nHealth Policy and Clinical Practice and to recognize the work they have \ndone on accountable care organizations.\n  Accountable care organizations are about coordinating care among \nproviders--hospitals, primary care physicians, specialists, and other \nmedical professionals. These accountable care organizations make \ndecisions with patients. I think that is the operative phrase. They \nmake decisions ``with'' patients about what steps they can take \ntogether to improve care. When these efforts result in cost and quality \nimprovements, providers and consumers can share in the savings. This is \nthe essence of true reform. We must demand performance, quality, and \nvalue from our health care system. This package makes great strides.\n  I will close by thanking all of my fellow freshmen. I am so proud to \nbe part of this freshman class and all of the great work they have \ndone.\n  I especially wish to recognize Senator Warner, who has really been \nthe driving force behind this health care package. I am not sure I \nagree with his cell phone analysis, but I certainly agree with the \nleadership he has shown on this package.\n  Also, I recognize our senior colleagues, Senators Dodd, Baucus, Reid, \nand Harkin, for the leadership they have shown in getting us to this \npoint.\n  Finally, I recognize all of the staff of all of us freshman Senators, \nmany of whom are here today, who have worked so hard to get us to this \npoint. I single out my assistants, Alison MacDonald and Dr. Manny \nJimenez, for the work they have done on this package. It is a great \neffort, and I am pleased to be here with my fellow freshmen.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to join us in support of this effort.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the freshman value \nand innovation package, which builds on efforts to provide quality, \naffordable health care at a lower cost to families. I, too, applaud our \ncolleague, Senator Mark Warner, for helping to initiate this package.\n  I wish to take a moment to talk about two provisions in the package \nthat I included: curbing fraud and abuse with 21st-century technology \nand medication therapy management.\n  Today, Medicare spends about $430 billion annually; Medicaid, \napproximately $340 billion; the States Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, an additional $5 billion, for a total of $775 billion.\n  In Medicare alone, annual waste amounts to between $23 billion and \n$78 billion. Yet, despite these sky-high numbers, investigations are \npursued only after payment has been made, which means government fraud \ninvestigators have to recover funds that have already been paid. As a \nresult, it is estimated that only about 10 percent of possible fraud is \never detected, and of that amount only about 3 percent is ever actually \nrecovered. This means the government recovers, at best, about $130 \nmillion in Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse. Again, when estimates are \nbetween $23 billion and $78 billion, we are only recovering $130 \nmillion.\n  ``Doctor shopping'' is an example that was profiled in a recent USA \nTODAY news article and GAO report. This involves a patient receiving \nmultiple prescriptions from numerous doctors in a short period of time, \nwithout getting caught. Each of the claims gets paid by Medicare, \nMedicaid, or even private health insurers.\n  The current technology exists to assess in real time if a claim \nwarrants further investigation, and this technology will prevent \nfraudulent claims from being paid on the front end. A software company \nin Cary, NC, SAS, has developed this technology.\n  This amendment will require the Department of Health and Human \nServices to put into place systems that will detect patterns of fraud \nand abuse before any money leaves our Federal coffers.\n  Another source of waste in the system is people not sticking to their \nmedication regimen. As much as one-half of all patients in our country \ndo not follow their doctors' orders regarding their medications. The \nNew England Health Care Institute estimates that the overall cost of \npeople not following directions is as much as $290 billion per year.\n\n[[Page S12654]]\n\n  This waste can be eliminated with medication therapy management. That \nis a program where seniors bring all of their prescriptions, in a \nlittle brown bag, and their over-the-counter medications and their \nvitamins and supplements to the pharmacy to be thoroughly reviewed in a \none-on-one session. The pharmacist follows up and educates the patient \nabout his or her medication regimen.\n  North Carolina has some successful medication therapy management \nprograms already in place.\n  In 2007, the North Carolina Health and Wellness Trust Fund Commission \nlaunched an innovative statewide program called Checkmeds NC to provide \nmedication therapy management services to our seniors. During the \nprogram's first year, more than 15,000 seniors and 285 pharmacists \nparticipated. Just this small program saved an estimated $10 million, \nand countless health problems were avoided for our seniors.\n  This amendment takes this successful North Carolina model and \nimplements it nationally, permitting pharmacies and other health care \nproviders to spend considerable time and resources evaluating a \nperson's drug routine and educating them on proper usage.\n  I urge passage of this freshman amendment package which will further \nreduce health care costs for American families. Thank you.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, this package today is a \nresult of collaboration that began months ago when the Senate's \nfreshman class united as advocates for comprehensive health reform, \nwhen we united in the belief that the status quo is not an option.\n  The health care status quo does not work for Americans and it does \nnot work for America either. If we fail to act, every person, every \ninstitution, every small business in this country will pay the price.\n  Achieving true reform means making insurance available and affordable \nto all Americans. It also means reining in out-of-control spending. For \nsome, those two goals seem diametrically opposed. They ask: How can you \ncontain costs when you are expanding access to millions of additional \npeople?\n  One of our country's great economic thinkers, Paul Krugman, recently \nchallenged this hypothesis. First, he said a majority of Americans \nuninsured are young and healthy. Covering them would not increase costs \nvery much. Second, he noted that this reform links coverage expansion \nto ``serious cost-control measures.''\n  These goals are two sides of the same coin. Without one, we cannot \nhave the other. As Mr. Krugman said:\n\n       The path to cost control runs through universality. We can \n     only tackle out-of-control costs as part of a deal that also \n     provides Americans with the security of guaranteed health \n     care.\n\n  With these amendments, we take additional steps to transform our \ndelivery system, to contain costs, and to curb abuses and excess \nspending. With these amendments, we encourage a faster transition to a \n21st-century system that is more efficient, costs less, and holds \nproviders and insurers accountable.\n  I am proud to sign on to all of the amendments in this package. But \nthere is one proposal that is particularly important to the people of \nNew Mexico. In my State, 30 of 33 counties are classified as medically \nunderserved. Residents of these highly rural counties are more likely \nto be uninsured. They are more likely to have higher rates of disease. \nAnd because of a shortage in health care providers, they are often \nforced to travel long distances for care.\n  This amendment would help us take the first steps toward alleviating \nthe growing shortage of primary care physicians in New Mexico and \nacross the country. By 2025, there will be a shortage of at least \n35,000 primary care physicians in the United States. As this shortage \ngrows, our rural areas will be hardest hit.\n  In this amendment, we call for expert recommendations on how to \nencourage providers to choose primary care and to establish their \npractices in medically underserved areas. These experts would analyze \nthings such as compensation and work environment. They would recommend \nways to increase interest in primary care as a career.\n  We are closer than ever to providing all Americans with access to \nquality, affordable health care. I am proud to be a part of a group of \nfreshmen who refuse to sit on the back bench and watch this reform \ndevelop from the sidelines. I am proud to be part of a group that from \nthe beginning refused to accept the status quo as an option.\n  I thank the staff of all these fine Senators and thank personally my \nstaff members, Fern Goodheart and Ben Nathanson.\n  I look forward to continuing the work with this outstanding group as \nwe debate a bill that will improve our health care system for \ngenerations to come.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, it is also my pleasure to stand with my \ncolleagues and be a part of this health reform package, to give \nrecognition to those distinguished senior Senators who have put so much \nheart into drafting this important legislation, to our Leader Reid and \nto Senator Baucus, Senator Dodd, and all the individuals. It is a \npleasure for me to be a part of this freshman colloquy on this major \npackage.\n  Over the past several months, my freshman colleagues and I have taken \nthe floor many times to speak about the need for comprehensive health \ncare reform. I am pleased to join them today as we discuss our cost \ncontainment package.\n  This set of provisions will help promote accountability, increase \nefficiency, and reduce disparities in our health care system. Our \namendment will reinforce and improve the principles of high-value, low-\ncost care that is central to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct.\n  Our amendment will strengthen Medicare's ability to act as a payment \ninnovator, paying for value and not for volume. In speeding this \nprocess, our amendment gives Medicare more of the resources it needs to \ngather data, expand programs that work, and reach the neediest \npatients.\n  We also work to strengthen waste, fraud, and abuse provisions in the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act in order to make sure that \nthe Department of Health and Human Services has the tools to not only \npunish offenders but to prevent fraud from happening in the first \nplace.\n  But this is not just about our public programs. We also promote \nprivate-public data sharing to get a better picture of our whole \nmedical system.\n  Our amendment further takes aim at administrative costs, another \nbarrier often cited to getting the most effective care, by encouraging \npublic-private collaboration to create uniform standards and reduce the \nmountain of paperwork that takes doctors' time away from their \npatients.\n  Finally, we put pressure on private insurers to change the way they \npay. By encouraging insurers to reward programs that reduce \ndisparities, providers will increasingly focus attention on populations \nthat need it most.\n  By proactively targeting these needy folks through cultural \ncompetency training, language services, and community outreach, our \namendment will increase wellness and reduce the use of costly emergency \nroom care.\n  My colleagues and I are supported by top business groups, consumer \ngroups, and providers because they all know we have to transform the \nway care is delivered in this country. Businesses know that without the \nreduced cost of care and promoting transparency, the cost of premiums \ncontinues to rise, putting a stranglehold on wage increases and making \nthem less competitive.\n  Consumer groups want to ensure the patients get more value for their \ndollar, that they do not just get more care but they get the type of \ncoordinated, effective care that will keep them healthy and out of the \nemergency rooms. Those providers who focus on targeted care to get the \nbest patient outcome want to be rewarded for doing so.\n  The evidence could not be clearer, the conclusions could not be more \ndecisive that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, coupled \nwith our amendment, will lower costs for ordinary Americans.\n\n[[Page S12655]]\n\n  I call upon my colleagues to take an honest look at what we are \ndoing, and I defy them to say that health care reform will not reduce \ncosts and improve the functioning of our health care system.\n  The debate over health care reform cannot be scoring political \npoints. It must be about the health and well-being of the American \npeople. All of our great work will bear fruit, and we will reform our \nNation's health system because there is no other option. Our citizens \ndemand it, and they deserve no less.\n  I thank our distinguished colleagues. I am happy to be a part of this \nfreshman colloquy in presenting such an important issue at this time in \nhistory in this great country of ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I seek the floor to talk about this \npackage of cost containment offered by the freshmen. I am proud to join \nthem in offering this amendment today.\n  The technical work in this package is complex and complicated, but \nthe themes it addresses are simple and straightforward, which I know \nour colleagues on the other side will appreciate and we hope support--\nvalue, innovation, quality, transparency, and cost containment.\n  The full legislation now under debate in the Senate makes wonderful \nstrides in fixing what is broken in America's current health care \nsystem. Under the leadership of Senators Baucus, Dodd, Harkin, and our \nMajority Leader Reid, the committees have done incredible work.\n  What the freshmen are saying today is we believe our package can \nhelp. We can go further. We can do better. Our goal is a health care \nsystem that is more efficient and more affordable.\n  In a few moments, I will stand together at a news conference with all \nmy freshman colleagues to formally announce this package. What I most \nappreciate is that we will do so with the support of consumer and \nbusiness groups.\n  While the language of this amendment promotes efficiency and \nencourages innovation within the health delivery system, what it is \nabout is helping individual Americans and businesses get a better deal \non health care. I am proud of that, especially when we know that cost \ncontainment is the No. 1 priority of small business owners in this \nhealth reform debate.\n  Insurance premiums alone in the last 10 years for small businesses \nhave risen 113 percent. It was reported in the media that small \nbusinesses in this country face another 15-percent increase in the \nhealth premiums in the coming year.\n  What about families, our friends, and our neighbors? Health insurance \npremiums are eating up ever growing chunks of the family budget. \nNationwide, family health insurance purchased through an employer at \nthe start of this decade cost about $6,700, almost 14 percent of the \nfamily income. Last year, the same premium cost $13,000--21 percent of \nthe family income.\n  If we do nothing, if we do not reform the system and do not contain \ncosts, this country will be in big trouble. By 2016, the same family \nhealth insurance will cost more than $24,000. Because health costs are \nskyrocketing compared to wages, that $24,000 will represent 45 percent \nof the family budget. Enough is enough. The package we are offering \ntoday will help.\n  I want to focus briefly on a small but significant piece of this \npackage that addresses rural health care. It will help hospitals in \nseveral States, including Alaska, my home State, by extending the Rural \nCommunity Hospital Demonstration Program. We are building on known \nsuccess. The program is small. Even with this amendment, the number of \neligible hospitals nationwide will expand from 15 to 30, and 20 rural \nStates will be eligible to participate instead of the current 10.\n  Part of what we are saying in this package is this: If something is \nworking to provide better health care access and value, for goodness \nsake, let's keep it going and do what we can to improve on it.\n  My thanks go to Senator Ben Nelson who has been a champion of this \nprogram and is also pushing for the extension.\n  As I conclude, I wish to stress once again how proud I am to stand \nwith my freshman colleagues. The cost containment package we are \nproposing today will help all Americans, and I hope it will move the \nSenate that much closer to a historic vote on the landmark legislation \nthat is before us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I know our time is about to expire. I \nwish to close by thanking all my freshman colleagues and their staffs \nfor the great work they have done on this legislation.\n  I see a number of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle. \nThis is an amendment package that brings greater transparency, greater \naccountability, greater efficiency, and greater innovation, and is \nsupported by the Business Roundtable, small businesses and health care \nsystems around the country. I ask for their consideration.\n  I again thank the Chair, Senator Dodd, for allowing us to lay out \nthis package of amendments. I think it will add an important component \nto this bill in trying to rein in costs not just on the government side \nbut systemwide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, quickly, because I know my colleagues are \nhere on the other side, I want to commend 10 of the 11 new freshmen who \nare here and who have spoken with great eloquence and passion about \nthis issue. I think all of us, regardless of which side of the aisle we \nare on, owe them all a great deal of gratitude for putting together a \nvery fine package.\n  I particularly thank Senator Mark Warner, our colleague from \nVirginia, who has led this effort, but obviously so much of this has \nhappened because of the cooperation and ideas that each Member who has \nspoken here this morning has brought to this particular cluster of \nideas on cost containment. All Americans owe them a deep debt of \ngratitude and can feel pretty good about the future of our country with \nthis fine group of Americans leading it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority now has 60 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, may I ask unanimous consent to speak for \na couple of minutes to comment on the freshman package? It will just \ntake a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I join my good friend from Connecticut \nin thanking--I don't know if calling them freshmen would be wise, \nbecause our colleagues act as though they have been here for years and \nknow the subject extremely well.\n  Delivery system reform has always been something I have been pushing \nfor, and I am happy to see it is part of your package, and also with \nadditional emphasis on rural areas and Indian reservations. We clearly \nneed more of that, and more transparency. I firmly believe that will \nhelp us get costs down and get quality of care up. Your work on the \nindependent Medicare advisory board is great too.\n  To be honest, these are all the next steps in ideas that are pretty \nmuch in the bill, but they are the proper next steps, and the next \nsteps I firmly believe should be taken. So I compliment you and thank \nyou very much, and I thank my friend from Arizona for allowing me this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I wish also to add my words of \ncongratulations to the new Members for their eloquence, their passion, \nand their well-informed arguments, although they are badly misguided. \nBut I do congratulate them for bringing forth their ideas and taking \npart in this spirited debate. We welcome it, and I hope that someday we \nwill be able to agree on both sides for us to engage in real colloquy \nbetween us, back and forth. I think the American people and all Members \nwould be well informed.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for the next 30 minutes to \nengage in a colloquy with my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I talk a lot about C-SPAN. I am a great \nadmirer of C-SPAN. And the President--at least when he was running for \nthe presidency--believed in C-SPAN as\n\n[[Page S12656]]\n\nwell, because he said C-SPAN would be in on the negotiations. Here is \nwhat was posted by a reporter from Politico last night at 5:48 p.m., \nentitled ``No C-SPAN Here.''\n\n       Right now a group of moderate Senators is meeting behind \n     closed doors to try to hash out a compromise on the public \n     option. Reporters, waiting for the meeting to break, were \n     just moved out of the corridor nearest the meeting and \n     shunted around the corner, making it harder for the press to \n     catch Senators as they leave. C-SPAN this is not.\n\n  I would remind my colleagues that the amendment we are discussing \nhere is drafted to prevent drastic Medicare Advantage cuts from \nimpacting all seniors in Medicare Advantage. The amendment says simply: \nLet's give seniors who are members of Medicare, who have enrolled in \nMedicare Advantage, the same deal that Senator Nelson was able to get \nfor the State of Florida--at least most of the seniors who enrolled in \nthe Medicare Advantage Program. There are 11 million American seniors \nwho are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage Program. This amendment \nwould allow all 11 million to have the same benefits and there would be \nno carve-out for various groups of seniors because of the influence of \na Member of this body.\n  I want to quote again the New York Times, my favorite source of \ninformation, from an article entitled ``Senator Tries to Allay Fears on \nHealth Overhaul.''\n\n       . . . Mr. Nelson, a Democrat, has a big problem. The bill \n     taken up this week by the committee would cut Medicare \n     payments to insurance companies that care for more than 10 \n     million older Americans, including nearly one million in \n     Florida. The program, known as Medicare Advantage, is \n     popular--\n\n  And the article lists the benefits, and then continues as follows:\n\n       ``It would be intolerable to ask senior citizens to give up \n     substantial health benefits they are enjoying under \n     Medicare,'' said Mr. Nelson, who has been deluged with calls \n     and complaints from constituents. ``I am offering an \n     amendment to shield seniors from those benefit cuts.''\n\n  He is offering an amendment to shield senior citizens. Well, I am \noffering a motion that deals with all of the 11 million seniors who are \nunder Medicare Advantage, as the Senator from Florida said, to shield \nseniors from benefit cuts. That is what this motion is all about. We \nshould not carve out for some seniors what other seniors are not \nentitled to. That is not America. That is not the way we should treat \nall of our citizens, and I hope my colleagues will understand this \namendment is proposed simply in the name of fairness.\n  I ask the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Texas, who have \na large number of enrollees in the Medicare Advantage Program, whether \nthey feel this would be unfair?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his motion, \nand I thank the Senator from Florida for his amendment, because \nMedicare Advantage is very important to Tennesseans. We have 243,000 \nTennesseans who have opted for Medicare Advantage. About one-fourth of \nall Americans who are on Medicare have chosen Medicare Advantage \nbecause it provides the option for increased dental care, for vision \ncare, for hearing coverage, for reduced hospital deductibles, and many \nbenefits. It is helpful to low-income and minority Americans, and it is \nespecially helpful to people in rural areas.\n  What the Republicans have been arguing all week is that, contrary to \nwhat our friends on the other side are saying, this bill cuts those \nMedicare Advantage benefits. The Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice says that fully half--fully half--of the benefits in Medicare \nAdvantage for these 11 million Americans will be cut. Our Democratic \nfriends say: No, that is not true. That is not true. We are going to \ncut $1 trillion out of Medicare over a fully implemented 10-year period \nof this bill, but nobody will be affected by it.\n  Well, the Senator from Florida apparently doesn't believe that. He \nsays: We have 900,000 Floridians who don't want their Medicare \nAdvantage cut. And he is saying, in effect, we don't trust this \nDemocratic bill to protect these seniors in Medicare Advantage.\n  So I ask the Senator from Texas: If the people of Florida and the \nSenator from Florida don't trust the Democratic bill to protect \nMedicare Advantage, why should 240,000 Tennesseans trust the Democratic \nbill to protect Medicare Advantage?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I agree with the distinguished Senators from Tennessee \nand Arizona, that what is good enough for the seniors in Florida ought \nto be good enough for all seniors. In my State of Texas, we have \n532,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage, and they like it, for the \nreasons that the Senator from Tennessee mentioned. They do not want us \ncutting those benefits.\n  But I say to the Senators from Arizona and Tennessee, I seem to \nrecall that we had amendments earlier which would have protected \neverybody from cuts in Medicare benefits, and now we have a targeted \neffort, negotiated behind closed doors, to protect States such as \nFlorida and Pennsylvania and others, and I wonder whether the Nelson \namendment to protect the seniors of Florida would even be necessary if \nour colleagues across the aisle had agreed with us that no Medicare \nbenefits should be cut.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As the Senator points out, a few days ago, by a vote of \n100 to 1, we voted to pass an amendment proposed by the Senator from \nColorado, Senator Bennet, which included words such as ``protecting \nguaranteed Medicare benefits'' or ``protecting and improving guaranteed \nMedicare benefits.'' The wording was: ``Nothing in the provisions of or \namendments made by this act shall result in the reduction of guaranteed \nbenefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.''\n  Is there any Member on the other side who can guarantee that seniors \nin his or her State in Medicare Advantage will not lose a single \nbenefit they have today--not the guaranteed benefit the other side goes \nto great pains to talk about. I think those who are enrolled in the \nMedicare Advantage system believe that since they receive those \nbenefits, they are guaranteed benefits as well.\n  I would ask our two physicians here on the floor, who both have had \nthe opportunity to deal directly with the Medicare Advantage Program, \nif you have a patient come in and you say: By the way, you are having \nyour Medicare Advantage Program cut, but don't worry, we are protecting \nyour guaranteed Medicare benefits, do you think they understand that \nlanguage?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would respond to the Senator from Arizona in the \nfollowing way. First of all, they won't understand that language. But \nmore importantly, if you look at the law, there is Medicare Part A, \nMedicare Part B, Medicare Part C, and Medicare Part D. They are all \nlaw. They are all law. What is guaranteed under the law today is that \nif you want Medicare Advantage, you can have it. What is going to \nchange is that we are going to take away that guarantee. We are going \nto modify Medicare Part C, which is Medicare Advantage.\n  So we have this confusing way of saying we are not taking away any of \nyour guaranteed benefits, but in fact, under the current law today, \nMedicare Advantage is guaranteed to anybody who wants to sign up for \nit. So it is duplicitous to say we are not cutting your benefits, when \nin fact we are.\n  Let me speak to my experience and then I will yield to my colleague \nfrom Wyoming, who is an orthopedic surgeon.\n  What is good about Medicare Advantage? We hear it is a money pot to \npay for a new program for other people. Here is what is good about it. \nWe get coordinated care for poor Medicare folks. Medicare Advantage \ncoordinates the care. When you coordinate care, what you do is you \ndecrease the number of tests, you prevent hospitalizations, you get \nbetter outcomes, and consequently you have healthier seniors.\n  So when it is looked at, Medicare Advantage doesn't cost more. It \nactually saves Medicare money on an individual basis. Because if you \nforgo the interests of a hospital, where you start incurring costs, \nwhat you have done is saved the Medicare Trust Fund but you have also \ngiven better care.\n  The second point I wish to make is that many people on Medicare \nAdvantage cannot afford to buy Medicare supplemental policies. Ninety-\nfour percent of the people in this country who are on Medicare and not \nMedicare Advantage are buying a supplemental policy. Why is that? \nBecause the basic underlying benefit package of Medicare is not \nadequate. So here we have this\n\n[[Page S12657]]\n\ngroup of people who are benefitted because they have chosen a \nguaranteed benefit of Medicare Part C, and all of a sudden we are \nsaying: Time out. You don't get that anymore.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So a preponderance of people who enroll in Medicare \nAdvantage are low-income people, and a lot of them are rural residents?\n  Mr. COBURN. A lot of them are rural. I don't know the income levels, \nbut I know there is a propensity for actually getting a savings, \nbecause you don't have to buy a supplemental policy if you are on \nMedicare Advantage.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would add to that, following on my colleague from \nOklahoma, that there is the coordinated care, which is one of the \nadvantages of Medicare Advantage, but there is also the preventive \ncomponent of this. We talk about ways to help people keep their health \ncare costs down, and that has to do with coordinated care and \npreventing illness.\n  Mr. COBURN. And we heard from the freshman Democrats that they want \nto put a new preventive package into the program. Yet they want to take \nthe preventive package out of Medicare Advantage. It is an interesting \nmix of amendments, isn't it?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. We want to keep our seniors healthy. That is one way \nthey can stay out of the hospital, out of the nursing home, and stay \nactive. Yet with the cuts in Medicare Advantage, the Democrats have \nvoted to do that--to cut all the money out of this program that seniors \nlike. Eleven million American seniors who depend upon Medicare for \ntheir health care choose this because there is an advantage to them.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma, the other physician in the Senate, has \ntalked, as I have, extensively about patient-centered health care--not \ninsurance centered, not government centered. Medicare Advantage helps \nkeep it patient centered. So when I see deals being cut behind closed \ndoors where they are cutting out people from all across the country and \nproviding sweetheart deals to help seniors on Medicare Advantage in \nFlorida in order to encourage one Member of the Senate to vote a \ncertain way, I have to ask myself: What about the seniors in the rest \nof the country, whether it is Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, or Arizona?\n  A lot of seniors have great concern, and I would hope they would call \nup and say this is wrong; we need to know what is going on, and to ask \nwhy it is there is a sweetheart deal for one selected Senator from one \nState when we want to have that same advantage; and why are the \nDemocrats voting to eliminate all this Medicare money.\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I ask my colleagues a question--maybe starting with \nthe Senator from Arizona--on a related issue. Medicare Advantage is a \nprivate sector alternative or choice to Medicare, which is a \ngovernment-run program. I am detecting throughout all of this bill sort \nof a bias against the private sector and wanting to eliminate choices \nthat aren't government-run plans.\n  Am I reading too much into this or do any of my colleagues see a \nsimilar propensity in this bill?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may respond to the Senator from Texas, I think he \nis exactly right. There is a lot of very appealing talk that we hear \nfrom the advocates of the so-called health reform bill. But when we get \nright down to it, and when we examine it closely, we find a big \nincrease in government-run programs. What does that mean for low-income \nAmericans, and what does it mean for seniors who depend on our biggest \ngovernment-run programs, Medicare and Medicaid? It means they risk not \nhaving access to the doctor they want. The Senator from Wyoming \nmentioned the Mayo Clinic, widely cited by the President and by many on \nthe other side as an example of controlling costs, is beginning to say: \nWe can't take patients from the government-run programs in some cases \nbecause we are not reimbursed properly.\n  What is going to happen behind all this happy talk we are hearing \nabout health care is, we are going to find more and more low-income \npatients dumped into a program called Medicaid. Under this program half \nthe doctors will not see a new Medicaid patient. It is akin to giving \nsomeone a bus ticket on a bus line that runs half the time. Medicare is \ngoing to increasingly find itself in the same shape as Medicaid. The \nMayo Clinic has already said they can't afford to serve patients from \nthe government-run programs. The Senator from Texas is exactly right. \nWe don't have to persuade the 11 million Americans who have chosen \nMedicare Advantage that it is a good program. They like it. In rural \nareas, between 2003 and 2007, more than 600,000 people signed up for \nit. In a way, the Senator from Florida may have a sweetheart deal, but \nin a way he has done us a favor. We have been trying to say all week \nthe Democrats are cutting Medicare. They are saying: Trust us, we are \nnot cutting Medicare. The Senator from Florida is saying: Floridians \ndon't trust you. You are cutting their Medicare Advantage. I want to \nhave an amendment to protect them. Senator McCain is saying: Let's \nprotect all seniors' Medicare Advantage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I also point out, for the record, on September 20, \n2003, there was a letter to the conferees of Medicare, urging them to \ninclude a meaningful increase in Medicare Advantage funding for fiscal \nyears 2004-2005--a group of 18 Senators, including Senators Schumer, \nLautenberg, Clinton, Wyden, et cetera, including Senator Kerry, who now \nobviously wants to reduce the funding for Medicare Advantage. Again, \nperhaps he was for it before he was against it.\n  I would also like to point out, as short a time ago as April 3, 2009, \na group of Senators, bipartisan, including Senators Wyden, Murray, \nSpecter, Bennet, Klobuchar, and others, wrote to Charlene Frizzera, \nacting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services:\n\n       We write to express our concerns regarding the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services' proposed changes to Medicare \n     Advantage rates for calendar year 2010. The advance notice \n     has raised two important issues that, if implemented, would \n     result in highly problematic premium increases and benefit \n     reductions for Medicare Advantage enrollees across the \n     country.\n\n  Again, as recently as last April, there was concern on the other side \nabout cuts in the Medicare Advantage Program.\n  Mr. COBURN. I wonder if the Senator is aware, in Alabama, there will \nbe 181,000 people who will get a Medicare Advantage cut; in California, \n1,606,000 seniors are going to have benefits cut; Colorado, 198,000; \nGeorgia, 176,000; Illinois, 176,000; Indiana, 148,000; Kentucky, \n110,000; Louisiana, 151,000; Massachusetts, 200,000; Michigan, \n406,000--that is exactly what Michigan needs right now, isn't it, for \ntheir seniors to have their benefits cut--Minnesota, 284,000; Missouri, \n200,000; Nevada, 104,000; New Jersey, 156,000; New York, 853,000; Ohio, \n499,000; Oregon, 250,000; Pennsylvania--maybe, maybe not because they \nmay have the deal--865,000; Tennessee, 233,000; Washington State, \n225,000; Wisconsin, 243,000.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of what the enrollment is by \nCMS on Medicare and Medicare Advantage enrollment, as of August 2009, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe

The point of all this is, the Senator from Florida, a \nmember of the Finance Committee, felt so strongly that Medicare \nAdvantage was at risk he decided to carve out, and was able to get the \nmajority on a party-line vote of the Finance Committee to carve out a \nspecial status for a group of seniors under Medicare Advantage in his \nState. My motion simply says, everyone whom the Senator from Oklahoma \nmade reference to deserves that same protection. That is all this \nmotion is about.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator would yield for a question, if this motion \nis not agreed to, which protects all Medicare Advantage beneficiaries--\nall 11 million of them, 532,000 in my State--and as a result of not \nonly these cuts but perhaps additional cuts to come in the future to \nMedicare Advantage, which will make it harder for Medicare \nbeneficiaries to get coverage, I ask particularly my doctor colleagues, \nwhat is the impact of eliminating Medicare Advantage and leaving people \nwith Medicare fee for service, which is, as I recall, the Bennet \namendment earlier? You have to parse the language closely, but it \ntalked about guaranteed benefits. I think the Senator from Oklahoma \nmakes a good point. Right now, Medicare Advantage has guaranteed \nbenefits.\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CORNYN. What is the consequence of seniors losing Medicare \nAdvantage and being forced onto a Medicare fee-for-service program?\n  Mr. COBURN. Limited prevention screening, no coordinated care, loss \nof access to certain drugs, loss of accessory things, such as vision \nand hearing supplementals, but, more importantly, poorer health \noutcomes. That is what it is going to mean--or a much smaller \ncheckbook, one or the other. A smaller checkbook because now the \ngovernment isn't going to pay for it--you are--or poorer health \noutcomes. If your checkbook is limited, the thing that happens is, you \nwill get the poorer health outcome.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Additionally, the Senator from Arizona talked about the \nclosed-door meetings, secretly trying to come up with things.\n  There was an article in the paper today that the Democrats are \nturning to actually throwing more people on the Medicare and Medicaid \nrolls as they are trying to come up with some compromise; the idea \nbeing it is going to be compromising the care of the people. They are \ntrying to put more people onto the Medicaid rolls. The Senator from \nTennessee has said many physicians don't take those patients because \nreimbursement is so poor. It is putting more people into a boat that is \nalready sinking. They want to put more people on Medicaid and more on \nMedicare, but at the same time they are cutting Medicare by $464 \nbillion. This is a program we know is already going broke. Yet they \nwant to now put people age 55 to 64, add those to the Medicare rolls, \nwhich is a program we have great concerns about.\n  Special deals for some, cutting out many others, now adding more \npeople to the Medicare rolls--to me, this is not sustainable. Yet these \nare the deals that are being cut less than 100 feet from here off the \nfloor of the Senate, when we are out here debating for all the American \npeople to see the things we think are important about health care. Jobs \nare going to be lost as a result, if this bill gets passed. People who \nhave insurance will end up paying more in premiums, if this bill is \npassed. People who depend on Medicare, whether it is Medicare Advantage \nor regular Medicare, will see their health care deteriorate as a result \nof this proposal. I turn to the Senator from Arizona, who has been a \nspecial student of this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So seniors, by losing Medicare Advantage, would then lose \ncertain provisions Medicare Advantage provides and then they would be \nforced, if they can afford it, which they are now paying zero because \nit is covered under Medicare Advantage, then they would have to buy \nMedigap policies that would make up for those benefits they lost when \nthey lose Medicare Advantage.\n  Guess who offers those Medigap insurance policies. Our friends at \nAARP, which average $175 a month. We are telling people who are on \nMedicare Advantage today, when they lose it, they can be guaranteed, if \nthey want to make up for those benefits they are losing, they would be \npaying $175 a month, minimum, for a Medigap policy. A lot of America's \nseniors cannot afford that.\n  Mr. COBURN. That is $2,000 a year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. They can't afford it.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will make one other point. Over the next 10 years, 15 \nmillion baby boomers are going to go into Medicare. We are taking $465 \nbillion out of Medicare; on the 10-year picture, $1 trillion. So we are \ngoing to add $15 million and cut $1 trillion. What do you think is \ngoing to happen to the care for everybody in Medicare? The ultimate\n\n[[Page S12659]]\n\nis, we are going to ration the care for seniors, if this bill comes \nthrough.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time remains, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes is remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask Dr. Barrasso, have you treated people under \nMedicare Advantage?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I have. People know there is an advantage to being in \nthis program, and that is why they sign up for it. That is why citizens \nall around the country have signed up for Medicare Advantage. They \nrealize there is value in prevention and there is value in coordinated \ncare. There is value in having eye care, dental care, hearing care. \nThere are advantages to wanting to stay healthy, to keep down the cost \nof care.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So you are making the case that even though it may cost \nmore, the fact that you have a weller and fitter group of senior \ncitizens, you, in the long-run, reduce health care costs because they \ntake advantage of the kind of care that, over time, would keep them \nfrom going to the hospital earlier or having to see the doctor more \noften.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. That is one of the reasons that Medicare Advantage was \nbrought forth. I know a lot of Senators from rural States supported it \nbecause it would allow people in small communities to have this \nadvantage to be in a program such as that. It could encourage doctors \nto go into those communities to try to keep those people well, work \nwith prevention. The 11 million people who are on Medicare Advantage \nknow they are on Medicare Advantage. They have chosen it. It is the \nfastest growing component because people realize the advantages of \nbeing on Medicare Advantage. If they want to stay independent, healthy, \nand fit, they sign up for Medicare Advantage. I would think people all \nacross the country, who are seniors on Medicare but are not on Medicare \nAdvantage, would want to say: Why didn't I know about this program? As \nseniors talk about this at senior centers--and I go to centers and \nmeetings there and visit with folks and hear their concerns--they are \nconverting over and joining, signing up for Medicare Advantage because \nthey know there are advantages to it. For this Senate and the Democrats \nto say: We want to slash over $100 billion from Medicare Advantage, I \nthink the people of America understand this is a great loss to them and \na peril to their own health, as they lose the coordinated care and the \npreventive nature of the care.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from Tennessee, do you know of any \nexpert economist on health care who believes we can make these kinds of \ncuts in Medicare Advantage and still preserve the same benefits the \nenrollees have today?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The answer to the Senator from Arizona is no. I do not \nknow of one. I know of one Senator at least who does not believe it. He \nis the Senator from Florida. It is interesting that all week we have \nbeen going back and forth. We have been saying to the Democrats: You \nare cutting Medicare benefits. They have been saying: No, we are not.\n  We have been saying: Yes, you are.\n  No, we are not.\n  I am sure the people at home must say: Well, who is right about this? \nWell, the Senator from Florida, who sits on the other side of the \naisle, has said: I am not willing to go back to Florida and say to the \npeople of Florida that your benefits are going to be cut if you are on \nMedicare Advantage, so I want an amendment to protect you. The Senator \nfrom Texas wants and amendment to protect 11 million seniors and so \ndoes the Senator from Oklahoma and so does the Senator from Louisiana \nand so does the Senator from Wyoming, and the Senator from Tennessee.\n  So the Senator from Arizona is saying, we believe you are cutting \nMedicare Advantage benefits for 11 million Americans. The Senator from \nFlorida does not trust your bill. We do not either. We want an \namendment that protects 11 million seniors.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would ask our Senators to expand in \nthe brief time we have. It seems as if all of the discussion about \nhealth care reform is a bit about accountable care organizations, \ncoordinating care, particularly in the later part of life, avoiding \nchronic diseases in life.\n  When I was at Kelsey-Seybold Clinic in Houston, TX, they told me it \nis Medicare Advantage that allows them to coordinate care, to hold down \ncosts, to keep people healthier longer. Yet the irony, to me, it seems, \nis that by cutting Medicare Advantage benefits, we are going backward \nrather than forward when it comes to that kind of coordinated, less \nexpensive care.\n  Would the Senator concur with that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would concur that this is actually taking a step \nbackward. That is why the Senator from Florida has demanded they make \naccommodations for the people of Florida. The people of Wyoming want \nthose same accommodations, as do the people of Arizona and Texas. \nBecause 11 million Americans have chosen the Medicare Advantage Program \nbecause it does help coordinate care. It has preventive care. It keeps \nit more patient centered as opposed to government centered, insurance \ncompany centered. That is the way for people to stay healthy, live \nlonger lives, and keep their independence.\n  We have seen cuts across the board on Medicare, whether it is home \nhealth, nursing homes, hospice care, Medicare Advantage. And across the \nboard, they are cutting Medicare in a way that certainly the seniors of \nthis country do not deserve. They have paid into that program for many \nyears and they deserve their benefits.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may say to the Senator from Arizona one other \nthing, we have talked a lot about our good friend, the Senator from \nFlorida, and how he has been so perceptive on noticing that his \nFloridians with Medicare Advantage may lose their Medicare benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 30 seconds for the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I say to the Senator from Arizona, I believe there are \nother Medicare benefits that are likely to be cut in this bill. Aren't \nthere cuts to hospice? Aren't there cuts to hospitals? Aren't there \ncuts to home health care, which we talked about yesterday? So if \nFloridians do not trust the Democratic bill to protect their Medicare \nbenefits from Medicare Advantage, why should they trust the Democratic \nbill to protect any of their Medicare benefits?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to finally point out what Dr. Coburn said. \nMedicare Part C, which is Medicare Advantage, is part of the law, and \nto treat it in any way different, because those on the other side do \nnot particularly happen to like it, I think is an abrogation of the \nresponsibilities we have to the seniors of this country.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2962\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to talk about another \namendment that is pending, the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment. This is an \namendment that I think has been discussed in the last day as well. That \nis the amendment that would assure that no Federal funds are spent for \nabortion. That was unclear. It is unclear in the underlying bill. I \nthink it is very important we talk about it, that we make sure it is \nvery clear exactly what the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment does; and that \nis, it would bar Federal funding for abortion, which is basically \napplying the Hyde amendment to the programs under this health care \nbill.\n  Since the Hyde amendment was first passed in 1977, the Senate has had \nto vote on this issue many times, probably just about every year, and I \nhave consistently voted to prohibit Federal funding for abortions, as I \nknow my colleague and friend from Utah has done, as well as the \nDemocratic sponsors of this amendment.\n  Yet it seems that some Members were on the floor last night \nmisconstruing exactly what the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment does. \nSpecifically, their claim was that the Hyde language only bars direct \nfunding for elective abortions while the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment \nbars funding of an entire benefits package that includes elective \nabortions and therefore is unprecedented.\n\n[[Page S12660]]\n\n  I wish to ask the distinguished Senator from Utah, what exactly did \nthe Hyde language say? Let's clarify what Hyde was, so we can then \ndetermine if your amendment is the same.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator so much.\n  The current Hyde language contained in the fiscal year 2009 Labor-HHS \nAppropriations Act says the following:\n\n       Sec. 507. (a) None of the funds appropriated in this Act, \n     and none of the funds in any trust fund to which funds are \n     appropriated in this Act, shall be expended for any abortion.\n       (b) None of the funds appropriated in this Act, and none of \n     the funds in any trust fund to which funds are appropriated \n     in this Act, shall be expended for health benefits coverage \n     that includes coverage of abortion.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. So Federal funds are prohibited from being used in \nabortions in that particular bill.\n  What about programs such as CHIP, that was created in the Balanced \nBudget Act? And in 2009, it was reauthorized by Congress and signed by \nthe President earlier this year. What about the CHIP program?\n  Mr. HATCH. I know a little bit about CHIP. That was the Hatch-Kennedy \nbill. I was one of the original authors of the program and insisted \nthat the following language be included in the original statute:\n\n                  limitation on payment for abortions\n\n       (A) In general.--Payment shall not be made to a State under \n     this section for any amount expended under the State plan to \n     pay for any abortion or to assist in the purchase, in whole \n     or in part, of health benefit coverage that includes coverage \n     of abortion.\n       (B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an \n     abortion only if necessary to save the life of the mother or \n     if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.\n\n  That is what the CHIP bill said, and that was the Hatch-Kennedy bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would assume you do know what is in that bill. What \nabout the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, what does it say?\n  Mr. HATCH. The reason I mentioned Senator Kennedy is because he was \nthe leading liberal in the Senate at the time, and yet he agreed to \nthat language.\n  As to the Federal Employees Health Benefits package, the following \nlanguage appears in the Financial Services and General Government \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2009:\n\n       Sec. 613. No funds appropriated by this Act shall be \n     available to pay for an abortion, or the administrative \n     expenses in connection with any health plan under the Federal \n     employees' health benefits program which provides any \n     benefits or coverage for abortions.\n       Sec. 614. The provisions of Section 613 shall not apply \n     where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus \n     were carried to term, or the pregnancy is the result of an \n     act of rape or incest.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Well, isn't that the same as the language in the \nNelson-Hatch-Casey amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. You are absolutely right.\n  Let me read the language for you in the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment.\n\n       In general.--No funds authorized or appropriated by this \n     Act (or an amendment made by this Act) may be used to pay for \n     any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health \n     plan that includes coverage of abortion.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. So based on what you have said, this is not new \nFederal abortion policy. The Hyde amendment currently applies to the \nplans discussed, including the plans that Members of Congress have. And \nthe abortion protections for all of the Federal health programs all say \nexactly the same thing.\n  The amendment we are going to vote on that is the Nelson-Hatch-Casey \namendment would preserve the three-decades-long precedent--that is what \nyour amendment does--and that we must pass it if we are going to \nguarantee that the bill that is on the floor is properly amended so it \nis the same as our 30 years of abortion Federal policy in this country?\n  Mr. HATCH. Right. The reason it is so critical we pass the Nelson-\nHatch-Casey amendment is that it is the only way to guarantee that \ntaxpayers' dollars are not used by the insurance plans under the \nDemocrats' bill to pay for abortions. In other words, the Hyde language \nis in the appropriations process. We have to do it every year rather \nthan making it a solid amendment. But this bill is not subject to \nappropriations. So if we leave the Hyde language out of this bill, the \nlanguage we have in the amendment, the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment, \nthen we would be opening up a door for people who believe that abortion \nought to be paid for by the Federal Government to do so. And we should \nclose that door because that has been the rule since 1977.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator for the explanation. I thank the \nSenator from Utah because I do think it is important people know. There \nhas been a lot of questions raised about the bill and whether it would \nbe a foot in the door for changing a policy that has been the law of \nour country, and accepted as such. Whether it was a Democratic-\ncontrolled Congress or a Republican-controlled Congress, I think \neveryone has agreed this Hyde amendment language has protected Federal \ntaxpayers who might have a very firm conviction against abortion so \nthey would not have to be subsidizing this procedure.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate the Senator from Texas pointing this out. The \ncurrent bill has language that looks like it is protective, but it is \nnot. That is what we are trying to do: close the loophole in that \nlanguage and get it so we live up to the Hyde amendment, which has been \nin law since 1977.\n  To be honest with you, I do not see how anybody could argue that the \ntaxpayers ought to be called upon to foot the bill for abortions. Let's \nbe brutally frank about it. The taxpayers should not be called upon to \npay for abortions. The polls range from 61 percent of the American \npeople, including many pro-choice people, who do not believe taxpayers \nshould pay for abortions, to 68 percent. The polls are from 61 to 68 \npercent of those who do not believe the taxpayers ought to be paying \nfor abortion, except to save the life of the mother or because of rape \nor incest. And we have provided for those approaches in this amendment. \nSo anybody who argues otherwise is plain not being accurate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, will the Senator from Utah be willing \nto yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My question relates to the provisions of the pending \nbill, section 1303(2)(A), which specifies that the plan will not allow \nfor any payments of abortion, and where there is, as provided under \nsection 1303(2)(B), there will be a segregation of funds. So that under \nthe existing statute, there is no Federal funding used for abortion. \nBut a woman has the right to pay for her own abortion coverage. And \nwith the status of Medicaid, where the prohibition applies to any \nFederal funds being used to pay for an abortion, there are 23 States \nwhich allow for payment for abortion coverage coming out of State \nfunds.\n  So aren't the provisions of this statute, which enable a woman to pay \nfor an abortion on her own, exactly the same as what is now covered \nunder Medicaid, without violating the provisions of the Hyde amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, the way we view the current language in the bill is \nthat there is a loophole there whereby they can even use Federal funds \nto provide for abortion under this segregation language, and that is \nwhat we are concerned about. We want to close that loophole and make \nsure that the Federal funds are not used for abortion.\n  Like I say, there are millions of people who are pro-choice who agree \nwith the Hyde language. All we are doing is putting the Hyde language \ninto this bill in a way that we think will work better.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield further.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. In responding to the Senator from Pennsylvania as \nwell, I wish to quote Bart Stupak, who carried the same sort of \namendment you are putting forward, only on the House side. The same \nsorts of questions, naturally, were coming forward, saying: OK, you are \nblocking abortion funding for the individual. He said this--and I am \nquoting directly from Representative Stupak:\n\n       The Capps amendment--Which is in the base Reid bill here--\n     departed from Hyde in several important and troubling ways: \n     by mandating that at least one plan in the health insurance \n     exchange provide abortion coverage, by requiring a minimum $1 \n     monthly charge for all covered individuals that would go \n     toward paying for abortions and by allowing individuals \n     receiving Federal affordability credits--\n\n\n[[Page S12661]]\n\n\n  Those are Federal dollars--\n\n     to purchase health insurance plans that cover abortion. . . .\n\n  In all those ways, the Capps amendment--which is in the Reid bill--\nexpands and does allow Federal funding of abortion that we have not \ndone for 33 years.\n  Going on with Representative Stupak's statement:\n\n       Hyde currently prohibits direct federal funding of \n     abortion. . . . The Stupak amendment--\n\n  Which is also the Nelson-Hatch amendment--\n\n     is a continuation of this policy--\n\n  Of the Hyde amendment--\n\n     nothing more, nothing less.\n\n  I think it is important to clarify that this is a continuation of \nwhat we have been doing for 33 years that the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from Nebraska are putting forward with this amendment.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my colleague for bringing it \nforward. The segregation language is very problematic language. That is \nwhat we are trying to resolve. We basically have all agreed with the \nHyde amendment, which is from 1977, and this would, in effect, \nincorporate the language in the bill.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Would the Senator yield for another comment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I might just offer a thought here on that language. The \nNational Right to Life group saw through that gimmick immediately. It \ntook them about 20 seconds to figure out what was happening here. I \nthink they referred to it as a ``bookkeeping gimmick,'' that somehow \nthere would be some segregation if the Federal money went in your left \npocket but you paid for abortions out of your right pocket. It doesn't \nmake any sense. That segregation isn't going to work. They saw through \nit. They saw the gimmick it was.\n  Let me just say, I support the Senator's amendment. I applaud Senator \nHatch and Senator Nelson and Senator Casey for bringing this very \nimportant issue forward. I applaud you for keeping this effort that \nstarted with the Hyde amendment--or Hyde language, rather--because what \nwe are really doing here is we are saying very clearly to the American \npeople, whether directly or indirectly, your tax dollars are not going \nto be used to buy abortions.\n  Thank you for your leadership on this issue. I am happy to be here to \nsupport that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the Senator from Utah respond to my question? How \ncan you disagree with the provisions of section 1303(2)(A) of the bill \nwhich is pending which specifies that if a qualified health plan \nprovides services for abortion--this is the essence of it--if a \nqualified health plan provides coverage for services for abortion, the \nissuer of the plan should not use any amount of the Federal funds for \nabortion? So there is a flatout prohibition for use of Federal funds. \nAnd under section 1303(2)(B), there is a segregation of funds which is \nidentical to Medicaid.\n  So however you may want to characterize it, how do you respond to the \nflat language of the statute which accomplishes the purpose of the Hyde \namendment and allows for a payment by collateral funds, just as \nMedicaid pays for abortions without Federal funds?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me respond to the distinguished Senator, although I am \nnot going to ask him a formal question. If that is true, then why have \nthe Capps language in there? Why don't we just take the Hyde language, \nwhich is what we are trying to do. It isn't true. We know in this bill \nthere will be subsidization to help people pay for health insurance. In \nfact, the subsidization can go to people up to $88,000 a year, and that \ncould be indirectly used for abortion. It is a loophole that Hyde \ncloses.\n  If the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania believes the Capps \nlanguage does what Hyde meant to begin with and what it has been since \n1977, what is wrong with putting the Hyde language in here and solving \nthe problem once and for all? We see it as a loophole through which \nthey can actually get help from the Federal Government directly and \nindirectly to pay for abortion.\n  Now, let's think about it. There are no mandates in this language \nthat we have for elective abortion coverage. Plans and providers are \nfree from any government mandate for abortion. There is no Federal \nfunding of elective abortion or plans that include elective abortion \nexcept in the cases where the life of the mother is in danger or the \npregnancy is caused by rape or incest. The amendment allows individuals \nto purchase a supplemental policy from a plan that covers elective \nabortion as long as it is purchased with private dollars. The amendment \nprohibits the public plan from covering elective abortions. It prevents \nthe Federal Government from mandating abortion coverage by private \nhealth plans or providers within such plans. And insurance plans are \nnot prevented from selling truly private abortion coverage, even \nthrough the exchange. This amendment doesn't prohibit that.\n  The bottom line: The effect on abortion funding and mandates is \nexactly the same as that of the House bill changed by the Stupak \namendment.\n  Now, look, if the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania believes \nthe Capps language is the same as Hyde, he is wrong. And if he believes \nit does what Hyde would do, he is wrong there. Why not just put the \nHyde language in once and for all, which has been there since 1977? \nThat is what the Stupak language is.\n  The Hyde amendment specifically removes abortion from government \nprograms, but the Reid bill specifically allows abortion to be offered \nin two huge new government programs. The Reid bill tries to explain \nthis contradiction by calling for the segregation of Federal dollars \nwhen Federal subsidies are used to purchase health plans. This \n``segregation'' of funds actually violates the Hyde amendment which \nprevents funding of abortion not only by Federal funds but also by \nState matching funds within the same plan. Simply put, today, Federal \nand State Medicaid dollars are not segregated. So that is the \ndifference.\n  If the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania believes the current \nlanguage in the Reid bill meets the qualities of the Hyde language, \nthen why not just put the Hyde language in once and for all since it \nhas been in law since 1977?\n  It is important to note that today there is no segregation of Federal \nfunds in any Federal health care program. For example, the Medicaid \nProgram receives both Federal and State dollars. There is no \nsegregation of either the Federal Medicaid dollars or the State \nMedicaid dollars.\n  With that, I know I have some colleagues who have asked for some time \nto speak, so I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Utah has not yet answered the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I strongly support the efforts of the distinguished Senator from Utah \nand his amendment offered along with Senator Nelson and Senator Casey. \nAnd I think this exchange and this colloquy is very helpful. In fact, I \nthink it proves the point, particularly the participation of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania in it. The only folks who are defending the \nlanguage in the Reid bill are folks who are clearly and strongly pro-\nchoice, pro-abortion. Folks who have a fundamental problem with that \nall say the underlying language in the Reid bill has huge loopholes. \nThat includes people who want to support the bill otherwise. I am \nstrongly against this bill. I am not in that category. But, as the \ndistinguished Senator, Mr. Brownback, mentioned, Representative Stupak \nwants to support the underlying bill. He supported it in the House, but \nhe was very clear in his efforts on the House floor that the underlying \nlanguage, which is now in the Reid bill, had huge loopholes, wasn't \ngood enough, needed to be fixed. That is why he came up with the Stupak \nlanguage, and that is essentially exactly what we have in this \namendment.\n  Similarly, the U.S. Conference of Bishops is very supportive of the \nconcepts of the underlying bill, but they have said clearly that the \nReid bill is ``completely unacceptable'' on this abortion issue and \n``is actually the worst bill we have seen so far on the life issues.''\n\n[[Page S12662]]\n\n  So this colloquy involving the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, I think that general debate proves the point clearly.\n  I again compliment the Senator from Utah, along with Senator Nelson, \nSenator Casey, and others--I am a cosponsor of the amendment--on this \neffort. We need to pass this on the bill. This will do away with the \nloophole. This will be real language to truly prohibit taxpayer funding \nof abortions. This constitutes exactly the same as that long tradition, \nsince 1977, of the Hyde amendment. This marries the Stupak language, so \nit should be crystal-clear.\n  What will this amendment specifically do? It will mean there are no \nmandates for elective abortion coverage. Plans and providers are free \nfrom any government mandate for abortion under this amendment language. \nIt would mean there is no Federal funding of elective abortion or plans \nthat include elective abortion except in the case of when the life of \nthe mother is in danger or in case of rape or incest. It means this \namendment would allow individuals to purchase a supplemental policy or \na plan that covers elective abortion as long as that separate policy is \npurchased completely with private dollars. It would prohibit the public \nplan from covering those elective abortions and prevent the Federal \nGovernment from mandating abortion coverage by any private plan. \nInsurance plans are not prevented from selling truly private abortion \ncoverage, including through the exchange, but taxpayer dollars would \nhave nothing--absolutely nothing--to do with it.\n  Bottom line: The effect on abortion funding and mandates is exactly \nthe same as the long and distinguished tradition of the Hyde amendment \nwith this amendment, and it would be exactly the same as the Stupak \nlanguage on the House side.\n  I also agreed with the distinguished Senator from Utah when he said \nthis should not be of any great controversy. Abortion is a deeply \ndivisive issue in this country, but taxpayer dollars being used to pay \nfor abortion is not. There is a broad and a wide and a deep consensus \nagainst using any taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion. The Senator \nfrom Utah mentioned polls. That is why the Hyde amendment has been \nlongstanding since 1977. That is why it has been voted for and \nsupported and passed again and again in Congresses with Democratic \nmajorities and Republican majorities. It is a solid consensus. It does \nrepresent the common sense of the American people. Certainly, I will \nfollow in a similar, proud tradition of Louisiana Senators supporting \nthat consensus. Every U.S. Senator from Louisiana since the Hyde \namendment was originally adopted has strongly supported this \ncommonsense consensus view--every Senator. Everyone but me has been \nDemocratic, but every sitting U.S. Senator from Louisiana has supported \nthat commonsense consensus view, and I surely hope that tradition \ncontinues today.\n  Again, I applaud the Senator from Utah and his leading cosponsors, \nSenator Nelson and Senator Casey, on this effort, and I encourage all \nof my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to come together around \nwhat the American people consider a real no-brainer, a true consensus, \nsomething that clearly reflects the common sense of the American \npeople. Is abortion a divisive issue? Yes. Is using taxpayer dollars to \nfund abortion a close question? No. There is a clear consensus in \nAmerica not to use any taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. It is \ncrystal-clear that we need to pass this amendment, and the underlying \nlanguage in the Reid bill is completely unacceptable.\n  With that, thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am very appreciative of the Senator \nfrom Texas, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska, and, of course, the distinguished Senator from \nKansas and the distinguished Senator from South Dakota who are here on \nthe floor and participating. I believe we have until 12:27, so I am \ngoing to relinquish the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE. Before the Senator leaves, I wish to put one fine point on \nsomething the Senator said in response to the question from the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania about the use of Medicaid funds in the States.\n  There are a number of States that do provide programs that have \nabortion funding, but I think there is a very clear distinction that \nneeds to be made in Medicaid funds which are matching funds, and none \nof those funds can be used to fund abortions. You said that in response \nto his question, but I think that point needs to be made very clearly \nbecause the Senator from Pennsylvania was implying that somehow, since \nStates have created programs to fund abortions and since Medicaid is a \nFederal and State program, that somehow those two are being mixed, and \nthat this idea that because they are calling for ``segregation,'' that \nreally doesn't exist in the Medicaid Program.\n  The Medicaid Program--those are matching funds--is a Federal-State \nprogram. The Federal dollars that go into the Medicaid Program--the \nprohibition that exists on Federal funding of abortions applies to \nMedicaid dollars that go to the States, to the degree that States have \nadopted programs that fund abortion. Those are State funds and not \nMedicaid funds, which are matching funds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am glad the Senator made that even more clear. Last \nnight, a number of Democrats completely distorted this issue. If they \nthink the Capps language equals the Hyde language, why not put it in? \nThey want to be able to fund abortion any way they possibly can, to \nfund it in a variety of ways, with Federal dollars, if we don't put the \nHyde language in. That is what this is about.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If you are not clear about this, then abortion will be \nfunded. If there is any of this that needs clarity one thing is for \ncertain with the Capps language in the baseline of the Reid bill, that \nabortion will be funded.\n  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts recently passed its State-mandated \ninsurance, Commonwealth Care, without an explicit exclusion on \nabortion. Guess what. Abortions there were also funded immediately. In \nfact, according to the Commonwealth Care Web site, abortion is \nconsidered covered as outpatient medical care. That is a point about \nbeing clear with the Hyde-type language, which is the Nelson-Hatch \nlanguage, which says: No, we are not going to fund this, and we are \ngoing to continue the 33-year policy. If we keep the Capps language in \nthat funds abortion--the last time the Federal Government funded \nabortions was during that 3-year period after Roe, but before Hyde, and \nwe were funding about 300,000 abortions a year. The Federal taxpayer \ndollars funded abortions through Medicaid.\n  I cannot believe any of my colleagues would say: Yes, I would be \nwilling to buy into that 300,000 abortions a year when President Obama \nand President Clinton said we want to make abortions safe, legal, and \nrare. Well, 300,000 a year would not be in that ballpark. That is the \npast number that happened when you didn't have Hyde language in place \nat the Federal level.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is what it will do here too. All this yelling and \nscreaming when they say it equals the Hyde language--it doesn't. That \nis the problem. If they want to solve the problem, why not use the Hyde \nlanguage that has been accepted by every Congress since 1977? The \nSenator is right that there were 300,000 abortions a year between 1973 \nand 1977 because we didn't have the Hyde language. We got tired of the \ntaxpayers paying for them. Why should they pay for it? Why should \ntaxpayers who are pro-life--for religious reasons or otherwise--have to \npay for abortions, elective abortions by those who are not? They should \nnot have to.\n  To be honest, the language in the current bill is ambiguous and it \nwould allow that. Anybody who is arguing this is the same as the Hyde \nlanguage hasn't read the Capps language. We want to change it to go \nalong with Hyde. It doesn't affect the right to abortion, except that \nwe are not going to have taxpayers paying for it.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. THUNE. That is what Stupak and other Members of the House of \nRepresentatives saw; that this created\n\n[[Page S12663]]\n\ntremendous ambiguity and they sought to tighten it up and reinstate the \nlongstanding policy regarding Federal funds and their use to finance \nabortions since 1977, the Hyde language. The Stupak amendment to the \nHouse bill passed with 240 votes. There was a sizable, decisive \nmajority of Members in the House of Representatives who saw through \nwhat the ambiguity was that exists regarding the House bill and now the \nSenate bill.\n  This is intentionally ambiguous for the reasons you mentioned. This \nsimply clarifies, once and for all, what has been standard policy at \nthe Federal level going back to 1977. As the Senator stated earlier, I \nbelieve it represents the consensus view in America of both Republicans \nand Democrats who believe this is ground we can all stand on, \nirrespective of where people come down on this issue; that the idea \nthat somehow Federal taxpayer funds ought to finance abortions is \nsomething most Americans disagree with. That is why there has been such \nbroad, bipartisan support for this particular policy, and that is why \nit should be extended into the future.\n  As the Senator from Utah said, 61 percent are against funding \nabortions. But I have seen polls that suggest it is much higher than \nthat. I know it is much higher in my State of South Dakota. I commend \nthe Senator for seeing his way to offer an amendment that clarifies and \nremoves all this ambiguity and what, to me, is clearly an intentional \nambiguity regarding this issue and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCornyn be added as a cosponsor to the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I have been on the floor a number of \ntimes debating this issue, a while back on a motion to proceed and \nsince this amendment has come up. I wish to tell the Senator from Utah \nthat I don't believe I have seen a more concise, clear explanation of \nthe history of the Hyde language than I saw over the last half hour of \ndebate on the Senate floor. The Senator laid it out perfectly. The \nSenator laid out how we have, over a long period of time, stayed with \nthat Hyde language. That was the agreement that had been reached.\n  Our colleague from Texas said this is a foot in the door, and I agree \nwith her. If this Reid bill passes with the current language on \nabortion, it is not only a foot in the door but, in my estimation, it \nkicks down the door. It kicks down the door and sets up structure for \nthe Federal funding of abortions. That is what we are going to end up \nwith.\n  A couple weeks ago, I came to the floor when we were debating the \nmotion to proceed and I said, at that time, to me, this is the pro-life \nvote, because if this bill goes to the floor, we will now need 60 votes \nto get an amendment passed. I said I don't count the 60. I issued a \nchallenge and I said: If there is any Member who has a list of 60 \nMembers who will vote for this amendment, I am willing to look at that \nand change my view of the world. Well, that hasn't happened.\n  In fact, there are many predictions being made that, sadly and \nunfortunately, this amendment will not get the 60 votes it needs.\n  Let me put this into context. For pro-life Senators, this is the \nvote, but it doesn't stop here. In my estimation, you are pro-life on \nevery vote. You don't get a pass on this vote or that vote or the next \nvote or whatever the vote is. You are pro-life all the way through.\n  Even if this amendment doesn't pass, I wish to make the case that \nthis bill should not go forward because it literally will create a \nsystem, a structure, a way to finance abortions. I don't believe that \nis what this country wants. Many Senators, including the Senator from \nSouth Dakota and the Senator from Kansas, have very clearly made the \ncase that the people of the United States do not want their tax dollars \nto go to buying abortions.\n  My hope is, 60 Senators will step up on this amendment. I will sure \nsupport it. I will speak everywhere I can in support of it. I am so \nappreciative that Senator Nelson and Senator Hatch and Senator Casey \nbrought this forward. I am glad to be a cosponsor. It is my hope this \namendment will pass.\n  It is my conviction that we need to stand strong throughout this \ndebate and make sure this language doesn't end up in the final bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I think the Catholic bishops have put \nit as concisely as anybody:\n\n       In every major Federal program where Federal funds combine \n     with nonfederal funds (e.g. state or private) to support or \n     purchase health coverage, Congress has consistently sought to \n     ensure that the entire package of benefits excludes elective \n     abortion. For example, the Hyde amendment governing Medicaid \n     prevents the funding of such abortions not only using federal \n     funds themselves, but also using the state matching funds \n     that combine with the federal funds to subsidize the \n     coverage. A similar amendment excludes elective abortions \n     from all plans offered under the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Program, where private premiums are supplemented by \n     a federal subsidy. Where relevant, such provisions also \n     specify that federal funds may not be used to help pay for \n     administrative expenses of a benefits package that included \n     abortions. Under this policy, those wishing to use state or \n     private funds to purchase abortion coverage must do so \n     completely separately from the plan that is purchased in \n     whole or in part with federal financial assistance. This is \n     the policy that health care reform legislation must follow if \n     it is to comply with the legal status quo on federal funding \n     of abortion coverage. All of the five health care reform \n     bills approved by committee in the 111th Congress violate \n     this policy.\n\n  Following the Hyde amendment principles is what we have done for 33 \nyears, until this moment, until the Capps language in the Reid bill. \nNow we have flipped that on its head and are saying you can combine \nFederal funds with non-Federal funds to pay for elective abortions. \nThat was the policy prior to Hyde in 1977. That funded 300,000 \nabortions, roughly, a year at that point in time. There is no way in \nthis country that is a policy the American people support. They don't. \nThey may be divided about abortion but not about Federal funding for \nelective abortion. There is no division about that at all. It has been \nvery consistent policy, until we have seen the Reid bill, this \nparticular piece of legislation. We have been quite consistent about \nthis. It is my hope my colleagues will say: I may be pro-choice, but I \nhave consistently supported Hyde because I think we should not be \nfunding elective abortions.\n  I hope they will vote for the Nelson-Hatch amendment because of that \nvery feature. It is not about abortion, it is about the funding of \nelective abortions. I hope we don't go in that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Montana has 3 minutes 17 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, with respect to the last debate, let's \nbe clear that the underlying bill keeps the three-decades-old agreement \nthat has implemented the Hyde amendment to separate Federal funds from \nprivate funds when it comes to reproductive health care.\n  The Nelson-Hatch amendment is unnecessary. It is discriminatory \nagainst women. Women are the only group of people who are told how to \nuse their own private money. That is unfair.\n  On another matter, with respect to the McCain motion, let me explain \na little bit about Medicare Advantage and how it works. Essentially, \nthe Medicare Advantage Programs are insurance companies. They are \ninsurance companies that have their own officers, directors, their own \nmarketing plans and their own administrative costs and they are \nconcerned about the rate of return on investment for their \nstockholders. These are simple, garden variety, ordinary insurance \ncompanies.\n  In this case, they are insurance companies that get general revenue \nfrom payroll taxes and premiums. They are basically insurance companies \nthat give benefits to senior citizens. These insurance companies are \noverpaid. There is not much disagreement that they are overpaid. How \nare they paid? Well, believe it or not, these insurance companies--\nMedicare Advantage plans--are paid according to the amount Congress \nsets in statute. That is their payment rate, what Congress sets in \nstatute.\n\n[[Page S12664]]\n\n  The problem is, by doing so, these preset rates overstate the actual \ncost of providing care by 30 percent. We pay more than it costs to \nprovide care by about 30 percent, in many cases. These overpayments \nalso clearly promote inefficiencies in Medicare. Also, these payments \nhave not been proven to increase the quality of care seniors receive. \nIn the estimate I saw, about half the Medicare Advantage plans have \ncare coordination and half don't. Half are no better than ordinary fee-\nfor-service plans. Because of this broken, irrational payment system, \nsome plans receive more than $200 per enrollee per month and others \nreceive about $36 per enrollee per month.\n  Again, the payment rates are set by statute, relating to fee for \nservice in the area. It is broken. It doesn't make sense. It causes \ngreat dislocations and differences in the payment rates. Frankly, under \nthis broken system, all beneficiaries are not receiving the same care. \nI believe all beneficiaries should be able to have access to the best \ncare, not just those who happen to live in States with high payment \nrates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for \nan additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have said these Medicare Advantage \nplans are overpaid. Nobody disagrees with that. They are overpaid. The \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, when I asked him a few days ago if \nhe thought they were overpaid, said: Yes, they are overpaid. The MedPAC \nadvisory board tells us: Yes, they are overpaid.\n  Here is a statement made by Tom Scully, former Administrator of the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services:\n\n       I think Congress should take some of it away. There's been \n     huge over-funding.\n\n  There are lots of other citations from Wall Street analysts and \nothers in the industry saying clearly the Medicare Advantage plans are \noverpaid. Frankly, we, in Congress, put a statutory provision in law \nthat has caused this overpayment. Clearly, we should fix it.\n  In addition, something that is pretty alarming is, according to a \nstudy I saw, only about 14 cents on the dollar of extra payments to \nMedicare Advantage plans goes to beneficiaries--only 14 cents--which \nmeans 86 cents on the dollar goes to the company, not to the \nbeneficiaries, not to the enrollees but to the companies--``the \ncompanies'' meaning the officers, directors, administrative costs, \nmarketing costs, rate of return. It is to the company, any ordinary, \ngarden variety company. Therefore, it behooves us to find a better way \nto pay Medicare Advantage companies so it is efficient, there is not \nwaste, and payments go primarily to enrollees, to beneficiaries.\n  How do we do that? This legislation moves away from the current \narchaic system which sets statutory amounts in effect. Rather, we say, \nOK, why not have these companies bid? Let them compete based on costs \nin their regions. One region of the country is different from another \nregion of the country. We are going to say what is fair here to get rid \nof a lot of waste and overpayments is provide that Medicare Advantage \nplans can compete in their area based on cost.\n  The plan will be paid the average bids that are based on competition \nin the area. We, the authors of this bill, think that is a far better \nway of paying for Medicare Advantage.\n  Will that reduce payments to beneficiaries? Certainly no. All \nguaranteed benefits are guaranteed in this legislation. In fact, I am \ngoing to check up on another statistic. I heard somewhere under this \nlegislation there will be an increase of enrollees--not a decrease, an \nincrease of enrollees. I am going to track that down because I want to \nbe sure I am accurate.\n  I will conclude. I want to talk more about this issue later. There \nmay be a separate amendment on this subject offered on our side. By and \nlarge, it is wrong to continue a current system that dramatically \noverpays and where 86 percent of the overpayment goes to the company \nand only 14 cents goes to the beneficiaries. We have to come up with a \nfair way of paying Medicare Advantage. I think a fair way is to have \nthe companies competitively bid based on cost in their areas. That way \nthey are going to get reimbursed at a level that is relevant to their \narea, and it is also relative to the cost they incur when they run \ntheir plans. I will have more to say about that later.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/08/senate-section/article/S12664-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween 2:15 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. be equally divided between the two \nleaders, or their designees, in alternating 30-minute blocks of time, \nwith the majority controlling the first 30 minutes and the Republicans \ncontrolling the second 30 minutes; further, that no amendments be in \norder during this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, since this is the 30 minutes of time for \nour side, I ask that I be recognized for 10 minutes, Senator Murray for \n5 minutes, Senator Lautenberg for 5 minutes, Senator Harkin for 5 \nminutes, and Senator Cardin for 5 minutes.\n  We have many Members who wish to come and speak, and I would urge \nthem to contact us. I will just take a minute to get my notes in order, \nso I suggest the absence of a quorum, and the time should be taken off \nour time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are in the middle of a very important \ndebate about whether we are going to move forward and make sure our \npeople in America have health care. That is what it is about. I am \ngoing to throw out a few numbers that are always on my mind as I talk \nabout this issue. One of them is 14,000. Every day, 14,000 Americans \nlose their health insurance. It is not because they did anything wrong. \nA lot of times it is just because they get sick and their insurance \ncompany walks away from them or they may reach the limit of their \ncoverage, which they didn't realize they had, and they are done for. \nThey could lose their job and suddenly they can't afford to pay the \nfull brunt of their premium. They could get sick and then all of a \nsudden are now branded with a PC--and that is not a personal computer, \nit is a preexisting condition--and they can't get health care.\n  So we are in trouble in this country, with 14,000 Americans a day \nlosing their health care, and a lot of them are working Americans. As a \nmatter of fact, most of them are working Americans. Sometimes a child, \nfor example, will reach the age where they can no longer be covered \nthrough their parents' plan, and the child might have had asthma. When \nthey go to the doctor, they beg the doctor not to say they have asthma. \nI have doctors writing to me saying that parents are begging them: \nPlease, don't write down that my child has asthma; say she has \nbronchitis because when she goes off my medical plan, she is going to \nbe branded with a preexisting condition. So 14,000 Americans a day, \nremember that number.\n  Then, Mr. President, 66 percent, that is the percentage--66 percent--\nof all bankruptcies that are due to a health care crisis. People are \ngoing bankrupt not because they didn't manage their money well or they \ndidn't work hard and save but because they are hit with a health care \ncrisis and either they had no insurance or the insurance refused them. \nThe stories that come across my desk, as I am sure yours, are very \nheartbreaking. So people are going bankrupt. They lose their dignity, \nthey lose everything because of a health care crisis.\n\n[[Page S12665]]\n\n  Yesterday, I brought up a couple of numbers--29 out of 30 \nindustrialized nations. That is where we stand on infant mortality. We \nare not doing very well. It is no wonder; more than 50 percent of the \nwomen in this Nation are not seeking health care when they should. They \nare putting it off or they are never getting it. No wonder we don't do \nwell with infant mortality.\n  Now, why don't women do this? Because they either don't have \ninsurance or they do not have good enough insurance or they can't \nafford the copay or they are fearful. They are fearful that maybe if \nthey go this time, the insurance company will say: No more.\n  We rank 24 out of 30 industrialized nations for life expectancy. My \nconstituents are shocked to hear that. They are shocked at the infant \nmortality ranking, and they are shocked at the life expectancy ranking. \nI have heard my Republican friends try to rationalize this: Well, it is \nbecause our population is diverse--and all the rest. This is the most \npowerful, richest Nation on Earth. There is no reason we have to be 24 \nout of 30 in terms of our life expectancy, especially when we know so \nmuch of our problem deals with about five diseases--diseases such as \ndiabetes, which can be prevented and certainly treated.\n  The last number I will talk about is 45 percent. The average family \nin America, by 2016, if we do nothing, will be paying 45 percent of \ntheir income on premiums. Now, this is disastrous, and 2016 is around \nthe corner by my calculations. So that means more and more of us will \nnot be able to afford insurance, and we are going to show up at \nhospital emergency rooms. That costs a lot and the outcomes are bad and \nAmerica will continue on this downward spiral in relation to our health \ncare system.\n  Why do I take time to talk about this issue? It is because we need to \nkeep our eye on the big picture, and the big picture is not a pretty \npicture for our people right now. The status quo is not benign, it is \nnot neutral, it is cruel. Every one of us could wake up in the morning \nhaving lost a job and having no health care. So what we are doing is \ngoing to help every American, and I think one of the best things we do \nin the underlying bill is to make sure that health care premiums are \naffordable for everyone. That is the key, and we do it in a number of \nways.\n  But, Mr. President, in the middle of all this, we have an amendment \nthat would roll back the clock on women's rights. I am here to say, as \nI said last night--and I am happy to see other colleagues joining me--\nit is unacceptable to single out one group of people--namely the women \nof this country--and tell them they can't use their own private money \nto buy an insurance policy that covers the range of reproductive health \ncare. Why are women being singled out? It is so unfair.\n  We have had a firewall in place for 30 years. It said this: No \nFederal funds can be used for abortion, but private funds can be used \nas long as abortion is legal, and it is. Roe v. Wade made it legal in \nthe early stages of a pregnancy. Women have had that right.\n  Well, this amendment says there is one group of people we are going \nto treat differently. We are going to take one procedure, that only \napplies to them, and say they can't buy health insurance for that \nprocedure--only if it is a separate rider, which everyone knows is \nunaffordable, impractical, and will not work.\n  I don't see any amendment saying to men that if they want to have a \nprocedure that relates to their reproductive health they can't use \ntheir own private money to buy coverage for it. No, it is not in there. \nWe don't tell men, if they want to make sure they can buy insurance \ncoverage through their pharmaceutical plan for Viagra, that they can't \ndo it. No, we don't do that, and I wouldn't support that. It would be \nwrong. Well, it is wrong to single out women and to say to the women of \nthis country that they can't use their own private funds to purchase \ninsurance that covers the whole range of reproductive health care.\n  You have to look behind this amendment to understand how pernicious \nit really is. I have five male colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who were on the Senate floor for at least an hour or so talking \nabout this amendment, and one thing about each and every one of them, \nthey want to make abortion illegal. There is no question about it. They \nwant to take away a woman's right to choose, even in the earliest \nstages of the pregnancy, even if it impacts her health, her ability to \nremain fertile, or her ability to avoid a very serious health issue \nsuch as a heart problem, a stroke. They do not want to have an \nexception for a woman's health. No question, that is what they want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds, and \nthen I will turn to Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So to sum up my part, the amendment that has been offered \nby Senators Nelson, Hatch, Vitter, Brownback, et al., hurts women. It \nsingles out one legal procedure and says: You know what. You can't use \nyour own private funds to buy insurance so that in case you need to use \nit for that legal procedure, you can. So I hope we will vote it down.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and note that Senator Lautenberg is \nhere for 5 minutes. Oh, I am sorry. May I say that the order was \nSenator Murray for 5 minutes to be followed by Senator Lautenberg for \n5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher debate, for outlining the serious concerns we have, and I rise \ntoday not only in strong opposition to the Nelson amendment but in \nstrong support of women's health care choices, which this amendment \nwould eliminate.\n  Mr. President, we can't allow a bill that does so much for women and \nfor families and for our businesses and for the future strength of this \nNation to get bogged down in ideological politics because in every \nsingle sense of the word, health insurance reform is about choices--\ngiving options to those who don't have them: options for better care or \nbetter quality, and insurance that is within reach. This bill was never \nsupposed to be about taking away choices, and we cannot allow it to \nbecome that.\n  Mr. President, this bill already does so much for millions of women \nacross America. Already so far, the Senate has passed Senator \nMikulski's amendment to be sure that all women have access to quality \npreventive health care services, and that screenings, which are so \ncritical to keeping women healthy, are available. This underlying bill \nwill also help women by ending discrimination based on gender-rating or \ngender-biased preexisting conditions, on covering maternity care, \npreventive care and screenings, including mammograms and well-baby \ncare, expanding access to coverage even if an employer doesn't cover \nit, and giving freedom to those who are forced to stay in abusive \nrelationships because if they leave, they or their children could lose \ntheir coverage.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us today would undermine those \nefforts and goes against the spirit and the goal of this underlying \nbill. All Americans should be allowed to choose a plan that allows for \ncoverage of any legal health care service, no matter their income, and \nthat, by the way, includes women. But if this amendment were to pass, \nit would be the first time that Federal law would restrict what \nindividual private dollars can pay for in the private health insurance \nmarketplace.\n  Let me repeat that: If this amendment were to pass, it would be the \nfirst time that Federal law would restrict what individual private \ndollars can pay for in the private health insurance marketplace.\n  Now, the opponents of this bill have taken to the floor day in and \nday out for months arguing that this bill takes away choice. This bill \ndoesn't take away choice, Mr. President, but this amendment sure does. \nThis amendment stipulates that any health plan receiving any funds \nunder this legislation cannot cover abortion care, even if such \ncoverage is paid for using the private premiums that health plans \nreceive directly from individuals.\n  Simply put, the amendment says if a health plan wants to offer \ncoverage to individuals who receive affordability credits--no matter \nhow small--that coverage cannot include abortion.\n  In this way, the amendment doesn't only restrict Federal funds, it \nrestricts\n\n[[Page S12666]]\n\nprivate funds. It doesn't just affect those receiving some amount of \naffordability credits, it also impacts people who are paying the entire \ncost of coverage but who just happen to purchase the same health plan \nas those with affordability credits.\n  The bottom line: This amendment would be taking away options and \nchoices for American women.\n  There is no question this amendment goes much further than current \nlaw, no matter what our colleagues on the other side contend. Current \nlaw restricts public funds from paying for abortion except in cases of \nrape or incest or where the woman's life is in danger. The existing \nbill before us represents a genuine compromise. It prohibits Federal \nfunding of abortion, other than the exceptions I just mentioned, but it \nalso allows women to pay for coverage with their own private funds. It \nmaintains current law; it doesn't roll it back.\n  This amendment now before us would be an unprecedented restriction on \nwomen's health choices and coverage. Health insurance reform should be \na giant step forward for the health and economic stability of all \nAmericans. This amendment would be a giant step backward for women's \nhealth and women's rights. Women already pay higher costs for health \ncare. We should not be forced into limited choices as well.\n  We are standing on the floor today having a debate about a broken \nhealth insurance system. It is broken for women who are denied coverage \nor charged more for preexisting conditions such as pregnancy or C-\nsections or domestic violence. It is broken when insurance companies \ncharge women of childbearing age more than men but don't cover \nmaternity care or only offer it for hefty additional premiums.\n  The status quo is not working. Women and their families need health \ninsurance reform that gives them options, doesn't take them away.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for real reform. Reject this \nshortsighted amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to amend the \nprevious order to give Senator Lautenberg 8 minutes, myself 2 minutes, \nand Senator Cardin 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, throughout my service in the Senate, I \nhave been a strong supporter for health care reform. But we can't allow \nreform to be used as an excuse to roll back women's rights that they \nhave had for almost half a century. That is why I strongly oppose the \namendment offered by my friend, the Senator from Nebraska. I think he \nis wrong.\n  What this amendment does is remove a woman's right to make her own \ndecision, as a practical matter. It is to prohibit any of the health \nplans on the exchange from covering abortion. It will ban coverage even \nfor women who don't get a dime in Federal subsidy.\n  Women's reproductive rights are always being challenged here in \nCongress. What about men's reproductive rights? Let's turn the tables \nfor a moment. What if we were to vote on a Viagra amendment restricting \ncoverage for male reproductive services? The same rules would apply for \nViagra as being proposed for abortion. Of course, that means no health \nplan on the exchange would cover Viagra availability. How popular would \nthat demand be around here? I understand that abortion and drugs such \nas Viagra present different issues, but there is a fundamental \nprinciple that is the same: restricting access to reproductive health \nservices for one gender. This amendment is exclusively directed at a \nwoman's right to decide for herself. It doesn't dare to challenge men's \npersonal decisions.\n  I have the good fortune of being a father of three daughters and \ngrandfather of six granddaughters. I am deeply concerned by the \nprecedent this amendment would set. I don't want politicians making \ndecisions for my daughters or my granddaughters when it comes to their \nhealth and well-being, but that is exactly what this amendment does.\n  Nothing made me happier than when any of my daughters announced a \npregnancy. I watched them grow and prosper in their health and well-\nbeing, as they were carrying that child. I was fully prepared to \nsupport a decision she might make for the best health of that new baby \nand protecting her health to be able to offer her love and care for a \nnew child, as I saw in my years.\n  I don't want to stand here and think that somebody is going to make a \ndecision in this room that affects what my granddaughters or my \ndaughters have to think about. If they want to restrict themselves, let \nthem do it. But how can we stand here and permit this to take place \nwhen we are trying to make people healthier and better informed? This \namendment wants to take away that right.\n  Right now, the majority of private health insurance plans do offer \nabortion coverage. This amendment would force private health insurance \ncompanies to abandon those policies, eliminate services, and limit a \nwoman's options. The amendment does not, contrary to statements being \nmade here on the floor, simply preserve the Hyde language that has been \nin place for more than three decades. Make no mistake, this amendment \ngoes well beyond the concept of limiting Federal funds from paying for \nabortion. This amendment would make it impossible for a woman who pays \nfor her premiums out of her own pocket to purchase a private health \nplan that offers her the right to choose what is best for her, for her \nhealth, and her family's well-being.\n  We have been working hard for a long time to eliminate discrimination \nagainst women in our current health care system. Right now, our health \ncare bill takes a balanced approach to abortion coverage. It preserves \nexisting Federal law. Women have fought since this Nation's founding to \nhave full rights under the law, including suffrage, including many \nother things. Unfortunately, this amendment would force them to take a \nstep backward. I don't want to see it happen.\n  I urge my colleagues, please, use your judgment, make your own \nchoices about your own family. Make your decisions as to what you would \nrecommend to a daughter or a wife. But for God's sake, let the woman \nchoose what is best for her.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Nelson-\nHatch amendment. Let me start by saying that I support a woman's right \nof choice as a constitutionally affirmed right. I understand how \ndifficult and divisive this issue is. That is why the underlying bill \nwe have before us carries out the compromise that has already been \nreached between pro-choice and pro-life supporters. It represents \nmaintaining the prohibition on Federal funds for abortion but allows a \nwoman to pay for abortion coverage through use of her own funds. That \nis current law, and that is what the underlying bill makes sure we \ncontinue.\n  Many of us believe the health care debate is critically important. It \nis also controversial. Let's not bring the abortion issue into the \nbill. The Nelson-Hatch amendment would go beyond that. It would \nrestrict a woman's ability to use her own funds for coverage to pay for \nabortions. It blocks a woman from using her personal funds to purchase \ninsurance plans with abortion coverage. If enacted, for the first time \nin Federal law, this amendment would restrict what individual private \ndollars can pay for in the private insurance marketplace.\n  When you look at those who are supporting this amendment, you can't \nhelp but have some concern that this amendment is being offered as a \nway to derail and defeat the health care reform bill. Most of the \npeople who are going to be supporting the amendment will vote in \nopposition to the bill. It is quite clear that the Senate health reform \nbill already includes language banning Federal funds for abortion \nservices. So supporters of this bill are not satisfied with the current \nfunding ban; they are trying to use this to move the equation further \nin an effort to defeat the bill. This is really wrong as it relates to \nwomen in America.\n\n  I am outraged at the suggestion that women who want an abortion \nshould be able to purchase a separate rider to cover them. Why would we \nexpect this overwhelmingly male Senate to expect women to shop for a \nsupplemental plan\n\n[[Page S12667]]\n\nin anticipation of an unintended pregnancy or a pregnancy with health \ncomplications? Who plans for that? The whole point of health insurance \nis to protect against unexpected incidents.\n  Currently, there are five States--Idaho, Kentucky, Oklahoma, \nMissouri, and North Dakota--that only allow abortion coverage through \nriders. Guess what. The individual market does not accept this type of \npolicy. It doesn't exist.\n  Abortion riders severely undermine patient privacy, as a woman would \nbe placed in a position of having to tell her employer or insurer and, \nin many cases, their husband's employer that they anticipate \nterminating a pregnancy.\n  Also, requiring women to spend additional money to have comprehensive \nhealth care coverage is discriminatory. We don't do that for services \nthat affect men's reproductive rights.\n  I hear frequently from my friends on the other side of the aisle that \nthe statements we make; that is, those who support the underlying \nbill--that this allows individuals who currently have insurance to be \nable to maintain their insurance builds on what is good in our health \ncare system. This amendment takes away rights people already have. So \nif you have insurance today as an individual that covers abortion \nservices, if this amendment were adopted, you will not be able to get \nthat. So we are denying people the ability to maintain their own \ncurrent insurance, if this amendment were adopted.\n  It is the wrong amendment. The policy is wrong. But clearly, on this \nbill it is wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept the compromise reached on this bill. \nMany of us who would like to see us be more progressive in dealing with \nthis issue and remove some of the discriminatory provisions in existing \nlaw understand we will have to wait for another day to do that. Let's \nnot confuse the issue of health care reform. Let's defeat this \namendment that would be discriminatory against women. That is wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Nelson-Hatch amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senators Murray, Lautenberg, and \nCardin for participating in our half hour of debate. Our block of time \nhas almost expired. I would like to close the half hour by saying one \nword that I think is a beautiful word, and that word is ``fairness.'' \n``Fairness'' is a beautiful word. It should always be the centerpiece \nof our work here. We should never single out one group of people as \ntargets. We should treat people the same.\n  It has been very clearly stated that the Nelson-Hatch amendment, like \nthe Stupak amendment in the House, singles out an area of reproductive \nhealth care that only impacts one group, and that is women. It says to \nwomen that they can't use their own private funds to buy coverage for \nthe full range of reproductive health procedures. It doesn't say that \nto a man. It doesn't say to men: You can't use your own funds to cover \nthe cost of a pharmaceutical product that you may want for your \nreproductive health. It doesn't say that they can't use their own \nprivate funds for a surgical procedure they may choose that is in the \narsenal that they may choose for their own reproductive rights.\n  So we say to the men of this country: Look, we are not going to \nsingle out any procedure or any pharmaceutical product you may want to \nuse for your reproductive health care. We are saying, if a private \ninsurer offers it, you have the right to buy it. We are singling out \nwomen.\n  Again, let me say this as clearly as I can. We have had a firewall \nbetween the use of Federal funds and private funds. Senator Reid has \nkept that firewall in place in the underlying bill. He keeps the status \nquo of the Hyde amendment. The group here who is coming on the floor \ncontinually--mostly men; I think so far all men; there may be some \nwomen who have spoken on their behalf, but I have not heard it--are \nbasically saying: Forget the firewall. Forget it. Women, you cannot use \nyour private funds, and government will tell you what you can or cannot \ndo. I will tell you something. That is not what Uncle Sam should do. \nUncle Sam should respect women, should respect men. I hope we defeat \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, America's seniors have made clear they value \nthe Medicare Advantage Program. They like their access to private \nplans, plan choices, lower cost sharing, and all the extra benefits not \nincluded in traditional Medicare, such as vision, dental, hearing, and \nthe wellness programs that help them stay fit.\n  Before the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, seniors had been \ndecrying their lack of choices. We made sure, under the Medicare \nModernization Act, that seniors would be assured health care choices, \njust as all of us here in the Congress enjoy.\n  Now that they have access to private coverage and enjoy more benefits \nand choices, seniors want us to make sure Medicare Advantage stays \nviable, and they are not happy about the proposed cuts in the majority \nleader's bill.\n  I have received more than 500 phone calls since November 1 from \nconstituents who oppose the $120 billion Medicare Advantage cuts \nproposed by the majority's bill. They know you cannot cut $120 billion \nfrom a program without cutting its benefits. A lot of seniors in \nArizona are asking, What happened to the President's repeated promise \nthat if you like your insurance, you get to keep what you have? They do \nnot like the idea that under this bill their benefits would be slashed \nby 64 percent, from $135 of value per month to $49 of value per month, \nwhich is exactly what the Congressional Budget Office projects would \nhappen. They do not want the money they paid into Medicare going to \nfund a new government entitlement program for nonseniors. They are not \nsatisfied with the majority's promise to protect ``guaranteed'' \nbenefits. They want Members of Congress to be straight about our \nintentions and not engage in semantics. They want an unequivocal \npromise they will be able to keep exactly what they have now, just as \nthe President promised.\n  Here is the problem. There is an earmark buried on page 894 of the \nlegislation before us that suggests that senior citizens in Florida \nmust have insisted on this exact kind of protection for their Medicare \nAdvantage as well.\n  This provision, in section 3201(g), was specifically drafted at the \nrequest of the senior Senator from Florida to protect the benefits for \nat least 363,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in Florida but very \nfew anywhere else. Nothing in the bill grants the same protection that \nis granted to these senior citizens to those in my State or in the \nother States in which there are a lot of seniors who have the Medicare \nAdvantage Program.\n  That is why I support the motion of my colleague, Senator McCain, to \ncommit this bill to the committee and return it without these--\nactually, what his bill does is to ensure that all seniors, whatever \nState they are in, enjoy the same grandfathering status as the senior \ncitizens in Florida would have under the Nelson proposal.\n  The McCain motion to commit is straightforward. First of all, it \nwould help the President keep his commitment that seniors get to keep \ntheir insurance if they like it. And it applies to all of America's \nseniors the same protection granted to Floridians, as I said. Isn't \nthat what all seniors deserve, the security of knowing their current \nbenefits are safe? If our Democratic colleagues are not willing to \nextend this protection to every Medicare Advantage beneficiary, then I \ncannot imagine how they can claim to be in favor of protecting \nMedicare.\n  I have been sharing letters that I have received from Arizona \nconstituents describing what the Medicare Advantage Program means to \nthem. I thought today I would share some excerpts from a few more of \nthese letters.\n  A constituent in Surprise, AZ--I hope the Presiding Officer likes the \nname of that town: Surprise, AZ--just west of Phoenix, says:\n\n       I truly hope you will consider keeping the Medicare \n     Advantage plans for seniors. I find the savings a must on my \n     fixed income.\n\n[[Page S12668]]\n\n       I appreciate the [high quality] doctor care on my MediSun \n     Advantage plan. Prescriptions are included in the cost of my \n     plan, providing further savings for me. Medicare Advantage \n     has made a real difference in my life. Please don't let \n     anything happen to this important program.\n\n  A constituent from Fountain Hills, AZ, writes:\n\n       I suffer from a specific type of amyotrophic lateral \n     sclerosis, and rely on Medicare Advantage for all of my \n     medical needs. I am asking that you do all that is in your \n     power to protect and provide for the continued funding of \n     this program. In Arizona, we have over 329,000 people who \n     count on Medicare Advantage. Our lives would be devastated \n     without it.\n\n  A constituent from Wickenburg, AZ, says:\n\n       Please don't let anything happen to my Medicare Advantage. \n     I like my Medicare Advantage plan because I can choose my own \n     doctor in my own town and also choose a specialist if I need \n     one.\n       I can also get regular check-ups and don't have trouble \n     getting to see the doctor. So, I ask that you don't let the \n     government cut my Medicare Advantage.\n\n  A constituent from Mesa, AZ, says:\n\n       I am a senior citizen. I am becoming more and more \n     concerned about President Obama's healthcare plans, and I am \n     writing to tell you that I am happy with my Medicare \n     Advantage plan. I request that you do all you can not to cut \n     my benefits.\n       I have a fairly wide choice of doctors and specialists, who \n     have always treated me with respect, given me the time I feel \n     I need, and have given me excellent care.\n       I have a fitness benefit, which entitles me to the Silver \n     Sneakers program at our local YMCA; two choices of a dental \n     plan; a vision plan; plus many other options to maintain my \n     level of health or to try to improve it.\n       Please, I beg you, do whatever you can to maintain our \n     Medicare Advantage plan. Do NOT cut any of our benefits.\n\n  We know there are millions of seniors out there who absolutely depend \non Medicare Advantage. Many have stories to tell about how this program \nhas improved the quality of their life and their health. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the McCain motion to commit to ensure that all of \nAmerica's seniors, not just those in certain preferred counties, \nprimarily located in the State of Florida, are grandfathered in these \nbenefits.\n  Again, to make it very clear, Medicare Advantage benefits are cut by \nthe $120 billion reduction in Medicare under the bill. The Senator from \nFlorida found a way to grandfather the Medicare Advantage benefits for \nmany of his constituents. What the McCain motion to commit does is to \napply that same grandfathering to all seniors in all States so that \nnone of the seniors who have Medicare Advantage today would lose any of \nthe benefits they enjoy today.\n  It seems to me what is good for our senior citizens in Florida ought \nto be good for our senior citizens in Arizona or any other State in \nwhich they reside. I urge my colleagues to consider and to support the \nMcCain motion to commit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. Voinovich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I want to spend a minute discussing the \nvery emotional and divisive issue of abortion. I personally believe \nthat all children, born or unborn, are a precious gift from God, and we \nhave a moral responsibility to protect them. It grieves me to think \nthat there have been more than 40 million abortions performed in this \ncountry since 1973.\n  I am pleased to support the Nelson amendment that would apply the \nlong-standing Hyde amendment, which currently prohibits Federal funding \nto pay for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or to \nsave the life of the mother, to the health care reform bill.\n  The issue of abortion is one that results in very strong emotions on \nboth sides of this issue. Because of the concerns that millions of \nAmericans have with using Federal taxpayer dollars for abortion, \nCongress enacted the Hyde amendment. As my colleagues know, the Hyde \namendment has restricted Federal Medicaid dollars from paying for \nabortion services since 1977, and has been applied to all other \nfederally funded health care programs, including the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program.\n  Think about that, this language has been in place since the Ford \nadministration, and has survived through the administrations of \nPresidents Carter, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. \nBush. That is 33 years, and all of a sudden, my colleagues want to \nchange our policy on Federal funding of abortion.\n  We shouldn't be making this type of sweeping policy change in the \nhealth care legislation, and the Nelson amendment is a necessary \naddition to the bill in order to protect our current policy and the \nunborn.\n  I understand that not everyone in this country agrees with my \nposition on abortion, but I am deeply concerned about the possible \nimplications of spending taxpayer dollars on abortions when the issue \nso deeply divides Americans on ethical grounds.\n  While as I have said, I don't agree with abortion and believe Roe v. \nWade should be overturned, the Nelson amendment does not prohibit \nanyone from seeking an abortion, it does not overturn Roe v. Wade, and \nit does not place any new restrictions on access to abortions.\n  It simply ensures that the taxpayer dollars will not pay for services \nthat cause such deep moral divisions in our Nation. I think it is \nnotable that this amendment is one of the few bipartisan amendments \nthat the Senate will consider as part of this debate.\n  I am pleased that a similar amendment in the House of Representatives \npassed with a convincing margin, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Nelson-Hatch amendment before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho, Mr. Crapo.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Medicare \nAdvantage Program again. It is one that is facing nearly $120 billion \nin cuts under the Democratic health care bill.\n  Currently, there are nearly 11 million seniors enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage, which is about one out of every four seniors in the United \nStates. In my home State of Idaho, that is about 60,000 people or 27 \npercent of all Medicare beneficiaries in the State.\n  Medicare Advantage is an extremely popular program. In fact, it is \nprobably the most popular and fastest growing part of Medicare. A 2007 \nstudy reported high overall satisfaction with the Medicare Advantage \nProgram. Eighty-four percent of the respondents said they were happy \nwith their coverage, and 75 percent would recommend Medicare Advantage \nto their friends or family members.\n  But despite the popularity of the program, the massive cuts in the \nReid bill will result in most seniors losing benefits or coverage or \nboth under Medicare Advantage.\n  I have a chart in the Chamber which I have shown before. You cannot \nsee the individual States too well on it from this distance at this \nsize, but you can see the coloring on the United States in this chart.\n  If you live in a State that is red, deep red, or the pinkish color--\nwhich is almost every State in the Union--then you are going to see \nyour benefits cut under Medicare Advantage under this bill.\n  Why am I bringing it up again? We have already had a vote on it. In \nfact, we have had two votes on it. The majority has insisted on keeping \nthese cuts in the bill. The reason I am bringing it up again is \nbecause, as we have combed through this 2,074-page bill, we have found \nout there is a provision in the Reid bill that would protect Medicare \nAdvantage benefits for some people in the United States, for just a few \nin this country.\n  During the Finance Committee markup, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida \nadvocated on behalf of Medicare Advantage and the beneficiaries in his \nhome State of Florida. Subsequently, during closed-door negotiations, \nthe legislative language was added to protect those beneficiaries.\n  This is interesting because one of the responses to us, as we have \ntried to stop the imposition of these cuts to Medicare, has been this \nbill will not cut any Medicare benefits. Well, if not, then why does \nFlorida need a special exemption for its citizens? If not, why not \nsupport the McCain amendment that would give the same protection to all \nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries that the bill gives to primarily just \na few in Florida?\n\n[[Page S12669]]\n\n  Specifically, section 3201(g) of the Reid bill, very deep in the bill \non page 894, has a $5 billion provision drafted to prevent the drastic \ncuts in the Medicare Advantage Program from impacting those enrollees \nwho reside primarily in three counties in Florida: Broward, Miami-Dade, \nand Palm Beach. It seems unfair that taxpayers would foot a $5 billion \nprovision that provides protection for only some of the Medicare \nAdvantage beneficiaries. It certainly proves there are cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage benefits in this bill; again, benefits that one out of four \nbeneficiaries in America receives--one of the fastest, if not the \nfastest, growing parts of Medicare. Instead of preferential treatment \nfor some, why not extend these same protections for Medicare Advantage \nto all beneficiaries under Medicare? I know the 60,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries on Medicare Advantage in Idaho, my home State, want and \ndeserve that same level of protection.\n  That is why I am here to support the McCain motion to commit, and \nthat is what his motion to commit would accomplish, very plain and very \nsimple.\n  The McCain motion would extend this grandfathering provision to all \nbeneficiaries in the Medicare Advantage Program so all seniors in this \npopular and successful program could maintain that same level of \nbenefits that today they enjoy under the current law. Every senior in \nthe Medicare Advantage Program deserves to keep these critical extra \nbenefits, which include things such as dental protection, vision \ncoverage, preventive and wellness services, flu shots, and much more.\n  In fact, most people who are not on Medicare Advantage in the \nMedicare Program have to buy supplemental insurance to get access to \nthis coverage. Those in Medicare Advantage, which is one of the reasons \nit is such a popular program, have the opportunity to get it through \ntheir Medicaid services. Why is Medicare Advantage so opposed? Well, \nsome say it is because of the extra costs, except that the extra costs \nin Medicare Advantage are returned to the government or shared with the \nbeneficiaries. I think the reason might be because Medicare Advantage \nis one part of the Medicare Program that we have successfully been able \nto turn over to the private markets for operation. Interestingly, when \nthe private sector gets involved in administering this part of the \nMedicare Program, the Medicare beneficiaries get more benefits, and it \nbecomes the most popular program in Medicare.\n  I know my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, has filed an \namendment to protect the 864,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in \nhis home State, and I would expect strong bipartisan support for the \nMcCain motion to commit, since I think every Senator representing their \nconstituents in their State wants to see this kind of protection. At \nthe end, the McCain motion to commit is simply an amendment that will \nprotect nearly 11 million seniors today enrolled in the Medicare \nAdvantage Program and help to keep the President's promise when he said \nif you like what you have, you can keep it. If this bill is not amended \nin the way it is being proposed to be amended by Senator McCain's \namendment, 11 million Americans are not going to be able to keep what \nthey have in the Medicare Program, and that is just a start on the \nimpact of what people in America are going to see under this \nlegislation in terms of a reduction of their benefits and the quality \nof services they have access to.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield myself the balance of the time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2962 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Nelson amendment. We \nhave been talking about the McCain amendment, which provides fairness \nfor seniors who have Medicare Advantage so everybody across the country \ncan have the same thing Florida is getting. But the critical amendment \nI wish to talk about is the Nelson amendment.\n  This amendment needs to be adopted if we truly want to prevent \nFederal dollars from being used to pay for abortions. I am asking my \ncolleagues to support a Democratic amendment. This isn't a partisan \nissue; it is a human issue. Even if you are on the other side, I hope \nyou can agree it is not right to force people to pay for a procedure \nthey may find offensive to the core of their morality. This issue is \nvery personal for many of us. It is for me.\n  When my wife Diana gave birth to our first child, Amy was 3 months \npremature. She weighed just 2 pounds and the doctor's advice was: Wait \nuntil morning and see if she lives. The doctors couldn't do anything to \nhelp this newborn baby. She survived the night.\n  The next day I took Amy to a hospital in Casper. An ambulance wasn't \navailable so we went in a Thunderbird. It was in a huge blizzard, the \nsame blizzard that prevented us to fly Amy to a hospital in Denver that \nspecialized in that. But we took this car and went to the center of the \nState to the biggest hospital to get the best care we could find. We \nran out of oxygen on the way because the snow slowed us. The highway \npatrol was looking for us, and they were looking for an ambulance. All \nalong the way, we were watching every breath of that child.\n  We arrived at the hospital in Casper and put her in the care of \ndoctors. There were several times when Diana and I went to the hospital \nand found her isolette with a shroud around it. We would knock on the \nwindow and the nurses would come and say: It is not looking good. We \nhad to help her to breathe again or: Have you had your baby baptized? \nWe did have Amy baptized a few minutes after birth, as she worked and \nstruggled to live. Watching an infant fight with every fiber of her \nbeing, unquestionably showing the desire to live, even though they are \nonly 6 months developed, is something that will show you the value of \nlife. Amy survived and is now a teacher so gifted she teaches other \nteachers.\n  Amy's birth changed my whole outlook on life. It reminded me of the \nmiracle of life and the respect we owe that miracle. The Reid bill, as \nit is currently, does not respect life. But the amendment before us \nwill allow that respect to be given to every American who benefits from \nthat bill.\n  On September 9, President Obama told a joint session of Congress: \n``No Federal dollars will be used to fund abortions.'' I agree. No \nFederal dollars should ever be used to pay for abortions. To do \notherwise would compel millions of taxpayers to pay for abortion \nprocedures they oppose on moral or ethical grounds. Unfortunately, the \nReid bill fails to meet that standard set by the President. Section \n1303 of the bill provides the Secretary the authority to mandate and \nfund abortions.\n  Some have questioned exactly how this bill funds abortions. It is \nquite simple. The bill funds abortions through the government-run \ninsurance option and through subsidies to individuals to help pay for \nthe cost of private insurance. Both of these options are funded with \nFederal dollars. Under the community health insurance option, also \nknown as the government-run plan, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices could allow the plan to cover abortions. In addition, the new \ntax subsidies in the bill could also go to private plans that cover \nabortions. In both these cases, Federal subsidies would be paid to \nplans that cover abortion.\n\n  The Reid bill attempts to use budget gimmicks so its sponsors can \nargue that Federal funds will not pay for abortions. As the accountant \nin the Senate, I am not fooled by these gimmicks and neither should \nanyone else be. If the Reid bill is passed, Federal dollars will be \nused to pay for abortions.\n  Money is fungible. That is an interesting word. It means Federal \ndollars paid into a health plan could be shifted across accounts. We \ndon't have a good accounting system for that. It can replace other \nspending and those dollars could then go to pay for abortions. There is \nno way to absolutely prevent Federal dollars from paying for abortions \nonce they are paid to plans that cover abortions.\n  That is why Federal laws for the last 30 years have explicitly \nprohibited Federal funding going to such plans. That is right. It is \nalready Federal law, although it comes in, in the appropriations bill, \non an annual basis. Federal law currently prohibits funds going to pay \nfor abortions under the Medicaid Program, under FEHBP--that is the \nprogram where we get our health insurance; it is the one that provides \nall the\n\n[[Page S12670]]\n\nhealth insurance for all Federal employees, the same choices of plans--\nand the TRICARE Program, which is for all our Active military and their \nfamilies.\n  Current law recognizes the only way to actually prevent Federal funds \nfrom being used to pay for abortion is to offer the coverage of \nabortion in separate insurance plans and collect separate premiums to \npay for that plan. This is what States who want to cover abortion for \ntheir Medicaid populations already do. As I said earlier, Medicaid is \nprohibited from using Federal dollars to pay for abortions. As a \nresult, States set up separate plans and collect non-Federal dollars in \nseparate accounts to pay for those services.\n  If anyone has any doubts about the impact of the Reid bill, I would \npoint them to the comments made by the senior staff at the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops. The associate director, Richard \nDoerflinger, recently described the Reid bill as ``completely \nunacceptable'' and said it was the worst health reform bill they had \nseen so far on life issues.\n  It is probably worth it to note that the bishops have been longtime \nsupporters of health care reform and covering the uninsured. Similarly, \nNational Right to Life said the Reid bill ``seeks to cover elective \nabortions in two big new Federal health programs, but tries to conceal \nthat unpopular reality with layers of contrived definitions and hollow \nbookkeeping requirements.''\n  There has also been some misinformation out there regarding this \namendment, and I wish to take a minute to clear up a couple arguments \nused against the Nelson amendment. First, it does not prohibit \nindividuals from purchasing abortion coverage with their own private \ndollars. When similar arguments were made during the House debate on \nthe Stupak language, PolitiFact, a Pulitzer Prize-winning, fact-\nchecking organization, concluded that such statements were false. The \nNelson amendment only prohibits Federal funds from subsidizing those \nplans.\n  Some have argued the Nelson amendment could cause individuals to lose \nthe abortion coverage they currently receive from their current health \ninsurance plans. That also isn't accurate. I would urge everyone to \nread section 1251 of the bill. Section 1251 says, clearly and \nunequivocally, that:\n\n       Nothing in this act or an amendment made to this act shall \n     be construed to require that an individual terminate coverage \n     under a group health plan or health insurance coverage in \n     which such individual was enrolled at the date of the \n     enactment of this act.\n\n  According to the sponsors of this bill, this section protects the \nability of persons with existing insurance coverage to keep that same \ncoverage. If section 1251 works as its authors describe it, this bill \nshould make no changes to existing insurance plans that cover abortion \nand should allow individuals to keep the plans they have.\n  Some have also said this amendment would ban abortion procedures. \nThat, too, is false. The amendment does not ban abortions; it simply \nprohibits Federal dollars from paying for abortions, which is \nconsistent with the current law.\n  Many of my Democratic colleagues have argued during the debate that \nthe health care we provide under this bill should be as good as the \ncoverage given to Senators. If they believe that, they should all \nsupport applying the same rules regarding abortion coverage that apply \nto our own health plans. Federal employees' plans are prohibited from \ncovering abortion--all Federal employees, not just Senators.\n  I will work hard to see that taxpayers are not compelled to fund \nabortion services. I believe those of us in elected office have a duty \nto work to safeguard the sanctity of human life, since the right to \nlife was specifically named in the Declaration of Independence. By \nsafeguarding our right to life, our government fulfills the most \nfundamental duty to the American people. When that right is violated, \nwe violate our sacred trust with our Nation's citizens and the legacy \nwe leave to future generations.\n  Regardless of what some people think, God doesn't make junk. He makes \npeople in a variety of sizes, shapes, and abilities, and disabilities. \nThere is a purpose even if we cannot understand it. I like the sign \njust outside Gillette. It says: ``If it's not a baby, you're not \npregnant.''\n  I don't believe Federal funding should be used to pay for abortions, \nand I will work to ensure that it doesn't happen under this bill. I \nwill vote in support of the Nelson amendment and encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same to protect life and respect the miracle of \nlife that I witnessed with the birth of my daughter Amy.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the following \norder: Boxer, 1 minute; Durbin, 5 minutes; Stabenow, 5 minutes; \nShaheen, 5 minutes; Dodd, 5 minutes; Menendez, 5 minutes; and Baucus, 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I gave birth to two beautiful children, \nand I am proud to say that I have now four grandchildren--the light of \nmy life. I am just here to say as a mother, as a grandmother, and as a \nSenator from California that I trust the women of this country. I don't \nwant to tell the women of this country--or tell anybody else anything \nlike this--that they can't buy insurance with their own private money \nto cover their whole range of legal reproductive health care. We don't \ndo that to the men. We don't say they can't get any surgery if they \nmight need it for their reproductive health care. We don't tell them \nthey can't get certain drugs, under a pharmaceutical benefit, they may \nneed for their reproductive health care. Imagine if the men in this \nChamber had to fill out a form and get a rider for Viagra or Cialis and \nit was public. Forget about it. There would be a rage in this Chamber.\n  We are just saying treat women fairly. Treat women the same way you \ntreat men. Let them have access to the full range of legal reproductive \nhealth care. That is all we are saying. Vote no on this amendment, the \nNelson-Hatch amendment, because Harry Reid takes care of the firewall \nbetween private funds and Federal funds. We keep that firewall.\n  Is it OK if Senator Durbin goes after Senator Stabenow?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her passionate advocacy and standing up for all of us, \nthe women of this country. She is a mom, as she said. I, too, am a mom. \nAs hard as it is for me to believe, I am also a grandmother with \nwonderful 2-year-old Lily and a little grandson Walter, who was born on \nhis daddy's--my son's--birthday in August. Obviously, they are the \nlight of my life, as well.\n  One of the reasons I feel so passionate about the broader bill on \nhealth care reform is that this is about extending coverage to babies \nso they can be born healthy, and about prenatal care; it is about \nmaking sure that in the new insurance exchange we have basic coverage \nfor maternity care. I was shocked to learn that 60 percent of the \ninsurance policies offered right now in the individual market don't \noffer maternity care as basic care. We happen to think that is \nincredibly important. We are 29th in the world in the number of \nbabies--below Third World countries--that survive the first year of \nlife. This health care reform bill is about making sure we have healthy \nbabies, healthy moms, and it is about saving lives and moving forward \nin a way that is positive, expanding coverage, not taking away \nimportant coverage for women who, frankly, find themselves in a crisis \nsituation.\n  That is what we are doing, unfortunately, through the Nelson-Hatch \namendment. I have great respect for both of my colleagues who have \noffered this amendment, and for others who feel deeply about this \nissue. In the bill that has come before us, I think we respect all \nsides and keep in place the longstanding ban on Federal funding for \nabortion services, and no one is objecting to that. No one is trying to \nchange that.\n  As my friends have said, this is about whether we cross that line \ninto private insurance coverage--whether we say to a woman, to a \nfamily: You are going to have to decide whether, when you have a child \nand you are having a crisis in the third trimester and might need\n\n[[Page S12671]]\n\nsome kind of crisis abortion services--whether you are going to find \nyourself in a situation where you are going to need abortion services, \nand you are going to have to publicly indicate that and buy a rider on \ninsurance because you can't use your own money to buy an insurance \npolicy.\n  Here is what we know now. We know five States have riders right now--\nIdaho, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Missouri, and North Dakota. There is no \nevidence there are any riders available in the individual market. So \neven though, technically, they say you can buy additional coverage, it \nis not offered or available. We are told by the insurance carriers \nthat, in fact, it probably will not be available.\n  We all know what this is about. This is about effectively banning \nabortion services coverage in the new insurance exchange we are setting \nup, which could, in fact, have a broader implication of eliminating the \ncoverage for health plans outside the exchanges. So that is what this \nis about, which is why it is so important.\n  Again, we are agreeing on the elimination or banning of Federal \nfunding for abortions, other than extreme crises circumstances. We have \ndone that in Federal law. This is about whether we go on to essentially \ncreate a situation where effectively people cannot get that coverage \nwith their own money.\n  The Center for American Progress noted that because approximately 86 \npercent of the people who are going to be offered new opportunities for \ninsurance--small businesses, individuals, in the private market--that \nbecause 86 percent of them will, in fact, receive some kind of tax \ncredit or tax cut, in fact, again, we are talking about eliminating \nthis option altogether because the majority of people will get some \nkind of a tax cut during this process.\n  I think there are also some broader implications around the tax \npolicy. If we are saying that someone can't purchase an insurance \npolicy of their liking if they are getting a tax credit to help with \nhealth insurance, the fact is, what about other tax credits? What about \nother kinds of ways in which people get tax credits or tax cuts today? \nThe implications of this are extremely broad.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote. Let's keep Federal policy in place that doesn't \nallow Federal funding for abortion but respects the women of this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hatch-Nelson \namendment. For 27 years, it has been my honor to serve in both the \nHouse and Senate. During that 27 years, the issue of abortion has been \nfront and center as one of the most controversial and contentious \nissues we have faced. When I returned home to my congressional \ndistrict, and now to the State, there have been many strong, heartfelt \npositions on this issue that are in conflict. Members of the Senate and \nHouse meet with people who have varying degrees of intensity on this \nissue all the time. We are not going to resolve this issue today with \nthis amendment or this bill. We are going to do several things that I \nthink are important.\n  What we set out to do in health care reform was honor the time-\nhonored principles that we have now accepted. They are these: Abortion \nis a legal procedure since the Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade. For \nover 30 years now, we have said no public funds can be used for an \nabortion but to save the life of a mother or in cases of rape or \nincest. We have said that no doctor or hospital will be compelled to \nperform an abortion procedure if it violates their conscience. Those \nare the three basic pillars of our abortion policy in this country.\n  Now comes this debate about health care reform and a question about \nwhether, if we offer health insurance policies through an exchange that \noffers abortion services, and the people are paying for the premiums \nfor those policies with a tax credit, whether we are indirectly somehow \nor another financing and supporting abortion. I argue that we are not. \nWe find, on a daily basis, many instances where Federal funds go to a \nprivate entity, even a religious entity with clear guidelines that none \nof the Federal funds can be spent for religious or private purposes.\n\n  Organizations far and wide across America live within those bounds. \nThey keep their books clean, and they account for the money received, \nand no questions are asked. The audits show that they followed the \nguidelines. This bill before us strictly follows these guidelines, as \nwell. No Federal funds shall be used for any abortion procedure in an \ninsurance policy. It has to be privately funded.\n  I want to step back and make a slightly different argument too. There \nare those who have said in the House and in the Senate that unless the \nStupak language in the House is adopted, they would seriously consider \nvoting against health care reform. I argue to them that is a wrong \nposition to take if they are opposed to abortion because the health \ncare reform bill before us dramatically expands health care coverage.\n  Today, there are 17 million women of reproductive age in America who \nare uninsured. This bill will expand health insurance coverage to the \nvast majority of them, which means millions more women will have access \nto affordable birth control and other contraceptive services. This \nexpanded access will reduce unintended pregnancies and reduce \nabortions. So the family planning aspect of our health care reform will \nactually net fewer abortions in America--we know this because of the \nhistory of the issue--as more women have access to family planning. So \nthose who argue that they either have this amendment or they will vote \nagainst health care reform should reflect on the fact that there will \nbe fewer abortions in America with these health care services.\n  Senator Mikulski, in the first amendment we adopted, provided for \nmore preventive services for women across the board. Those services, I \nbelieve, would result in more counseling, more contraception, and fewer \nunintended pregnancies. That is a reality. Every Federal dollar that we \nspend on family planning saves $3 in Medicaid costs. In 1972, we \nestablished a special matching rate of 90 percent for family planning \nservices in Medicaid. Across the board, we know this money, well spent \nto allow women to decide their own reproductive fate, means there are \nfewer unintended pregnancies.\n  I argue that whether your position is for or against abortion, if you \nbelieve there should be fewer abortions, you want this health care \nreform bill to pass--with or without the Stupak amendment. I think that \nthe Stupak amendment goes too far, and I think we have come up with a \nreasonable alternative that adheres to the three pillars I mentioned \nearlier on abortion policy in America, and it sets up reasonable \naccounting on these insurance policies. I think this language in the \nbill is the right way to move to lessen the number of abortions in \nAmerica and stay consistent with the basic principles that guide us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Illinois, the \nDemocratic whip of the Senate, for his arguments. He speaks for me when \nhe identifies the pillars of our views on this issue.\n  I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1974, 2 years after \nRoe v. Wade, and I have been in Congress now for 35 years. We have \nlived with those guidelines since then. I know it has not resolved the \nmatter for many people. But it has served us well.\n  What we have in this bill is a reflection of a continuation of those \npillars. Having been the acting chair of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee during the markup of the bill--in fact, Senator \nKennedy voted by proxy, as they call it in that process--we insisted \nupon the adoption of a Kennedy amendment that maintained the notion of \nconscience in these matters. So we would not be forcing individuals to \nengage in abortion practices if they felt otherwise.\n  We have long held the view in this Congress, under Democratic and \nRepublican leadership, despite the differences--others have different \nviews on this matter--that clearly public money should not be used. \nDespite the arguments to the contrary, we have done that again with \nthis bill.\n  The Senator from Illinois made a point about the measures in the bill \nthat deal with wellness and reproductive rights. We minimize the \nlikelihood of there being a demand for abortion on the part of many.\n\n[[Page S12672]]\n\n  I appreciate the fact that our leadership has made this matter, the \nNelson-Hatch amendment, a matter of conscience. There is no caucus \nposition on this amendment. There never has been and nor should there \nbe, in my view, given the nature of this debate.\n  I want to mention another argument we fail to understand here, in \naddition to the eloquent ones made by the Senator from Illinois. We \nrank 29th in infant mortality in the United States. It is an incredible \nstatistic when you consider the wealth of our Nation. I worked on \nlegislation with our colleague, Lamar Alexander, on infant births, \nprescreening, trying to provide resources and help for families with \ninfants who suffer these debilitative and fatal problems.\n  This legislation takes a major step forward in taking the United \nStates out of the basement when it comes to infant mortality and gets \nus back to where we ought to be in reducing the tragedy that occurs in \ninfant mortality.\n  There is a distinction, clearly, between abortion and infant \nmortality. But this legislation takes a major step in improving quality \nof life, assisting children who arrive prematurely, as many do in our \ncountry today, and many do not survive that prematurity. Today many \nwomen are not getting the kind of support they need during their \npregnancy, thus increasing the likelihood of premature births \noccurring, or not getting the screenings that need to occur immediately \nso you can avoid the terrible problems that can ensue thereafter. This \nlegislation takes a major step in that direction.\n  While we have done what is necessary for us to do, that is, protect \nthe longstanding distinction between public and private dollars when it \ncomes to abortion, we also have gone so much further. This bill \nprovides support for families when it comes to minimizing the \nlikelihood a child will be lost because they are not getting support \nservices, as well as providing the reproductive services that will \nassist women during their pregnancies.\n  My colleagues know I am a late bloomer. I am a parent of a 4-year-old \nand an 8-year-old. My colleagues talk about being grandparents. I \nalways said I was the only candidate in the country who used to get \nmail from AARP and diaper services at the same time, having qualified \nfor Medicare and also being a parent of infant children, two little \ngirls, Grace and Christina. I want them to grow up having all the \nrights of young women in this country. I am hopeful that one day I may \neven be around to be a grandparent. We fought very hard to make sure \nthose children were going to get the protections they could during my \nwife's pregnancies, to see to it they would be born healthy and sound. \nI have a great health care plan, as a Federal employee, to make sure \nthat will happen. I want every American to have that same sense of \nsecurity when that blessing occurs with the arrival of a child or \ngrandchild. This bill does that.\n  For all of those reasons, this amendment ought to be defeated. This \nbill ought to be supported and achieve a great success for our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe Nelson-Hatch amendment.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act we have before us does \nso many good things. It gives women access to preventive care. It makes \nhealth care more accessible to families across the country. It changes \nthe way patients receive the care they need. We must not let the issue \nof reproductive choice overshadow all of the things this bill gets \nright.\n  For over three decades, the Hyde amendment, which prohibits the use \nof Federal funds to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, \nor if the life of the mother is at risk, has been the law of this land. \nAbortion should play no role in this health care debate. The Finance \nand HELP Committees spent countless hours drafting legislation that is \npart of the language in our health care bill to make sure it remains \nneutral on the issue of choice.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that is currently \nbefore us maintains the Hyde amendment prohibiting Federal funding of \nabortions. As a result, neither the pro-choice nor the pro-life agendas \nare advanced.\n  This is clearly explained in an analysis done by the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record this analysis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                November 30, 2009.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Hon. Jeanne Shaheen.\n     From: Jon O. Shimabukuro, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division, Congressional Research Service.\n     Subject: Abortion and the Patient Protection and Affordable \n         Care Act.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your request concerning \n     abortion and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \n     The measure was proposed by Senator Harry Reid on November \n     21, 2009 as an amendment in the nature of a substitute for \n     H.R. 3590, the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act of \n     2009. You asked several questions about the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act and the use of federal \n     funds to pay for abortion services. This memorandum addresses \n     those questions.\n       1. ``Does the Senate's Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act prohibit affordability and cost-sharing credits from \n     paying for abortions beyond those permitted by the most \n     recent appropriation for the Department of Health and Human \n     Services?''\n       Division F of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, \n     provides appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health \n     and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies for \n     FY2009. Section 507, included within Division F, prohibits \n     generally the use of appropriated funds to pay for abortions:\n       (a) None of the funds appropriated in this Act, and none of \n     the funds in any trust fund to which funds are appropriated \n     in this Act, shall be expended for any abortion.\n       (b) None of the funds appropriated in this Act, and none of \n     the funds in any trust fund to which funds are appropriated \n     in this Act, shall be expended for health benefits coverage \n     that includes coverage of abortion.\n       (c) The term ``health benefits coverage'' means the package \n     of services covered by a managed care provider or \n     organization pursuant to a contract or other arrangement.\n       This restriction on the use of appropriated funds to pay \n     for abortions is commonly referred to as the ``Hyde \n     Amendment.'' In 1976, Rep. Henry J. Hyde offered an amendment \n     to the Departments of Labor and Health, Education, and \n     Welfare, Appropriation Act, 1977, that restricted the use of \n     appropriated funds to pay for abortions provided through the \n     Medicaid program.\n       An exception to the general prohibition on using \n     appropriated funds for abortions is provided in section \n     508(a) of the omnibus measure:\n       The limitations established in the preceding section shall \n     not apply to an abortion--\n       (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or \n     incest; or\n       (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical \n     disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a \n     life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from \n     the pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a \n     physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an \n     abortion is performed.\n       In other words, funds appropriated to the Department of \n     Health and Human Services (``HHS'') for FY2009 could be used \n     to pay for an abortion if a pregnancy is the result of an act \n     of rape or incest, or if a woman's life would be endangered \n     if an abortion were not performed. Appropriated funds remain \n     unavailable, however, for elective abortions.\n       Under the Senate measure, the issuer of a qualified health \n     plan would determine whether or not the plan provides \n     coverage for either elective abortions or abortions for which \n     the expenditure of federal funds appropriated for HHS is \n     permitted. If a qualified health plan decides to provide \n     coverage for elective abortions, it could not use any amount \n     attributable to a premium assistance credit or any cost-\n     sharing reduction to pay for such services. The community \n     health insurance option established by the Senate measure \n     would be similarly restricted. H.R. 3590 would allow coverage \n     for elective abortions by the community health insurance \n     option, but amounts attributable to a premium assistance \n     credit or cost-sharing reduction could not be used to pay for \n     such abortions.\n       2. ``Does the Senate's Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act ensure that the community health insurance option \n     does not use federal funds to pay for abortions beyond those \n     permitted by the most recent appropriation for the Department \n     of Health and Human Services?''\n       The Senate measure would allow coverage for elective \n     abortions by the community health insurance option, but \n     amounts attributable to a premium assistance credit or cost-\n     sharing reduction could not be used to pay for such \n     abortions.\n       3. ``Under current law, the Weldon Amendment prohibits \n     Federal agencies or programs and State or local governments \n     who [sic] receive certain federal funds from discriminating \n     against certain health care entities, including individuals \n     and facilities, that are unwilling to provide, pay for, \n     provide coverage of, or refer for abortions. Does the \n     Senate's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act offer an \n     additional, new conscience protection for individual health \n     care providers\n\n[[Page S12673]]\n\n     and facilities that are unwilling to provide, pay for, \n     provide coverage of, or refer for abortions?''\n       Under the Senate measure, individual health care providers \n     and health care facilities could not be discriminated against \n     because of a willingness or unwillingness to provide, pay \n     for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions, if their \n     decisions are based on their religious or moral beliefs. \n     Section 1303(a)(3) of the Senate measure states: ``No \n     individual health care provider or health care facility may \n     be discriminated against because of a willingness or an \n     unwillingness, if doing so is contrary to the religious or \n     moral beliefs of the provider or facility, to provide, pay \n     for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.''\n       4. ``Does the Senate's Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act ensure that there is a health plan available in \n     every exchange that does not cover abortion beyond those \n     permitted by the most recent appropriation for the Department \n     of Health and Human Services?''\n       The Senate measure would require the Secretary of HHS to \n     ensure that in any health insurance exchange (``Exchange''), \n     at least one qualified health plan does not provide coverage \n     for abortions for which the expenditure of federal funds \n     appropriated for HHS is not permitted. If a state has one \n     Exchange that covers more than one insurance market, the \n     Secretary would be required to provide the aforementioned \n     assurance with respect to each market.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the health reform legislation before us \npreserves the Hyde language and maintains the status quo in this \ncountry. We should keep it so. This should be a debate about health \ncare. It should be about patients and about ensuring they have access \nto quality care at all stages of their lives, regardless of what may \nhappen in their lives. It is a mistake to make this debate one about \nabortion.\n  The amendment that is before us, the Nelson-Hatch amendment, would \nrestrict any health plan operating in the exchange that accepts \naffordability credits from offering abortion services. In essence, the \namendment before us would amount to a ban on abortion coverage in the \nhealth insurance exchange regardless of where the money comes from. Put \nanother way, a woman who pays for insurance with money out of her own \npocket would most likely not be able to get insurance that covers \nabortion.\n  Make no mistake about it, this amendment is much more than a debate \non whether Federal funds should be used for abortion, which is already \nestablished law. It is established law that is maintained in the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act before us.\n  The Nelson-Hatch amendment is a very far-reaching intrusion into the \nlives of women in how we would get private insurance. It is \nunprecedented, and it would mean millions of women would lose coverage \nthey currently have.\n  It is true, as we have heard from those people who support this \namendment, that a woman would be able to buy an abortion rider. What we \nheard from Senator Stabenow and what we have seen from the National \nWomen's Law Center shows us that in the five States that do require \nsuch a rider, there is no evidence that such plans exist. And even if \nthey did exist, who would purchase that kind of a rider? No woman \nexpects to need an abortion. This is not something you go into planning \nahead of time.\n  Finally, this amendment would have effects that reach well into the \nprivate insurance market. An independent analysis by the School of \nPublic Health and Health Services at George Washington University \nconcluded that a similar amendment adopted in the House--what is \ncommonly known as the Stupak amendment--will have an ``industry-wide \neffect,'' eliminating coverage of medically indicated abortions over \ntime for all women.'' That means any type of abortion for which there \nis a medical indication of need would go uncovered.\n  I ask unanimous consent that ``Introduction and Results in Brief'' of \nthe George Washington University analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   An Analysis of the Implications of the Stupak/Pitts Amendment for \n               Coverage of Medically Indicated Abortions\n\n(By Sara Rosenbaum, Lara Cartwright-Smith, Ross Margulies, Susan Wood, \n                           D. Richard Mauery)\n\n\n                   Introduction and Results in Brief\n\n       This analysis examines the implications for coverage of \n     medically indicated abortions under the Stupak/Pitts \n     Amendment (Stupak/Pitts) to H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health \n     Care for America Act. In this analysis we focus on the \n     Amendment's implications for the health benefit services \n     industry as a whole. We also consider the Amendment's \n     implications for the growth of a market for public or private \n     supplemental coverage of medically indicated abortions. \n     Finally, we examine the issues that may arise as insurers \n     attempt to implement coverage determinations in which \n     abortion may be a consequence of a condition, rather than the \n     primary basis of treatment.\n       Industry-wide impact that will shift the standard of \n     coverage for medically indicated abortions for all women: In \n     view of how the health benefit services industry operates and \n     how insurance product design responds to broad regulatory \n     intervention aimed at reshaping product content, we conclude \n     that the treatment exclusions required under the Stupak/Pitts \n     Amendment will have an industry-wide effect, eliminating \n     coverage of medically indicated abortions over time for all \n     women, not only those whose coverage is derived through a \n     health insurance exchange. As a result, Stupak/Pitts can be \n     expected to move the industry away from current norms of \n     coverage for medically indicated abortions. In combination \n     with the Hyde Amendment, Stupak/Pitts will impose a coverage \n     exclusion for medically indicated abortions on such a \n     widespread basis that the health benefit services industry \n     can be expected to recalibrate product design downward across \n     the board in order to accommodate the exclusion in selected \n     markets.\n       Supplemental insurance coverage for medically indicated \n     abortions: In our view, the terms and impact of the Amendment \n     will work to defeat the development of a supplemental \n     coverage market for medically indicated abortions. In any \n     supplemental coverage arrangement, it is essential that the \n     supplemental coverage be administered in conjunction with \n     basic coverage. This intertwined administration approach is \n     barred under Stupak/Pitts because of the prohibition against \n     financial commingling. This bar is in addition to the \n     challenges inherent in administering any supplemental policy. \n     These challenges would be magnified in the case of medically \n     indicated abortions because, given the relatively low number \n     of medically indicated abortions, the coverage supplement \n     would apply to only a handful of procedures for a handful of \n     conditions. Furthermore, the House legislation contains no \n     direct economic incentive to create such a market. Indeed, it \n     is not clear how such a market even would be regulated or \n     whether it would be subject to the requirements that apply to \n     all products offered inside the exchange. Finally, because \n     supplemental coverage must of necessity commingle funds with \n     basic coverage, the impact of Stupak/Pitts on states' ability \n     to offer supplemental Medicaid coverage to women insured \n     through a subsidized exchange plan is in doubt.\n       Spillover effects as a result of administration of Stupak/\n     Pitts. The administration of any coverage exclusion raises a \n     risk that, in applying the exclusion, a plan administrator \n     will deny coverage not only for the excluded treatment but \n     also for related treatments that are intertwined with the \n     exclusion. The risk of such improper denials in high risk and \n     costly cases is great in the case of the Stupak/Pitts \n     Amendment, which, like the Hyde Amendment, distinguishes \n     between life-threatening physical conditions and conditions \n     in which health is threatened. Unlike Medicaid agencies, \n     however, the private health benefit services industry has no \n     experience with this distinction. The danger is around \n     coverage denials in cases in which an abortion is the result \n     of a serious health condition rather than the direct \n     presenting treatment.\n       The remainder of this analysis examines these issues in \n     greater detail.\n\n\n                    Overview of Current Federal Law\n\n       1. The Hyde Amendment and Medicaid\n       The Hyde Amendment has been part of each HHS-related \n     appropriation since FY 1977. As set forth in the most recent \n     annual Labor/HHS federal appropriations legislation, the Hyde \n     Amendment provides in pertinent part as follows:\n       Sec. 507. (a) None of the funds appropriated in this Act, \n     and none of the funds in any trust fund to which funds are \n     appropriated under this Act, shall be expended for any \n     abortion.\n       (b) None of the funds appropriated in this Act, and none of \n     the funds in any trust fund to which funds are appropriated \n     in this Act, shall be expended for health benefits coverage \n     that includes coverage of abortion.\n       (c) The term ``health benefits coverage'' means the package \n     of services covered by a managed care provider or \n     organization pursuant to a contract or other arrangement.\n       Sec. 508. (a) The limitation established in the preceding \n     section shall not apply to an abortion--\n       (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or \n     incest; or\n       (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical \n     disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a \n     life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from \n     the pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a \n     physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an \n     abortion is performed.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. When we pass this legislation that will reform our \nhealth care system, it should not be done in a way that would lose \nbenefits for\n\n[[Page S12674]]\n\nwomen. All women should have access to comprehensive health care, \nincluding reproductive health care, from the provider of their choice.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose any amendment that threatens \nreproductive care that women have counted on for over 30 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, health care reform legislation we are \nconsidering is good for America, it is good for women and for families. \nIt is a health care reform bill; it is not an abortion bill. In fact, \nnot a dime of taxpayers' money goes to subsidize abortion coverage in \nthis bill. It is, in fact, abortion neutral.\n  This amendment, however, would change that. It would roll back the \nclock on a woman's right to choose. It unfairly singles women out and \ntakes away benefits they already have. It singles out our daughters and \nlegislates limits on their reproductive health, their reproductive \nrights. If we were to do the same to men, if we were to single out \nmen's reproductive health in this legislation, imagine the outcry. \nImagine if men were denied access to certain procedures. Imagine if \nthey were denied access to certain prescription drugs. Imagine if the \nmajority had to suffer the decision of the minority. But that is \nexactly what we are being asked to do to our daughters with this \namendment--rolling back the hands of time. I personally find that \noffensive, as do women across this country.\n  The language of this bill has been carefully negotiated to ensure \nthat we are preserving a woman's right to choose but doing so without \nFederal funding. To claim otherwise is hypocritical and misleading.\n  We need not fight all battles that have nothing to do with the real \nissue at hand--that millions of Americans do not have health insurance \nand many are being forced into debt to buy coverage that insurers later \ndeny. But now, instead, we are not only reopening long-settled debates \nover this issue, we are actually faced with a proposal that would turn \nback the clock and deny women access to reproductive health care. It is \nthe wrong debate at the wrong time.\n  Over the years, we have made extraordinary progress in addressing \nwomen's reproductive rights. We have debated this issue in the Senate. \nWe have debated it in our churches, in our homes, in our communities, \nand in the U.S. Supreme Court that has said a woman's right to choose \nis the law of the land. Let's not turn back the clock.\n  I respect the deeply held views of my friend from Nebraska and the \ndeeply held views of my friend from Utah. I know we will debate the \nissue many times in many forums. They will raise their voices in \nprotest of a woman's right to choose, as I will raise mine to protect \nit. But this is neither the time nor the legislative vehicle for hot-\nbutton politics to get in the way of badly needed health care reform.\n  The language in this bill is clear: It preserves a woman's \nreproductive rights without any taxpayer funding. Yet we are engaged in \na debate in which we are basically being told that neutrality is not \ngood enough; that there needs to be an antichoice bill, not a health \ncare reform bill; that neutrality on the issue is not acceptable; that \nonly effectively banning abortion is acceptable. We are not going to be \ndragged down that road, and the women of this country will not stand \nfor it. Certainly, this Senator will not either.\n  The sponsors claim the amendment simply reinforces existing law \nrestricting Federal funding of abortion coverage. Let's be very clear: \nThere is no taxpayer money going to a woman's reproductive choices--\nnone--and to say otherwise is simply wrong.\n  The fact is, this amendment that clearly takes us back in time would \nleave our daughters with the same hopeless lack of options their \ngrandmothers faced, and that is not where we ought to be.\n  This amendment would make it virtually impossible for insurance plans \nin the exchange to offer abortion coverage even if a woman were to pay \npremiums entirely out of her own pocket. It would do so by forbidding \nany plan that includes abortion coverage from accepting even one \nsubsidized customer.\n  This amendment is nothing more than a backdoor effort to restrict \nrights women already have. Would I like to see it clearly stated in \nthis legislation that a woman should have a right to choose and all \naspects of her reproductive health should be available under every \nplan? Yes, I would. But am I willing to accept neutrality as a \nreasonable compromise for the sake of passage of a bill that will \nprovide affordable, accessible health care to every American and not \nspend a dime of taxpayers' money on women's reproductive choices? I \nwill.\n  Under this bill, if a plan chooses to provide abortion coverage, only \nprivate funds can go toward that care. That is further than I would \nlike to go, but it is neutrality. In this bill, in each State exchange, \nthere would be at least one plan that covers abortion and one plan that \ndoes not. That is neutrality. It is fair. Let's accept it and move on.\n  Under this legislation, women will keep their fundamental right to \nreproductive health benefits and gain other benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. That is what we should do in terms of the underlying \nbill. Let's vote down this amendment. Let's not turn back the clock.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in lieu of \nSenator Baucus's 4 minutes, Senator Casey take that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nelson amendment \nfor two reasons, and I speak for myself, not for other Members of the \nSenate. Obviously, I know there is a good bit of disagreement on both \nsides and even within both sides of the aisle.\n  But I support this amendment for two reasons. One, I wish to make \nsure we ensure, through this health care legislation, the consensus we \nhave had as part of our public policy for many years now--that taxpayer \ndollars don't pay for abortions. I believe we can and should and will \nget this right by the end of this debate.\n  The second reason I support this is, I believe it is important to \nrespect the conscience of taxpayers, both women and men across the \ncountry, who don't want taxpayer dollars going to support abortions. If \nthere is one or maybe two areas where both sides can agree--people who \nare pro-life and pro-choice--it is on these basic principles: No. 1, we \ndon't want to take actions to increase the number of abortions in \nAmerica. I think that is the prevailing view across the divide of this \nissue. No. 2, we also have to do more to help those women who are \npregnant, and I don't believe we are doing enough. We will talk more \nabout that later. Even as we debate this amendment, the third thing I \nthink we can agree on is, no matter what happens on this vote--and this \ndebate will continue, even in the context of this bill--I believe we \nhave to pass health care legislation this year.\n  There are all kinds of consumer protections in this bill that will \nhelp men and women--prevention services that have never been part of \nour health care system before, insurance reforms to protect families \nand, finally, the kind of security we are going to get by passing \nhealth care legislation for the American people. I believe we can get \nthis decisive issue correct in this bill. We are not there yet, but I \nbelieve we can. I believe we must pass health care legislation this \nmonth through the Senate and then, from there, get it enacted into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before we turn this over to the Republican \nside, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom religious leaders who support maintaining the underlying bill and \nwho oppose this amendment, and they are: Catholics for Choice, \nDisciples Justice Action Center, The Episcopal Church, Jewish Women \nInternational, Presbyterian Church Washington Office, Religious \nCoalition for Reproductive Choice, Union of Reform Judaism, United \nChurch of Christ, Justice and Witness Ministries, United Methodist \nChurch-General Board of Church and Society, Unitarian Universalist \nAssociation of Congregations.\n  We are proud to have their support for our position.\n\n[[Page S12675]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Religious Leaders Support Maintaining the Status Quo on Abortion in \n                           Health Care Reform\n\n       The undersigned religious and religiously affiliated \n     organizations urge the Senate to support comprehensive, \n     quality health care reform that maintains the current Senate \n     language on abortion services.\n       We believe that it is our social and moral obligation to \n     ensure access to high quality comprehensive health care \n     services at every stage in an individual's life. Reforming \n     the health care system in a way that guarantees affordable \n     and accessible care for all is not simply a good idea--it is \n     necessary for the well-being of all people in our nation.\n       The passage of meaningful health reform legislation will \n     make significant strides toward accomplishing the important \n     goal of access to health care for all. Unfortunately, the \n     House-passed version of health reform includes language that \n     imposes significant new restrictions on access to abortion \n     services. This provision would result in women losing health \n     coverage they currently have, an unfortunate contradiction to \n     the basic guiding principle of health care reform. Providing \n     affordable, accessible health care to all Americans is a \n     moral imperative that unites Americans of many faith \n     traditions. The selective withdrawal of critical health \n     coverage from women is both a violation of this imperative \n     and a betrayal of the public good.\n       The use of this legislation to advance new restrictions on \n     abortion services that surpass those in current law will \n     serve only to derail this important bill. The Senate bill is \n     already abortion neutral, an appropriate reflection of the \n     fact that it is intended to serve Americans of many diverse \n     religious and moral views. The bill includes compromise \n     language that maintains current law, prohibiting federal \n     funds from being used to pay for abortion services, while \n     still allowing women the option to use their own private \n     funds to pay for abortion care. American families should have \n     the opportunity to choose health coverage that reflects their \n     own values and medical needs, a principle that should not be \n     sacrificed in service of any political agenda.\n       We urge the Senate to support meaningful health reform that \n     maintains the compromise language on abortion services \n     currently in the bill.\n           Respectfully,\n         Catholics for Choice, Disciples Justice Action Center, \n           The Episcopal Church, Jewish Women International, \n           NA'AMAT USA, National Council of Jewish Women, \n           Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) Washington Office, \n           Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, The \n           Religious Institute, Union of Reform Judaism, United \n           Church of Christ, Justice and Witness Ministries, \n           United Methodist Church--General Board of Church and \n           Society, Unitarian Universalist Association of \n           Congregations.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I assume that added a few additional minutes \nto our time as well.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, let me start my remarks today, if I \ncould, by offering my words of support and commendation to Senators \nNelson and Hatch for offering this amendment. They have long been \nchampions of the pro-life cause, and I applaud them for putting the \ntime and effort into this amendment to get it right, bringing it to the \nfloor, and offering it. I am very proud to stand here today as a \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  Fundamentally, this legislation is simply about doing the right \nthing. It ensures that current Federal law is upheld. In its most basic \nform, it says taxpayer dollars are not going to be used, directly or \nindirectly, to finance elective abortions. In fact, this has been the \nlaw of our country now dating back three decades.\n  Basically, this amendment applies the Hyde amendment to the health \ncare reform bill. It bars Federal funding for abortion, except in the \ncase of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother. The Hyde \namendment--as we have heard so many times during this debate--finds its \ngenesis in 1977. The language in the Nelson-Hatch amendment is \nvirtually identical to the Stupak language that was included in the \nHouse bill, where 240 Representatives in the House supported it and it \npassed on a vote of 240 to 194.\n  The Stupak language very clearly prohibits Federal funding of \nabortions. It says this: No. 1, the government-run plan cannot cover \nabortions. That seems very straightforward. No. 2, Americans who \nreceive a subsidy cannot use it to buy health insurance that covers \nabortion. No. 3, the Federal Government cannot mandate abortion \ncoverage by private providers or plans. Then, finally, No. 4, as has \nbeen the case for 30 years, private insurance plans may cover abortion, \nand individuals may purchase a plan that covers it, but taxpayer \ndollars cannot be in the mix to purchase that.\n  Compare that to what is in the current Senate bill. The government-\nrun plan can cover abortion. Americans who receive a subsidy can use it \nto buy a health insurance policy that covers abortion. The Federal \nGovernment can and does mandate abortion coverage by at least one \nprovider or plan. There is a stipulation in the current bill that \nrequires the Health and Human Services Secretary to assure the \nsegregation of funds, the tax credit/Federal dollars can't be used.\n  But the reality is, it is akin to saying: Here, put those Federal \ndollars in your left pocket. When you are purchasing the abortion \ncoverage, make sure it is your right hand that is reaching into your \nright pocket. How do you segregate those funds? It is impossible. What \nit does is to simply erase the line between taxpayer dollars and \nfunding of abortions.\n  Quoting the National Right to Life:\n\n       Senator Reid included in his substitute bill language that \n     some have claimed would preserve the principles of the Hyde \n     Amendment. Such claims are highly misleading. In reality, the \n     Reid language explicitly authorizes direct funding of \n     elective abortion by a Federal Government program.\n\n  Well, I feel very strongly we must ensure that Federal dollars are \nnot used to fund abortions directly or indirectly. Health care reform, \nunder the Reid language, has become a vehicle for changing the current \nlaw of the land regarding abortion coverage. Here is what some of my \nconstituents have said to me, and I am quoting from a gentleman in \nKearney:\n\n       It is time to make sure that abortion is explicitly \n     prohibited by any language that may be put forward.\n\n  Another Nebraskan said to me:\n\n       I know that the pro-life issue is not the only component of \n     the Healthcare bill to consider, but it is probably the most \n     important issue of concern that I have in this bill. Abortion \n     is not health care.\n\n  From central Nebraska I heard this:\n\n       I'm taking a minute to send a note to say ``thank you'' for \n     standing up for life. Life is precious, whether you are just \n     conceived or over 100 years of age.\n\n  Pro-life groups across the board support this amendment--the National \nRight to Life, Catholic Bishops, Family Research Council, and others. \nThey represent millions of Americans. But the reality is, Americans \nsupport this.\n  In a recent CNN survey, we confirm that 6 in 10 Americans favor a ban \non the use of Federal funds for abortion. A recent Washington Post-ABC \nNews poll indicates 65 percent of adults believe private insurance \nplans paid for with government assistance should not include coverage \nof abortion.\n  I was in McCook, NE, a while back, doing a townhall meeting in \nAugust. After everybody had left, a gentleman came up to me. He told me \nsomething about that I will remember all the years I am in the Senate. \nFirst, he spoke about his faith, and then he said: I hope you \nunderstand, Senator, I cannot, under any circumstances, agree to \nanything that would allow my taxpayer dollars, either directly or \nindirectly, to fund abortions. He said: I cannot go there. He said: \nPlease, do everything you can to stop this from happening.\n  Today, I stand with that gentleman from McCook, NE, to say we have to \nstop this.\n  I applaud my colleague from Nebraska, and I wish to end my comments \nwith this. Senator Nelson stood on this issue and in a recent interview \nhe said this:\n\n       I have said at the end of the day, if it doesn't have the \n     Stupak language on abortion in it, I won't vote to move it \n     off the floor.\n\n  I think that is a courageous statement. I do not mind standing here \nand saying I am very pleased to associate myself with Senator Nelson \nand Senator Hatch on this important amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I yield my 2 minutes 45 seconds to Senator Hatch when he \nspeaks. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S12676]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate this very much. It has \nbeen a healthy debate, a big debate, and it is an unusual debate \nbecause we haven't debated Hyde around here for 20 years. So this is an \nunusual debate we are having. Normally, we debate about abortion but \nnot about abortion funding because there has been an agreement in this \nbody for 33 years about that. So this is an unusual debate, but I think \nit is an important one.\n  I think it is extraneous, in many respects, to the health care bill \nitself. Abortion is not health care, and so why we are debating the \nfunding of abortion in a health care bill seems odd to me. But it is in \nthe base bill, and we need to deal with that.\n  A lot of people are coming forward and saying: Well, OK, which way is \nthis; is it in the bill or not on funding for abortion? I am going to \ngo to an independent fact checker and cite this. This is an independent \nresearch and prize-winning fact checker, PolitiFact.com, and they say \nour opponents' characterization of this amendment was ``misleading'' \nand that ``the people who would truly pay all their premium with their \nown money, and who would not use Federal subsidies at all, not barred \nin any way from obtaining abortion coverage, even if they obtain their \ninsurance from the federally administered health exchange.''\n\n  That is an independent group, PolitiFact.com, saying this doesn't \nlimit the ability for somebody on their own to be able to purchase \nabortion coverage, if they want to do that, but in the base bill, what \nwe are saying is we don't want to put Federal funds in it as the \nlongstanding policy has been here.\n  As the President himself has said when he spoke to a joint session of \nCongress, launching the health care debate:\n\n       One more misunderstanding I want to clear up--under our \n     plan, no Federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and \n     Federal conscience laws will remain in place.\n\n  Unfortunately, in the Reid bill, this is not true. This is not true \nin the Reid bill. What is in the Reid bill is the so-called Capps \namendment language, which allows for the Federal funding of abortion.\n  I wish to describe--and I think a great deal of what is in here has \nbeen described, but what is taking place is the Federal subsidization \nof an insurance program that will have abortion funding in it. \nAccording to most groups, that is what is taking place in the Capps \nlanguage, which is in the base Reid bill.\n  I say this is an unusual debate that is taking place because we \nhaven't debated Hyde for years around here. I wish to read to you what \nis our normal status on funding of abortions; that is, that we don't do \nFederal funding of abortions. I will read to you what the normal status \nis. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which supports this base \nbill but does not support funding of abortions, describes it this way:\n\n       In every major federal program where federal funds combined \n     with nonfederal funds to support or purchase health coverage, \n     Congress has consistently sought to ensure that the entire \n     package of benefits excludes elective abortions. For example, \n     the Hyde amendment governing Medicaid prevents the funding of \n     such abortions not only using federal funds themselves, but \n     also using the state matching funds that combine with the \n     federal funds to subsidize the coverage. A similar amendment \n     excludes elective abortions from all plans offered under the \n     Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, where private \n     premiums are supplemented by a federal subsidy.\n\n  So there it is prohibited as well.\n\n       Where relevant, such provisions also specify that federal \n     funds may not be used to help pay the administrative expenses \n     of a benefits package that includes abortions. Under this \n     policy, those wishing to use state or private funds to \n     purchase abortion coverage must do so completely separately \n     from the plan that is purchased in whole or in part with \n     federal financial assistance.\n  Here I take a quick aside. That is what we are saying should be done \nin this bill, but it is not what is done in this bill.\n  Going on:\n\n       This is the policy that health care reform legislation must \n     follow if it is to comply with the legal status quo on \n     federal funding of abortion coverage. All of the five health \n     care reform bills approved in the 111th Congress violate this \n     policy.\n\n  This is from a group, the United States Conference of Catholic \nBishops, that supports health care reform but not the abortion funding \nin it. They say as well that this fails in the Reid bill, that there is \nexplicit funding for abortion in this bill.\n  I thank my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle, \nSenators Nelson and Casey, for being major cosponsors of this \namendment. They are the ones who look at this and say: I don't want \nthis in the base bill. This should not be in the base bill. It doesn't \nbelong in the base bill. The language should be different.\n  I also wish to note that most people across the country don't want \nthis in the base bill. A majority of the country is opposed to the bill \noverall. They don't think this is the way we should go. They think it \nis the wrong way. But even people who support the bill itself by and \nlarge don't want Federal funding for abortion to be in this bill.\n  A Pew poll even showed that 46 percent of people who support health \ncare reform want to see the radical abortion language removed, the \nCapps language in the Reid bill, and all pro-choice Republicans and \nseveral pro-choice Democrats supported the measure in the House that \nput Stupak language in that removed the Federal funding for abortion. \nThe American people feel this way because they know that forcing \nFederal funding of abortion is fiscally irresponsible and morally \nindefensible. Those are the two central pieces we are discussing, the \nfiscal responsibility or irresponsibility of this and the moral \nindefensibility. At a time of hemorrhaging debt, the Federal Government \nbeing supportive and funding elective abortions flies in the face of \ntrying to restrain or bend the cost curve down in this legislation. \nThat is not us being fiscally responsible.\n  I have shown this chart before, but I think it is so striking. Back \nwhen we did do funding for abortions, we funded about 300,000 a year. \nHow is that extra funding going to help us be more fiscally \nresponsible? That is why a majority of the people, pro-life and pro-\nchoice, are saying the Federal Government should not be funding this. I \ndon't believe that is fiscally responsible. And it is morally \nindefensible.\n  Whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, we are having 300,000 \nchildren who are not going to be here that we are funding the \nelimination of. Under anybody's definition of looking at that, they \nwould say that is morally indefensible for the Federal Government that \nhas long debated abortion policy, has not debated abortion funding, \nthat that is morally indefensible for us to do something along that \nline.\n  There are many issues to debate but thankfully Hyde has not been one \nof them we have been debating until now. I say to my colleagues the \nadmonition we have had many times, whether you choose this day life or \ndeath, blessing or curse, why wouldn't we choose the life route on this \none? Even if you have a close call or you are questioning this, why \nwouldn't we choose the route that says: I am not going to fund 300,000 \nabortions. I want abortion to be safe, legal and rare, as some people \nin this body, but that is not rare, 300,000. Why wouldn't we choose the \nlife route that says this is a controversial issue sometime way in the \npast, not recently. We don't fund these things. So many people in \nAmerica don't want their money used to pay for abortions. Yet in this \nbase Reid bill, it is there. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment that puts into Hyde language that is \nthe status quo that there is not taxpayer funding going toward abortion \nand to reject those who would put the Reid language forward that would \ntake us back decades to an era when we did fund abortion procedures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my opposition to the \nNelson-Hatch amendment. In deliberating how to construct a fair \nequitable solution to such a divisive question, the one thing that our \nGroup of 6 agreed on during our meetings prior to the markup of \nlegislation in the Finance Committee was that we wanted to remain \nneutral and preserve the status quo.\n  I am pleased that Majority Leader Reid chose to reflect the Finance \nCommittee's work because I believe that we\n\n[[Page S12677]]\n\nachieved that careful balance. Federal funds continue to be prohibited \nbeing used to pay for abortions unless the pregnancy is due to rape, \nincest or if the life of the mother is in danger. Health plans that \nchoose to cover abortion care must demonstrate that no tax credits or \ncost-sharing credits are used to pay for abortion care.\n  The Finance Committee adopted this solution primarily because the \npolicy of separating Federal dollars from private dollars has been \nachieved in other instances and there is a precedent for that approach. \nToday, 17 States cover abortion beyond the Hyde limitations with State-\nonly dollars in their Medicaid Programs. States and hospitals, which in \nno way want to risk their eligibility for Medicaid funding, use \nseparate billing codes for abortions that are allowable under the Hyde \namendment, and those that are not. And let me emphasize, there have \nnever been any violations among the States in this regard. Moreover, a \nsimilar approach has also been taken with Title X family planning funds \nand the United Nations Population Fund. We ought to hew to current law \nand what we know already works.\n  Yet some want to prohibit women from using their own money--beyond \ntaxpayer dollars--towards purchasing a plan in the exchange that covers \nabortion or limit coverage only through a supplemental policy. I have \nstrong reservations about taking such an approach.\n  Under the Nelson-Hatch amendment, a woman must try to predict whether \nor not she will require that coverage. This is an unfair proposition. \nHalf of all pregnancies in this country are unplanned and most women do \nnot anticipate the necessity for abortion coverage. Furthermore, in \nmost cases, women already have that coverage. Today, between 47 and 80 \npercent of private plans cover abortion services. So for a middle \nincome woman who already purchases coverage in the individual market \nand could now receive a subsidy, let me be clear about the effect this \nchange would have. This would take away coverage she currently has \nessentially creating a two tiered system for women who don't have \ncoverage through their employer and instead receive it through the \nexchange. That is fundamentally wrong, and it is patently unfair.\n  And the fact is, over time, more and more individuals will receive \ncoverage through the exchange, which means that the number of women who \nwill confront these restrictions will grow. Not only that but this \namendment threatens to reach even further than the exchange. According \nto a study by the George Washington University School of Public Health \nthat reviewed the Stupak/Pitts provisions from the House ``the size of \nthe new market is large enough so that Stupak/Pitts can be expected to \nalter the `default' customs and practices that guide the health \nbenefits industry as a whole, leading it to drop coverage in all \nmarkets in order to meet the lowest common denominator in both the \nexchange and expanded Medicaid markets.''\n  As opposed to the demonstrated evidence from States that separating \nFederal funds can and does work, we cannot say the same about the \navailability of supplemental, abortion-only coverage.\n  In the five States that have similar prohibitions on abortion \ncoverage to the Nelson-Hatch amendment, supplemental coverage is \ngenerally not offered--as a result of a lack of market demand for \nriders. And even if supplemental coverage were available, there are \nsignificant privacy concerns. If a woman opted to purchase supplemental \nabortion coverage, it could be inferred that she plans to obtain an \nabortion. Confidentiality is vital to women who are making this choice \nand the possibility that this information could be disclosed is both \nserious and disturbing. Women may face harassment and intimidation on \nwhat should be a private matter between her family and her physician.\n\n  The fact of the matter is, whether to undergo an abortion is one of \nthe most wrenching decisions a woman can ever make--and we shouldn't \nignore the real life circumstances that lead them to this choice. For \nsome expecting mothers, tragedy strikes when a lethal fetal anomaly is \ndiscovered. Other times there may be adverse health consequences to \ncontinuing a pregnancy. In these heartbreaking cases, a woman without \ncoverage can face severe financial hardship in paying for these health \ncosts--not to mention emotional anguish from ending a planned \npregnancy.\n  Rather than focusing on abortion, we should concentrate on the \nsignificant obstacles women of child-bearing age face under our current \nhealth care system. And we have achieved some clear victories for women \nin this bill. For example, maternity and newborn care is specifically \nincluded as an essential health benefit. Pregnancy is typically the \nmost expensive health event for families during their childbearing \nyears and there are significant consequences in a lack of coverage or \neven minimal coverage. Maternity coverage in the individual insurance \nmarket is difficult to find and exceedingly expensive if it is \navailable. Maternity coverage riders alone ranged from $106 to $1,100 \nper month, required waiting periods of one to 2 years with either no or \nlimited coverage during that period and capped total maximum benefits \nas low as $2,000 to $6,000. Yet expenditures for maternity care average \n$8,802.\n  I am also pleased that we passed the Mikulski amendment, which I was \nproud to cosponsor, that will enhance preventive services for women. \nThis could include preconception care, where doctors counsel women on \nnutrition and other health interventions before they become pregnant, \nas well as proper prenatal care.\n  This is critical as mothers who receive no prenatal care have an \ninfant mortality rate more than six times that of mothers receiving \nearly prenatal care. Yet 20 percent of women of childbearing age are \nuninsured and approximately 13 percent of all pregnant women are \nuninsured.\n  This bill also at long last ends the discriminatory practice of \ngender rating. For years, women in this age group seeking insurance \ncoverage have faced clear inequities compared to men. A study conducted \nby the National Women's Law Center found that insurers who practice \ngender rating charged 25-year-old women anywhere from 6 percent to 45 \npercent more than 25-year-old men, and charged 40-year-old women from 4 \npercent to 48 percent more than 40-year-old men. These critical \nimprovements will enhance both access and health care outcomes for \nwomen. This is precisely the direction we should be heading in . . . \nrather than placing additional obstacles in front of women.\n  Throughout my tenure in Congress I have opposed Federal funding for \nabortion. At the same time, as a champion of women's health, I have \nprofound reservations about limiting coverage options for women when \nthey are contributing private dollars. Women who are subject to an \nindividual mandate and are contributing private dollars to the cost of \ntheir insurance should not have coverage choices dictated for them by \nthe Federal Government. We are making decisions that will affect women \non an intensely personal level and if we fail to craft the right \nsolution, it could have serious implications for women's health and \nprivacy.\n  I appreciate the Finance Committee's effort to navigate this \ndifficult issue and hope we can concentrate on the task at hand--\nproviding coverage to the 30 million uninsured Americans. In that \nlight, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Nelson-Hatch amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield such time as is remaining to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I had a longer statement I was going to \ndeliver this afternoon, but after listening to my colleagues speak \nabout the Nelson-Casey-Hatch amendment, I want to take my time to \nrefute some of the arguments they are making about our amendment.\n  It does not even sound as though they are talking about the same \namendment I filed with Senators Nelson and Casey. Our amendment does \nnothing to roll back women's rights. When my colleagues on the other \nside say that, they are simply mischaracterizing our amendment. Our \namendment ensures that the Hyde language, a provision that has been in \nthe HHS appropriations legislation for the last 33 years, will apply to \nthe new health care programs created through this bill. We are applying \ncurrent law\n\n[[Page S12678]]\n\nto these programs. That is it. The current Hyde language ensures that \nno Federal Government funds are used to pay for elective abortion or \nhealth plans that provide elective abortion. Today States may only \noffer Medicaid abortion coverage if the coverage is paid for using \nentirely separate State funds, not State Medicaid matching funds. They \ncannot do that under current law. This is a longstanding policy based \non a principle that the Federal Government does not want to encourage \nabortion.\n  For example, Guttmacher studies show that when abortion is not \ncovered in Medicaid, roughly 25 percent of women in the covered \npopulation who would have otherwise had an abortion choose to carry to \nterm. I wanted to explain why the Reid-Capps language in the Reid bill \nis not the Hyde language. First, the Hyde amendment prohibits funding \nfor abortions through Medicaid and other programs funded through the \nHHS appropriations bill. However, the public option is not subject to \nfurther appropriation and therefore is not subject to Hyde. Directly \nopposite of the Hyde amendment, the Reid-Capps language explicitly \nauthorizes the newly created public option to pay for elective \nabortions. The public option will operate under the authority of the \nSecretary of HHS and draw funds from the Federal Treasury account. \nRegardless of how these funds are collected, these funds from the \nTreasury are Federal funds. Funding of abortion through this program \nwill represent a clear departure from longstanding policy by \nauthorizing the Federal Government to pay for elective abortion for the \nfirst time in decades.\n  The Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment would prohibit funding for abortion \nunder H.R. 3590 except in the cases of rape, incest, or to save the \nlife of the mother. As is the case with the CHIP program and Department \nof Defense health care, the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment would be \npermanent law rather than an appropriations rider, subject to annual \ndebate and approval. Any funding ban subject to annual approval will be \nin jeopardy in the future. Even if there are the votes to maintain the \nHyde language, procedural tactics and veto threats could be employed \nand make it impossible to retain an annual ban.\n  Secondly, the Hyde amendment prohibits funding for health benefits \ncoverage that includes coverage of abortion. This requirement ensures \nthat the Federal Government does not encourage abortion by providing \naccess to it. When the government subsidizes a plan, it is helping to \nmake all of the covered services available. Federal premium subsidies \nauthorized and appropriated in H.R. 3590 are not subject to annual \nappropriations and they are, therefore, not subject to the Hyde \nlanguage. Directly opposite of the Hyde language, the Reid-Capps \nexplicitly allows federal subsidies to pay for plans that cover \nabortion by applying an accounting scheme. Under the accounting scheme, \nthe government is permitted to subsidize abortion coverage provided \nthat funds used to reimburse for abortions are labeled ``private'' \nfunds. This is an end run around the Hyde restriction on funding for \nplans that cover abortion.\n  Furthermore, under the accounting scheme, premium holders will be \nforced to pay at least $12 per year as an abortion surcharge to be used \nto pay for abortions. The Nelson-Casey-Hatch amendment would ensure \nthat no funds under H.R. 3590 will subsidize plans that cover abortion. \nHowever, it does nothing to prohibit individuals from purchasing \nseparate abortion coverage or from purchasing plans that cover abortion \nwithout a Federal subsidy.\n  Another issue I want to raise is the impact the Nelson-Hatch-Casey \namendment would have on coverage of elective abortions by private \nhealth plans. I heard some of my colleagues say that our amendment \nwould prohibit women from purchasing health plans with abortion \ncoverage, even if they spend their own money. I understand there is a \nPolitifact story with the headline ``Lowey Says Stupak Amendment \nRestricts Abortion Coverage, Even for Those Who Pay for Their Own \nPlan.''\n  That is simply not true. Our amendment would not prohibit the ability \nof women to obtain elective abortions as long as they use their own \nmoney to purchase these policies and not the money of the taxpayers of \nAmerica, directly or indirectly. Again, our opponents will argue that \nit does, but if they take the time to read our amendment, they will \nnote on page 3, line 6, that it ensures there is an option to purchase \nseparate supplemental coverage or a plan with coverage for elective \nabortions. In fact, let me read it to my colleagues so we are all clear \non what the language actually says. I am going to read it because I am \ntired of hearing some of the misrepresentations made on the floor by, I \nam sure, well-meaning people who are very poorly informed on this \namendment. It is easy for me to see why they are poorly informed when I \nlook at this itty-bitty bill.\n  My gosh, no matter how bright you are, who could know everything in \nthis itty-bitty bill that will break the desk, if I drop it on it.\n  I am sorry. I scared the distinguished Senator from Iowa with this \nitty-bitty bill. I should have dropped it a little bit softly. I \napologize.\n  Let me tell you what it actually says.\n\n       (2) Option to purchase separate supplemental coverage or \n     plan.--Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as \n     prohibiting any non-Federal entity (including an individual \n     or a State or local government) from purchasing separate \n     supplemental coverage for abortions for which funding is \n     prohibited under this subsection, or a plan that includes \n     such abortions, so long as--\n       (A) such coverage or plan is paid for entirely using only \n     funds not authorized or appropriated by this Act; and\n       (B) such coverage or plan is not purchased using--\n       (i) individual premium payments required for a qualified \n     health plan offered through the Exchange towards which a \n     credit is applied under section 36B of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986; or\n       (ii) other non-Federal funds required to receive a Federal \n     payment, including a State's or locality's contribution of \n     Medicaid matching funds.\n\n  Under the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment, women are allowed to purchase \nseparate elective abortion coverage with their own money. I wish they \nwould not, but we allow it. Anybody who says otherwise is \nmisrepresenting what this amendment does. I am sure they are not \nintentionally misrepresenting but nevertheless misrepresenting. So have \nfair warning.\n\n  It is also true that our amendment allows women to purchase a health \nplan that includes coverage of elective abortions in addition to the \nsupplemental abortion policy as long as they pay for it with their own \nmoney. So when those who oppose our amendment say a woman would never \nwant to purchase abortion coverage as a separate rider, they are truly \nmisunderstanding that our language also permits women to purchase an \nidentical exchange plan that includes coverage of elective abortions, \nin addition to other health benefits. To be clear, under our amendment, \na woman may purchase with her own funds either a supplemental policy \nthat covers elective abortions or an entire health plan that includes \nthe coverage of elective abortions.\n  Today, Federal funds may not pay for elective abortions or plans that \ncover elective abortions. This is the fundamental component of the Hyde \nlanguage. And to be clear, the Nelson-Hatch-Casey language does not \nprevent people purchasing their own private plans that include elective \nabortion coverage with private dollars.\n  In addition, our amendment explicitly states that these types of \npolicies may be offered. In other words, our amendment does not \nrestrict these policies from being offered. The only caveat is that \nthey may not be purchased with Federal subsidies. We want to make that \nclear, and the Reid-Capps language does not.\n  Let me read that section of the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment for my \ncolleagues. It may be found on page 4, line 3, of the Nelson-Hatch-\nCasey amendment.\n\n       (3) Option To Offer Supplemental Coverage Or Plan.--\n\n  Now get this:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall restrict any non-Federal \n     health insurance issuer offering a qualified health plan from \n     offering separate supplemental coverage for abortions for \n     which funding is prohibited under this subsection, or a plan \n     that includes such abortions, so long as--\n       (A) premiums for such separate supplemental coverage or \n     plan are paid for entirely with funds not authorized or \n     appropriated by this Act;\n       (B) administrative costs and all services offered through \n     such supplemental coverage\n\n[[Page S12679]]\n\n     or plan are paid for using only premiums collected for such \n     coverage or plan; and\n       (C) any such non-Federal health insurance issuer that \n     offers a qualified health plan through the Exchange that \n     includes coverage for abortions for which funding is \n     prohibited under this subsection also offers a qualified \n     health plan through the Exchange that is identical in every \n     respect except that it does not cover abortions for which \n     funding is prohibited under this subsection.\n\n  Our amendment has the support of the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, the National Right to Life Committee, the Family Research \nCouncil, the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern \nBaptist Convention, Concerned Women for America, the National \nAssociation of Evangelicals, and Americans United for Life Action.\n  Polls across the country indicate a majority of Americans do not want \ntheir tax dollars paying for elective abortions. According to a CNN/\nOpinion Research Corporation survey, 6 in 10 Americans favor a ban on \nthe use of Federal funds for abortion. Anybody who understands that \nfigure knows there are pro-choice people who also favor a ban on the \nuse of Federal funds for abortion.\n  It also indicates that the public may also favor legislation that \nwould prevent many women from getting their health insurance plan to \ncover the cost of an abortion, even if no Federal funds are involved. \nThis poll indicates that 61 percent of the public opposes the use of \npublic money for abortions for women who cannot afford the procedure, \nwith 37 percent in favor of allowing the use of Federal funds.\n  So my question to my fellow Senators is the following: When is this \nCongress going to start listening to the American people, people on \nboth sides of this issue, who do not feel that taxpayers ought to be \nsaddled with paying for abortion through their tax dollars, or in any \nother way, for that matter?\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment. Do \nthe right thing and support our amendment, which truly protects the \nsanctity of life and provides conscience protections to health care \nproviders who do not want to perform abortions. That is an important \naspect of this issue, and I have waited until the last minute to say \nsomething about that issue. Why should people of conscience be forced \nto participate in any aspect of elective abortions? They should not. \nPeople who have deep feelings of conscience should not be forced--that \nincludes nurses, doctors, health care providers, hospitals--they should \nnot be forced to do this, just because of the radicalness of some \npeople who exist in our society today, and some think the radicalness \nof some in this body and in the other body. It is radical to expect the \nAmerican taxpayers to pay for elective abortions, especially when such \na high percentage--up to 68 percent, according to some polls, and I \nthink even higher--do not want to have Federal dollars used for this \npurpose.\n  I appreciate my colleagues. I appreciate what my colleagues stand \nfor. But this is very important stuff.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a number of constituent letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Constituent Letters\n\n       Senator Hatch: I am absolutely and adamantly opposed to \n     having any of my tax dollars go to fund abortion directly or \n     indirectly. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to \n     vote against any motion to have the Senate consider any bill \n     that does not include specific language like the Stupak \n     Amendment.\n       Please let me know how you vote on the upcoming motion to \n     proceed to consider any healthcare legislation.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Hatch: I am extremely concerned that the majority \n     of members of all the congressional committees that have \n     considered healthcare legislation have refused to \n     specifically include language that would prohibit allowing \n     any of my tax dollars from directly or indirectly funding \n     abortions.\n       I am absolutely opposed to being forced to fund abortions \n     in any way with my tax dollars, and I urge you not to support \n     any healthcare bill that does not specifically prevent this. \n     I consider abortion to be the taking of innocent life and a \n     fundamental moral issue. I do not want to be forced to \n     support it in any way. . . .\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Hatch: During floor debate on the health care \n     reform bill, please support an amendment to incorporate \n     longstanding policies against abortion funding and in favor \n     of conscience rights. If these serious concerns are not \n     addressed, the final bill should be opposed.\n       Genuine health care reform should protect the life and \n     dignity of all people from the moment of conception until \n     natural death.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Nebraska be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the \nbipartisan amendment which I have proposed with Senator Hatch, the \nPresiding Officer, and others. As my good friend and colleague from \nUtah has so eloquently explained, our amendment mirrors the language \noffered by Representative Stupak that was accepted into the House \nhealth care bill. Our view is that it should become part of the Senate \nhealth care bill we are debating as well.\n  It is a fact that the issue of abortion stirs very strong emotions \ninvolving strongly held principles all across America, from those who \nsupport the procedure and those who do not. We are hearing that passion \nat times here on the Senate floor.\n  But we are not here to debate for or against abortion. This is a \ndebate about taxpayer money. It is a debate about whether it is \nappropriate for public funds to, for the first time in more than three \ndecades, cover elective abortions. In my opinion, most Americans and \nmost of the people in my State would say no.\n  As it is currently written, though, the Senate health care bill \nenables taxpayer dollars, directly and indirectly, to pay for insurance \nplans that cover abortion. We should not open the door to do so. As I \nsaid yesterday, when we offered the amendment, some suggested the \nStupak language imposes new restrictions on abortion. But that is not \nthe case. We are seeking to apply the same standards to the Senate \nhealth care bill that already exist for many Federal health programs.\n  But the bill does set a new standard. It is a standard in favor of \npublic funding of abortion. Our amendment does not limit the procedure, \nnor prevent people from buying insurance that covers abortion with \ntheir own money. It only ensures that when taxpayer dollars are \ninvolved, people are not required to pay for other people's abortions.\n  Some have claimed that the amendment restricts abortion coverage even \nfor those who pay for their own plan. That is not true, according to \npolitfact.com, a prize-winning, fact-checking Web site, which looked at \nsimilar claims by a House Member during House debate on the Stupak \namendment. PolitFact found, and I quote:\n\n       First, she suggests the amendment applies to everyone in \n     the private insurance market when it just applies to those in \n     the health care exchange. Second, her statement that the \n     restrictions would affect women ``even when they would pay \n     premiums with their own money'' is incorrect. In fact, women \n     on the exchange who pay the premiums with their own money \n     will be able to get abortion coverage. So we find her \n     statement false.\n\n  The Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment only incorporates the longstanding \nrules of the Hyde amendment, which Congress approved in 1976, to ensure \nthat no Federal funds are used to pay for abortion in the legislation.\n  This standard now applies to Federal health programs covering such \nwide and broad groups as veterans, Federal employees, Native Americans, \nactive-duty servicemembers, and others--all of whom are covered under \nsome form of a Federal health program.\n  Thus, this standard applies to individuals participating in the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, Medicare, Medicaid, Indian Health \nServices, veterans health, and military health care programs.\n  I wish to emphasize another point. All current Federal health \nprograms disallow the use of Federal funds to help pay for health plans \nthat include abortion. Our amendment only continues that established \nFederal policy. Some have said the Hyde amendment already is in effect \nin this bill. But that is not the case at all. The bill says the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services may allow elective abortion\n\n[[Page S12680]]\n\ncoverage in the Community Health Insurance Option--the public option--\nif the Secretary believes there is sufficient segregation of funds to \nensure Federal tax credits are not used to purchase that portion of the \ncoverage.\n  The bill would also require that at least one insurance plan that \ncovers abortion and one that does not cover abortion be offered on \nevery State insurance exchange.\n  Federal legislation establishing a public option that provides \nabortion coverage and Federal legislation allowing States to opt out of \nthe public option that provides abortion coverage eases--let me repeat \nthe word ``eases''--the standards established by the Hyde amendment.\n  The claim that the segregation of funds accomplishes the Hyde intent \nfalls short. Segregation of funds is an accounting gimmick. The reality \nis, taxpayer-supported Federal dollars would help buy insurance \ncoverage that includes covering abortion.\n  I wish to offer some other points about the effect of the Nelson-\nHatch-Casey amendment.\n  Under the amendment, no funds authorized or appropriated by the bill \ncould be used for abortions or for benefits packages that include \nabortion. The amendment would prohibit the use of the affordability tax \ncredits to purchase a health insurance policy that covers abortion. It \nwould also prohibit Federal funding for abortion under the Community \nHealth Insurance Option.\n  In addition, the amendment makes exceptions in the cases of rape or \nincest or in cases of danger to the mother's life.\n  In addition, the amendment allows an individual to use their own \nprivate funds to purchase separate supplemental insurance coverage for \nabortions, perhaps even what is called a rider to an existing plan.\n  The amendment allows an individual whose private health care coverage \nis not subsidized by the Federal Government to purchase or be covered \nby a plan that includes elective abortions, paid for with that \nindividual's own premium dollars.\n  Under the amendment, a private insurer participating in the exchange \ncan offer a plan that includes elective abortion coverage to \nnonsubsidized individuals on the exchange, as long as they also offer \nthe same plan without elective abortion coverage to those who receive \nFederal subsidies.\n  On another point, under Federal law, States are allowed to set their \nown policies concerning abortion. Many States oppose the use of public \nfunds for abortion. Many States have also passed laws that regulate \nabortion by requiring informed consent and waiting periods, requiring \nparental involvement in cases where minors seek abortions, and \nprotecting the rights of health care providers who refuse, as a matter \nof conscience, to assist in abortion.\n  But perhaps most importantly, there is no Federal law, nor is there \nany State law, that requires a private health plan to include abortion \ncoverage. But the bill before us, as written, does.\n  As I have said, the current health care bill we are debating should \nnot be used to open a new avenue for public funding of abortion. We \nshould preserve the current policies, which have stood the test of \ntime, which are supported by most Nebraskans and most Americans. The \nSenate bill, as proposed, goes against that majority public opinion. I \nthink most Americans would prefer that this health care bill remain \nneutral on abortion, not chart a new course providing public funds for \nthe procedure. Public opinion suggests so. So does the fact that over \nthe last 30-plus years Congress has passed new Federal laws that have \nnot broken with precedent.\n  Finally, as President Obama has said, this is a health care reform \nbill. It is not an abortion bill. So it is time to simply extend the \nlongstanding standard disallowing public funding of abortion to new \nproposed Federal legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from California. At \nleast indirectly it is our understanding that Senator Reid will soon \ncome to the floor to speak.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As soon as he comes in, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That would be my request.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, simply put, I believe this amendment \nwould be a harsh and unnecessary step back in health coverage for \nAmerican women.\n  What this amendment would do, as I read it, is to prohibit any health \ninsurance plan that accepts a single government subsidy or dollar from \nproviding coverage for any abortion, no matter how necessary that \nprocedure might be for a woman's health, even if she pays for the \ncoverage herself.\n  The proponents of this amendment say their sole aim is to block \ngovernment funds from being used to cover abortion, but the underlying \nbill already does that. In the bill before us, health plans that opt to \ncover abortion services--in cases other than rape, incest, or when the \nlife of the mother is at stake--must segregate the premium dollars they \nreceive to ensure that only private dollars and not government money is \nused. They argue that segregating funds means nothing--you heard that--\nand that money is fungible. However, this method of separating funds \nfor separate uses is used in many other areas, and there is ample \nprecedent for the provision.\n  For example, charitable choice programs allow agencies that promote \nreligion to receive Federal funds as long as these funds are segregated \nfrom religious activities. We all know that. We see it in program after \nprogram. If these organizations can successfully segregate their \nsources of funding, surely health insurance plans can do the same. \nAdditionally, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must certify \nthat the plan does not use any Federal funding for abortion coverage \nbased on accounting standards created by the GAO.\n  This amendment would place an unprecedented restriction on a woman's \nright to use her own money to purchase health care coverage that would \ncover abortions. Let me give my colleagues one example. Recently, my \nstaff met with a bright, young, married attorney who works for the \nFederal Government. She and her husband desperately wanted to start a \nfamily and were overjoyed to learn she was pregnant. Subsequently she \nlearned the baby she was carrying had anencephaly, a birth defect \nwhereby the majority of the brain does not develop. She was told the \nbaby could not survive outside of the womb. She ended the pregnancy but \nreceived a bill of nearly $9,000. Because she is employed by the \nFederal Government, her insurance policy would not cover the procedure. \nHer physician argued that continuing the pregnancy could have resulted \nin ``dysfunctional labor and postpartum hemorrhage, which can increase \nthe risk for the mother.'' The physician also warned that the \ncomplications could be ``life threatening.''\n  However, OMB found that this circumstance did not meet the narrow \nexception in which a woman's life, not her health, is in danger. The \npatient was told: ``The fetal anomaly presented no medical danger to \nyou,'' despite the admonitions of her physician. The best she could do \nwas to negotiate down the cost to $5,000.\n  Now, this story, without question, is tragic. A very much-wanted \npregnancy could not be continued and, on top of this loss, the family \nwas left with a substantial unpaid medical bill. Health insurance is \ndesigned to protect patients from incurring catastrophic bills \nfollowing a catastrophic medical event. But if this amendment passes, \ninsured women would lose any coverage included in the underlying bill, \neven if she pays for it herself. Why would this body want to do that? I \ncan't support that.\n  A woman's pregnancy may also exacerbate a health condition that was \npreviously under control, or a woman may receive a new diagnosis in the \nmiddle of her pregnancy. It happens. If this amendment passes, women in \nthese circumstances would also learn that their insurance does not \ncover an abortion. In some cases, it may be unclear whether the woman's \nhealth problem meets the strict definition of life endangerment.\n  The National Abortion Federation has compiled calls they receive on\n\n[[Page S12681]]\n\ntheir hotline which are available to women who need assistance \nobtaining abortion care. Let me give you a few examples.\n  Molly was having kidney problems and was in a great deal of pain. She \ncouldn't go to work. She couldn't provide for her two children. When \nshe became pregnant, she made the decision to terminate the pregnancy \nin order to have her kidney removed to begin her recovery. She knew \ncarrying the pregnancy would create additional health problems and \nwould leave her unable to provide for her family.\n  Jamie already had severe health problems when she learned she was \npregnant. She was a severe diabetic and her low blood sugar levels \ncaused her to suffer from seizures. She was unable to continue her \npregnancy but had difficulty affording the procedure.\n  Another was suffering from a serious liver illness when she became \npregnant. Doctors were unsure of the cause, but she was in a great deal \nof pain. She already had two children. She could not care for them \nbecause of this pain. The tests and medications she needed to address \nher medical condition were incompatible with pregnancy.\n  None of these women experienced immediate threats to their lives, so \nunder this amendment their circumstances would not meet the narrow \nexceptions permitted for abortion coverage.\n  This is a problem. How can one say we are going to provide insurance, \nbut we don't like one aspect of it. We don't want the government to pay \nfor it. OK, OK. But the woman herself can't pay for it. That is the \nextra step that this legislation takes.\n  To this day, it is still legal to have an abortion. Women in this \nsituation don't buy insurance for abortion, but they buy a policy that \nmay cover them, married women, should something happen in a pregnancy \nin the third trimester. If they find a baby is without a brain, she can \nhave an abortion, and it is covered.\n  One of the problems with this whole debate is everybody sees \nsomething through their own lens. They don't see the grief and trouble \nand morbidity that is out there and the circumstances that drive a \nwoman to decide--married--she has to terminate her pregnancy for very \ngood medical reasons. Nobody considers that. This is all ideologic, and \nit really, deeply bothers me.\n  So I can only tell my colleagues I very much hope this amendment goes \ndown.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I would like to summarize the \nreasons for and the intent of the amendment that Senator Hatch and the \nPresiding Officer and I, together with others, have proposed to the \nhealth care bill.\n  First of all, I should say the examples our very good friend from \nCalifornia has outlined would not have been covered under the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan either because the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan does not provide abortion coverage for such \ncircumstances.\n  Our amendment mirrors the language that has been offered by \nRepresentative Stupak that was adopted into the House health care bill, \nand we believe it should be applied to the Senate bill as well. As I \nsaid earlier, the issue of abortion certainly prompts strong opinions, \nfierce passions, and deep-seated principles for millions and millions \nof Americans, those who support the procedure and those who don't. But \nour amendment does not take sides on abortion. It is about the use of \ntaxpayer money.\n  The question before us is whether public funds, for the first time in \nmore than three decades, should cover elective abortions. Numerous \npublic opinion polls have shown that most Americans, including a number \nwho support abortion, do not support public funds paying for abortion. \nBut the Senate bill we are debating allows taxpayer dollars, directly \nand indirectly, to pay for insurance plans to cover abortion. That is \nout of step with the majority of Nebraskans and of all Americans.\n\n  Our amendment does not impose new restrictions on women despite what \nsome have claimed, and I respect but strongly disagree with them. We \nare seeking to just apply the same standards to the Senate health care \nbill that already exist for every Federal health program.\n  Our amendment does not add a new restriction, but the bill does add a \nnew relaxation of a Federal standard that has worked well for more than \n30 years. Under our amendment, abortion isn't limited, nor would people \nbe prevented from buying insurance on the private market covering \nabortion with their own money.\n  Our amendment only ensures that where taxpayer money enters the \npicture, people are not required to pay for people's abortions.\n  The Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment incorporates the longstanding \nstandard established by the Hyde amendment which Congress approved in \n1976. Today it applies to every Federal health program. That includes \nplans that cover veterans, Federal employees, including Members of \nCongress, Native Americans, Active-Duty servicemembers, and a whole \nhost of others.\n  Some people have called our amendment radical. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. It is reasonable. It is rational because it \nfollows established Federal law. It is right. Taxpayers shouldn't be \nrequired to pay for people's abortions. It is just that simple.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there were 45,000 funerals in America this \nyear. These funerals, 45,000 in number, stood out from all the rest. \nWhy? They were tearful, as all funerals are. They filled loved ones \nwith sorrow and grief, as many of us know firsthand. But these 45,000 \nfunerals were avoidable. That is why they were more tragic than most, \nbecause 45,000 times this year--nearly 900 times a week, more than 120 \ntimes each day, about every 10 minutes in America, every day, without \nend--someone dies as a direct result of not having health insurance.\n  That is a sickening number. You would have to be heartless not to be \nhorrified. It doesn't even include those who did have health insurance \nbut died because it was not enough to meet their most basic needs. That \nis what this is all about.\n  But it is not even just about death. How many citizens in each of our \nStates are bankrupt and broke because of a broken health care system? \nHow many have to choose between their mother's chemotherapy and their \ndaughter's college tuition? How many have to work two or three jobs to \nprovide for a family they never have time to see, all because of an \naccident they had or an illness they acquired that some insurance big \nshot calls a preexisting condition.\n  So many of these tragedies could be prevented. If our Nation truly \nvalues the sanctity of life, as I believe it does, we will do \neverything we can to prevent them. That is why we are pushing so hard \nto make it possible for every American to afford good health. That is \nwhy we cannot take no for an answer, and that is why we will not let \nthe American people down.\n  That value is also evident in the amendment before us. As some know, \nfor many years--nearly 28 years as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, of the Senate, and as majority leader--I have \nconsistently cast my vote against abortion.\n  To me, it is not about partisanship of any kind or political points \nor even polling data. To me, it is a matter of conscience.\n  I might not be the loudest on this topic, but that doesn't make my \nbeliefs any less strong. I might oppose abortion, but that does not \nmean I am opposed to finding common ground for the benefit of the \ngreater good. We can find common ground.\n  My belief in the sanctity of life is why I have repeatedly voted \nagainst using taxpayer money for abortion. It is why I have repeatedly \nvoted against covering abortions in Federal employees health insurance \nplans and repeatedly voted against allowing Federal facilities to be \nused for abortions.\n  But I recognize abortion is an emotional issue. Many Senators in this\n\n[[Page S12682]]\n\nbody disagree, as many citizens in the country disagree, on the issue. \nBut divisive issues don't have to divide us. There is value in finding \ncommon ground.\n  Among this institution's immortals is Senator Henry Clay, who worked \nunder the premise that, as he said:\n\n       All legislation is founded upon the principle of mutual \n     concession.\n\n  It is in that spirit that I have been able to work with my colleagues \nto my left and to my right--Congressmen and Senators who are pro-life, \nsuch as I am, and those who are pro-choice. One of the ways I have done \nthis is by trying to reduce the rate and number of unintended \npregnancies.\n  Our great country leads the world in many ways. But this area is not \none in which we take much pride. The United States has one of the \nhighest rates of unintended pregnancies among all industrialized \nnations, and that is an understatement. Half of all pregnancies in \nAmerica--every other one--is unintended. Of those, more than half \nresult in abortions.\n  I have worked to stop this problem before it starts. In 1997, Senator \nOlympia Snowe and I started the first of many efforts to improve access \nto contraception. We said health plans should treat prescription \ncontraception the same way it treats other prescription medications. We \neven passed a law that ensures that Federal employees have access to \ncontraception. This proves what is possible when Senators have \ndifferent backgrounds, both of good faith, work with each other rather \nthan against each other.\n  In this case, a pro-life Democrat and a pro-choice Republican \nfollowed common sense and found common ground. I have always been \nappreciative of Senator Snowe for her cooperation and her courage. I \ncontinue, to this day, to be grateful.\n  Let's not forget that the historic bill before this body will \ncontinue those efforts. By making sure that all Americans can get good \nhealth care, we will reduce the number of unintended pregnancies at the \nroot of this issue. That is a goal both Democrats and Republicans can \nagree is worthwhile.\n  Let's talk about current law and this bill. In that and many other \nrespects, this bill is a good, strong, and historic one. It is a bill \nthat will affect the lives of every single American, and it will do so \nfor the better. It will--as you have heard me say many times--save \nlives, save money, and save Medicare.\n  But you have also heard me say this bill deserves to go through the \nlegislative process. That process includes amendments. It warrants \nadditions, subtractions, and modifications, as the Senate sees fit. \nThis is an appropriate process, one that has served this body well for \nmore than two centuries.\n  The amendment before us today, offered by Senator Nelson of Nebraska, \nwould make dramatic changes in current law in America. It is worth \nexamining what that law says, how this bill would treat it and what \nthis amendment would require in addition and then evaluating whether it \nimproves the overall effort.\n  As current law dictates, not a single taxpayer dollar--not one--can \nbe used to pay for an abortion. There are very few--but very serious--\nexceptions to this rule: Those are explicitly limited to cases in which \nthe life of the mother is in danger and when the pregnancy is the \nresult of rape or incest.\n  This law is called the Hyde amendment. It has been on the books since \nthe late Republican Congressman Henry Hyde wrote it in 1976. I have \ngreat respect for Henry Hyde, and I recall with fondness how this \nIllinois Republican Congressman came to Nevada and campaigned for me. \nWe worked together at a time when a Republican could campaign for a \nDemocrat and vice versa and not fear retribution and condemnation from \nhis own party.\n  When we drafted the health reform bill now under consideration, we \nworked hard to come up with a compromise between pro-life and pro-\nchoice Senators. On one side, there are some Senators who don't believe \nabortion should be legal, let alone mentioned in any health plan. On \nthe other side, there are Senators who don't want a woman's access to \nlegal abortion to depend on which health plan she could afford, and \nthey wanted that reflected in this bill.\n  So legislating in pursuit of mutual concession, as Senator Clay \nadvised, we struck a compromise. It is a compromise that recognizes \npeople of good faith can have different beliefs, and instead of trying \nto settle the sensitive question of abortion rights in this bill, we \nfound a fair middle ground.\n  That compromise is, we maintain current law. We are faithful to the \nHyde amendment, which has been in place now for 33 years. Let me be \nclear. As our bill currently reads, no insurance plans in the new \nmarketplace we create--whether private or public--would be allowed to \nuse taxpayer money for abortion, beyond the limits of existing law.\n  But we don't stop there. The bill takes special care to keep public \nand private dollars separate to make sure that happens. This isn't a \nnew concept. It is worth noting this practice of segregating money is \nconsistent with other existing rules that make sure the public doesn't \npay for things it shouldn't. It is consistent with the existing \nMedicaid practice that gives States the option of covering abortion \nalso at their expense. It mirrors practices already in place to \nseparate church and State by ensuring money the Federal Government \ngives religious organizations is not used for religious practices. So \nwe are not reinventing the wheel.\n\n  Just as current law demands, the bill respects the conscience of both \nindividual health care providers and health care facilities. And once \nagain, it goes further. Our bill not only safeguards a long list of \nFederal laws regarding conscience protections and refusal rights, it \neven outlaws discrimination against those health care providers and \nfacilities with moral and religious objections to abortion. That means \nif a doctor does not believe it is right to perform an abortion, he or \nshe can say no, no questions asked. Health care facilities such as \nCatholic hospitals, which are the largest nongovernment, nonprofit \nhealth care providers in the country, would continue to have the same \nright to refuse to perform abortions.\n  Under our bill, at least one plan that does not cover abortion \nservices will have to be offered in each exchange so no one will be \nforced to enroll in a plan that covers abortion services. This is an \nimprovement since the current marketplace does not provide a similar \nguarantee.\n  It is clear that the current bill does not expand or restrict \nanyone's access to abortion, period. It does not force any health plans \nto cover abortion or prohibit them from doing so, period. Why? Because \nthis bill is about access to health care, not access to abortions.\n  I have great respect for Senator Ben Nelson. His integrity and \nindependence reflect on the Nebraskans he represents. His strong \nbeliefs are rooted in his strong values. But he shows, better than \nmost, that one can be steadfast without being stubborn. Senator Nelson \nhas always been a gentleman whose consideration is the true portrait of \nhow a Senator should conduct oneself.\n  I mentioned that our underlying bill leaves current law where it is. \nThis amendment, however, does not. It goes further than the standard \nthat has guided this country for 33 years. It would place limits not \nonly on taxpayer money, which I support, but also on private money. \nAgain, current law already forbids Federal funds from paying for \nabortions, and our bill does not weaken that rule one bit. I believe \ncurrent law is sufficient, and I do not believe we need to go further. \nSpecifically, I do not believe the Senate needs to go as far as this \namendment would take us. No one should use the health care bill to \nexpand or restrict abortion, and no one should use the issue of \nabortion to rob millions of the opportunity to get good health care.\n  This is not the right place for this debate. We have to get on with \nthe larger issue at hand. We have to keep moving toward the finish line \nand cannot be distracted by detours or derailed by diversions.\n  Our health reform bill now before this body respects life. I started \nby saying I believe in the sanctity of life. But my strong belief is \nthat value does not end when a child is born; it continues throughout \nthe lifetime of every person.\n  With this bill, nearly every American will be able to afford the care \nthey need to stay healthy or care for a loved one. It respects life.\n\n[[Page S12683]]\n\n  Those who today have nowhere to turn will soon have security against \nwhat President Harry Truman called ``the economic effects of \nsickness.'' It respects life.\n  Those who suffer from disease, from injury, or from disability will \nno longer be told by claims adjustors they never met that they are on \ntheir own. It respects life.\n  It will help seniors afford every prescription drug they need so they \ndo not have to decide which pills to skip and which pills to split. It \nrespects life.\n  It will stop terrible illnesses before they start and stop Americans \nfrom dying of diseases we know how to treat. It respects life.\n  We will stop terrible abuses, such as insurance companies looking at \nearnings reports instead of your doctor's report and charging rates \nthat make the health we want a luxury. It respects life.\n  We will ensure the most vulnerable and the least prosperous among us \ncan afford to go to a doctor when they are sick or hurt, not to the \nemergency room where the rest of us pick up the bill. It respects life.\n  This bill recognizes that health care is a human right. This bill \nrespects life.\n  The issue in this amendment is not the only so-called moral issue in \nthis debate. The ability of all Americans to afford and get the access \nto care they need to stay healthy is also a question of morality.\n  The reason I oppose abortion and the reason I support the historic \nbill is the same: I respect the sanctity of life.\n  This is a health care bill. It is not an abortion bill. We cannot \nafford to miss the big picture. It is bigger than any one issue. \nNeither this amendment nor any other should be something that \novershadows the entire bill or overwhelms the entire process.\n  Throughout my entire public career, I voted my conscience on the \nsubject of abortion. As I said, that decision is based on something \npersonal with me. My vote today will also honor another principle I \nbelieve to my very core and that I will believe until my very last day \non Earth: We must make it possible for every American to afford a \nhealthy life.\n  I believe the compromise in our current bill and the current bill \nitself fully fulfill both of these moral imperatives. And I believe \nwhen we are given the trust of our neighbors, friends, relatives, the \nprivilege to lead the opportunity to improve others' lives, we cannot \nturn our backs. We cannot turn our backs on the tens of millions of \nAmericans who have no health insurance at all--none--not thousands, not \nhundreds, not millions but tens of millions. We cannot turn our backs \non the many who do but live one accident, one illness, or one pink slip \naway from losing that insurance they have.\n  One of the most cherished charters this Nation has, drafted by one of \nour most beloved leaders, declared life to be the first among several \nof our absolute rights. Jefferson put it even before liberty, even \nbefore the pursuit of happiness--life.\n  If we still truly value life in America--and I believe we do--if we \nstill truly value the life of every American, we cannot turn our backs \non the 14,000 of us who lose health coverage every single day of every \nweek of every month of every year in this country--no weekends off, no \nvacations. How many of the thousands of men, women, and children who \ntoday will be kicked out in the cold will next year become one of the \ntens of thousands who die because of it? If we value the sanctity of \nlife, as I know we do, and fix what is broken, as I know we must, we \nwill not have to find out.\n  I believe in this bill and what it will do for our country for \ngenerations to come, what it will do for our constituents, my children, \nmy grandchildren, and their children and their grandchildren. I will \nnot support efforts to undermine this historic legislation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Nelson-Hatch amendment No. 2962; \nthat regardless of the outcome of the vote with respect to that \namendment, there be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to \nthe McCain motion to commit, equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the McCain motion to commit; the McCain \nmotion be subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold; that if the \nmotion achieves that threshold, then it be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that if it does not achieve that \nthreshold, then it be withdrawn; and that no amendment be in order to \nthe motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the \nmotion to commit offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the McCain motion to commit on Medicare \nAdvantage would keep overpayments in the Medicare Advantage program, \neven though the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission recommends that \nthey be eliminated.\n  The McCain motion to commit is a tax on all seniors. It would \nmaintain the overpayments to private insurers and require beneficiaries \nto pay higher Part B premiums. The average couple pays $90 per year \njust so insurers can reap greater profits under Medicare.\n  The McCain amendment is a raid on the Medicare trust fund. MA \noverpayments take 18 months off the life of the Part A trust fund. And \naccording to MedPAC, there is no evidence of greater quality of care. \nIn fact, MedPAC told Congress this year that ``only some'' MA plans are \nof high quality. MedPAC finds that ``only half of beneficiaries \nnationwide have access to a plan that Medicare rates above average on \noverall plan quality.''\n  The more than 45 million seniors with Medicare deserve better. They \ndo not deserve to subsidize high profits of private insurers. And the \nmore than 11 million Medicare beneficiaries who choose to enroll in \nprivate plans also deserve better. They deserve plans that coordinate \ncare. Most plans today do not. They deserve plans that are of high \nquality. Many plans today do not.\n  If Senators want to help beneficiaries, they will vote to eliminate \noverpayments under Medicare Advantage. And they should vote against the \nMcCain motion.\n\n[[Page S12684]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is about an earmark. It is \nabout a special deal cut for a special group of people who happen to \nreside in the State of Florida. I am never so presumptuous. I have lost \ntoo many votes trying to eliminate earmarks. But what I am trying to do \nis allow every American citizen who is enrolled in Medicare Advantage \nto have the same protection of their Medicare Advantage Program as the \nSenator from Florida has carved out in this bill. That is all it is \nabout. It is about equality. It is about not letting one special group \nof people who reside in a particular State get a better deal than those \nwho live in the rest of the country. That is all this amendment is \nabout.\n  It will probably be voted down on a party-line vote. But what you \nhave done is you have allowed a carve-out for a few hundred thousand \npeople in the State of Florida and have disallowed the other 11 million \nwho have Medicare Advantage from having their health care cut. That is \nwhat this is all about.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe presentation by the Senator from Texas that I be recognized to \noffer an amendment, and following that Senator Crapo be recognized to \noffer an amendment, and Senator Crapo, I believe, wishes to speak 2 or \n3 minutes, and following that then I would be recognized as well for a \npresentation on the amendment I have offered, and following my \npresentation, the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, would be \nrecognized, and Senator Kaufman would be recognized as part of the \ncolloquy with Senator Klobuchar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we have spent the last few days \nhighlighting how this health care reform bill is paid for by cutting \nbenefits to seniors, jeopardizing their access to care. Almost $500 \nbillion will be cut from the Medicare Program.\n  But this bill also imposes $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes. These are \ntaxes that hit every American and virtually every health care business \nor related business in the country.\n  During an economic downturn, this approach is counterintuitive. These \ntaxes will discourage investment and hiring. We are in one of the worst \neconomic downturns in the history of our country. We do not need to \ntell anybody that. We are all feeling it. We know people who are \nsuffering right now.\n  I look at what has been done in the past when we have had economic \ndownturns, and I look at President Kennedy, President Reagan, President \nBush. They lowered taxes. What happened? The economy was spurred. Lower \ntaxes have proven to spur the economy. Yet in this bill we see $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in new taxes on families and small businesses.\n  Let's walk through some of these taxes.\n  Employer taxes. Madam President, $28 billion in new taxes is imposed \non businesses that do not provide health insurance to their employees. \nTo avoid the tax, an employer has to provide the right kind of \ninsurance--insurance that the Federal Government approves. It is going \nto be a certain percentage and have certain coverage requirements. \nEmployers who do not provide the right kind of insurance could see a \npenalty as high as $3,000 per employee.\n  We should be encouraging people to hire in this kind of environment. \nThat should be job No. 1: creating jobs.\n  Yet imposing taxes and fines are what is in this bill, and that is \nnot going to encourage hiring; it is going to discourage hiring. That \nis economics 101.\n  Individual taxes: There are $8 billion in taxes for those who don't \npurchase insurance on their own. The tax is $750 per person. Again, \nbecause you are insured today does not mean you will avoid the tax. You \nmust have the right kind of insurance--insurance that the Federal \nGovernment approves and says is the right amount of insurance.\n  How about the taxes on high-benefit plans? There are $149 billion in \ntaxes on health insurance plans that the Federal Government says are \ntoo robust. These high-benefit plans--Cadillac plans some call them--\nwould be subject to a 40-percent excise tax. To make it worse, the tax \nis not indexed, so it is a new AMT, a new alternative minimum tax that \neveryone says was not supposed to encroach on lower income people, but, \nin fact, it has because it is not indexed for inflation.\n  So here we are. In this bill, you get taxed if you don't provide \nenough benefits and you get taxed if you provide too many benefits. So \nthis is beginning to sound like government-run health care to me, and I \ncan only imagine how the unions feel because they are the ones that \nhave these high-benefit plans and here they are under fire because they \nhave too much coverage.\n  Medicare payroll tax: This is the new payroll tax that is imposed on \nindividuals making more than $200,000 and couples making more than \n$250,000. That tax raises another $54 billion. This additional payroll \ntax is a marriage penalty. It is not indexed to inflation, meaning it \nis another AMT in the making because today, that may sound high--\n$200,000 and $250,000--but it is a huge marriage penalty, and it could \nbegin then to go down in numbers so that more and more people are \naffected.\n  This body voted unanimously during the budget debate--unanimously--\nthat a point of order would be made against legislation that would \nimpose a marriage penalty in the budget. So we have voted unanimously \nthat a budget point of order would stand if there is a marriage penalty \nin the budget. So now here we are a few months later, and the majority \nis not only retreating from the opposition to the marriage penalty, but \nwe now have for the first time in our Tax Code--or will when this bill \npasses--a payroll tax marriage penalty. How on Earth can we do that?\n  I am going to fight this marriage penalty, and I hope the Senate will \nvote against this concept. It is a new precedent that could be set in \nother areas that would say if you are married, you are going to get \nfewer benefits than if you are single. That is not a precedent we ought \nto be setting.\n\n[[Page S12685]]\n\n  Then there is the medical deduction cap. There is a change in our Tax \nCode that would limit the itemized deduction for medical expenses. We \nhave always had one that said if your medical expenses go above 7.5 \npercent of your income, that you would be able to deduct anything above \nthat. This bill increases that threshold to 10 percent so that if you \nare going to get deductions--and this is going to affect people who \nhave catastrophic accidents, really, really high medical bills, \ndebilitating health conditions, or very, very expensive medicine--if \nyou go above 7.5 percent today, you would be able to deduct. But in \nthis bill, it is going to be 10 percent of your income before the \ngovernment is going to allow you to deduct these added expenses.\n  Then there is the drug, device, and insurance company taxes: $60 \nbillion in taxes assessed to insurance companies, $22 billion to \nprescription drug manufacturers, and $20 billion on medical device \nmanufacturers. The experts have said, all of the economists have said \nthese taxes will be paid by the public. Of course they are going to be \npassed on: higher premiums for every insurance policy that is already \nthere, and higher prices for medications and medical equipment.\n  So medications you take for diabetes or heart disease, medications or \nmedical devices that you need to fight cancer would all become more \nexpensive because every one of them would have a higher cost because \nthe company is going to pay an added fee just for producing these \nmedicines and equipment.\n  So many people today are struggling with their medical bills. They \nare struggling to fill prescriptions. Why aren't we bringing costs \ndown? Isn't medical cost part of the reason for reform because the \ncosts are going up? Wasn't the point of reform to bring the costs down \nso more people would have affordable options for health care coverage? \nWhat happened to that? All of these taxes on individuals and businesses \nare going to drive prices and costs up.\n  In closing, the bill before us imposes $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes \nat a time when unemployment is soaring and our economy is struggling. \nWe have $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to Medicare which is going to severely \nhurt our senior citizens and their access to health care, and then $\\1/\n2\\ trillion in tax increases, taxing marriage, taxing Tylenol, taxing \nhigh-benefit plans, taxing low-benefit plans, taxes if you offer \nemployee health care coverage, and taxes if you offer not quite enough. \nThis is a tax-and-spend bill.\n  Republicans have repeatedly put forward ideas that would reform our \nhealth system, bring the costs down without burdening our employers \nwith more taxes that would keep them from helping our economy by hiring \nmore people; ideas that would increase competition and transparency and \nensure access to affordable care.\n  So I hope while our colleagues are meeting to try to get their 60 \nvotes--which we know they are--that maybe they might consider bringing \neverybody into this process and listening to other ideas that would not \nbe a government takeover of our health care system; that would not be \nmore government mandates, more taxes, cuts from Medicare services. This \nis a recipe for disaster for our country, and I hope it is not too late \nfor the Democratic majority to say: OK, let's get together and try to \nput together a bipartisan plan that will not hurt the quality of health \ncare that Americans have known and expected in our country, one that \nwill bring costs down and make health care more affordable, one that \nwill give carrots to our employers not sticks that will switch them if \nthey don't have the right kind of coverage or the government-approved \ncoverage or the right percentage of coverage.\n  We can do better and I hope we will.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I have a motion at the desk which I wish \nto call up and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo] moves to commit the bill \n     H.R. 3590 to the Committee on Finance with instructions to \n     report the same back to the Senate with changes that \n     provide that no provision of this Act shall result in an \n     increase in Federal tax liability for individuals with \n     adjusted gross income of less than $200,000 and married \n     individuals with adjusted gross income of less than \n     $250,000.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you, Madam President.\n  As the motion which has just been read clearly states, this motion \nwould be to commit this bill to the Finance Committee for the Finance \nCommittee to do one simple thing, and that is to make the bill conform \nto President Barack Obama's pledge to the American people about health \ncare reform and who would pay for health care reform.\n  In a speech he has given in a number of different places, President \nObama has very clearly stated:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge . . . no family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase . . . not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes. You will not see any of your taxes \n     increase one single dime.\n\n  All this motion does is to commit this bill to the Finance Committee \nto have the Finance Committee assure that its provisions comply with \nthis pledge.\n  Now, why would we want to do that? I think most Americans are very \naware today that this bill comes at a huge price. There are $2.5 \ntrillion of new Federal spending, $2.5 trillion of new Federal spending \nthat is offset, if you will, by about $500 billion worth of cuts in \nMedicare and $493 billion worth of cuts in the first 10 years are tax \nincreases, $1.2 trillion of tax increases in the first real 10 years of \nthe full implementation of the bill. There is no question but that much \nof the tax increase that is included in this bill to pay for this \nmassive increase in Federal spending will come squarely from people in \nthe United States who make less than $250,000 as a family or less than \n$200,000 as individuals.\n  All we need to do is to go through this bill to see that by the \nanalysis we have made so far, it appears that at least 42 million \nhouseholds in America will pay a portion of this $1.2 trillion in new \ntaxes, people who are under these income levels to whom President Obama \nmade the pledge.\n  I will have a greater opportunity tomorrow to discuss this motion in \nmore detail. Tonight I just had a few minutes to make the introduction \nand to call up the motion, and we will then get into a fuller \ndiscussion on how this bill provides a heavy tax burden on the middle \nclass of this country in direct violation of the President's pledge.\n  So as I conclude, I would simply say this is a very simple amendment. \nWe can debate about whether the bill does or does not increase taxes--I \nthink that is absolutely clear--on those in the middle class. But all \nthe motion would do is to commit this bill to the Finance Committee to \nhave the Finance Committee make the bill comport with the President's \npledge.\n  I will conclude by just reading his pledge one more time. The \nPresident, in his words, said:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge . . . no family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase . . . not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes. . . . you will not see any of your \n     taxes increase one single dime.\n\n\n[[Page S12686]]\n\n\n  That is what this motion accomplishes.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the amendment I have offered with many \ncolleagues--over 30 colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, a bipartisan \nlegislation--deals with the issue of prescription drugs; specifically, \nthe importation of FDA-approved drugs that the American people would be \nable to access for a fraction of the price they are charged in this \ncountry.\n  The American people are paying the highest prices in the world for \nbrand-name prescription drugs.\n  It is not even close. Let me just show the first chart. I have many. \nI will show the first one to describe what brings me to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Here are prices for Lipitor. There are so many people who take \nLipitor that they probably ought to put it in the water supply--the \nmost popular cholesterol-lowering drug in America, perhaps in the \nworld. Here is what the American people pay for an equivalent quantity: \n$125. The same quantity costs $40 in Britain, $32 in Spain, $63 in the \nNetherlands, $48 in Germany, $53 in France, and $33 in Canada. Once \nagain, it is $125 to the American consumer.\n  Here are the two bottles for Lipitor. It is made in Ireland by an \nAmerican company and then sent around the world. This happened to go to \nCanada, and this went to the United States. It is the same pill, same \nbottle, same company, made at the same manufacturing plant, and it is \nFDA approved. Difference? The American consumer gets to pay three to \nfour times higher cost. Fair? Not for me.\n  That is what this amendment is about. This amendment is about \nfreedom, giving the American people the freedom in the global economy \nto buy the same FDA-approved drug from those countries that have an \nidentical chain of custody as we do in this country, so an FDA-approved \ndrug sold for a fraction of the price--why should we prevent the \nAmerican people from being able to exercise and see the same savings \nevery other consumer in the world sees?\n  Let me see whether anybody recognizes this. Prescription drugs are a \nsignificant part of our lives. We are bombarded with ads every single \nday. Let me show a demonstration of the push for consumption of \nprescription drugs at the highest brand-name prices in the world.\n  On television, Sally Field says to us--and I have seen it many \nmornings when I am brushing my teeth--she says this:\n\n       I always thought calcium, vitamin D, and exercise would \n     keep my bones healthy. But I got osteoporosis anyway, so my \n     doctor started me on once-a-month Boniva. And he told me \n     something important: Boniva works with your body to help stop \n     and reverse bone loss.\n       My test results proved I was able to stop and reverse my \n     bone loss with Boniva. And studies show that after one year, \n     9 out of 10 women did, too.\n       I've got this one body and this one life, so I wanted to \n     stop my bone loss. But I did more than that; I reversed it \n     with Boniva.\n       Ask your doctor if Boniva is right for you.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Some of us need help falling asleep. Some of us need help \n     staying asleep. A good night's sleep doesn't have to be an \n     on/off thing anymore.\n       From the makers of the most prescribed name in sleep \n     medicine comes controlled release Ambien CR. It's the only \n     one with two layers of sleep relief.\n       Ambien CR is a treatment you and your doctor can consider \n     along with lifestyle changes and can be taken for as long as \n     your health care provider recommends.\n       So ask your health care provider about Ambien CR, for a \n     good night's sleep from start to finish.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Does your restless mind keep you from sleeping? Do you lie \n     awake exhausted? Well, maybe it's time to ask whether Lunesta \n     is right for you.\n       For a limited time, you're invited to take the 7-night \n     Lunesta challenge. Ask your doctor how to get 7 nights of \n     Lunesta free and see if it's the sleep aid you've been \n     looking for.\n       Get your coupon at Lunesta.com and ask your doctor today.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       They're running the men's room marathon, with lots of guys \n     going over and over. And here's the dash to the men's room \n     with lots of guys going urgently. Then there's a night game \n     waking up to go.\n       These guys should be in a race to see their doctors. Those \n     symptoms could be signs of BPH or enlarged prostate. Waking \n     up to go, starting and stopping, going urgently, incomplete \n     emptying, weak stream, going over and over, straining.\n       For many guys, prescription Flomax reduces urinary symptoms \n     associated with BPH in one week. Only a doctor can tell if \n     you have BPH and not a more serious condition like prostate \n     cancer.\n       Call 1-877-FLOMAX to see if Flomax works for you and to see \n     if you qualify for $40 off your prescription.\n       For many men, Flomax can make a difference in one week.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       There are moments you look forward to, and you shouldn't \n     have to miss out on them. Sometimes a bladder control problem \n     can cause unwanted interruptions. It doesn't have to be that \n     way. Overactive bladder is a treatable medical condition.\n       Enablex is a medication that can help reduce bladder leaks \n     and accidents for a full 24 hours. Ask your doctor about \n     Enablex.\n\n  Well, I have a couple dozen more.\n  Most people understand what this is because they have heard them \nall--things like: Go ask your doctor if the purple pill is right for \nyou. They don't have the foggiest idea what a purple pill is for. They \nthink that with all these scenes of trees and green grass and \nconvertible cars and pillow clouds in the sky, if life is like that \nwhen you are on the purple pill, give me some purple pills. I mean, \nthat is what this advertising is all about.\n  I don't mean to make light or fun of all of it. Prescription drugs \nare important in people's lives. I understand that. But you know what, \nyou can only get a prescription drug if your doctor prescribes it and \nbelieves you need it. These advertisements are telling people sitting \nat home watching a television program tonight that you need to get up \nand go talk to your doctor and see if you don't need some of these \npills. It is trying to create consumer demand for something you can get \nonly because a doctor believes you should have it.\n  Well, that is where we are now with prescription drugs in our \ncountry. A lot of people are taking prescription drugs. A lot of these \ndrugs are miracle drugs, and they allow people to stay out of a \nhospital. They don't have to be in an acute-care hospital bed if they \nmanage the disease--whether it is high blood pressure, high \ncholesterol--with medicine. That is good, and I understand that. But \nthis consumer demand-driven urge for prescription drugs is pretty \nunbelievable. Go talk to a doctor and ask that doctor what happens \nevery single day in the doctor's office. Somebody is coming in and \nsaying: I wonder if I shouldn't be taking some of this medicine. I read \nabout it or saw the advertisement about this. I wonder if I shouldn't \nbe taking some of it. It is quite a deal.\n  You produce all of this demand with dramatic amounts of marketing, \npromotion, and advertising, and then you jack up the price and keep it \nup. The question is, Who can afford these prescription drugs? Who can \nafford them?\n  So that is what brings me to the floor of the Senate today saying \nthat when the American people are charged the highest prices for brand-\nname drugs--and this year, it goes up close to 10 percent once again in \nprice--at a time when we have almost no inflation, isn't that pricing \nprescription drugs out of the reach of too many Americans?\n  We are now talking about health care reform. There is nothing in any \nof this legislation in the House or the Senate that addresses this \nquestion of the steep and relentless price increases on prescription \ndrugs. There is nothing in any of this legislation that does that. The \nquestion is, Shouldn't we be addressing this as well?\n  I talked about Lipitor. Let me show you Plavix. Do you see the U.S. \nprice? The U.S. consumer pays the highest prices in the world.\n  Here is Nexium. If you want to buy that, you get to pay $424 in the \nUnited States, and it is $41--one-tenth the price--in England, $36 in \nSpain, and $37 in Germany. The question is this: If Nexium is an FDA-\napproved drug--and it is--made in plants approved by our FDA--and it \nis--why should an American citizen not be able to access this drug from \nhere, from here, and from here? It is because the pharmaceutical \nindustry doesn't want them to. They have had enough friends here to \nkeep in place a law that prevents the American people from reimporting \nthese drugs. That is why.\n  That is what this amendment is about. This amendment says: Give the \nAmerican people the freedom to access\n\n[[Page S12687]]\n\nFDA-approved drugs where they are sold at a fraction of the price.\n  Madam President, there is a lot to talk about, and I will describe a \nnumber of circumstances that have brought us to this point.\n  This is the place for this amendment--not some other place; this is \nthe place. It is about health care. We have been told over and over \nagain that our problem is that health care is consuming too large a \nportion of the GDP of this country--roughly 17.3 percent, I believe. \nAll right, part of health care--not the largest part but one of the \nfastest growing parts is prescription drugs. So if the issue is that \nhealth care is rising in cost relentlessly and consuming too large a \nportion of our GDP because we spend much more on health care than \nanybody else in the world by far--it is not even close--if that is the \ncase and if one of the fastest rising areas of health care is drug \ncosts, then why would legislation that leaves this Chamber or the House \nof Representatives not include something that addresses these \nunbelievable price increases for prescription drugs? How is it that we \nwould allow that to happen? I don't know how we got to this point \nwithout having it in the bill, but I aim to try to put it in.\n  I understand, by the way, that there is tremendous pushback by the \npharmaceutical industry. If I had the sweetheart deal they have, I \nwould fight to the finish to try to keep it. I understand that.\n  By the way, let me just say, as I have always said and nobody hears \nit very much--certainly the pharmaceutical industry will never hear \nthis--that some of the things the pharmaceutical industry does for this \ncountry are laudable. I say, good for you. They talk about the \nprescription drugs they produce. Good for them. A substantial portion \nof that comes from research we have done and paid for at the National \nInstitutes of Health with taxpayer funds. But that doesn't matter to \nme. That information ought to be available to the pharmaceutical \nindustry--and it is--so they can produce these new miracle drugs. I \ncommend them.\n  My beef is not that they produce pharmaceutical drugs that help \npeople. I am all for that. My beef is the way they price those drugs, \nsaying to the American people: You will pay the highest prices in the \nworld, and there is nothing you can do about it. It is their pricing \npolicy. It is just not fair.\n  How many in this Chamber have visited with somebody at a town meeting \nsomeplace--I have--and they come up to you--in this case, an elderly \nwoman who was close to 80 touched me gently on the elbow and said, \n``Senator Dorgan, can you help me?'' She was talking about how many \nprescription drugs she had to take, how little money she had to pay for \nthem, and how she always had to try to determine what her rent cost was \nand how much groceries she could buy to determine how much she had left \nto pay for prescription drugs. How many people have said to you: Yes, I \ntake the drugs my doctor asks me to take, but I cut them in half \nbecause I cannot afford the whole dose. We have all heard that. So the \nquestion is, Are we going to do something about it?\n  This is a chart that shows price increases in 2009. Enbrel, for \narthritis, is up 12 percent. Singulair, for asthma, is up 12 percent. \nBoniva is up 18 percent. Nexium is up 7 percent.\n  I want to talk a bit about the issue of drug prices versus inflation. \nThis chart shows what has happened to the price of prescription drugs, \nthe red line, and the inflation rate in this country, the yellow line. \nIt describes why it is urgent that we do something, why we cannot allow \na health reform bill to leave this Chamber and do nothing about the \nissue of prescription drugs. We must at least address this question of \nwhether the American people should not have the freedom to access these \nidentical drugs where they are sold elsewhere for a fraction of the \nprice.\n  This year, there was a 9.3-percent increase in brand-name \nprescription drug prices, at a time when inflation is going down. We \nhave had deflation. That is not justifiable.\n  Madam President, I know we are going to have a lot of debate here in \nthe Chamber about a lot of things. I will describe tomorrow morning, \nwhen I speak, that 40 percent of the active ingredients in U.S. \nprescription drugs currently come from India and China. And they are \nworried about somebody from Sioux Falls, SD, buying prescription drugs \nfrom Winnipeg. Are you kidding me? Again, 40 percent of the active \ningredients in U.S. prescription drugs currently come from India and \nChina. In most cases, the places those active ingredients come from \nhave never been inspected.\n  I will talk about that, but I am not going to go into it tonight. I \nwill talk about a number of issues related to drug safety of the \nexisting drug supply and how what we have included in this legislation \nwith respect to pedigree, batch lots and track and trace will \ndramatically improve the existing drug supply in our country and make \ncertain we prevent safety problems coming from the importation of \ndrugs.\n  I am going to speak about this at some length tomorrow. But I just \nreceived a letter from the head of the FDA, Margaret Hamburg, who \nraises some questions about the amendment. I am not going to read the \nletter into the Record. I will talk more about it tomorrow.\n  I must say, I am in some ways surprised by the letter and in some \nways not surprised at all. Surprised, because this administration, \nPresident Obama, was a cosponsor of this legislation last year in the \nSenate--a cosponsor of my legislation. He was part of a bipartisan \ngroup that believed the American people ought to have this right and \nbelieved we could put together a piece of legislation that has \nsufficient safety capabilities and, in fact, dramatically enhances the \nsafety of our existing drug supply.\n  I am going to show tomorrow that the existing drug supply has all \nkinds of issues. I will show batch lots of existing drugs that have \ngone through strip joints, in the back room in coolers, and distributed \nout of strip joints. I am going to talk about that. But, first, I wish \nto say I was surprised to get this letter because both the President \nand the Chief of Staff at the White House were a cosponsor in the \nSenate and a leader in the House for reimportation of prescription \ndrugs.\n  I called the head of the FDA yesterday afternoon about this time and \nsaid: I have heard rumors that there was a letter coming to Capitol \nHill on this issue. She told me she was not aware of such a letter. \nTwenty-four hours later, apparently she is aware of that letter because \nshe signed it. I am interested in where it was written, but that is \nanother subject I will save for tomorrow as well.\n  We will be told, as we have been so often, that if you allow the \nAmerican people to buy prescription drugs that are FDA approved from \nelsewhere, it will be somehow unsafe. The implication is, we are not \nsmart enough and we are not capable enough of putting together a system \nthat the Europeans have had together for 20 years.\n  In Europe, they do this routinely. For 20 years, they have had \nsomething called parallel trading. You are in Germany and want to buy a \nprescription drug from Spain? No problem. You are in Italy and want to \nbuy a prescription drug from France? No problem. They have a specific \nparallel trading system, and it works and works well.\n  I am going to describe, in the words of someone who has been involved \nin that system for many years, that the Europeans can do, have done it, \ndo it today with no problems at all. Are people saying they can do it, \nthey are smart enough, they are capable enough, but we are not? Give me \na break. That makes no sense to me at all. Of course, we can do this.\n  It is just that those who do not want to do it have decided this \ncurrent ``deal,'' which allows the pharmaceutical industry to price as \nthey wish in this country and make certain the American people cannot \ndo anything to get the lesser prices in other countries, lower prices \nfor the identical drug, it means they will price this year up 9.3 \npercent, just this year alone. They will do whatever they want to price \nthose prescription drugs and too often will price them out of reach of \nthe American people. It is not fair to me. It does not make any sense \nto me.\n  I know some will view this as just an attack on the pharmaceutical \nindustry. It is not intended to be that. As I said, I don't have a \ngrievance against that industry at all. The only problem I have is the \nway they price their product, and I think it is not fair to the \nAmerican people.\n\n[[Page S12688]]\n\n  We are dealing with health care, which is a big issue and an \nunbelievably controversial issue. This is one piece of it--not even the \nbiggest piece--but it is an important piece.\n  I have a lot to say tomorrow morning, and I will take substantial \ntime. I know there are others who want to speak tonight. I wish to say \nthis. I have watched and listened in this Chamber now for some while. I \nhave not spoken a lot on health care. I have been pretty distressed \nabout some of what has been said on the floor of the Senate. I \nespecially have been distressed with the television ads that have been \nrunning that are unbelievably dishonest with respect to the facts. The \nfirst amendment allows all that. I would be the last to suggest we \nought to alter the first amendment.\n  This is a great country in which we live. Over the last century, for \nexample, we have made a lot of changes, and in most every case--in most \nevery single case--the changes have been unbelievably painful.\n  I think of the Presiding Officer and think of the period in which the \nwomen in this country wanted the right to vote and were taken to the \nOccoquan Prison and beaten. Lucy Byrne and Alice Paul, they nearly \nchoked to death one of them; the other hung with a chain from a prison \ndoor all night long with blood running down her arms. Why? Because they \nwanted the right to vote. Think of the pain of that.\n  Now we look back and say: How could anybody have decided we are all \nAmericans except women do not have full participation because they \ncannot vote? Think of that. You can go right up the line. Social \nSecurity: a Communist socialist plot. Medicare: What are you thinking \nabout? A takeover of health care for senior citizens.\n  I bet there is not--I was going to say I bet there is not one. I \nshouldn't say that. I bet there are not more than two or three people \nin this Chamber, if we said: Let's get rid of Medicare, who would say: \nYes, let's do that. Almost everybody believes that providing health \ncare for senior citizens was the right thing to do.\n  There were no insurance companies in the fifties and early sixties \nthat said: Here is our business strategy. Our business strategy is to \ngo look for old people and see if we can't sell them health insurance \nbecause we think that would be a very good deal. They were not doing \nthat. They would not even make health insurance available to a lot of \nold folks because they know, somewhere toward the end of their lives, \nthey were going to need a lot of health care. One-half of the senior \ncitizens in America had no access to health care. Think of that--lie \ndown on your pillow at night frightened that tomorrow might be the day \nyou have this dreaded disease and you have no coverage to see a doctor \nor go to a hospital. It is unbelievable.\n  So some people in this Chamber said: Let's do Medicare. Man, that was \nradical. People said: Socialist plot, government takeover. But we did \nit. I was not here. They did it--God bless the ones who did it--and it \nenriched this country, to say all those who lived their lives and built \nthe roads and built the schools and built the communities and left a \nbetter place for us: You are not going to have to lay awake at night \nfrightened about your health care; we are going to provide health care \nfor you.\n  All these issues have been difficult, draining, wrenching issues, and \nthey have all provoked great criticism and great anger, in many cases. \nThis issue of health care brought to the floor of the Senate--I, \nperhaps, would have a different view of what is the priority.\n  I have spent most of my time saying: The economic engine, restart the \nengine, get people back to work. But that does not mean health care is \nnot important. It is. Health care continues to gobble up more and more \nof this country's economy. At some point, somebody has to say: How do \nwe stop that? If we are spending much more than anybody else, how do we \nfix this?\n  That is what this is about. It is going to take some courage to do \nit. One piece of it is this issue of prescription drugs and pricing. \nSome of us have been working on this for a long time. The breadth of \nthe support of this issue in this Chamber extends from the late Senator \nTed Kennedy, who sat in that seat back there--and God bless his \nmemory--to John McCain over there; it extends to Senator Chuck \nGrassley, Debbie Stabenow, Amy Klobuchar--a whole series of Republicans \nand Democrats who have come together to say: You know what, let's make \nsure there is fair pricing of prescription drugs for the American \npeople.\n  We are not asking for anything other than fair pricing. How do you \nget it? My goal is not to ask the American people to buy their \nprescription drugs overseas. My goal is to say, if we allow the \nAmerican people the freedom to do that, the pharmaceutical industry \nwill be required to reprice their drugs in this country. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  I know others wish to speak. As I said, I have a lot to say tomorrow. \nI am going to go home kind of upset about this letter today from the \nFDA, which is, in my judgment, completely bogus. I will read it \ntomorrow. I am not surprised. I expected this. I heard rumors about it.\n  Tomorrow my hope is with my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--we \nwill pass this legislation at last, at long last. Many of us have been \nworking on this issue 6, 8, 10 years. We will pass this legislation. \nWhy? Because this is the place for it. This is the bill that should be \namended. This is the time to do this. We cannot walk out of this \nChamber and say something happened in that Chamber to deal with health \ncare. But did you do something about prescription drugs? No, no, we \ncouldn't do that, couldn't do that. This is not the way I want this to \nend, and it is not the way it has to end if enough of us have the \ncourage to take on this fight.\n  As I said, I will have a lot more to say tomorrow morning. I \nappreciate the indulgence of my colleagues to listen tonight about why \nwe have offered this legislation.\n  I started and let me finish by saying this is broadly bipartisan. It \nis, first and foremost, a Dorgan-Snowe bill. Senator Dorgan--myself--\nand Senator Snowe from the State of Maine, but many others--my \ncolleague, Senator Grassley, who is on the floor, Senator McCain, who \nspent a lot of time on this issue--Republicans and Democrats have come \ntogether.\n  By the way, this has not happened very often on this bill. But this \nis a bipartisan bill with Republicans and Democrats pulling their oars \ntogether to try to get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, before the Senator from North Dakota \nleaves and before I speak on another issue, I wish to tell him I am \ngoing to speak in support of his amendment. But I would like to ask him \na question now, if he will answer it for me--a friendly question, but \nit is something I don't know absolutely for sure, but I believe that \npharmaceuticals are about the only thing a consumer in the United \nStates cannot buy anywhere in the world that they want to buy. We ought \nto give them that same right we do on everything else. There may be \nsome other items I am not aware of, but I think it is only \npharmaceuticals that you cannot import from wherever you want to buy \nthem.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Iowa, that and \nCohiba cigars from Cuba, I reckon. We have a special embargo with \nrespect to Cuba. With that exception, I don't think there is a legal \nproduct the American consumer cannot access anywhere else in the world.\n  This is about giving the American consumer the freedom that the \nglobal economy should offer everybody. The big shots got it. The big \ninterests can do it. How about the American people having the \nopportunity to shop around the world for the same product and pay a \nfraction of the price of the charges that are imposed on them in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I would like to talk about a recent news----\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, we had a unanimous consent agreement. \nI am trying to figure out the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next speaker is \nto be the Senator from Minnesota, followed by the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak now, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S12689]]\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question? How long will the \nSenator be?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Fifteen minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I believe our speeches are 10 minutes \nlong. If the Senator from Iowa could wait for 10 minutes, then we will \nbe able to complete our speeches, as recognized by the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will let the Senators speak, and I will speak \ntomorrow because I have to go to a meeting. I will let the unanimous \nconsent agreement stand.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I was not aware the Senator from Iowa had to leave. If \nhe can keep it to 10 minutes, that would be helpful.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I cannot keep it to 10 minutes, and I cannot shorten \nit. So I will let the unanimous consent agreement stand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, the Senator from Minnesota and I are \ngoing to engage in a colloquy.\n  We rise to talk about health care fraud enforcement. It is no secret \nfraud represents one of the fastest growing and most costly forms of \ncrime in America today.\n  In no small part, our current economic crisis can be linked to \nfinancial fraud, starting with unchecked mortgage fraud generated by \nloan originators through securities fraud that hastened the eventual \nmarket crash and maximized its impact on Main Street and the average \nAmerican investor.\n  In response, this body passed the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act, \nwhich directed critical resources and tools to antifinancial fraud \nefforts. I was proud to work on FERA with my friend from Minnesota, a \nformer prosecutor, who understands both the harm that financial fraud \ncauses ordinary Americans and the importance of deterring criminal \nbehavior before it happens.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank Senator Kaufman. Before I \nbegin, I wish to, first, acknowledge the amendment that has been \noffered by Senator Dorgan on drug reimportation, something I support \nand I know Senator Kaufman supports as well. We look forward to talking \nabout that amendment in the days to come.\n  The bill Senator Kaufman referred to, the Fraud Enforcement and \nRecovery Act, was passed in response to an unprecedented financial \ncrisis.\n  I was proud to work on that bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nalong with Senator Kaufman.\n  But Americans should expect Congress to do more than simply react to \ncrises after their most destructive impacts have already been felt. We \nare always coming in after the fact and putting out the fire. That is \nnot what we want to do. We owe it to our constituents to be proactive, \nto seek out and to solve problems on the horizon so that financial \ndisasters can be averted.\n  In the midst of the debate concerning comprehensive health care \nreform, we must be proactive in combating health care fraud and abuse. \nEach year, criminals drain between $72 billion and $220 billion from \nprivate and public health care plans through fraud, increasing the \ncosts of medical care and health insurance and undermining public trust \nin our health care system. Think of all the money wasted--$72 billion \nto $220 billion each year--drained by criminals, that could be going to \nour seniors, that could be going for care.\n  Let me give a couple of examples, Senator Kaufman, of the kinds of \nfraud we need to address. On June 23 of this year, eight individuals \nwere indicted in Miami for cashing $30,000 to $80,000 several times a \nweek at two check-cashing facilities they owned themselves. These \ncrooks defrauded the U.S. health care system by creating a phony clinic \nthat churned out medical bills in five States. They were not providing \nhealth care. They were phony clinics. Federal prosecutors announced \nthis on Tuesday.\n  Some of the purported clinics were empty storefronts with handwritten \nsigns while others existed only as post office boxes, but none provided \nany actual medical services, according to prosecutors. By the time they \nwere caught, in this one incident, this one group of con men, had \nbilked the government of $100 million. That is $100 million at a time \nwhen our taxpayers are trying to save every dime, while they are \nholding on to their jobs and trying to pay their bills. This one group \nof con men--$100 million.\n  Here is another example. In November of 2007, the Department of \nJustice indicted a woman for billing Medicare for motorized wheelchairs \nthat beneficiaries didn't need and for children's psychotherapy \nservices never provided. According to the indictment, the woman then \nlaundered the money through a Houston check-cashing business, cashing \nseveral Medicaid checks each for more than $10,000. Those are just \nexamples of what we are dealing with.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I say to the Senator, those are sobering examples of the \nkinds of fraud we must stop. As we take steps to increase the number of \nAmericans covered by health insurance and to improve the health care \nsystem for everyone--and we will do that--we must ensure that law \nenforcement has the tools it needs to deter, detect, and punish health \ncare fraud.\n  The Finance and HELP Committees, as well as leadership, have worked \nlong and hard to find ways to fight fraud and bend the cost curve down, \nand they have done a great job. But there is more work to be done. That \nis why Senator Klobuchar and I, along with Senators Leahy, Specter, \nKohl, Schumer, and Harkin, have introduced our health care fraud \nenforcement, No. 2792.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. What I like about the amendment is it will protect our \nincreased national investment in the health of Americans. We have \ndecided Americans should be covered by health care; that people \nshouldn't be thrown off of their health insurance by preexisting \nconditions. The way we protect that investment, and the way we make \nsure the funds are there to help people, is by doing things such as \nincreasing the tools we need to prosecute these kinds of cases.\n  These criminals scheme the system to rob the American taxpayers of \nmoney that should be used to provide health care to those who need it \nmost. We must put a stop to this, and we are doing that with this \namendment. It provides straightforward but critical improvements to the \nFederal sentencing guidelines, to health care fraud statutes, to \nforfeiture, money laundering, and obstruction statutes, all of which \nwould strengthen prosecutors' ability to combat health care fraud.\n  As a former prosecutor, I can tell you that when we had these types \nof cases, we used every tool you could use to push someone to plead \nguilty, every tool you could use to make sure you got the maximum \nsentence so a message would be sent not just to that particular \ncriminal but to other white collar offenders who thought this might be \na quick way to make a buck. They need to hear they can be caught and \nthey will go to jail.\n  I know Senator Kaufman has worked on this and is taking a lead, and \nperhaps he can provide the details on this amendment.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Sure. This amendment directs a significant increase in \nthe Federal sentencing guidelines for large-scale health care fraud \noffenses. It is incredible that despite enormous losses in many health \ncare fraud cases, analysis from the U.S. Sentencing Commission suggests \nthat health care fraud offenders often receive--and I know this is hard \nto believe--shorter sentences than other white collar offenders in \ncases with similar loss amounts. For some reason, people think health \ncare fraud is kind of okay.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. If people knew this, they would be shocked. In health \ncare fraud, you are taking money from people who need it most--when \nthey are at the hospital--and yet they would have shorter sentences \nthan other types of fraud.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. There is data to show that criminals are drawn to health \ncare fraud, when they are sitting around deciding what kind of fraud \nthey are going to do, because the risk-to-reward ratio is so much \nlower. That is ridiculous. We need to ensure these offenders are \npunished not only commensurate with the costs they impose on our health \ncare system but also at a level that will offer real deterrence. People \nhave got to understand they can't go out and commit health care fraud.\n  There are so many different ways it can be presented; that if in fact \nthey do\n\n[[Page S12690]]\n\nit, they are going to get real time for the crime. As a result, our \namendment directs changes to the sentencing guidelines that, as a \npractical matter, amount to sentence increases of between 20 and 50 \npercent for health care fraudsters stealing over $1 million.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. The other thing that is great about this amendment is \nit updates the definition of ``health care fraud offense'' in the \nFederal criminal code so it includes violations of the anti-kickback \nstatute, the Food and Drug and Cosmetic Act, and certain provisions of \nERISA. These changes will allow the full array of law enforcement tools \nto be used against all health care fraud.\n  The amendment also provides the Department of Justice with subpoena \nauthority for investigations conducted pursuant to the Civil Rights for \nInstitutionalized Persons Act--also known as CRIPA. Under current law, \nthe Department of Justice must rely upon the cooperation of the nursing \nhomes, mental health institutions, facilities for persons with \ndisabilities, and residential schools for children with disabilities \nthat are the target of these CRIPA investigations. While such targets \noften cooperate, they sometimes do not, and the current lack of \nsubpoena authority puts vulnerable victims at needless risk.\n  Finally, in addition to the very important piece of this amendment \nthat Senator Kaufman has pointed out--where we are actually increasing \nthe ability to get better criminal penalties--the amendment corrects an \napparent drafting error by providing that obstruction of criminal \ninvestigations involving administrative subpoenas under HIPAA--the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996--should be \ntreated in the same manner as obstruction of criminal investigations \ninvolving grand jury subpoenas.\n  Senator Kaufman and I also plan to file an additional health care \nfraud amendment that would require direct depositing of all payments \nmade to providers under Medicare and Medicaid. This amendment is \nincredibly important because the Medicare regulations already require \ndirect depositing or electronic transfer, but these regulations have \nnot been uniformly enforced and criminals are taking advantage of this \nsystem.\n  Again, I ask the question: Why would we want this money--$60 billion \nestimated for Medicare fraud alone--to be going to con men and crooks, \npeople who are setting up fake storefronts with fake signs that say \ndoctor's office, instead of to the hard-working people in this country \nwho can hardly afford their health care insurance? It is an outrage.\n  That is why I am so glad Senator Kaufman would take the leadership \nhere, that we have a group of us who were prosecutors working on this \nin the Judiciary Committee to include this in the health care reform \nbill, because Americans have waited too long for these kinds of \nchanges.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. That is a great amendment that I think will be a big \nhelp in terms of cutting down this fraud, and that is what we are all \nabout. This is a bipartisan issue, if there was ever a bipartisan \nissue. I don't know of anyone who doesn't think we have to do more in \nterms of health care fraud. When we have $70 billion to $220 billion a \nyear in health care fraud, we have to do everything we can to stop it.\n  As we consider and debate meaningful health care reform, we must \nensure that criminals who engage in health care fraud--and more \nimportantly those who contemplate doing so--understand that they face \nswift prosecution and substantial punishment.\n  When the time comes, Senator Klobuchar and I, along with our fellow \ncosponsors, will urge our colleagues to support these amendments.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Afghanistan Strategy\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \nAfghanistan strategy President Obama announced last week. The dilemma \nfacing the President and our national security team in Afghanistan is \none of the most complex and difficult I have seen in more than three \ndecades of public service.\n  President Obama's speech laid out a bold plan, and he has been both \ndeliberative and courageous in his approach. At the same time, I share \nthe concerns of many Americans about the challenges that lie ahead for \nour troops. Sending young men and women into harms way is the most \ndifficult choices we must face. Each life lost is one too many.\n  The decision in Afghanistan is especially difficult because four \nprimary questions remain. The first question is do we have a trusted \nand effective partner in President Karzai? No matter how many troops we \ndeploy, we cannot succeed with an Afghan government plagued by \ncorruption.\n  The second question is to what length is Pakistan willing to go to \nhelp? We cannot defeat al-Qaida and degrade the Taliban without \nPakistan's support.\n  The third question is can we accelerate the training of Afghan \nNational Security Forces? Today, there are too few Afghan security \nforces to clear and hold against the Taliban, and they are not capable \nof taking over from U.S. troops. And in light of the President's 18-\nmonth deadline, it is clear that self-sufficiency for the Afghans is \nnot optional; it is mandatory. Secretary Gates confirmed for me in last \nweek's Senate Foreign Relations hearing that July 2011 is a firm \ndeadline. In 18 months, we will begin our withdrawal and we will not \nsend additional troops after this time. This was reiterated by \nSecretary Clinton and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mullen.\n  The fourth question is do we have enough qualified U.S. civilians in \nAfghanistan to partner with the Afghan people in promoting governance \nand economic development? We must send even more and ensure that the \n``civilian surge'' extends to all 34 provinces, so they can partner \nwith Afghans in the field.\n  I visited Afghanistan in April and September and had the opportunity \nto speak with our military and civilian leaders, President Karzai, and \nnumerous Afghan ministers. I traveled to Helmand and Kandahar \nProvinces, and met with local government officials and tribal elders at \na ``shura,'' or community council. What I heard from the Afghan people \nwas frustration with their government's inability to provide security, \nadminister justice, and deliver basic services. They welcomed \ninternational assistance in the short-term but sought improved security \nand governance. Most importantly, they wanted control transferred to \nAfghan security forces once they were capable of holding against the \nTaliban themselves.\n  Since returning from Afghanistan, my No. 1 concern has been the \nability of the Karzai government to be an effective and trusted \npartner. In his second term, President Karzai must eliminate \ncorruption, strengthen rule of law, and deliver essential services in \norder to win the trust of the Afghan people. Ultimately, the battle is \nnot between the U.S. and the Taliban. It is a struggle between the \nAfghan government and the Taliban, and the fight must be won by the \nAfghans themselves. The notion of a corrupt government has emboldened \nthe Taliban and further undermined trust between President Karzai and \nhis people. President Karzai must translate promises in his \ninauguration speech into action, because increased government \ntransparency and accountability is absolutely critical.\n  For me, the key point in President Obama's speech was that our \nmilitary commitment is not open-ended. In July 2011, we will begin our \ntroop drawdown. This has created an 18-month deadline for progress, \ninjecting a sense of urgency to our mission that has been missing for \nthe past 8 years. It sends a message that the clock is ticking for the \nAfghan government to eliminate corruption. They will no longer get a \n``blank check'' because the time for action is now. On the security \nfront, the\n\n[[Page S12691]]\n\nAfghan National Army and Police have no choice but to assume greater \nresponsibility given the certainty of a U.S. withdrawal.\n  As President Obama outlined, Pakistan is central to this fight. We \ncannot succeed without its cooperation because developments in the \nregion are inextricably tied to both sides of the border. After my \nApril visit, I was concerned about the Pakistani commitment. When I \nreturned in September, however, I was impressed by the Pakistani \nmilitary's decision to go after elements of the Taliban in the Swat \nValley and South Waziristan. At the same time, Pakistan must take \naction against the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaida, which continue to find \nsafe haven in Pakistani tribal areas. If extremists continue to operate \nfreely between Afghanistan and Pakistan, it will undermine security \ngains made on the Afghan side of the border. And the stakes are even \nhigher in Pakistan, which has both nuclear weapons and delivery \nvehicles.\n  In Afghanistan, we must break the momentum of the Taliban by \nimproving security and strengthening our ability to partner with the \nAfghans. That is why I support efforts to accelerate the training of \nAfghan National Security Forces, ANSF. I am concerned that the \nPresident's goal of increasing the Afghan Army to 134,000 in 2010 does \nnot go far enough in building the capacity of the ANSF. By comparison, \nIraq--a geographically smaller country with the same sized population--\nhas 600,000 trained security forces. This is why we must accelerate our \ntargets for building the army and improve the capability of the police, \nwhich has faced even greater challenges in terms of corruption, \nincompetence, and attrition.\n  Finally, our success in Afghanistan depends on more than troops--we \nneed an integrated civilian-military strategy in order to sustain \nprogress. Many dedicated U.S. civilians continue to serve in \nAfghanistan, and we must further augment these numbers and ensure they \ncan directly interact with Afghans in the field. Given their role as a \nforce multiplier for the military and international nongovernmental \norganizations, NGOs, this is an area where we must channel even more \nresources and people in the near term. We need a stronger civilian \ncapacity, because counterinsurgency cannot and should not be conducted \nwith the military alone.\n  Over the coming months, I will closely monitor our progress in Afghan \ngovernance, partnering with Pakistan, building the Afghan National \nSecurity Forces, and increasing the U.S. civilian surge. Improvements \nin these areas are critical to our overall success in Afghanistan, and \nwill determine when our brave men and women in uniform can return home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama. Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see my good friends, Senators Kaufman \nand Klobuchar, had talked about actions we could take to deal with \nfraud in health care. I support that. I had the opportunity in the \npast, as U.S. attorney, to lead a group that would do that. But \nsomething is troubling me today a great deal. I am uneasy about it. It \ngoes to the heart of how the legislation that is before us today has \nbeen put together.\n  Earlier today, we had Senator McCain offering an amendment to say \nthat every State should have the same policies with regard to Medicare \nAdvantage that the State of Florida will under this bill. Presumably, \nthat was an effort to gain some support. We have seen other situations \nsuch as that with Louisiana and other places getting special \nadvantages.\n  Let me tell you about something that is particularly troubling to me. \nIt was written about by Robert Reich, who was Secretary of Labor in \nPresident Clinton's Cabinet. He is a prolific writer about economic and \nhealth care matters. He starts his Sunday August 9 article this way on \nhis blog. It says:\n\n       I'm a strong supporter of universal health insurance--\n\n  He is not pulling any punches there. He believes in a single-payer \ngovernment policy. Then he goes on to say--\n\n     and a fan of the Obama administration. But I am appalled by \n     the deal the White House has made with the pharmaceutical \n     industry's lobbying arm to buy their support.\n\n  That is a pretty serious charge. He goes on to say:\n\n       Last week, after being reported in the Los Angeles Times, \n     the White House confirmed it had promised Big Pharma that any \n     healthcare legislation will bar the Government from using its \n     huge purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices. That's \n     basically the same deal George W. Bush struck in getting the \n     Medicare drug benefit, and it's proven a bonanza for the drug \n     industry.\n\n  I will say, as I recall, that Mr. Reich was a critic of that at the \ntime. Right or wrong, it was done and he was a critic of it. I give him \ncredit for it. He said a continuation of that would be an even larger \nbonanza. He goes on to describe why he thinks it is a bonanza.\n  Right or wrong, as a matter of policy and so forth, it is no doubt \nthat is something Big Pharma would like. He goes on to say this:\n\n       In return, Big Pharma isn't just supporting universal \n     health care. It's also spending lots of money on TV and radio \n     advertising in support. Sunday's New York Times reports that \n     Big Pharma has budgeted $150 million for TV ads promoting \n     universal health insurance, starting this August--\n\n  I am quoting him--\n\n     (that's more money than John McCain spent on TV advertising \n     in last year's presidential campaign), after having already \n     spent a bundle through advocacy groups like Healthy Economies \n     Now and Families USA.\n\n  I don't know what has happened. There is a memorandum in, I believe, \none of the blogs here, the Huffington Post. That is supposed to be the \nmemorandum that documents the agreement. I don't know what the facts \nare, but I know this, it is not a healthy thing, as somebody who has \nbeen involved in Federal law enforcement, for a government official, \nunder color of right, to say to a private individual that you will help \nme with an advertising campaign and spend your private money, or I will \ndo you a favor in exchange for an $150-million television campaign.\n  I wish to tell you that is not good. That is beyond the pale. If \nthings such as this have been done in the past, it is not the kind of \nthing that ought to be continued. I think it is a big deal.\n  The New York Times has reported, as they go forward:\n\n       Shortly after striking that agreement, the trade group--the \n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or \n     PhRMA--also set aside $150 million for advertising to support \n     health care legislation.\n\n  I am quoting a New York Times article by Duff Wilson.\n\n       But an industry official involved in the discussions said \n     the group and its advertising money would now be aimed \n     specifically at the approach being pushed by Mr. Baucus, \n     Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance \n     Committee.\n\n  Is that the way this thing is being done? I hope not. I will examine \nthese circumstances in more detail, but I would like to say, right now \nand today, that I am not happy about it. I don't like the looks of it, \nit doesn't smell good to me, it does not strike me as something that is \nlegitimate, and I think maybe we need to find out more about it, \nfrankly.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues a fundamental concern I have with \nthis health care bill. Supporters of the bill have made a great deal of \npromises. They alleged it would do a lot of very great sounding things, \nand we were asked to support it on the basis of their promises. But a \ncareful examination of the legislation shows it fails to deliver on \nalmost all the major promises it made and is likely to cause a great \ndeal of adverse, unanticipated consequences. As a result, I think the \nAmerican people have intuitively understood this; that is, why they are \nso strongly opposed to it. They cannot imagine why the leadership of \nthis Senate continues to try to push down on their brow this piece of \nlegislation that does not do what it promised to do.\n  For example, the sponsors of the legislation say the bill's total \ncost is $848 billion. However, they do not begin the benefits of the \nbill until 5 years after enactment and that $848 billion is the cost of \nexpenditures over 10 years. So\n\n[[Page S12692]]\n\nwhen you move forward to when the benefits actually start for those who \nwill be receiving them and go 10 years from that point, the total costs \nare not $848 billion, they are $2.5 trillion. That is a huge \ndifference. It is a monumental difference. It is a difference so large \nI cannot understand how we can, with a straight face, try to contend \nthat we have a sound budget-minded bill that is going to cost $848 \nbillion, and we have tax increases of about half of that, and raids on \nMedicare for about half of that and that is how we are going to pay for \nit. It is not working in that way, in my view.\n  Another promise for the bill that was made by the President in the \njoint session to the Congress, he said this:\n\n       This bill will not add one dime to the deficit.\n  That is just not accurate. You can make anything deficit neutral if \nyou pay for it by slashing Medicare and taking the money from Medicare \nto pay for it. Or you can make a bill be deficit neutral if you raise \nenough taxes. So they are raising $494 billion in taxes. They are \ncutting Medicare by $465 billion. That is the plan.\n  They claim they have a $130 billion surplus. So don't worry about the \nbudget. We have created a bill that is going to reduce the deficit. \nThat is what they have said repeatedly.\n  But they forgot something. They forgot we have to pay our physicians. \nThat was always supposed to be part of health care reform. In fact, the \nphysician groups were told they were going to be paid. But under this \nbill, to show you how it has been doctored--and this has been done \nbefore, Republicans have participated in this in the past, and it has \nbeen something that has been going on for a decade, but it is really \nrelevant today, particularly in this legislation because this \nlegislation was supposed to fix this problem--they keep the physician \nrates slightly above last year's rate for 1 year. Then for 9 years in \nthe 10-year budget, they assume that doctor payments, physician \nreimbursements are going to be cut 23 percent. That is unthinkable.\n  We are not going to cut physicians 23 percent. We can't cut the \nphysicians at all because they are already wondering whether they will \ncontinue to take Medicare patients and, even more so, Medicaid \npatients, where they get paid less.\n  We could have a mass walkout of physicians who couldn't afford to see \nseniors if we were to cut their pay by 23 percent. In fact, we are not \ngoing to do that. We all know this. So what did they do? I know they \nwere meeting down in the hallways somewhere, and they were plotting out \nthis bill. They said: The President said it will not add to the debt. \nWhat are we going to do? The numbers don't add up. We can't raise taxes \nany more. We can't cut Medicare any more. We have done all we can do. \nWhat are we going to do?\n  So what they obviously decided was to take the physician pay portion \nof the bill out, that one that would have fixed this aberrational law \nwe have that requires it to be cut 23 percent, and so they put it in a \nseparate bill. Every penny of this separate bill would be paid for by \nincreased debt, so not really paid for at all. They offered that bill \non the Senate floor, and it got voted down because Republicans all \nvoted against it as being utterly fiscally irresponsible. Enough \nDemocrats joined in to kill the bill. They wouldn't support it either. \nA number of Democrats know the budget has to have some rationality. So \nthey failed to do that.\n  But if you put the doctor fix in, you are increasing the costs of the \nbill by $250 billion, so the $130 billion surplus is reduced to a $120 \nbillion deficit. So it does add to the deficit. It adds more than one \ndime to the debt; it adds $120 billion to the debt.\n  Another fiction was their promise that they would fix the physician \npayments and make a permanent policy of paying them so every year they \nwouldn't have to run to Congress and hire lobbyists to come here and \nmeet with Senators to beg them not to have a 23-percent cut. That \nhappens every year. It is ridiculous. But this bill does not deal with \nthat. It only has a 1-year fix, and for 9 years it is reduced just like \nit has been done in the past. There is no reform in that part of health \ncare that needs to be done.\n  Another fiction is that they are not cutting Medicare benefits. They \nsay: We are not cutting Medicare benefits. We are cutting that bad old \nMedicare Advantage that 11 million seniors are benefiting from and \nenjoy and participate in. They are cutting that $100-plus billion which \nis about one-fourth of what the cuts to Medicare are. They say that is \nnot truly cutting Medicare. But that clearly is cutting Medicare \nbecause Medicare Advantage is part of the Medicare Program. It is \ncutting Medicare. However you feel about Medicare Advantage, this is a \ncut to Medicare Programs that millions of seniors favor.\n  That is why Florida didn't want to have their Medicare Advantage cut. \nSo they got a special deal in this legislation. Everybody else in \nAmerica won't get that. They want to keep it.\n  Let's go on a little bit further just to show you why the American \npeople are unhappy with Congress. They have a right to be unhappy. \nPeople say: Those people out there at the tea parties and townhall \nmeetings, they were just upset. They are poor Americans. They are not \ngood Americans. Good Americans would come in and say: How much more \nmoney can we give you, big government, to take care of all our needs \nfrom cradle to the grave?\n  The people at the tea parties understand the kind of games that are \nbeing played here. They understand the cuts to home health care, to \nhospice programs, to hospitals, the hospitals that care for a \ndisproportionate share of the poor people, and the $23 billion from \njust general Medicare accounts represent cuts to Medicare, which is our \nseniors program.\n  How is it, then, that we have this disagreement? How is it possible \nthat you can't agree on where $465 billion comes from? The sponsors of \nthe bill, this is what they say. They say: We promised we wouldn't cut \nMedicare benefits. Any guaranteed benefit any senior citizen has, we \npromised not to cut it. All we are doing is cutting the providers, the \npeople who provide the benefit.\n  Give me a break. So you come in and you cut hospice, nursing homes, \nother providers, $118 billion from Medicare Advantage, $192 billion \nfrom the hospices, nursing homes, and other providers, $43 billion from \nhospitals that serve a disproportionate number of poor and uninsured, \n$23 billion from unspecified Medicare accounts, and that this doesn't \nweaken Medicare. If we could cut that, why haven't we done it already? \nIf this didn't reduce the quality of care for seniors, if we could \nreduce these hospitals and others and they could still provide care to \nour seniors, why haven't we done it already?\n  Mike Horsley, head of our hospital association in Alabama, tells me \nthat as a result of an abominable wage index program that helps to \ndetermine how much hospitals get paid primarily and lien payments in \ngeneral, two-thirds of the hospitals in Alabama are operating in the \nred. They don't need to be cut any more.\n  I guess what I would say is, this is the way the game has been \nplayed. My colleagues are saying we are not cutting guaranteed \nbenefits. We are just cutting the money from the people who provide the \nbenefits. How many of them are going to keep doing so, as the CMS \nActuary's report questioned? How many of those will give it up?\n  Fiction No. 6--I have 10, and I will not go through all of them \ntonight--is that hospitals that treat the poorest and sickest will \nsomehow be better off under this program. But they are not feeling that \nway. They are not feeling they are going to make up for the fact that \nthe hospitals that qualify as disproportionate share hospitals, those \nwho serve a high percentage of individuals who are very low income or \nwho have no insurance, they are going to lose $43 billion in cuts under \nthis bill. These hospitals that provide so much charity care and \nprovide a safety net in the communities are going to suffer under this \nlegislation. They are telling me that. I don't know who in Washington \nmay say they are not, but that is what they are telling me. I think \nthey are telling the truth.\n  Fiction No. 5 is that average family premiums are going to decrease. \nHave you heard that through this proposal? Senator Evan Bayh asked the \nCBO about this, and they said families who do not receive coverage from \ntheir employer would see their premiums rise ``about 10 to 13 percent \nhigher by 2016'' than under the current law. The ones who claim they \nare seeing some reductions, those reductions are only the\n\n[[Page S12693]]\n\nslightest reduction, less than 3 percent in most cases, of the 5- or 6-\npercent increase expected to occur every year under current law.\n  So instead of going up 5.56 percent, it goes up 5.41 percent. They \nare claiming, I guess, that is some sort of cut. But it is \nmisrepresentation to say that family premiums are going to decrease, \nwhen people who are not in group health plans through their employers \nare the ones who are going to see the largest increases, perhaps 10 to \n13 percent by 2016, more than would occur under present law.\n  I am pleased to be able to serve in the Senate with Senator Grassley \nwho chaired the Finance Committee, is ranking member now, who does over \n100 townhall meetings a year or something in the counties in Iowa. He \nmet with thousands of people and got the same message I got, which is \nyou people are irresponsible. The debt is surging and will double in 5 \nyears, the whole debt of America, and triple in 10. I want to say that \nthe American people are concerned about this. Senator Grassley worked \nso hard to see if he could get a bill that would be bipartisan, that we \nall could support, or large numbers of the Senate could support. But we \ngot off track.\n  I talked to one person who dealt with this issue. He said the way \nthings got off track was that we abandoned ways to legitimately contain \ncosts increases. The way to create more competition, the more personal \nstake in your health care, other things that would actually help reduce \nthe cost of health care, is what we got away from, and it became driven \nby President Obama's determination to have a government option. That, \nin my estimation, may have been the decisive event in the negotiations \nbreaking down.\n  This is a serious piece of legislation. It seeks to alter one-sixth \nof the American economy. It does not do what it promises. It surges \nspending. It increases taxes dramatically. It represents a major \ngovernmental takeover and will ultimately undermine the special \nrelationship between patients and their doctors. It will also \nsubstantially threaten the viability of Medicare. This money that is \nbeing taken out of Medicare will only accelerate its insolvency. By \n2017, Medicare--I believe Senator Grassley will agree--is expected to \ngo into default. It will go down rapidly, actually.\n  Is that correct, Senator Grassley, that by 2017, under current law, \nMedicare is projected to go into default and go rapidly into default, \nand if we could save any money out of Medicare, if we can save $400 \nbillion, shouldn't it be kept in the Medicare Program to try to extend \nits life and make it a viable program that seniors can rely on rather \nthan creating a whole new spending program with that money?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if the Senator is asking me that \nquestion, I will tell him that he is absolutely right, not based upon \nwhat I say or what the Senator says, but every spring the trustees of \nSocial Security and Medicare look ahead 75 years and they predict what \nthe income and the outlays are going to be based upon the population \nand the projected growth of the economy and all that stuff. Right now, \nthey are projecting $37 trillion of shortfall over that 75-year period \nof time. They already told us, and it has materialized, that in the \nyear 2008 we started paying more money out of Medicare than was coming \ninto Medicare, and by the year 2017, as the Senator correctly stated, \nthe trust fund will be out of reserves.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So we are spending the reserves in Social Security, \nwhich will be exhausted by 2017.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In Medicare.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Medicare. Excuse me.\n  I am going to yield the floor to Senator Grassley. I say to the \nSenator, I appreciate your leadership and insight into this issue. I \nvalue your whole approach to it. I think most Americans--if they \nunderstood this information as the Senator does and as the Senator has \narticulated, the opposition to the bill would be even greater than it \nis.\n  I urge my colleagues to examine the fact that the bill simply does \nnot do what it sets out to do. It does not meet its promises, and as a \nresult, we absolutely should not go down this road to a major Federal \ntakeover of health care, with ramifications that go far beyond what it \nmight appear today.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I had a chance to hear a great deal of \nwhat the Senator from Alabama said. I think I would highlight that what \nhe said is what he is hearing from the grassroots of his State, which \nis very much what I hear from the grassroots of my State: people are \nvery concerned about this piece of legislation leading to the \nnationalization of health care, similar to what they have seen this \nadministration previously do this year with the nationalization of \nGeneral Motors, partial nationalization of the financial system--a big \ndeficit. And then they see the money being spent on this bill--$2.5 \ntrillion after it gets fully implemented. And where are you going to \nget money? And what is that going to do to the economy? And, more \nimportantly, what sort of a legacy is that leaving to our children and \ngrandchildren?\n  He also correctly stated that I do visit every county every year. The \nnumber of counties the Senator had was just a little bit high. We only \nhave 99 counties. But for the 29 years I have been in the U.S. Senate, \nI have held a town meeting in each one of our counties every year. So I \ndo have the benefit of 2,871 town meetings as a basis for suggesting \nwhat people tell me face to face, besides the large number of phone \ncalls we get.\n  You cannot believe the number of phone calls that are coming in now, \nthe number of e-mails we are getting--historically high. I have never \nhad that before on any issue. I assume it is the same for the State of \nAlabama, contacting their two Senators as well.\n  Mr. President, I rise to bring up an issue that is a relatively new \nissue in this debate, as in the secrecy of the negotiations that are \ngoing on around Capitol Hill on the issue of health care reform. These \nsecret negotiations actually started about October 2 when Senator Reid, \nthe leader, had to merge the bill out of the Senate Finance Committee \nand the bill out of the Senate HELP Committee into one bill. It took a \nlong period of time to do that.\n  We are in the second week of debate. I hope people realize that 99 \nSenators ought to have the same privilege that 1 Senator had of getting \na grasp of this huge 2,074-page bill. There are still negotiations \ngoing on because the leader still does not have locked down the 60 \nvotes that it is going to take to get to finality.\n  So some of these discussions are: what can we do to get a few votes \nif we do not have a so-called public option? And the latest of that is: \nWell, allow people to buy into Medicare. So I want to speak about that \nissue because it sounds pretty simple. It may get 4 more votes and may \nget 60 votes, but it is bad. It may be good politically, but it is bad \nfor Medicare and particularly for Medicare in rural areas where we have \na difficult time keeping hospitals open, and we have a difficult time \nrecruiting doctors in rural America.\n  So I would talk about the recent news reports of a proposal being \nconcocted behind closed doors to allow 55- to 64-year-olds to buy into \nthe Medicare Program. Supposedly, this idea has been put on the table \nto get the votes for supporters of having a brandnew government-run \nhealth plan and the people who do not like that.\n  Back in the spring, such a proposal came up during the early stages \nof our Finance Committee's health care reform efforts. The idea was \noriginally proposed by President Clinton even going back to 1998. I \nopposed such a proposal back then, and I oppose such a proposal now. I \noppose the proposal because of its negative effect on the Medicare \nProgram and our senior citizens who use Medicare.\n  The best way to describe the effect of this proposal on the Medicare \nProgram and its beneficiaries is to quote former Senator Phil Gramm of \nTexas when he was asked about President Clinton's proposal when \nPresident Clinton put that proposal on the table back in 1998. Senator \nGramm said this about President Clinton's proposal, which would be \napplicable today as our colleagues are studying it:\n\n       If your mother is on the Titanic, and the Titanic is \n     sinking, the last thing on Earth you want to be preoccupied \n     with is getting more passengers on the Titanic.\n\n  Since its inception in 1965, the Medicare Program has helped ensure \nsenior\n\n[[Page S12694]]\n\naccess to health care. But, as the Senator from Alabama and I were just \ndiscussing, the problems with health care and Medicare are such that \nMedicare is already under extreme financial pressure. So why would you \nload more people into a system that Senator Gramm of Texas was \nreferring to as the Titanic? You would not load more people on it as it \nwas going to sink.\n  This is not to say that this entitlement program, Medicare, is not in \nneed of improvement, but having the 36 million Americans who are age 55 \nto 64 buy into the program is not an improvement. Even groups \nsupporting the Reid bill, such as the AARP, are pointing out the severe \nshortcomings of such an approach.\n  Last summer, the AARP Public Policy Institute published an analysis \nof the Medicare buy-in concept. In their report, the AARP points out \nthe potential for increased Federal entitlement spending. AARP said:\n\n       Expanding the program to more people could raise federal \n     spending even further if their care is made affordable \n     through subsidies that would be funded by the existing \n     Medicare trust funds.\n\n  And do not forget the effects of adverse selection from a Medicare \nbuy-in program. Here AARP has studied it, and this is what they say \nabout that:\n\n       . . . the premium may be too uncompetitive for those who \n     don't use much health care and unaffordable for those with \n     modest incomes. This may limit buy-in enrollment and drive up \n     cost further.\n\n  So this means that this buy-in proposal is likely unsustainable. And \nwe all know what happens when the government creates an unsustainable \nnew program. What happens? The taxpayers end up on the hook for bailing \nit out down the road sometime.\n  We all know the Medicare Program has $37 trillion in unfunded \nobligations. We all know about the pending insolvency of the Medicare \nProgram. The trustees say so every spring.\n  The Medicare hospital insurance trust fund started going broke last \nyear. In 2008, the Medicare Program began spending more out of this \ntrust fund than was coming in through the payroll tax. The Medicare \ntrustees have been warning all of us for years that this trust fund is \ngoing broke. They now predict that it will go broke right around the \ncorner in 2017. Well, as the AARP has pointed out, adding millions to \nthe Medicare Program would almost certainly make things much, much \nworse for the fiscal health of a program that is not in very good \nfinancial shape. This proposal would also make things worse for the 45 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries who paid into the program over the years \nand are receiving benefits under the program.\n  Since we started debate on this 2,074-page bill, Members on this side \nof the aisle have questioned the wisdom of slashing Medicare by $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion and then using the savings to start a new Federal entitlement \nprogram. We on this side have stressed that provider cuts of this \nmagnitude will make it financially harder for providers to care for \nbeneficiaries. We have pointed out that this will worsen beneficiary \naccess to health care, as providers stop treating Medicare patients.\n  Adding millions more Americans to Medicare on top of the $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in Medicare cuts in this Reid bill would make beneficiaries' \naccess to care much worse. But do not take my word for it. Even \nnational hospital associations such as the American Hospital \nAssociation and the Federation of American Hospitals are opposing this \nproposal. They are mobilizing their ranks against this proposal even as \nI speak. Yes, the same groups that agreed already--and this was back in \nJune--to $155 billion in Medicare cuts--and they did that in an \nagreement with the White House and got sweetheart deals in this bill--\ndo not want the Senate to go the route of expanding Medicare for people \nunder 65 years of age. The American Medical Association has also \nopposed this proposal. These groups recognize the potential for \nfinancial disaster by boosting the number of patients with coverage \nthat pays well below cost.\n  This Medicare buy-in proposal would also jeopardize retiree benefits. \nGoing back to the same AARP analysis that I have quoted, they concluded \nthat a Medicare buy-in program could further reduce employer-sponsored \nhealth benefits.\n  According to the AARP:\n\n       . . . a buy-in program might displace retiree coverage now \n     available through [their] employers.\n\n  Still quoting AARP, they said:\n\n       As health care costs tend to rise with age, employers might \n     have the incentive to find ways to avoid offering private \n     coverage for early retirees. . . .\n\n  So with fewer patients with higher paying private coverage, there is \nless opportunity for providers to cost-shift to make up for low \nMedicare payments, because everybody recognizes the Federal Government \ndoes not pay 100 percent of costs. This would make it even harder for \nproviders to treat Medicare beneficiaries, and as a result, \nbeneficiaries would have an even harder time finding a provider to \ntreat them.\n  I come from a rural State where Medicare reimbursement is already \nlower than almost every other State in the Nation, so I have serious \nconcerns about the ability of the Iowa providers to keep their doors \nopen if more and more of their reimbursement is coming from Medicare. I \nknow this is a concern that is shared by rural State Members of this \nbody from both sides of the aisle. But losing providers to serve \nMedicare beneficiaries would only be the beginning of access problems \ncaused by a Medicare buy-in program. Because if you think it would be \ntough to keep existing Medicare providers, think how hard it would be \nthen to recruit new ones.\n  Provider recruitment is already a major problem in rural States, \nparticularly my State of Iowa. This issue comes up during my meetings \nwith constituents in Washington or during the townhall meetings I hold \nin each of Iowa's 99 counties every year. It is already a challenge \nunder the current Medicare Program for Iowa to compete for providers \nwith urban areas where Medicare reimbursement is higher.\n  I hear countless stories from constituents where they make great \nefforts to recruit doctors only to lose them to areas where Medicare \nreimbursement is higher. The Medicare buy-in will only make this \nsituation worse in my State of Iowa, because more and more \nreimbursement would come from Medicare. So the current and future \nMedicare beneficiaries would be assured of limited access to providers \nbecause of this buy-in.\n  AARP pointed out another flaw in this buy-in proposal. In their \nanalysis, AARP warned that there are large cost-sharing requirements in \nMedicare, so buy-in enrollees would still be exposed to significant \ncost sharing. Maybe these buy-in enrollees would have the resources to \npurchase supplemental Medicare policies to defray these cost-sharing \nrequirements. Perhaps AARP is thinking of making even more money by \nselling supplemental policies to these retirees.\n  I share the goal of getting more Americans covered, but expanding the \nMedicare Program to early retirees is not the answer. Medicare \nbeneficiaries have paid in to this program all these years and \nrightfully have the expectation to receive the benefits to which they \nare entitled under the program. The Medicare buy-in proposal would \njeopardize these benefits. It would jeopardize existing retiree \nbenefits. It would leave retirees exposed to significant cost sharing. \nIt would be unsustainable and taxpayers would end up footing the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, thank you very much. I rise tonight to \ncontinue the discussion and debate on health care. I had the chance \nover the last couple of months not only to do a good bit of work on a \nnumber of issues that relate to the bill and the two bills that came \nbefore and were merged into one bill, but also to hear from \nconstituents across Pennsylvania. Some of them are writing to us and \nurging us to pass a bill and some are urging us to go in the other \ndirection. But the communications I get from people who write about \ntheir own stories, their own family, their own challenges are, of \ncourse, the most compelling and the most worthy of time and attention.\n  Often they come from Pennsylvania families who are not only facing \nhealth care challenges but facing economic challenges that I don't \nthink anyone in this Chamber can fully understand, at least not at this \npoint in someone's life. Because when you become a Member of Congress, \nyou are usually in\n\n[[Page S12695]]\n\npretty good shape. You may not have a lot of wealth, but you at least \nhave a job to go to every day, you have a lot of people helping you, \nand you have health care. That is not something that can be said for \ntens of millions of Americans.\n  This legislation is the culmination of a lot of debate and discussion \nand analysis and study over many decades now. It is nice that we have \nbeen talking for years and years about preventing a preexisting \ncondition from barring someone's coverage or treatment. It is nice to \ntalk about it, but it is a lot better when we do something about it. It \nis nice we have talked about limiting out-of-pocket costs for families \nwho are trying to take care of their children, trying to care of \nthemselves, but it is a lot better to do it, to enact it into law.\n  This bill makes it illegal to use preexisting conditions to deny \nsomeone coverage. This bill makes it illegal for insurance companies to \nput a lifetime cap on services, or an annual cap. This bill makes it \nillegal to discriminate so that no longer, if we do what we must do and \nget this bill passed, can an insurance company discriminate against a \nwoman, which they do all the time now, just as they prevent people from \ngetting coverage due to a preexisting condition. We have an opportunity \nto change the way we provide health care in ways we haven't been able \nto imagine, let alone enact into law.\n  One issue that has motivated me throughout this whole debate is what \nhappens to our children at the end of the debate, at the end the \nlegislative line, so to speak. Will children in America--and I am \nspeaking about poor children and those with special needs because they \nare the ones who need help. If you are in a wealthy family, you will \nfigure it out, and your family will figure it out. If you happen to be \na child of a poor family or a child who has special needs, will you be \nbetter off at the end of this debate or will you be worse off.\n  As it relates to poor children and children with special needs, the \ngoal here has to be no child worse off. It is very simple. It is a very \nsimple test. That is what we have been working on. I believe this bill \nthat is on the floor right now is a dramatic improvement in the lives \nof so many families. I still think we have some more work to do as it \nrelates to children, but there is no question that the bill we are \ndebating will make children a priority in ways we haven't been able to \ndo in any kind of other legislation, other than the children's health \ninsurance legislation that Congress enacted going back more than a \ndecade ago and that we reauthorized this past year.\n  I wish to speak about two families tonight. This isn't a discussion \nabout theory or about the nuances of a policy. This is about real \npeople and what has happened to them under our existing system. I wish \nto put up the first chart. This chart depicts one family, the Ritter \nfamily in Manheim, PA. I spoke with them several days ago and I spoke \nwith these two young girls. One daughter's name is Hannah--one twin, I \nshould say, is Hannah and her sister--after I spoke on the floor I \ncalled their mom to talk about what I had said on the floor and I said \nto her, I think I referred to one of your daughters as Madeline, and \nthat is incorrect, it is Madeline. So I want Madeline to know I \ncorrectly pronounced her name my second time around. Part of that is \nbecause of a story I read to my daughters when they were kids all the \ntime. But there was a story about Madeline, and a lot of parents know \nthat story. So I apologize to Stacie Ritter.\n  But here is the story that Stacie Ritter has told me through this \ncommunication, but has told a lot of other people, and now we try to \ntell her story on the Senate floor to give meaning to what we are \ntalking about here. But this isn't some public policy discussion about \nhealth care; this is about what happens to real families when we don't \nget the policy right, when we talk and talk year after year, decade \nafter decade, and talk about good intentions, but never get it done, \nnever get a bill passed. This is what happens to people.\n  Stacie Ritter had to declare bankruptcy after her twins were \ndiagnosed with leukemia at the age of 4. My wife Teresa and I have four \ndaughters, and thank goodness they are all healthy. Two of them are in \ncollege, one is in high school, and one is in seventh grade. We have \nnever had to face that kind of diagnosis, thank goodness. Thank God I \nhave never had to face that, nor has my wife Teresa had to face that as \na parent. But if we did, we would have been given some protection and \nso would our daughters if we faced that horrific diagnosis, because \nwhen I was working as a lawyer or when I was a public official, I had \nhealth care. Sometimes, for a lot of that time period, a decade in \nState government health care, because I was a State employee, I had a \ntremendous health care plan, a kind of public option, a good public \nhealth care plan. So I never had to worry about that as a parent nor \ndid my wife if something horrific were diagnosed.\n  These two little girls pictured here--and you can see even though \nbecause of that diagnosis they are facing the kind of challenge I can't \neven imagine, let alone endure--I hope I could, but I am not sure I \ncould if I were in their place. But you can see that even though it is \nobvious they are facing a real challenge with regard to the leukemia, \nthey are very hopeful, aren't they, in that picture. They have their \narms around each other. They have these stethoscopes and they are \ndressed up like two doctors. So even in the midst of the horror of that \nkind of a diagnosis, you have these two brave little girls who are \nlooking forward, not just worried about their one situation but looking \nforward with hope and optimism.\n  Here is a picture down here taken last year in Washington, DC, then \nat the age of 11. Here is what their mother said:\n\n       Without meaningful health reform my girls will be unable to \n     afford care, that is if they are even eligible for care, that \n     is critically necessary to maintain this chronic condition.\n       Punished and rejected because they had the misfortune of \n     developing cancer as a child.\n\n  What is the particular problem here with this case? The obvious \nproblem is that these young girls were diagnosed with leukemia. That is \nbad enough. But we have a system that made their life a lot worse than \nthe leukemia, because we had a system that said--basically what the \nsystem said to them is: We can help you and maybe cure you, but we are \ngoing to put limits on it. We are going to say that it is nice to have \nall of this technology and all of this great medical knowledge and \ngreat doctors and hospitals across America--and we do. We are the envy \nof the world on some of this stuff: the doctors and the nurses and the \nhealth care professionals, and the hospitals and the technology and the \nknow-how. We are the envy of the world. We should acknowledge that. But \nthen we have this ridiculous system that says to these two little \ngirls: But the care we want to give you and the results we can get from \nthat care are going to be limited. So we hope it works out for you.\n  That is ridiculous. It is an abomination. I don't understand why we \nhave gone year after year and settled for this. Why do we have limits \non the kind of care people get? Because insurance companies thought \nthat was a good idea. I don't know why. I don't know whether it is for \ntheir bottom line or for whatever reason, but there is no excuse--no \nrationale--for saying to someone: We can cure you, but we are going to \nlimit your care.\n  You are in real trouble, and we know how to help you. But we are \ngoing to limit it. Here is what Stacie said about her kids:\n\n       When my identical twins were both diagnosed with [this \n     leukemia] . . . at the age of four, we were told they would \n     need a bone marrow transplant in order to survive. That's \n     when I learned that the insurance company thought my \n     daughters were only worth $1 million each.\n\n  I don't know a parent in America who believes their son or daughter--\nin this case, two daughters, her twins--is worth any amount of money or \ntheir care is worth any amount of money. Why does the insurance company \ndo it? We hear they say that is policy, and then they get pressure from \na TV station or news organization and they give the care.\n  If the policy makes sense, why would public pressure change a policy? \nThe policy is ridiculous and insulting. It should be changed. It is one \nof those things we have to make illegal, and this bill does that. We \nshould make it illegal for an insurance company to do that to children. \nBut it doesn't make a\n\n[[Page S12696]]\n\nlot of sense unless you talk about it in terms of a real story.\n  Here is what Stacie Ritter said after she talked about the limit--\nvery flatly, she said two words about whether a $1 million is enough to \ncare for two daughters with leukemia over many years:\n\n       It's not! When you add up the costs involved in caring for \n     a patient with a life-threatening disease like cancer, $1 \n     million barely covers it.\n\n  We have lots of stories like this.\n\n       Fortunately, the hospital social worker recommended we \n     apply for secondary insurance through the State considering \n     the highly probable chance we would hit the cap. And we did \n     hit that cap before the end of treatment.\n\n  The State program sounds a lot like a public option. I may be wrong, \nbut it sounds an awful lot like that.\n\n       Thankfully, the State program kicked in and helped pay for \n     the remainder of treatment.\n\n  So that part of the story worked itself out. It didn't work itself \nout because the insurance company said: We have a way to help you, and \nwe are going to do it and figure out the cost in another way. No, the \ninsurance company didn't help them. It was the State program in this \ncase--the kind of public option that helped these kids. That part of \nthe story has somewhat of a positive outcome. These kids are only 11. \nWhen they were 4 and 5, they didn't have that kind of an option.\n  This story gets worse. This is what Stacie says:\n\n       During this time, my husband had to take family medical \n     leave so we could take turns caring for our one-year-old son \n     and our twins at the hospital. . . .\n       For the 7 months my husband was out on family medical \n     leave, he was able to maintain his employer-based insurance \n     for us via a $717.18 a month COBRA payment.\n\n  Let me get this straight. We are now talking about COBRA--the \nextension of insurance coverage for people who are hurting, laid off or \nunemployed. That is another government initiative enacted by Congress. \nI am sure there were some folks who thought let's not use government to \nextend health insurance. But in this case, it was helpful to this \nfamily. But it wasn't enough.\n  Here is what Stacie says, as she keeps going:\n\n       After spending all our savings to pay the mortgage and \n     other basic living expenses, we had to rely on credit cards.\n\n  We have a health care system that forced Stacie Ritter, and lots of \nother families in America, to rely upon credit cards so they could get \nthe health care for their daughters who have leukemia and make ends \nmeet so they could pay the mortgage and all the other things they had \nto pay for for themselves and their daughters and their son. That is \nwhat this health care system has forced them to do.\n  This isn't unambiguous. This is exactly the result of the worse part \nof our health care system. This last sentence might be the most \npoignant. She mentions they filed bankruptcy:\n\n       And when you file bankruptcy, everything must be disclosed. \n     We even had to hand over the kids' savings accounts that \n     their great grandparents had given them when they were born.\n\n  That is another problem with this messed up system we have. It forced \nthis family not only to worry about whether their daughters were going \nto be taken care of with leukemia, it not only said they probably had \nto declare bankruptcy to take care of themselves and get the care they \nneeded, but in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, they had to \nturn over savings accounts.\n  I don't care if it was $1 or $1,000 or a much higher amount. I don't \ncare what the amount was. We should never allow a system to force two \nlittle girls with leukemia to turn over their savings accounts that \ntheir great grandparents started for them. That is how bad the system \nis.\n  I will spend lots of time complimenting doctors, hospitals, and \nnurses. We have a lot of good things. We have good technology. OK. I am \nacknowledging all that. But this system is messed up when we have this \nhappen to one family. I don't care if it is one family or 1 million, \nbut we know there are lots of them out there who face similar \ncircumstances.\n  Some people might say you are talking about the family and all these \nproblems. What does your bill do? It so happens the first provision in \nthe bill--go by the table of contents and go to the page--I think page \n16. The first provision of the bill talks about not having limits on \nlifetime coverage. If that were in effect when Stacie Ritter and her \nhusband got the diagnosis for their daughters--if that was in effect, \nthe following would have happened, and this is irrefutable: No. 1, they \nwere upset, and as worried as they were about their daughters, at least \nthey would have had the peace of mind to know they didn't have to worry \nabout it costing too much to get them care. They would not have had to \nworry about this causing bankruptcy. So at least we would have given \nthem some peace of mind and some security. Then on top of that, we \nwould have given them the kind of care they needed, including the \nfollow-up care.\n  When some people say we need to debate a little longer, 3 months or 6 \nmonths more, or let's talk about it for a couple more years--we have \ntalked this issue to death for years. We know exactly what is wrong. \nThis is what is wrong. That story alone is reason to pass the bill. \nThere are a lot of other reasons, a lot of other tragedies that are \npreventable if we do the right thing.\n  We have a bill that we are going to pass, and the first provision \nspeaks to this family's challenge.\n  Let me read one more letter and I will stop. I know I am over my \ntime. We have heard a lot of discussion in the last couple of days \nabout people whose personal tragedies bring all of us to our senses as \nwe get lost in the politics. I received a letter this fall that I think \nsums it up in a way that both Hannah's and Madeline's story does as \nwell. This is a letter that I received from a woman in Havertown, PA, \nsuburban Philadelphia. She says:\n\n       On September 9, 2009, my sister-in-law's cousin had to take \n     her three-week-old son off of life support. He took two \n     shallow breaths and passed away peacefully. He did not have \n     to die, he did not have to be on life support, he did not \n     even have to be in the [neonatal intensive care unit] NICU.\n       At 36 weeks gestation, his mother was told that she had \n     Placenta-previa, but the insurance company and the doctor \n     were at a tug of war on getting it covered.\n\n  This is America. Why should a doctor have to be in any tug of war \nabout whether this mother, who is pregnant, will be covered? That \nshould not even be a discussion. There should not have to be any \ndiscussion about that. But that is how messed up our system is.\n\n       At 39 weeks, Brandon's umbilical cord ruptured. His mother \n     Karen was rushed to the hospital and Brandon was taken to \n     Jefferson [hospital] in Philadelphia to undergo brain cooling \n     treatment to return brain activity.\n       It was too late. After minimal return of brain activity, it \n     was decided after 3 weeks to remove life support.\n\n  She concludes with this haunting sentence, this haunting reminder of \nhow bad a case this is:\n\n       Who saved money here? Was it worth a child's life to save a \n     few dollars? And I am sure 3 weeks of life support costs more \n     than a C-section.\n\n  That is the end of her letter. So anybody who says that we have to \nmake a couple little changes on the margins, but we have a great system \nthat is not in need of major reform--I need only point to these two \nexamples. That is all the information I need.\n  Unfortunately, we have thousands--hundreds of thousands of additional \nexamples--literally millions of people who are denied coverage because \nof a preexisting condition. Sometimes because a woman has been a victim \nof domestic violence, that has been used as a preexisting condition in \nterms of whether she gets health care. So we have a messed up system.\n  When we allow these tragedies to happen day after day, year after \nyear, and we have people in Washington saying: We just could not get it \ndone, we have to debate a little longer--we have to get a bill passed. \nWe are going to do that in the next couple of weeks. We will take \nwhatever steps are necessary to get this legislation passed because we \ncannot say to this woman who wrote to me from Havertown, PA, nor can we \nsay to these two girls and their parents--we can't walk up to Hannah \nand Madeline and other kids like them in the country and say we tried \nto get that lifetime limit matter done, but it got a little \ncontentious.\n  We have to get it done, and we will get it done because we are \nsummoned by a lot of things. But I think we are summoned by our \nconscience to get this done and make sure we can do everything \npossible--no system is perfect--to prevent these tragedies.\n\n[[Page S12697]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senator Casey \nfor his consistent efforts in fighting to make sure that every American \nhas good-quality, cost-effective health care. He has been a leader and \nI congratulate him.\n  Mr. President, I wish to touch on some of the health care issues that \nare out there and tell you what I think is positive in the bill we are \ndealing with in the Senate and tell you what I think is not so \npositive.\n  To begin with, as Senator Casey has aptly described, we have a system \nwhich, in many ways, is disintegrating. It is an international \nembarrassment that in the United States of America, we remain the only \nNation in the industrialized world that does not guarantee health care \nto all its people as a right. The result of that is, some 46 million \nAmericans today have no health insurance. Even more are underinsured, \nwith large copayments and deductibles.\n  We have some 60 million Americans today who, because of our very poor \nprimary health care outreach network, do not have access to a doctor on \na regular basis. The result of that is, as incredible as it may sound, \naccording to a recent study at Harvard University, some 45,000 people \ndie every single year because they do not get to a doctor when they \nshould. As a result, by the time they walk into a doctor's office, \ntheir illness may be terminal. In addition to that, God only knows how \nmany people end up in a hospital, at great expense to the system, \nbecause they did not get care when they should have.\n  Meanwhile, as Senator Casey indicated, bankruptcy is an enormous \nproblem because of our health care system. Close to 1 million Americans \nthis year will be going bankrupt because of medically related bills. \nFurthermore, when we talk about economic growth in America, all of us \nunderstand that small businesses, medium-sized businesses are plowing \nan enormous amount of money into health care for their workers rather \nthan reinvesting that money and expanding their operations and creating \nthe kind of jobs we need as a nation in the midst of our very deep \nrecession.\n  We have a major problem. At the end of the day, despite so many \npeople uninsured, underinsured, so many people dying because they do \nnot get health care when they need it, so many people going bankrupt, \nwe end up spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as \nany other nation.\n  It is clear to me and I think it is clear to the vast majority of the \nAmerican people that we need real health care reform. What real health \ncare reform must be about is at least two things. No. 1, providing \ncoverage to all Americans as a right of citizenship and, No. 2, doing \nthat in the most cost-effective way we possibly can.\n  To my mind, quite frankly, there is only one way that I know of that \nwe can provide universal, cost-effective, and comprehensive health care \nfor all our people, and that is a Medicare-for-all, single-payer \nsystem. Very briefly, the reason for that is we are wasting about $400 \nbillion every single year on administrative costs, on profiteering, on \nadvertising, on billing--all in the name of profits for the private \ninsurance companies that have thousands and thousands of separate plans \nout there, creating an enormously complicated and burdensome system. \nWith each one of their thousands of plans, if you are young and do not \nget sick and are healthy, they have a plan for you. If you are older \nand you get sick, they have another plan for you. There are 1,300 \nprivate insurance companies with thousands and thousands of plans, and \nto administer all of this costs hundreds and hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  That is money not going into doctors--we have a huge crisis in \nprimary health care physicians--not money going into dentists. Many \nareas, including Vermont, have a serious dental access problem. That is \nmoney not going to nurses. We have a nursing shortage. This is money \ngoing into bureaucracy, profiteering, and salaries for the CEOs of \ninsurance companies. It is going into inflated prices for prescription \ndrugs in this country. As a nation, we pay the highest prices in the \nworld for prescription drugs.\n  To my mind, as a nation, what we have to finally deal with is that so \nlong as we have thousands of separate plans, each designed to make as \nmuch money as possible, we are not going to get a handle on the cost of \nhealth care in America.\n  In the bill we are now talking about in the Senate, we have to be \nclear that the projections, according to the CBO, are that, everything \nbeing equal, over a 10-year period, the cost of health care for most \nAmericans is going to continue to soar. That is the reality. This is \nbad not only for individuals, not only for businesses, this is bad for \nour international competitive capabilities because we are starting off \nfrom the position that today we spend much more than any other country. \nGuess what? While this bill does a number of very good things, it is \nnot strong on cost containment.\n  If we are going to try to improve cost containment--and I wonder how \nmuch we can do within the context of this particular approach to health \ncare without being a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system--at the very \nleast, we need a strong public option. We need that for two reasons. \nFirst of all, there is widespread mistrust of private health insurance \ncompanies for all the right reasons.\n  Most Americans understand that the function of a private health \ninsurance company is not to provide health care; the function is to \nmake as much money as possible. People do not trust private health \ninsurance companies, and they are right in terms of their perceptions.\n  People are entitled to a choice. If you want to stay with your \nprivate health insurance company, great, you can do it. But as many \npeople as possible in this country should be able to say: You know \nwhat, I am not comfortable with a private insurance company. I would \nrather have a Medicare-type plan.\n  Poll after poll suggests that the American people want that public \noption. That is point No. 1, freedom of choice. People should have that \nchoice. If they do not want it, that is fine.\n  Point No. 2 may be even more important, if we are going to get a \nhandle on exploding health care costs, somebody is going to have to \nrein in the private insurance companies whose only function in life is \nto make as much money as they possibly can. We need a nonprofit, \ngovernment-run public plan to do that. If we do not have that in this \nbill, I am not sure how we are going to get any handle on cost \ncontainment.\n  I will fight to make sure we have as strong a public option as we \npossibly can. As I have said publicly many times, my vote for this \nlegislation is not at all certain. I have a lot of problems with this \nbill. We have to have at least, among other things, a strong public \noption.\n  Let me tell my colleagues something else I think we have to address \nin this bill. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have a disaster in terms \nof primary health care in America. Some 60 million Americans are \nfinding it difficult to get to a doctor on a regular basis, and that is \ndumb in terms of the health and well-being of our people. It is also \ndumb in terms of trying to control health care costs.\n  If somebody does not have a doctor they can go to when they get sick, \nwhere do they end up? They end up in the emergency room, and everybody \nknows the emergency room, by far, is the most expensive form of primary \nhealth care. Yet millions of people have no other options. They end up \nin an emergency room. If they have a bad cold, Medicaid may pay $500 to \n$600 for their visit to the emergency room. That is totally absurd.\n  Furthermore, if you have a primary health care physician, that person \ncan work with you on disease prevention--helping you get off cigarette \nsmoking or helping you with alcohol, a drug problem, a whole myriad of \nissues in terms of good prevention, good nutrition. That we have a \ndisaster in primary health care which is driving people to the ER makes \nno sense at all.\n  As I mentioned the other day, there is a provision in this \nlegislation in the Senate which authorizes a very significant expansion \nof federally qualified community health centers which, in a nonpartisan \nway, a bipartisan way is widely supported by, I suspect, almost \neverybody in the Senate and in the House as well.\n  These community health centers today allow 20 million people to \naccess not only good, quality primary health care but dental care, \nwhich is a huge\n\n[[Page S12698]]\n\nissue all over this country, mental health counseling, a very big \nissue, and low-cost prescription drugs.\n\n  The problem is, while the community health centers today do an \nexcellent job, there are not enough of them. So in this legislation, we \nhave greatly expanded community health centers. If we as a Congress are \ntalking about bringing 13, 14, 15 million more people into Medicaid, I \nam not quite sure how a struggling Medicaid Program is going to \naccommodate those people, unless we provide the facilities and the \nmedical personnel to treat them.\n  We need this. We need to expand primary health care. Community health \ncenters are the most cost-effective way I know how to do that. There \nare studies that suggest providing that primary care, keeping people \nout of the emergency room, keeping them out of the hospital because \nthey have gotten sicker than they should have gotten, we can, in fact, \npay for these community health centers over a period of years by simply \nsaving money.\n  In the Senate, we have very good language authorizing an expansion. \nIn the House, they have similar language, except in the House they have \na trust fund which actually pays for this. I am going to do my best to \nmake sure we adopt the House language, which pays for, through a trust \nfund, a substantial increase in community health centers and, in \naddition, a very significant expansion of the National Health Service \nCorps, which is a Federal program which provides debt forgiveness and \nscholarships for medical students who are prepared to serve in \nmedically underserved areas in primary health care.\n  We desperately need more primary health care physicians, nurses, \ndentists. That is what the National Health Service Corps does. My hope \nis the Senate will adopt the House provision to greatly expand the \nNational Health Service Corps and the Health Service programs. That is \nan issue that is very important to me.\n  Let me touch on another issue, which is clearly going to be \ncontentious; that is, at the end of the day, we are going to be \nspending on health care somewhere around $800 billion to $1 trillion. \nThe American people want to know a couple of things. They want to know: \nIs this going to raise our national deficit? What CBO tells us is, no, \nit will not. More money is going to come in than goes out. There will \nbe savings incorporated in the legislation, and that is a good thing. \nWe have a $12 trillion national debt, and we do not want to add to \nthat.\n  But people are also asking how are you going to raise the money? How \nare you going to pay for this? Where does the $800 billion to $1 \ntrillion come from? Here is where we have a bit of differences of \nopinion.\n  In the House, I think they have, once again, done the right thing. \nWhat the House has done is raise $460 billion, with a surcharge on the \ntop three-tenths of 1 percent of taxpayers. These are the wealthiest \npeople in this country. What the House has said, quite appropriately, \nis that at a time when the gap between the rich and everybody else is \ngrowing wider and at a time when the top 1 percent earn more income \nthan the bottom 50 percent, it is appropriate, especially after all of \nPresident Bush's tax breaks, to ask the wealthy to start paying their \nfair share of taxes so we can provide health insurance to tens of \nmillions of Americans. That, in my view, is exactly the right way to \ngo.\n  Unfortunately, in the Senate, we have not done that. What we have \nchosen to do in the Senate is to raise about--I do not know the exact \nnumber--but we have chosen to impose an excise tax of 40 percent on so-\ncalled Cadillac plans. The problem is, given the substantial increase \nin health care costs in this country, a Cadillac plan today in 5 or 10 \nyears may be a junk car plan.\n  I believe with a struggling middle class, with people desperately \ntrying to hold onto their standard of living, the last thing the Senate \nwants to do is impose a tax on millions and millions of working people \nwho have fought hard to get a halfway decent health care plan.\n  Let me very briefly read from a fact sheet that came from the \nCommunications Workers of America. CWA is one of the largest unions in \nthis country. Similar to almost every union, they are strongly opposed \nto this excise tax on health care benefits. This is what they say. I \nread right from it. This is a document from the CWA:\n\n       The U.S. Senate will soon vote on legislation that would \n     tax CWA-negotiated employer health plans. The tax will be \n     passed directly onto working families. To avoid the tax, \n     employers will try to significantly cut benefits for active \n     workers and pre-Medicare retirees.\n       How the House Benefits Tax Works.\n       A 40-percent excise tax would be assessed on the value of \n     health care plans exceeding $23,000 for a family and $8,500 \n     for an individual starting in 2013. (Levels are higher for \n     pre-Medicare retiree plans and high-risk industry plans--\n     $26,000 and $9,850.)\n\n  And here is an important point. Because while people may not have to \npay this tax in a couple of years, with health care costs soaring, they \nwill have to pay this tax in the reasonably near future.\n  Quoting from the CWA document:\n\n       These ``thresholds'' would increase at the rate of general \n     inflation, plus 1 percentage point, or 3 percent. This is \n     well below the medical inflation rate (4 percent) and about \n     half the rate (6 percent) at which employer and union plan \n     costs have been increasing.\n\n  In other words, the cost of health care is rising a lot faster than \ninflation, which today is almost zero. It may actually be below zero, \nthe point being that in a number of years, so-called Cadillac plans are \ngoing to reach the threshold upon which middle-class workers are going \nto be forced to pay a lot in taxes.\n  Let me go back to the CWA now. They write:\n\n       Health Benefits Tax Will Hit CWA--\n\n  And they are talking about many union workers here.\n\n     --CWA-negotiated Plans Hard and Result in Deep Cuts. In 40 of \n     43 states examined over 10 years (2013-2022) the average \n     excise taxes assessed on each worker in CWA's most popular \n     plans will be: $13,300 per active worker in the family plan.\n\n  That is for a 10-year period, $13,300.\n\n       $5,800 per active single worker, $13,600 for pre-Medicare \n     retiree in the family plan, and $4,400 for pre-Medicare \n     retiree in the single plan.\n\n  The bottom line is that the middle class in this country is \nstruggling. We are in the midst of the most severe recession since the \nGreat Depression of the 1930s. People are working longer hours for \nlower wages. The middle class is on the verge of collapse. The Senate \nshould not be imposing an additional tax on middle-class workers. The \nHouse got it right; the Senate got it wrong, and I intend to offer an \namendment to take out this tax and replace it with a progressive tax \nsimilar to what exists in the House.\n  Let me conclude by simply saying this: I understand that the \nleadership wants to move this bill forward as quickly as possible. I \nunderstand that. But in my view, we have a lot of work in front of us \nto improve this plan. Among many other things--many other things--and I \nknow other Members have different ideas--at the very least, States in \nthis country--individual States--if they so choose, should be able to \ndevelop a single-payer plan for their States. Because at the end of the \nday, in my view, the only way we are going to provide comprehensive, \ncost-effective, universal care is through a single payer.\n  I know some people are saying: Well, we are dealing with health care, \nwe are not going to be back for a long time. If this bill were passed \ntomorrow, trust me, we would be back in a few years, because health \ncare costs are going to continue to soar. Winston Churchill once said: \n``The American people always do the right thing when they have no other \noption.'' And I think that is what we are looking at right now. We are \nrunning out of options.\n  What we have put together is an enormously complicated patchwork \npiece of legislation. It is going to help a lot of people. It involves \ninsurance reform, which is absolutely right. We have a lot of money \ninto disease prevention, which we should have. There are a lot of very \ngood things in this bill. But it is not going to solve, in my view, the \nhealth care crisis. Costs are going to soar. If we don't have the \ncourage as a body to take on the insurance companies, to take on the \ndrug companies, at the very least let us give States--whether it is \nVermont, Pennsylvania, California, or other States--the right to become \na model for America; to provide health care to all people in a cost-\neffective way through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system. We have \nto do that.\n\n[[Page S12699]]\n\n  The other thing we have to do, in my view, is to get rid of this tax \non the middle class by taxing health care benefits. Mr. President, you \nwill recall that a year ago we were in a highly controversial and \ndifficult Presidential campaign. One candidate, who happened to have \nlost that election--a Member of the Senate, Senator McCain--came up \nwith a plan that was exactly--or very close to it--to what we are \ntalking about today. Then-Senator Barack Obama, who won that election, \ncame up with a different plan, because he said that wasn't a good idea. \nWell, how do you think millions of American workers are going to feel \nwhen they say: Wait a second, the guy who won told me he was against \ntaxing health care plans, and now we are adopting the program of the \nguy who lost. How do the American people who voted in that election \nhave faith in their elected officials if we do exactly what we said we \nwould not do?\n  So I believe we have to move toward a progressive way of funding this \nhealth care plan. As I stand here right now, this plan has a lot of \ngood stuff in it, but there are a lot of problems in it. I very much \nlook forward to the opportunity to be able to offer a number of \namendments to strengthen this bill. It is very important to the people \nof Vermont and to people all over this country that not only I but the \nPresiding Officer and other Members have a right to offer amendments. \nBecause if this bill gets whizzed right through, and is not as strong \nas it possibly can be, I think we will not have done the job we need to \ndo.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as chairman of the Special Committee on \nAging, the plight of vulnerable seniors is a subject of great concern \nto me. The committee is charged with uncovering problems that endanger \nthe health and welfare of older adults and developing policy to prevent \nseniors from becoming victims of fraudulent scams and abuse.\n  During this Congress, I have been fortunate to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Lincoln and Hatch and Stabenow, in advancing \npolicy to reduce elder abuse. The Senate health care reform bill now \nincludes both the Elder Justice Act and the Patient Safety and Abuse \nPrevention Act, and we will do our utmost to see that they become law.\n  Today I am pleased to continue the effort to protect America's \nvulnerable seniors by introducing an amendment that combines two very \nvaluable bills, the Elder Abuse Victims Act and the National Silver \nAlert Act. Both have been passed by the House of Representatives.\n  Elder abuse is a sad scourge on our society, often hidden from sight \nby the victis themselves. Even so, experts conservatively estimate that \nas many as 2 million Americans age 65 and older have been injured, \nexploited or otherwise mistreated by someone on whom they depend for \ncare or protection.\n  As Federal policymakers, it is time that we step forward and tackle \nthis chaenge with dedicated efforts and more vigorous programs that \nwill make fighting elder abuse as high a priority as ongoing efforts to \ncounter child abuse.\n  It is in this spirit that I am offering an amendment to give the \nDepartment of Justice a roadmap for how to establish programs to \nbolster the frontline responses of state and local prosecutors, aid \nvictims, and build a robust infrastructure for identifying and \naddressing elder abuse far more effectively than we do today.\n  We need to provide assistance to our courts, which would benefit from \nhaving access to designated staff that boast particular expertise in \nelder abuse. Specialized protocols may be required where victims are \nunable to testify on their own behalf, due to cognitive impairments or \npoor physical health. And there is a great need for specialized \nknowledge to support successful prosecutions and enhance the \ndevelopment of case law. Today, many state elder abuse statutes lack \nadequate provisions to encourage wide reporting of abuse and \nexploitation, more thorough investigations and greater prosecution of \nabuse cases.\n\n  For the victims of elder abuse, many of whom are physically frail and \nvery frightened, we must do much more. First and foremost, we must be \nmore responsive. Not too long ago, it was difficult to even get an \nabuse case investigated. While that is starting to change, we have much \nwork ahead. For example, sometimes emergency interventions are \nnecessary, particularly if the older person is being harmed at the \nhands of family members or trusted ``friends.'' It may be necessary to \nremove the older adult from his or her home to a temporary safe haven. \nTo do this, we must build a much more robust system of support.\n  And there is more we must do to assist vulnerable seniors who may not \nbe abused, but who are nonetheless vulnerable because they suffer from \ncognitive impairment. As the prevalence of dementia rises in our aging \nsociety, we have a special responsibility to ensure that those who ``go \nmissing'' from home are returned promptly and safely. This is the \npurpose of the second part of the amendment, which proposes to create a \nnational program to coordinate State Silver Alert systems.\n  The Amber Alert system, on which the Silver Alert Act is modeled, was \ncreated as a Federal program to rapidly filter reported information on \nmissing children and transmit relevant details to law enforcement \nauthorities and the public as quickly as possible. Using the same \ninfrastructure as Amber Alerts, 11 States have already responded to the \nproblem of missing seniors by establishing Silver Alert systems at very \nlittle additional cost. These programs have created public notification \nsystems triggered by the report of a missing senior. Postings on \nhighways, radio, television, and other forms of media broadcast \ninformation about the missing senior to assist in locating and \nreturning the senior safely home. Now we have an opportunity to finish \nthe job and create Silver Alert programs across the country.\n  Both of the provisions in this amendment are strongly supported by \nthe Elder Justice Coalition. I ask my colleagues to support this \namendment, and by doing so to markedly reduce the risk of harm to our \nmost vulnerable citizens.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it appears I am going to be closing \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Vida Chan Lin. The Las \nVegas Asian Chamber of Commerce recently named Vida Chan Lin as their \nfirst female president. For many years, Lin has been an advocate for \nNevada's Asian Pacific Islander American, APIA, community. Her early \nexposure to the complexities of business and the APIA community has \ncultivated the passion and talent necessary for success.\n  Vida Chan Lin moved to Las Vegas in 1994 and began developing her \ncareer as an insurance sales representative. Within a few years, Lin \npursued her entrepreneurial interests and launched an insurance agency \nnamed V Insurance. The company was committed to providing outstanding \nservice and education to Asian and minority communities in Nevada. Vida \nChan Lin's success continued when she was named vice president after a \nmerger between V Insurance and Western Risk Insurance.\n  Vida Chan Lin's continued involvement and dedication with supporting \nlocal community and business organizations resulted in a significant \npartnership that benefits families and businesses across Nevada. Lin \nhas also advanced local business endeavors through her work with the \nAsian Chamber of Commerce, ACC, and the OCA Las Vegas Chapter. During \nher tenure in ACC, she helped develop annual events such as the Chinese \nNew Year Community Achievement Awards Dinner, Bill Endow Golf \nTournament, and Asian Business Night. Her help with the OCA Las Vegas \nChapter resulted in two national events to be held in Las Vegas for the \nfirst time--the\n\n[[Page S12700]]\n\nOCA National Convention and the National Asian Pacific American \nCorporate Achievement Awards.\n  Being a leader in the Asian Pacific Islander American community has \nprovided Vida Chan Lin an opportunity to affect younger generations. \nHer positive attitude and passion for APIA issues brought forth an \ninspiration within our youth to provide for their communities. Lin \npromotes and ensures that the voice of APIA youth is heard. She \ncontinues to dedicate time for students involved in the OCA Las Vegas \nChapter and ACC by engaging them in entrepreneurial development \nopportunities such as the Clark County Summer Business Institute.\n  As she continues to advance her career and charitable interests, Vida \ncontinues to give great care to her family. Las Vegas is better as a \nplace because of dedicated people like Vida Chan Lin. Vida's dynamic \nambition reminds me of a quote from one of this country's greatest \nPresidents. Teddy Roosevelt once said:\n\n       The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, \n     whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives \n     valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; because \n     there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who \n     actually strive to do the deed; who knows the great \n     enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends himself in a \n     worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of \n     high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least \n     he fails while daring greatly. So that his place shall never \n     be with those cold timid souls who know neither victory not \n     defeat.\n\n  Vida is not a timid soul. She strives for success with her family, \ncareer, and community.\n  I know that Vida Chan Lin and the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce \nhave a bright and blessed future. I congratulate Vida on being the \nfirst woman to lead the Asian Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/08/senate-section/article/S12700-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12700-S12701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ALBERT E. DIX\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, all of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has \nsuffered a great loss with the recent death of Albert E. Dix. A fourth-\ngeneration journalist, Al Dix moved to Frankfort, Kentucky's State \ncapital, to become publisher of The State Journal in 1962, a post he \nwould keep until his retirement in 1996. Known for being a mentor to \naspiring journalists, Al Dix helped train scores of individuals who \nwent on to work at papers with much larger circulations. But he was \nmore than just one of Kentucky's finest journalists. As one of his \nformer press foremen put it, ``He treated all employees really well, \njust like they were his family. He was a really good person all \naround.''\n  Indeed, Al Dix leaves behind a legacy as not only a superb publisher \nbut as a pillar of his community. While I could say much more about my \nfriend Al Dix, I think it appropriate for me to share with my \ncolleagues a recent account of Al's life, which was published by The \nState Journal on December 3, 2009. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfull article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the State-Journal, Dec. 2, 2009]\n\n          Former Publisher Al Dix Remembered as Caring Leader\n\n                           (By Charlie Pearl)\n\n       Journalists, bankers, politicians, educators and others \n     today paid tribute to Al Dix as a sensitive and caring \n     publisher who was dedicated to improving the community but \n     kept his good works private.\n       Dix died at his home in Frankfort Tuesday morning of \n     pancreatic cancer. He was 80. Services will be 2 p.m. Friday \n     at South Frankfort Presbyterian Church with visitation at \n     noon. Burial will follow at Frankfort Cemetery.\n       Richard Wilson, who retired from The (Louisville) Courier-\n     Journal as its higher education reporter, got his first job \n     in newspapers with The State Journal under Dix in 1963 and \n     1964.\n       ``That helped me immensely during a nearly 40-year career \n     in journalism,'' Wilson said. ``Much of the reason for that \n     was Al, who was unquestionably a reporter's publisher. He was \n     encouraging, respected quality work and openly shared his \n     enthusiasm for its appearance in the newspaper.\n       ``While he may have held strong views on many subjects, he \n     never permitted them to permeate The State Journal's news \n     columns and he respected those who believed otherwise. He \n     also frequently took a personal interest in his employees and \n     their well-being, both professionally and personally.''\n       Bruce Brooks, retired executive vice president at Farmers \n     Bank, said he always considered Dix ``a dear friend. He was a \n     little bit of a mentor to me.\n       ``He was always willing to be a listening board for any \n     situation. He was free with his advice and usually it was \n     pretty sound and analytical.''\n       Brooks said Dix was master of ceremonies at various \n     functions, ``and was really, really skilled at it. And he \n     always had an open checkbook for a worthy cause. He would \n     walk the walk and talk the talk.''\n       Former City Commissioner Pat Layton said Dix encouraged her \n     to start her real estate career.\n       ``He had a lot of insight of what was going on in the \n     community,'' Layton said. ``It wasn't because he was \n     publisher of a newspaper but because he really loved his \n     community.\n       ``He was truly a leader. But a lot of people didn't know \n     about the many things he did for Frankfort because he was \n     very private about it. He was a silent supporter. When there \n     was a need, he was there and stepped right up front. He was a \n     special guy.''\n       State Sen. Julian Carroll, who was governor while Dix was \n     publisher, said, ``Al was a great community-minded leader. \n     Although he was a Republican and I'm a Democrat, he was \n     always very nice and cordial to me. I considered him to be \n     one of our outstanding citizens.''\n       Bob Roach, a retired school teacher and former city \n     commissioner and county judge-executive, said Dix ``was \n     certainly interested in young people and education, and he \n     believed in excellence. He was a prince of a fellow.''\n       While teaching at Franklin County High School, Roach said \n     he took groups of students to Washington, D.C., for 25 years \n     to participate in a North American Invitational Model United \n     Nations program, ``and we could always count on him for a \n     donation.''\n       By sponsoring an annual State Journal All-Academic Banquet, \n     Dix encouraged students to excel in the classroom, Roach \n     said, ``and he encouraged teachers by recognizing them as \n     well.''\n       Dix could also be a confidant, Roach said.\n       ``You could go talk to him about an issue and you knew it \n     would always be in confidence,'' Roach said. ``And I knew his \n     advice would be on target.''\n       Attorney Bill Kirkland, a former Paul Sawyier Public \n     Library president, said Dix was on a special gifts committee \n     during fundraising for the new library and he came faithfully \n     to every meeting.\n       ``He had numerous contacts in the community and personally \n     added immeasurably to the quality of the library through the \n     gifts he solicited.\n       ``He was a person of intellect, humor, good personality and \n     good judgment. There was never a kinder soul and more \n     generous person in the community.''\n       Kirkland said their friendship spanned four decades.\n       ``About 40 years ago, we played one-wall handball at the \n     old YMCA on Bridge Street. I knew him first through his \n     connection with South Frankfort Presbyterian Church, and \n     through a few Republican endeavors. He certainly was a \n     conservative after my own heart.\n       ``He had extraordinary compassion and was interested in \n     literacy, education, good government and ethical behavior.''\n       Bruce Dungan, retired president of Farmers Capital Bank \n     Corporation, said when Dix first came to Frankfort from Ohio, \n     ``I could tell he was here to be a friend of Frankfort. He \n     was very thoughtful of people.\n       ``He was here to help people, charities, government and his \n     church. He worked so hard at charities. He would call me and \n     say what I had given last year, and then say, `Don't you \n     think you ought to raise it a little this time?'\n       ``If it hadn't been for Al, the YMCA (on Broadway) may \n     never have happened. He kept pushing everybody. He did \n     whatever he could to improve Frankfort. He was one of the \n     greatest guys in Frankfort that I know of. We're going to \n     miss him. I sure will.''\n       Irvine Gershman, a retired downtown merchant, said Dix \n     ``coming here from Ohio was probably one of the best things \n     to happen to Frankfort. He was always willing to do things \n     for other people.\n       ``He and his family have contributed so much to this \n     community. When I would call on him for a little help (to \n     various charities), he would just say, `How much do you \n     need?' ''\n       Gershman's wife, Priscilla, said Dix ``was a precious \n     jewel. He will be sorely missed by everyone.''\n       Russ McClure, a former vice president of Morehead State \n     University, said he was ``under the gun a lot of times'' \n     while serving as Finance Cabinet secretary to Carroll and \n     assistant budget director to Bert Combs when they were \n     governors.\n       ``One thing I could always count on was Al being straight \n     up and fair,'' McClure said. ``He was always straightforward \n     with his questions and always accurate in his reporting of my \n     answers and the facts.''\n       The Rev. John Hunt, retired pastor of South Frankfort \n     Presbyterian Church, said he has fond memories of getting to \n     cover one of the launches of the Gemini space program in the \n     early 1960s for The State Journal because of Dix.\n       ``He knew of my interest in science and he credentialed \n     me,'' Hunt recalled.\n       When Hunt got to Cape Canaveral, bad weather caused the \n     flight to be postponed, so he figured he would have to miss \n     the experience because he would need to get back to Frankfort \n     for Sunday church services.\n\n[[Page S12701]]\n\n       But Dix encouraged him to stay in Florida, saying he would \n     give the sermon on Sunday, Hunt said.\n       ``He filled the pulpit for me and did an excellent job,'' \n     Hunt said. ``He got rave reviews and supplied the pulpit on \n     my absences after that. I was about ready to swap places with \n     him.''\n       Scottie Willard, who retired in September as press foreman \n     after 44 years at The State Journal, remembers when Dix \n     became publisher in 1962.\n       ``He made a lot of improvements as far as press equipment \n     when he took over,'' Willard said. ``He treated all employees \n     really well, just like they were his family. He was a really \n     good person all around.''\n       Ronnie Martin, retired composing foreman who worked at the \n     newspaper 43 years, agrees.\n       ``He was super to work for,'' Martin said. ``He gave me all \n     sorts of opportunities and challenges at the same time, but \n     they all worked out. He was a great guy. He treated everybody \n     fairly.''\n       Ann Maenza, Dix's daughter, now publisher of The State \n     Journal, said her father ``never cut corners. He always made \n     sure things were done right. He was old school, fair and \n     honest.''\n       Amy Dix Rock, senior director of regulatory and scientific \n     affairs at Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Nashville, \n     Tenn., said her father was ``always thinking of others. We \n     don't know how many things he's done for others because he \n     didn't talk about it.\n       ``That's the way he was. He was soft-spoken but when he did \n     speak you listened.''\n       Al Smith, who rose to prominence in the state as a weekly \n     newspaper publisher and as the longtime host of KET's \n     ``Comment on Kentucky,'' said Dix was a newspaper publisher \n     of the old school, ``but the opposite of the domineering \n     egotistic bosses who bullied employees and squeezed the news \n     to match their biases.\n       `` `Old school' means that we always knew that with Al at \n     The State Journal, it was like the grocery slogan of years \n     ago, `the owner is in the store.' He didn't have to call a \n     distant headquarters to know what to say or do.\n       ``He had strong views, conservative Republican in a \n     `company town' (state government) of readers who are mostly \n     Democratic, but he ran the paper on principles of fairness in \n     the news columns and gave his editorial writers, who were \n     mostly more liberal than he, free rein on the opinion page.''\n       Smith noted how The State Journal under Dix supported a \n     constitutional amendment that overhauled the state's judicial \n     system and created what is today the Supreme Court. Smith \n     also noted the newspaper's spotlight on corruption in \n     government and how Dix shunned personal publicity.\n       ``Once I wrote him a private note about something very \n     generous he had done to help someone in trouble,'' Smith \n     said. ``I heard nary a word in reply. But I didn't expect it. \n     I am sure he was embarrassed that I even knew.''\n       Born Aug. 18, 1929, in Ravenna, Ohio, Albert E. Dix majored \n     in political science and was a 1951 graduate of Denison \n     University in Granville, Ohio.\n       He served in the U.S. Army Intelligence from 1953-1955.\n       A fourth-generation journalist, Dix first worked at The \n     Times-Leader in Bellaire, Ohio, where his father was \n     publisher. He moved to Frankfort in October 1962 to become \n     publisher of The State Journal. He retired in 1996 as \n     publisher and president of Wooster Republican Printing Co., \n     the parent company of The State Journal, which now owns seven \n     newspapers.\n       The Kentucky Book Fair was founded by The State Journal in \n     1981.\n       Dix also was a member of the board of directors of First \n     Capital Bank of Kentucky, the Frankfort/Franklin County \n     Industrial Development Authority and the local Kiwanis Club; \n     and served two terms as chairman of the American Saddlebred \n     Museum at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington.\n       He loved fishing and making fishing rods, electric trains \n     and saddlebred horses.\n       Other survivors include his wife of 56 years, Edna Dix; a \n     son, Troy Dix, publisher of the Ashland Times-Gazette in \n     Ohio; and four grandchildren, Evan, Stewart and Melissa Dix \n     and Lauren Maenza.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/08/senate-section/article/S12701-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12701-S12703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor for S. 428, the \nFreedom to Travel to Cuba Act.\n  It is time we brought our strengths to bear--our people, our vision, \nour energy--to help the Cuban people shape the future direction of Cuba \nand to fix a policy that has manifestly failed. For America to act as \nthe great power we are, with confidence in our values and vision, we \nneed a Cuba policy that looks forward.\n  The truth is, we have reached out to countries where our wounds were \nfar deeper, and far more recent. When John McCain and I led the efforts \nto unfreeze our relationship with Vietnam, we said: ``let's be honest . \n. . the Cold War is over. All the American trade embargo is doing is \nkeeping Vietnam poor and thus encouraging a flood of refugees.''\n  For nearly 20 years after the fall of Saigon, the Vietnam war took a \nless bloody but equally hostile form. The U.S. and Vietnam had no \ndiplomatic relations. Vietnamese assets were frozen. Trade was \nembargoed. But in 1995 the United States normalized relations with \nVietnam. The Cold War had ended, and we even signed a trade deal with a \ncountry where 58,000 Americans had given their lives.\n  The results? A Vietnam that is less isolated, more market-oriented, \nand, yes, freer--though it has miles to go.\n  And yet, when it comes to Cuba, a small, impoverished island 90 miles \noff the shores of Florida, we maintain a policy of embargo--motivated \nby past grievance, not present realities and future dreams. Fidel \nCastro has stepped aside from day-to-day government, there is a new \nAmerican President, and Cuban-Americans increasingly want broad, far-\nreaching interaction across the Florida Straits. Times are changing, \nand we cannot live in the past.\n  Forty-seven years ago, I was in my first semester of college when \nSoviet missiles, deployed in Cuba, threatened to set the world on fire. \nNo one who lived through those thirteen harrowing days in October will \never forget them. Certainly, the threat from Cuba was real.\n  It is true that we continue to disapprove of Cuba's dismal human \nrights record and palpable lack of freedom. And it is also true that, \nover 50 years, the embargo can claim some successes. For example, it \ncan be reasonably argued that U.S. pressure contributed to Cuba's \ndecision to cease its military adventurism in Africa and its support \nfor the violent insurgencies that ripped apart Central America in the \n1980s.\n  But on the two most important questions, the verdict is decisive:\n  First, did this policy fulfill its often-stated purpose of \noverthrowing the Castro regime? Fidel Castro outlasted nine American \nPresidents, from Eisenhower to Clinton, and retired only for reasons of \nhealth during the tenth. When he passed on the reins to his brother, \nFidel joined Omar Bongo of Gabon and Libya's Colonel Qaddafi as one of \nthe world's longest-serving head of states.\n  Second, have the benefits of our policy outweighed the costs? It is \nhard to argue they have. The embargo has cost Cubans access to our \nmarkets, and for many years to our food and medicine--with little \nprogress to show. But it has cost us as well. It has limited the \ninfluence of our people and our democracy. What's more, this fall's \nU.N. vote condemning America's embargo showed yet again: Cuba is not \nthe only country isolated by our policy. The vote against our policy \nwas 187 to 3. All of our major allies voted against us, and one of the \ntwo voting with us itself routinely trades with Cuba.\n  Is it morally satisfying to sanction a government whose human rights \npractices we abhor and whose political system rejects many of our \nvalues? Sure. And helping Cubans to live in democracy and liberty \nabsolutely remains a goal of American policy. But for 47 years now, we \nhave endorsed an embargo in the name of democracy that produced no \ndemocracy!\n  In fact, our rhetoric and policies have actually helped to \nconsolidate the Cuban government. We have provided the Castro regime \nwith an all-purpose--if exaggerated--excuse to draw attention away from \nits many shortcomings, including its shamelessly flawed economic model. \nFor too many Cubans, our threats have legitimized Castro's outsized \nnationalism and repression of opponents. Our posture has played to his \nstrengths.\n  At the same time, we have not brought our strengths to bear--our \npeople, our vision, our energy, our opportunities. It is time for \nAmerica to act as the great power it is--with greatness built on \nconfidence in our values and vision.\n  Of course, the greatest cost of our policy has been borne by the \nCuban people themselves. Jose Marti, Cuba's great ``Apostle'' and man \nof letters, once said: ``Everything that divides men, everything that \nclassifies, separates or shuts off men, is a sin against humanity.'' \nMore than 70 percent of Cuba's 11\\1/2\\ million people have lived their \nentire lives in this stalemate. A Cuban boy or girl of 10 when Fidel \nCastro drove victorious into Havana is 60 years old today. His whole \nlife has been spent deprived of basic freedoms but\n\n[[Page S12702]]\n\nalso deprived--in accordance with U.S. policies except during brief \nperiods--of interaction with America's people.\n  We must have the courage to admit the need for a new approach. \nPresident Kennedy, who instituted sanctions against Cuba, had by mid-\n1963 set in motion secret contacts aimed at normalizing relations. Ford \nand Carter, too, looked for ways out of the box. George H.W. Bush \ncooperated with Cuba on the Angola peace accord, and his administration \neven dangled a promise of improved ties with America. Each initiative \nfailed for a different reason, but all were grounded in the same \nrecognition: there must be a better way forward.\n  Fortunately, we know there is a different strategy that can succeed. \nThe Clinton administration worked to refocus our policy around what \nmatters: on the Cuban people, not the Castro brothers; on the future, \nnot the past; and on America's long-term national interests, not the \npolitical expediencies of a given moment.\n  The Clinton administration promoted people-to-people relations \n``unilaterally''--without conditions on Havana. We worked to improve \nbilateral cooperation on issues like migration and combating drug \ntrafficking, which were clearly in our national interest. Family travel \nin both directions quickly skyrocketed. And tens of thousands of \nAmericans from across society--church members, academics and students, \nmedical professionals, athletes, journalists, and more--were permitted \nto interact with their Cuban counterparts.\n  Those policies sent a clear and effective message to the Cuban \npeople: the United States is not who your leaders say we are. Our \nproblem is not now, nor has it ever been, with the Cuban people. We \ncompletely changed the dynamic: A synagogue with holes in its roof so \nbig that birds flew around the sanctuary has been repaired with funds \nand materials from American supporters. Environmentalists worked \ntogether to save species and protect our shared environment. The \nchildren who received bats and balls--and moral support--from Baltimore \nOrioles players visiting Cuba for an exhibition game will never forget \nthe gesture of American generosity.\n  And guess what. Across the board, Cubans seeking a better future for \ntheir country have said that nothing energized civil society in Cuba \nmore than contact with U.S. civil society. Even Cuba's human rights and \ndemocracy activists benefitted immeasurably from the contact.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration shut down most forms of \ncontact and dramatically reduced our interactions to a tightly \nregulated, government controlled trickle. They tightened licensing \nprocedures, reduced transparency, and put government in the people's \nway in what amounted to a unilateral suspension of Americans' ability \nto help Cubans shape their future. People-to-people relations were made \nsecretive, filtered, and for narrow objectives. That is the opposite of \npro-democracy.\n  Regrettably, that was the record of the Bush administration: an \nenormous step backwards. Now it's up to the Obama administration to \ncraft a Cuba policy that moves us forward.\n  In May 2008, Barack Obama said on the Presidential campaign trail \nthat it was ``time for a new strategy.'' While he wasn't ready to give \nup the embargo as a source of leverage, he did declare at the Summit of \nthe Americas: ``The United States seeks a new beginning with Cuba,'' \nand announced that he was ``prepared to have [the] Administration \nengage with the Cuban government on a wide range of issues.''\n  As promised, the Obama administration has expanded licenses for \nCuban-Americans--albeit only Cuban-Americans--to travel to Cuba. \nControls on family remittances, gift parcels, and certain transactions \nwith telecommunications companies were loosened as well. Mid-level \ntalks about immigration matters and postal relations have resumed. And \nwe've turned off an Orwellian electronic billboard flashing political \nmessages from our Interests Section in Havana.\n  These are positive steps, but they are only a start. So what comes \nnext?\n  At a minimum, the administration should use the authorities that it \nhas to reinvigorate people-to-people relations--to unleash the energy \nof the American people who want to help Cubans build their future. The \npolicy worked in the past and enjoyed wide support in both countries.\n  When announcing expanded family travel, the President said, ``There \nare no better ambassadors for freedom than Cuban-Americans.'' But I \nthink it's also fair to say that there are excellent ambassadors for \nfreedom among the 299 million other Americans--religious faithful, \nteachers and students, environmentalists, scholars, doctors and nurses, \npolitical scientists, and artists--whose challenging minds, economic \nsuccess, love for democracy, and advocacy of solid American values make \nthem proud ambassadors as well.\n  The New York Philharmonic and its board of directors have been \nbrilliant representatives of America on trips to North Korea, Vietnam \nand around the world. I don't understand why the administration \nrecently blocked their proposed trip to Cuba. What are we afraid of?\n  Second, as we reinvigorate people-to-people diplomacy, the \nadministration should review the programs that the Bush administration \nfunded generously to substitute for it.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is already undertaking an \ninvestigation into the need to reform Radio and TV Marti--programming \nbeamed into Cuba at a cost of $35 million a year. Many Cubans call TV \nMarti ``La TV que no se ve'' because it has never, in 18 years of \nbroadcast, had a significant audience in Cuba. Report after report has \ndocumented that the Marti services are hindered by bad management, weak \nprofessional tradecraft, and serious politicization. We are looking at \nwhether its business model--as a ``surrogate service'' exempt from many \nVoice of America standards and regulations--has failed, and whether the \nTV service should be closed entirely and radio should be integrated \ninto the high-quality VOA services. We ought to be especially concerned \nthat human rights activists in Cuba a key bellwether audience are \nunanimous in their view that the Marti brand must be repaired.\n  Meanwhile, USAID's civil-society programs, totaling $45 million in \n2008, have noble objectives, but we need to examine whether we're \nachieving any of them. The Bush administration changed the program's \nfocus from supporting the Cuban people to accelerating regime change, \nand the fact that some of our grantees have extravagantly high \noverheads has raised concerns about where all the money is going. It is \nalso fair to ask whether these programs even work.\n  Bush's refocus on regime change made it difficult for Cubans outside \ndeclared antiregime groups to accept the informational materials or \nassistance offered--even if they had a burning desire for it. Our \ninterests section used to distribute tens of thousands of books a year \nto Cubans across the political spectrum and the books could be seen, \nwell-worn, in government and Communist party think tanks. Today, \npoliticization has reduced the flow of information to many of the very \nsame people eager to steer Cuba toward a better future.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has begun a review of these programs. \nIt is in the administration's interest to take the lead in overhauling \nthem.\n  Finally, as I mentioned at the outset, I want to address legislation \nthat will go even farther toward fixing our Cuba policy. S. 428, the \nFreedom to Travel to Cuba Act, does not lift the embargo or normalize \nrelations. It merely stops our government from regulating or \nprohibiting travel to or from Cuba by U.S. citizens or legal residents, \nexcept in certain obviously inappropriate circumstances.\n  The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act has strong support in Congress--33 \nsponsors in the Senate and 180 cosponsors for similar legislation in \nthe House. I cosponsored similar legislation in the past, and I am \nproud to do so again. We are talking about restoring a fundamental \nAmerican right--the right to travel--that is denied to Americans \nnowhere else in the world. Americans who can get a visa are free to \ntravel to Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and even North Korea, and it makes no \nsense to deny them the right to travel to a poor island near Florida. \nThere is a certain irony in the fact that Americans have to apply for \nlicenses and wait, with little or no feedback, to travel to a country \nthat we criticize for denying its\n\n[[Page S12703]]\n\ncitizens the right to travel. The current ban on travel contravenes the \nspirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights' statement that \n``everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and \nto return to his country.''\n  Free travel also makes for good policy inside Cuba. Visits from \nAmericans would have the same positive effects as people-to-people \nexchanges, but on a larger scale. Visiting Europeans and Canadians have \nalready increased the flow of information and hard currency to ordinary \nCubans, with a significant impact on the country. Cuba's economic \nmodel, for sure, remains profoundly flawed, and human rights conditions \nremain dismal. But the hard-currency sectors of the Cuban economy have \nsignificantly altered workers' dependence on the regime, introduced \nmaterial incentives that are changing economic culture, and raised \nexpectations, if not demands, for greater improvements in the future. \nAfter years of Cuban government propaganda, Americans are even better \npositioned than Europeans and Canadians to be catalysts of change. We \ncan do more if we let them.\n  That is one reason why all of Cuba's major pro-democracy groups \nsupport free travel. Freedom House, Human Rights Watch, and other \ngroups critical of Cuba's government agree. Studies of change in \nEastern and Central Europe show a direct correlation between contact \nwith the outside world and the peacefulness and durability of \ndemocratic transitions.\n  This is a policy whose time has come. Numerous polls of Americans--of \nCuban origin and otherwise--show strong support. Non-Cuban-Americans \nhave long supported easing restrictions. But here is what is \nsurprising: one recent poll found that 59 percent of Cuban-Americans--\nthe group most widely thought to oppose a change in policy--actually \nsupport allowing all American citizens to travel to Cuba. As the \nproportion of Cuban Americans who arrived after 1980 increases, support \nfor free travel is only growing. In fact, even many Cuban emigres 65 \nyears and older, once passionately opposed to it, now favor free \ntravel. This is a sea change in the attitudes of Cuban-Americans, and \nwe should not ignore it.\n  Change is in the air--in Havana, in Washington, and in major Cuban-\nAmerican communities. I don't personally hold high hopes that the \ntransfer of power from Fidel to Raul Castro and to the next generation \nof hand-picked loyalists portends rapid change, but it is obvious that \nthe Cuba of today is not the Cuba of the 60s or even the 90s, and that \nour policy should not be stuck in time either. Cubans are searching for \nmodels for the future, and our economic system and democratic ideals \nappeal to them.\n  In September, when the Colombian rock star Juanes came to Havana, by \nsome estimates as many as a million people came to hear the concert. \nFrom the stage, he looked out at the Cuban people and started a simple \nchant: Una Sola Familia Cubana. The crowd roared approval at the \nthought of ending the conflict between Cubans across the Florida \nStraits.\n  There is a hunger out there among the Cuban people. America should \ncapitalize on it. They want contact with their own families, and they \nwant contact with American people and American ideas.\n  There is no other country in the world to which we have closed our \nlives as long as we have to Cuba. The Berlin Wall fell 20 years ago, \nbut the wall separating Americans and Cubans has yet to come down.\n  We have a choice to ignore change and resist it or to mold it and \nchannel it into a new set of policies. After 50 years of trying to \nisolate and destroy, it's time to try working with the Cuban people and \nmaking a new future together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/08/senate-section/article/S12703-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12703-S12704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR PAULA HAWKINS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the passing of \nPaula Hawkins, a former colleague of mine in the U.S. Senate and a very \ndear and close personal friend whose service to the Nation and her home \nState of Florida will endure for generations in the heads and hearts of \nher posterity, friends and legions of admirers.\n  In the ranks of those who greatly admire and will dearly miss Paula, \nI stand front and center today to salute this extraordinary woman for \nher accomplishments, outstanding public service, wonderful family and \nexemplary life. As I do so, I am humbled by the magnitude of the task. \nIt is not easy to find the right words to do justice to such a unique \nand choice individual.\n  That said, I guess the first thing that comes to mind about Paula \nHawkins is that, true to her Utah Mormon heritage, she was a pioneer--a \nreal trailblazer who opened doors and windows of opportunity for others \nto follow.\n  Long before there was a Kay Bailey Hutchison, Dianne Feinstein, \nOlympia Snowe or Maria Cantwell in the U.S. Senate, there was Paula \nHawkins. In 1980, she became the first woman elected to that august \nbody for a full term without the benefit of family connections, and she \nwas the first woman from Florida to serve as a Senator.\n  And to the surprise of no one who knew her, she was no shrinking \nviolet in Washington once she arrived. The media may have dismissively \nbilled her as that ``housewife from Maitland,'' but she quickly showed \neveryone that this was one tough homemaker who was acclimated to the \npolitical kitchen and could weather the heat that goes with it. I mean \nto tell you she was tough.\n  Anyone who knows Paula also knows that she was always impeccably \ndressed. Indeed, her appearance was so picture-perfect that she \nprobably made many a Hollywood starlet feel shabby by comparison. To \nsay she was dressed to the nines is like saying Jack Nicklaus was a \nfair golfer or that Shakespeare sort of had a way with words.\n  But Paula was more than a pretty face. Sure, she had perfectly \ncoiffed hair and wore designer clothes and jewelry, but she had a \nrazor-sharp mind to go with her smart appearance, and she quickly \nshowed she was nobody's pushover. She could stand toe to toe and \nverbally slug it out with some of the most powerful and even most \nobnoxious Senators. In other words, she gave more than she got--and her \nopponents, more often than not, got more than they bargained for.\n  She was a great debater, a human dynamo who brought unrivaled energy \nand unbridled enthusiasm to the Senate. She was extremely intelligent \nand tremendously interested in politics--and she was very good at it. A \nquick look at her successful Senate campaign in 1980 attests to just \nhow good she was.\n  By today's big-bucks standards, Paula's campaign was strictly \nbargain-basement. Fox News pundit Dick Morris, her pollster at the \ntime, recalls the campaign being too cash-strapped to afford a \nteleprompter. Aides made do by writing scripts on paper towels and \nunrolling them as Paula spoke. In the end, her powers of persuasion and \ncommand of the facts carried the day with voters.\n  After stirring voters' hearts in Florida, Paula stirred things up in \nthe Nation's Capital. Change was in the wind when she blew into wintry \nWashington in January 1981. For starters, she became the first Senator \nto bring her husband to Washington, which resulted in the Senate wives' \nclub being renamed the Senate spouses' club. She helped spearhead \nlegislation to help widows and women divorcees get back into the job \nmarket. She supported efforts to improve pensions for women and make \nthem more equal to that of men. She further fought to get daycare for \nthe children of Senate employees. Even the all-male Senate gym was no \nsweat for Paula, who forced her fellow Senators to wear swimming suits \nso that she could swim there as well.\n  To me, Paula was a ray of Florida sunshine that brightened my days \nduring the years we served together in the Senate. She was a true blue \nconservative who was warm, witty and cracked wise. We shared many a \njoke and a laugh along with our commonly held moral, ethical and \nreligious beliefs. And we became political allies and fast friends. In \nfact, Paula became and always remained one of my closest friends.\n  Both on and off Capitol Hill, she always could be counted on through \ngood times and bad. I quickly learned that her word was her bond. \nWhenever I needed help, she was always there. And\n\n[[Page S12704]]\n\nI certainly hope the reverse was true--that I was there whenever she \nneeded help.\n  Women, minorities, as well as the elderly with disabilities also \nlearned they could count on Paula. She was a tireless advocate in their \nbehalf--and they loved her for it. She also showed great political \ncourage in 1984, when she disclosed during a hearing that she had been \nmolested as a child. I am sure that horrific childhood experience, in \npart, informed her efforts to champion children's causes.\n  While her legislative accomplishments are too numerous to mention \nhere, I would like to make mention of one in particular. Paula \nspearheaded the Missing Children's Act of 1982, the bill that \ninstituted the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Thanks \nto that landmark legislation, the names of thousands of missing \nchildren are now part of the FBI's national crime database.\n  To secure the bill's passage, Paula personally lobbied President \nReagan. As great a communicator as he was, the ``Great Communicator'' \nknew he had met his match in Paula and lent his support. Of course the \nPresident knew that Paula could always be relied on to help deliver a \nlegislative win for ``the Gipper'' in the Senate--which she did many \ntimes.\n  As a staunch conservative, she found common cause with the President \nand other conservatives, including myself, on numerous issues. She was, \nfor example, an ardent anti-communist who supported the President's \nhard line against Soviet expansionism. She also despised overly big \ngovernment--and, there is certainly a lot to despise in Washington, \nespecially these days.\n  Paula was an unwavering friend for those who shared her values and \ncommitment, but she was an implacable foe of political corruption and \nto those who peddled illegal drugs on our streets and in our schools. \nShe fought for legislation to cut foreign aid to nations that refused \nto reduce their export of harmful drugs. She further assisted in \ncreating the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control and \nhelped initiate the South Florida Drug Task Force.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't say something about Paula's stamina. \nShe could endure as well as endear--often when she was in great pain. \nIn 1982, she was knocked unconscious when a TV studio partition fell on \nher during an interview in Florida.\n  Those of us who worked closely with her know that the years that \nfollowed were often filled with crippling pain. Between votes on the \nSenate floor, she would often go to a room lent to her by Senator Strom \nThurmond in the Capitol and lie in traction in a hospital bed.\n  Despite the immense pain stemming from her debilitating injury, Paula \nsoldiered on during her 1986 bid for re-election. On campaign trips \nacross Florida Paula would sometimes lay in the back seat moaning \nbetween appearances, according to Congressman John Mica, her aide at \nthe time. While she lost that race to Bob Graham, it is amazing that \nshe did so well and a testament to her courage and determination.\n  Paula's service did not end with her Senate term. Her contributions \nto her State, community, family and church over the past 23 years have \nbeen truly significant. She also didn't lose her sense of humor. When a \nFlorida State senator told Paula several years ago that she was trying \nto do a good job, Paula smiled, grasped her hand firmly and said \nsimply: ``Try harder, dear.''\n  As great a public servant she was, Paula was just as remarkable in \nher private life--as a wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. \nShe had a fierce love for each member of her immediate and extended \nfamily. And her husband Gene is no less remarkable. He is one of the \nkindest, most friendly, decent and honorable men I have ever known--and \nhis love for Paula has always been uplifting to behold.\n  In every aspect of their lives, they have been an exemplary couple. \nThey have been just as exemplary as parents. As members of The Church \nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Gene and Paula took to heart the \nMormon teaching that families are forever. They were determined to \nensure that every family member worked hard toward achieving the goal \nof being able to be together in the hereafter. They have a great family \nand are well on their way toward achieving that lofty goal.\n  In the Old Testament book of Proverbs, we read:\n\n       Who can find a virtuous woman, for her price is far above \n     rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so \n     that he shall have no need of spoil . . . She stretcheth out \n     her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to \n     the needy . . . Strength and honor are her clothing; and she \n     shall rejoice in the time to come . . . She looketh well to \n     the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of \n     idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her \n     husband also, and he praiseth her . . . Favour is deceitful \n     and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she \n     shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let \n     her own works praise her in the gates (Proverbs 31:10-31).\n\n  Today, I am honored to have the privilege of adding my voice to the \nchorus of praise for my dear friend, Paula Hawkins. I feel deeply that \na loving Father in heaven and Jesus Christ have already embraced Paula \nand taken her into their care and treatment as one of truly great women \nwho graced this Earth.\n  I truly loved Paula Hawkins. We were best friends. Like Gene and the \nHawkins' three children--Genean, Kevin and Kelly--11 grandchildren and \n10 great-grandchildren, my wife Elaine and I look forward to a joyous \nreunion one day with Paula on the other side of the veil.\n  In the meantime, it is my hope that all of us here in this chamber \nwill reflect on her service and follow her advice to that State \nSenator: Try Harder!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/08/senate-section/article/S12704-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROY OBREITER\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. NELSON, of Nebraska:\n  S. 2846. A bill to authorize the issuance of United States War Bonds \nto aid in funding of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to help finance the war effort without sharp tax increases \nor increased foreign borrowing, The United States War Bonds Act of 2009 \nwill authorize the Treasury to issue and market War Bonds to the \nAmerican people to help finance the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I believe that we need shared sacrifice and fiscal discipline in \nfinancing the war effort. I don't believe our first instinct should \nalways be a rush to tax. The government has gone to great lengths to \naddress the economic downturn and adding new taxes right now could \nundermine those efforts. We need to work to reduce Federal spending \nwherever possible and reduce the growth in spending to finance the war.\n  War bonds are a cost-effective way to reduce our dependence on \nforeign creditors and create an outlet for Americans to express their \npatriotism and support for our servicemembers and America's mission. \nWar bonds allow us to borrow from ourselves, rather than other \ncountries.\n  This legislation finds a precedent in World War II savings bonds. \nFrom May 1, 1941 through December 1945, the War Finance Division and \nits predecessors were responsible for the sale of nearly $186 billion \nworth of government securities. Of this, more than $54 billion was in \nthe form of War Savings bonds.\n  Although the times and economic circumstances are different than the \n1940s, America's commitment to protecting freedom and our way of life \nhas not waned. My hope is that we can tap into the same spirit of \npatriotism and create a sense of participation in the war effort akin \nto that shown by the greatest generation.\n  The new military strategy increasing troops by 30,000 for Afghanistan \nannounced last week by President Obama is estimated to cost $30 billion \nbeyond the baseline for Iraq and Afghanistan funding, which stands \naround $130 billion for 2010. The United States public debt is \ncurrently more than $7.6 trillion and nearly $3.5 trillion--46 \npercent--of the debt is held by foreign investors.While there are no \nsimple solutions to our fiscal woes, while we endeavor to get our \nfiscal house in order, we must also be responsible borrowers and reduce \nour dependence on foreign creditors; this is a step in that direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2847. A bill to regulate the volume of audio on commercials; to \nthe Committee on commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCommercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act of 2009--the CALM Act. \nI want to thank my original cosponsor Senator Schumer for his support \nof this straightforward and commonsense legislation, which would \nrequire the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, to limit the volume \nof television advertisements to a level no louder than the average \nvolume level of the programs during which the advertisements appear. \nThis time for this Act is overdue. All too often over the years, \nAmericans, sitting down after a long workday or workweek to enjoy their \nfavorite television shows, have been assaulted by commercials at \nvolumes that are degrees of magnitude louder than the shows themselves. \nThe FCC first received enough complaints from viewers to look into the \nproblem in the 1960s--when television was in its earliest stages--but \ntechnology did not exist to fix the problem. Each decade, as consumer \ncomplaints piled up, the FCC had to reexamine the loudness issue. \nUnfortunately, it took no action\n\n[[Page S12711]]\n\neven with the technology improved. The complaints continue to this day; \nin the 25 quarterly reports on consumer complaints released by the FCC \nsince 2002, 21 have listed as a top complaint the loudness of \ntelevision commercials.\n  But now, with the digital transition complete and new broadcast \ntechnology available, we can finally take this long-overdue action. We \nnow have a common digital platform used by all broadcasters, which \npresents a terrific opportunity to standardize the loudness of the ads \nbroadcast into our living rooms. As Consumers Union, the nonprofit \norganization that publishes Consumers Report has stated, in testimony \nbefore the House of Representatives, ``the CALM Act provides an elegant \nand commonsense solution to finally ending a forty-five year consumer \ncomplaint in the United States.''\n  The House has already begun its consideration of companion \nlegislation, and I applaud the leadership of Representative Eshoo on \nthis issue. The television industry has been deeply involved in the \ndrafting of this legislation, and the standards it adopts are \npracticable, affordable, and effective. I hope my Senate colleagues \nwill act quickly to pass the CALM Act and finally put an end to this \nlongstanding irritation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2849. A bill to require a study and report on the feasibility and \npotential of establishing a deep water sea port in the Arctic to \nprotect and advance strategic United States interests within the \nevolving and ever more important region; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as you are undoubtedly aware, the U.S. \nis an arctic Nation. As such, the U.S. must ensure that not only its \neconomic and environmental interests in the region are protected, but \nalso its national defense and homeland security interests. While the \nU.S. maintains a strong working relationship with the 7 other arctic \nnations--Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian \nFederation and Sweden--these nations also have their own interests to \nprotect in the arctic region. Despite those relationships, the U.S. \ncannot assume that these nations will protect our interests in the \nregion. The ability for the U.S. to project its territorial claims and \nprotect its economic interests in the arctic will become increasingly \nimportant as the arctic shipping lanes become more accessible as the \nseasonal arctic ice decreases. With the high potential for increased \nand industrial and commercial activity in the arctic region, the U.S. \nmust ensure that it is prepared to protect human life as well as the \nvulnerable arctic environment.\n  With an expected increase in arctic activity on the horizon, the U.S. \ncannot wait until our interests in the region are threatened before we \nact. In that light, the Arctic Deep Water Sea Port Act of 2009 is a \nmajor step towards protecting vital U.S. interests in the region. The \nArctic Deep Water Sea Port Act of 2009 directs the Secretary of \nDefense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to \nconduct a study to determine the feasibility of establishing a deep \nwater port in the arctic to protect U.S. strategic interests in the \nregion. As the lead Departments for National Defense and Homeland \nSecurity initiatives for the U.S., the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, while working alongside their \nsubordinate agencies, are best suited for determining and implementing \npolicy decisions that protect U.S. sovereignty and national security.\n  This two-year study is designed to determine what strategic \ncapabilities a deep water port could provide as well as an optimal \nlocation that would provide protection for a wide spectrum of U.S. \ninitiatives. While studying the infrastructure needs for such a port, \nthis study will also endeavor to determine the resource and timeframe \nneeds to establish such a port, given the complex environmental \nconstraints that the arctic marine environment provides. Upon \ncompletion of this study, the U.S. will be better positioned to \nunderstand the resource and development needs for the arctic region \nthat are required to protect our interests in the region.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2851. A bill to make permanent certain education tax incentives, \nto modify rules relating to college savings plans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am offering legislation to make \npermanent a number of education-related tax relief measures. My \nlegislation also improves and makes permanent helpful provisions for \n529 plans and the American Opportunity tax credit for education.\n  At the first hearing I held when I became Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee in 2001, I made clear that education tax policy was a \npriority of mine. As Chairman, I was able to remove the 60-payment \nlimit for deducting student loan interest and I was able to increase \nthe income limits for that deduction. This was not the only time I \nfought hard to allow students to deduct their student loan interest. In \n1997, I was able to re-instate the student loan interest deduction that \nCongress had eliminated from our tax laws. However, the 60-payment \nlimit on the deductibility of student loan interest remained. I ensured \nthat the 2001 tax relief bill took care of that problem. Other \nincentives for education that I was able to enact into law in 2001 \nincluded raising the amount that can be contributed to an education \nsaving account from $500 to $2,000; making distributions from pre-paid \ncollege savings plans and tuition plans tax-free; and making permanent \nthe tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance. \nThese tax policies and many others, including those for school \nrenovations, repairs and construction, have proven their value to Iowa \nstudents in dollars and cents, year after year. The tax relief has \ndelivered measureable educational assistance to Iowans and students and \nfamilies nationwide, making education more affordable and accessible.\n  One draw-back of enacting these provisions in the 2001 tax relief \nbill, however, is that there was a sunset provision attached to that \nentire piece of legislation. All of the tax relief needs to be made \npermanent. Especially the education-related tax provisions. That is \nwhat my bill today does. My bill makes these provisions permanent.\n  It is no coincidence that I am introducing my education tax bill on \nthe day the President of the United States talked about jobs. Our \neconomy demands well-educated workers. The popularity of education tax \nincentives is good news for workers who find themselves unemployed or \nwho want to go back to school to advance, or even change, their \ncareers. Congress is willing to consider permanent tax relief for \ncompanies to buy machinery. Why isn't Congress willing to make an \ninvestment in people? That is what tax relief for education is. An \ninvestment in our future. It is just as important as job-creating tax \nincentives for businesses. Some will say we can't afford this, but we \nreally can't afford to lose billions of dollars of help for Americans \nworking hard to educate their kids.\n  Education has made this country great. We should not let this \nopportunity pass us by. We should not let these education-related tax \nprovisions expire. We should also continue to help make education \naffordable for families and students. This makes education accessible \nfor all. I look forward to working with my colleagues on passing this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2851\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 372\n\n       Whereas autoimmune diseases are chronic, disabling diseases \n     in which underlying defects in the immune system lead the \n     body to attack its own organs and tissues;\n       Whereas autoimmune diseases can affect any part of the \n     body, including the blood, blood vessels, muscles, nervous \n     system, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine glands, and \n     multiple-organ systems, and can be life-threatening;\n       Whereas researchers have identified over 80 different \n     autoimmune diseases, and suspect at least 40 additional \n     diseases of qualifying as autoimmune diseases;\n       Whereas researchers have identified a close genetic \n     relationship and a common pathway of disease that exists \n     among autoimmune diseases, explaining the clustering of \n     autoimmune diseases in individuals and families;\n       Whereas the family of autoimmune diseases is under-\n     recognized, and poses a major health care challenge to the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates \n     that autoimmune diseases afflict up to 23,500,000 people in \n     the United States, 75 percent of whom are women, and that the \n     prevalence of autoimmune diseases is rising;\n       Whereas NIH estimates the annual direct health care costs \n     associated with autoimmune diseases at more than \n     $100,000,000,000, with over 250,000 new diagnoses each year;\n       Whereas autoimmune diseases are among the top 10 leading \n     causes of death in female children and adult women;\n       Whereas autoimmune diseases most often affect children and \n     young adults, leading to a lifetime of disability;\n       Whereas diagnostic tests for most autoimmune diseases are \n     not standardized, making autoimmune diseases very difficult \n     to diagnose;\n       Whereas because autoimmune diseases are difficult to \n     diagnose, treatment is often delayed, resulting in \n     irreparable organ damage and unnecessary suffering;\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies \n     reported that the United States is behind other countries in \n     research into immune system self-recognition, the cause of \n     autoimmune diseases;\n       Whereas a study by the American Autoimmune Related Diseases \n     Association revealed that it takes the average patient with \n     an autoimmune disease more than 4 years, and costs more than \n     $50,000, to get a correct diagnosis;\n       Whereas there is a significant need for more collaboration \n     and cross-fertilization of basic autoimmune research;\n       Whereas there is a significant need for research focusing \n     on the etiology of all autoimmune-related diseases, in order \n     to increase understanding of the root causes of these \n     diseases rather treating the symptoms after the disease has \n     already had its destructive effect;\n       Whereas the National Coalition of Autoimmune Patient Groups \n     is a coalition of national organizations focused on \n     autoimmune diseases, working to consolidate the voices of \n     patients with autoimmune diseases and to promote increased \n     education, awareness, and research into all aspects of \n     autoimmune diseases through a collaborative approach; and\n       Whereas designating March 2010 as ``National Autoimmune \n     Diseases Awareness Month'' would help educate the public \n     about autoimmune diseases and the need for research funding, \n     accurate diagnosis, and effective treatments: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 2010 as ``National Autoimmune Diseases \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) supports the efforts of health care providers and \n     autoimmune patient advocacy and education organizations to \n     increase awareness of the causes of, and treatments for, \n     autoimmune diseases; and\n       (3) supports the goal of increasing Federal funding for \n     aggressive research to learn the root causes of autoimmune \n     diseases, as well as the best diagnostic methods and \n     treatments for people with autoimmune diseases.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this resolution designates March 2010 as \nNational Autoimmune Diseases Awareness Month. The purpose of the \nresolution is to raise awareness of autoimmune diseases and the need \nfor aggressive research to learn the root causes of autoimmune \ndiseases, as well as the best diagnostic methods and treatments for \npeople with autoimmune diseases.\n  Autoimmune diseases are chronic, disabling diseases in which \nunderlying defects in the immune system lead the body to attack its own \norgans and tissues. They can affect any part of the body--blood, blood \nvessels, muscles, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine \nglands, and multiple-organ systems--and can be life-threatening.\n  Researchers have identified over 80 different autoimmune diseases, \nincluding multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile diabetes, \nCrohn's disease, scleroderma, polymyositis, lupus, Sjogren's disease \nand Graves' disease, and suspect at least 40 additional diseases of \nhaving an autoimmune basis. The National Institutes of Health estimates \nthat autoimmune diseases afflict more than 23 million people in the \nU.S. Seventy-five percent of the people affected with autoimmune \ndiseases are women, and the prevalence of autoimmune diseases is \nrising. However, the family of autoimmune diseases is underrecognized, \nand this poses a major health care challenge to the U.S.\n  Diagnostic tests for autoimmune diseases are not standardized, which \nmakes autoimmune diseases very difficult to diagnose. Because \nautoimmune diseases are difficult to diagnose, treatment is often \ndelayed, resulting in irreparable organ damage and unnecessary \nsuffering.\n  There is a significant need for more collaboration and cross-\nfertilization of basic autoimmune research, with a particular focus on \nthe etiology of all autoimmune-related diseases in order to increase \nunderstanding of the root causes of these diseases rather than treating \nthe symptoms after the disease has had its destructive effect.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will help educate the public about \nautoimmune diseases and the continued need for research towards \naccurate diagnosis, and effective treatments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/08/senate-section/article/S12713-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12713-S12715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3001.

Such determination shall be made in \n     accordance with the medical exigencies of the case and as \n     soon as possible, but in no case later than 72 hours after \n     the time the request is received by the plan or issuer under \n     this subparagraph.\n       (C) Ongoing care.--\n       (i) Concurrent review.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), in the case of a \n     concurrent review of ongoing care (including \n     hospitalization), which results in a termination or reduction \n     of such care, the plan or issuer must provide by telephone \n     and in printed form notice of the concurrent review \n     determination to the individual or the individual's designee \n     and the individual's health care provider in accordance with \n     the medical exigencies of the case and as soon as possible.\n       (II) Contents of notice.--Such notice shall include, with \n     respect to ongoing health care items and services, the number \n     of ongoing services approved, the new total of approved \n     services, the date of onset of services, and the next review \n     date, if any, as well as a statement of the individual's \n     rights to further appeal.\n\n       (ii) Rule of construction.--Clause (i) shall not be \n     construed as requiring plans or issuers to provide coverage \n     of care that would exceed the coverage limitations for such \n     care.\n       (2) Retrospective determination.--A group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     shall make a retrospective determination on a claim for \n     benefits in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as\n\n[[Page S12730]]\n\n     possible, but not later than 30 days after the date on which \n     the plan or issuer receives information that is reasonably \n     necessary to enable the plan or issuer to make a \n     determination on the claim, or, if earlier, 60 days after the \n     date of receipt of the claim for benefits.\n       (c) Notice of a Denial of a Claim for Benefits.--Written \n     notice of a denial made under an initial claim for benefits \n     shall be issued to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) and the treating health care \n     professional in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than 2 \n     days after the date of the determination (or, in the case \n     described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (b)(1), \n     within the 72-hour or applicable period referred to in such \n     subparagraph).\n       (d) Requirements of Notice of Determinations.--The written \n     notice of a denial of a claim for benefits determination \n     under subsection (c) shall be provided in printed form and \n     written in a manner calculated to be understood by the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and shall include--\n       (1) the specific reasons for the determination (including a \n     summary of the clinical or scientific evidence used in making \n     the determination); and\n       (2) the procedures for obtaining additional information \n     concerning the determination.\n       (e) Definitions.--For purposes of this part:\n       (1) Authorized representative.--The term ``authorized \n     representative'' means, with respect to an individual who is \n     a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee, any health care \n     professional or other person acting on behalf of the \n     individual with the individual's consent or without such \n     consent if the individual is medically unable to provide such \n     consent.\n       (2) Claim for benefits.--The term ``claim for benefits'' \n     means any request for coverage (including authorization of \n     coverage), for eligibility, or for payment in whole or in \n     part, for an item or service under a group health plan or \n     health insurance coverage.\n       (3) Denial of claim for benefits.--The term ``denial'' \n     means, with respect to a claim for benefits, a denial (in \n     whole or in part) of, or a failure to act on a timely basis \n     upon, the claim for benefits and includes a failure to \n     provide benefits (including items and services) required to \n     be provided under this part.\n       (4) Treating health care professional.--The term ``treating \n     health care professional'' means, with respect to services to \n     be provided to a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee, a \n     health care professional who is primarily responsible for \n     delivering those services to the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee.\n\n                       Subpart B--Access to Care\n\n     SEC. 1611.
