The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1469.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes amendment No. 1469.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike $1,750,000,000 in Procurement, Air Force funding \n     for F-22A aircraft procurement, and to restore operation and \nmaintenance, military personnel, and other funding in divisions A and B \n       that was reduced in order to authorize such appropriation)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 106. ELIMINATION OF F-22A AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Elimination of Funding.--The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 103(1) for procurement for the Air \n     Force for aircraft procurement is hereby decreased by \n     $1,750,000,000, with the amount of the decrease to be derived \n     from amounts available for F-22A aircraft procurement.\n       (b) Restored Funding.--\n       (1) Operation and maintenance, army.--The amount authorized \n     to be appropriated by section 301(1) for operation and \n     maintenance for the Army is hereby increased by $350,000,000.\n       (2) Operation and maintenance, navy.--The amount authorized \n     to be appropriated\n\n[[Page S7724]]\n\n     by section 301(2) for operation and maintenance for the Navy \n     is hereby increased by $100,000,000.\n       (3) Operation and maintenance, air force.--The amount \n     authorized to be appropriated by section 301(4) for operation \n     and maintenance for the Air Force is hereby increased by \n     $250,000,000.\n       (4) Operation and maintenance, defense-wide.--The amount \n     authorized to be appropriated by section 301(5) for operation \n     and maintenance for Defense-wide activities is hereby \n     increased by $150,000,000.\n       (5) Military personnel.--The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 421(a)(1) for military personnel is \n     hereby increased by $400,000,000.\n       (6) Division a and division b generally.--In addition to \n     the amounts specified in paragraphs (1) through (5), the \n     total amount authorized to be appropriated for the Department \n     of Defense by divisions A and B is hereby increased by \n     $500,000,000.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is \n2 hours of debate on the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment will strike $1.75 billion in \nadditional funding for F-22 aircraft that was in the committee-reported \nbill. It will also restore serious cuts that were made in readiness and \nmilitary personnel accounts and across-the-board cuts. These cuts were \nmade in order to shift funds to support F-22 production. It is \nappropriate that the F-22 issue receive the full consideration by the \nSenate that it has received. The F-22 debate is among the most \nimportant debates we will have on the DOD authorization bill this year.\n  Stating what may be one of the worst kept secrets in Washington \ntoday, the Department of Defense budget request called for ending \nproduction of several programs, including the F-22 program. I suspect \nthe Department of Defense will seldom shut down any major acquisition \nprogram without a fair amount of controversy, and I agree with the \nSenator from Georgia that Congress should never be a rubberstamp for \nthe executive branch. But neither should we object to terminating \nproduction of a weapons system because of parochial reasons.\n  Terminating production, such as closing a base, can involve some \neconomic loss for communities involved. I know that very personally. \nBut we must do so from time to time and make these difficult decisions \nbased on what is best for the Nation and what is best for the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces.\n  As President Obama said the other day, in strong support of ending \nthe F-22 production:\n\n       To continue to procure additional F-22s would be to waste \n     valuable resources that should be more usefully employed to \n     provide our troops with the weapons that they actually do \n     need.\n\n  The Senate has heard from the senior leadership of the Defense \nDepartment, both civilian and military, that we should end F-22 \nproduction. The recommendation is strong and clear, as strong and clear \nas I have ever heard when it comes to ending the production of a \nweapons system.\n  The Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce sent me and Senator McCain a letter on this matter. This letter \nis already part of the Record. It reads, in part, as follows:\n\n       This review concluded with . . . a balanced set of \n     recommendations for our fighter forces: 1) focus procurement \n     on modern 5th generation aircraft rather than less capable F-\n     15s and F-16s; 2) given that the F-35 will constitute the \n     majority of the future fighter force, transition as quickly \n     as is prudent to F-35 production; 3) complete F-22 \n     procurement at 187 aircraft, while continuing plans for \n     future F-22 upgrades; and 4) accelerate the retirements of \n     the old 4th generation aircraft and modify the remaining \n     aircraft with necessary upgrades in capability.\n       In summary, we assessed the F-22 decision from all angles, \n     taking into account competing strategic priorities and \n     complementary programs and alternatives, all balanced within \n     the context of available resources. We did not and do not \n     recommend F-22s be included in the FY10 defense budget. This \n     is a difficult decision but one with which we are \n     comfortable. Most importantly, in this and other budget \n     decisions, we believe it is important for Air Force leaders \n     to make clear choices, balancing requirements across a range \n     of Air Force contributions to joint capabilities.\n\n  The Senate has also heard from the Secretary of Defense and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In their letter to me and \nSenator McCain on July 13, Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       There is no doubt that the F-22 is an important capability \n     for our Nation's defense. To meet future scenarios, however, \n     the Department of Defense has determined that 187 aircraft \n     are sufficient, especially considering the future roles of \n     Unmanned Aerial Systems and the significant number of 5th \n     generation stealth F-35s coming on-line in our combat air \n     portfolio.\n       It is important to note that the F-35 is a half generation \n     newer aircraft than the F-22, and more capable in a number of \n     areas such as electronic warfare and combating enemy air \n     defenses. To sustain U.S. overall air dominance, the \n     Department's plan is to buy roughly 500 F-35s over the next \n     five years and more than 2,400 over the life of the program.\n       Furthermore, under this plan, the U.S. by 2020 is projected \n     to have some 2,500 manned fighter aircraft, almost 1,000 of \n     them will be 5th generation F-35s and F-22s. China, by \n     contrast, is expected to have only slightly more than half as \n     many manned fighter aircraft by 2020, none of them 5th \n     generation.\n       The F-22 program proposed in the President's budget \n     reflects the judgment of two different Presidents, two \n     different Secretaries of Defense, three chairmen of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, and the current secretary and chief of staff \n     of the Air Force. If the Air Force is forced to buy \n     additional F-22s beyond what has been requested, it will come \n     at the expense of other Air Force and Department of Defense \n     priorities--and require deferring capabilities in areas we \n     believe are much more critical for our Nation's defense.\n  For all these reasons, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs concluded:\n\n       [W]e strongly believe that the time has come to close the \n     F-22 production line. If the Congress sends legislation to \n     the President that requires the acquisition of additional F-\n     22 aircraft beyond Fiscal Year 2009, the Secretary of Defense \n     will strongly recommend he veto it.\n\n  You do not get much stronger statements than that from a Secretary of \nDefense and a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n  The Secretary of Defense, just last Thursday, expanded on those \nthoughts at the Economic Club in Chicago, when he said the following:\n\n       . . . supporters of the F-22 lately have promoted its use \n     for an ever expanding list of potential missions. These range \n     from protecting the homeland from seaborne cruise missiles \n     to, as one retired general recommended on TV, using F-22s to \n     go after Somali pirates who in many cases are teenagers with \n     AK-47s--a job we already know is better done at much less \n     cost by three Navy SEALS.\n\n  The Secretary, in Chicago, said:\n\n       These are examples of how far-fetched some of the arguments \n     have become for a program that has cost $65 billion--and \n     counting--to produce 187 aircraft, not to mention the \n     thousands of uniformed Air Force positions that were \n     sacrificed to help pay for it.\n\n  The Senate has also heard, of course, from President Obama, as \nfollows--this is what he wrote us:\n\n       In December 2004, the Department of Defense determined that \n     183 F-22s would be sufficient to meet its military needs. \n     This determination was not made casually. The Department \n     conducted several analyses which support this position based \n     on the length and type of wars that the Department thinks it \n     might have to fight in the future, and an estimate of the \n     future capabilities of likely adversaries. To continue to \n     procure additional F-22s would be to waste valuable resources \n     that should be more usefully employed to provide our troops \n     with the weapons that they actually do need.\n\n  So the President, based on his uniformed and civilian advisers' \nrecommendations, has now said he will veto this bill if we keep the \nadditional $1.75 billion in the bill to buy the additional seven F-22s \nthose military leaders--uniformed and civilian--strongly say we do not \nneed.\n  I know my friend from Georgia has quoted some private sector \nindividuals and one senior military official in particular, GEN John \nCorley, the Commander of the Air Force's Air Combat Command.\n  I do not take lightly the recommendations and advice of someone with \na distinguished career such as General Corley. However, General \nCorley's assessment of a high military risk if we end the buy of F-22s \nat 187 is not shared by the most senior leadership of the Department \nthat is responsible for viewing the F-22 program, and all other \nDepartment of Defense programs, from a broader perspective. These same \nleaders from the previous administration--the previous Secretary of \nDefense, the previous Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--\nrecommended termination to President Bush, and President Bush also \nurged the termination of this program.\n  General Cartwright said at his confirmation hearing--or \nreconfirmation hearing--2 weeks ago the following:\n\n\n[[Page S7725]]\n\n\n       . . . I was probably one of the more vocal and ardent \n     supporters for the termination of the F-22 production. The \n     reason's twofold. First . . . there is a study in the Joint \n     Staff that we just completed and partnered with the Air Force \n     on that, number one, said that proliferating within the \n     United States military fifth-generation fighters to all three \n     services was going to be more significant than having them \n     based solidly in just one service, because of the way we \n     deploy and because of the diversity of our deployments.\n\n  General Cartwright went on to say the following:\n\n       Point number two is, in the production of the F-35 Joint \n     Strike Fighter, the first aircraft variant will support the \n     Air Force replacement of their F-16s and F-15s. It is a very \n     capable aircraft. It is 10 years newer--\n\n  ``It'' being the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter--\n\n       It is 10 years newer in advancement in avionics and \n     capabilities in comparison to the F-22. It is a better, more \n     rounded, capable fighter.\n\n  Well, that F-35 is in production now. In fact, there are 30 being \npaid for and bought and produced in the very budget for the Department \nof Defense which is before this body now.\n  President Eisenhower noted, from time to time, the military \nindustrial complex will push for more and more, more than is needed. In \nthis case, however--in this case--the senior military leadership is not \npushing for more.\n  Finally, to quote again from Secretary Gates's speech last week--this \nwas in Chicago at the Economic Club--\n\n       The grim reality is that with regard to the budget we have \n     entered a zero-sum game. Every defense dollar diverted to \n     fund excess or unneeded capacity--whether for more F-22s or \n     anything else--is a dollar that will be unavailable to take \n     care of our people, to win the wars we are in, to deter \n     potential adversaries, and to improve capabilities in areas \n     where America is underinvested and potentially vulnerable.\n\n  Secretary Gates said:\n\n       That is a risk I cannot accept and I will not take.\n\n  So, Mr. President, the time has come to end F-22 production at 187 F-\n22As. That is all we need to buy, that is all we can afford to buy, and \nthat is all we should buy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed on my leader \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Health Care Week VII, Day I\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Americans are eager for health care \nreforms that lower costs and increase access. This is why many of us \nare proposing reforms that should be easy for everyone to agree on, \nsuch as reforming our medical liability laws, strengthening wellness \nand prevention programs that would encourage people to make healthy \nchoices, such as quitting smoking and losing weight and addressing the \nneeds of small businesses without imposing new taxes that kill jobs.\n  The administration is taking a different approach to health care \nreform, and the more Americans learn about it, the more concerned they \nbecome. So it is good the President plans to spend a lot of his time in \nthe days ahead discussing the administration's plan for reform because \npeople need to know what the administration's plan is.\n  Specifically, Americans have concerns about losing the care they have \nand spending trillions of dollars for a so-called reform that could \nleave them with worse care than they have now, especially if it is paid \nfor by seniors and small business owners.\n  One prospect Americans are extremely concerned about is that they \nwill be forced off of their current plans as part of a government \ntakeover of health care. Despite repeated assurances from the \nadministration to the contrary, the independent Congressional Budget \nOffice says that just one section of one of the Democratic proposals we \nhave seen would force 10 million people off their current health plans.\n  Americans do not want a government takeover, and they certainly do \nnot want the government to spend trillions of their tax dollars to pay \nfor it, especially if the care they end up with is worse than the care \nthey already receive, and especially if the money that is spent on \nthese so-called reforms only adds to the national debt.\n  The President has repeatedly promised that his reform would not add \nto the debt. Yet both the House and Senate reform bills we have seen \nwould do just that. This is why even Democrats have started to \nbackpedal from the administration's plans.\n  One reason Democrats are having second thoughts is because the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office has sounded the alarm over \nthe administration's claims that its reforms would cut long-term \noverall health care costs. On the contrary, he said the \nadministration's reforms would actually lead to an increase in overall \ncosts. Concerns like these about costs and debt have been building \nslowly for weeks.\n  Another growing concern even among Democrats is the impact these \nhigher costs would have on States in the form of higher Medicaid costs. \nAt a time of tight budgets, this is something that Governors from both \npolitical parties are not very happy about.\n  For example, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson has said, and I am \nquoting him directly:\n       I'm personally very concerned about the cost issue, \n     particularly the $1 trillion figures being batted around.\n\n  Expanding Medicaid might look like an easy way to expand access, but \nit will actually mean massive spending increases for both Federal and \nState taxpayers. This could be a devastating blow to States such as \nKentucky and many others which are already struggling to pay the \nMedicaid costs they currently owe.\n  The administration's efforts to pay for its plans are not the least \nbit reassuring. The two main groups they are targeting are the last two \nthat should be expected to pay for it: seniors, through Medicare cuts, \nand small business owners, through higher taxes.\n  To me, it is just common sense that in the middle of a recession the \nlast thing--the last thing--we should be doing is raising taxes on \nsmall businesses. Yet both bills we have seen would do just that. \nIndeed, under the House bill, taxes on some small businesses would rise \nas high as roughly 45 percent. This means in order to pay for health \ncare reform, Democrats would increase the tax rate on some small \nbusinesses to about 30 percent higher than the rate for big \ncorporations. Taxes would go up so much, in fact, under the House \nproposal that the average combined Federal and State top tax rate for \nindividuals would be about 52 percent--52 percent, Mr. President.\n  Let's consider that figure for a moment. To repeat: In order to pay \nfor a health care proposal that would not even address all the concerns \nAmericans have about access and cost--and which might even increase \noverall health care costs--Democrats in the House would raise the \naverage top tax rate in the United States to about 52 percent.\n  The chart behind me was created by the Heritage Foundation and \nappeared last week in the Wall Street Journal. It shows that the House \nbill would raise the top U.S. rate above even France. Of the 30 \ncountries the OECD measures, only Belgium, Sweden, and Denmark have \nhigher rates, and five U.S. States would have tax rates even higher \nthan both Belgium and Sweden.\n  The United States is in the middle of a recession. We have lost more \nthan 2.5 million jobs since this January. Families are losing homes. \nThe last thing they need is a government takeover that kills even more \njobs, adds to the ballooning national debt, increases Americans' long-\nterm health care costs, and leaves Americans paying more for worse care \nthan they now receive. The proposals we have seen are not just \nincomplete, they are indefensible, particularly at a time of spiraling \ndebt and ever-increasing job losses.\n  Maybe this is why the administration has started to insist on an \nartificial deadline for getting its reform proposals through. We \ncertainly do not need to rush and spend $1 trillion to enact this \nflawed proposal by the August recess. The American people and members \nof both parties in Congress are calling on us to slow down and take the \ntime to get it right.\n  Health care reform is too important to rush through and get it wrong. \nWe saw what happened when some rushed and spent $1 trillion on an \nartificial\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\ndeadline with the stimulus. The American people do not want the same \nmistake to be made. Instead of setting a 3-week deadline on legislation \nthat would end up affecting one-sixth of our economy, the \nadministration should focus on meeting existing deadlines.\n  The Mid-Session Review of the administration's earlier predictions \nabout unemployment, economic growth, government spending, and the \noutlook for the Federal deficit has traditionally been released in mid-\nJuly. Yet now we are hearing the administration may not release its \nmidsession review until August, after Congress has adjourned and after \nthe administration's artificial deadline for a Senate bill on health \ncare.\n\n  The administration is also struggling to meet its decision to close \nGuantanamo by January 2010. The administration's task force on detainee \npolicy has said it will miss its deadline for making recommendations. \nIt seems premature to announce a closing date for Guantanamo without \nknowing where these detainees may be sent. The most recent delay is \neven more reason for the administration to show flexibility and \nreconsider its artificial deadline for closing Guantanamo.\n  Americans want Republicans and Democrats to enact real health care \nreform that reduces costs and makes health care more accessible. They \ndon't want a government takeover of the health care system that costs \ntrillions of dollars, is paid for by seniors and job-killing taxes on \nsmall businesses and that leaves them paying more for worse care than \nthey currently have. Before the administration rushes to spend another \ntrillion dollars, it needs to slow down and focus on fixing our economy \nand addressing the issues it is already falling behind on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Levin-\nMcCain amendment on the F-22. I was listening with interest to the \nchairman speak a little bit earlier when he raised several points that \nI am going to address specifically as I get into the guts of the \nargument. I think it is kind of interesting when he gives a list of \nthose individuals in the Pentagon and in the White House who are now in \nopposition to continued production of the F-22. Interestingly enough, \neverybody he talked about--from the President to the Secretary of \nDefense, to the Secretary of the Air Force, the Chief of Staff of the \nAir Force, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs--every single one of those \nindividuals is political. They are appointed. They are appointed by the \nPresident.\n  I am going to talk about some individuals who are in support of the \nF-22 who are not appointed. No. 1, they are the men and women who fly \nthe F-22. Secondly, it is men who have had the courage to wear the \nuniform of the United States of America in an unparalleled way that I \nhave seen since I have been here, who have been willing to stand up to \nthat political leadership and say: You guys are wrong. They have been \nwilling to stand and say that if you cut off production of the F-22 at \n187, you are going to put this country at a high risk from a national \nsecurity standpoint.\n  As we go through the debate, it is going to be interesting to \ncontrast the statements and the letters that every Member has received \na flurry of over the last several days. I have never seen the White \nHouse lobby such as they have lobbied on this issue. For a White House \nthat was not supposed to be a lobbying White House or in support of \nlobbyists, it has been unparalleled in my now going on 15 years as a \nMember of the Congress.\n  Senator Levin spoke earlier about the F-35: We are going to ramp up \nproduction. We are going to buy 30 airplanes, 30, in this budget. Well, \nguess what we are paying for those airplanes. We are paying $200 \nmillion a copy. Guess what we are buying an F-22 for today--an airplane \nthat has been through the test phase; an airplane that has proved \nitself. We are under a multiyear contract that calls for payment by the \nAir Force to the contractor of $140 million a copy. There is going to \nbe a lot of conversation on this floor about the cost of the F-22, and \nit is expensive: $140 million a copy is very expensive. But to come in \nhere with a straight face and say we are going to save taxpayers' money \nby moving to the F-35 and then turn around and say we are going to pay \n$200 million a copy in this bill for F-35s, something about that \ndoesn't add up.\n  Well, let me just say we are in a debate with the Pentagon with \nrespect to budgetary issues submitted by the Pentagon to Congress. \nThere are a lot of people who think we ought to step in line, salute \nthe Pentagon and move ahead and do exactly what the Pentagon says with \nrespect to the purchase of weapons systems. Well, that is not the way \nthe Framers of the Constitution intended the Senate and the House to \nwork. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution provides Congress with \nthe power to levy and collect taxes, provide for the common defense of \nthe United States, to raise and support armies and to make rules for \nthe government and regulation of the land and naval forces.\n  Clearly, we in Congress have a role in overseeing the Department of \nDefense, reviewing budgets, and questioning budget and policy \nrecommendations. Our interest and involvement in these issues are \nappropriate and not just based on parochial issues. We are charged with \nthe responsibility of reviewing DOD policies, whether fiscal policies \nor otherwise. That is simply a part of our job.\n  I think it is important to note that on several occasions in recent \nyears, Congress has authorized policy or funding initiatives that DOD \nhas strongly opposed and, in retrospect, Congress was right and DOD was \nwrong. Perhaps the most similar example to the F-22 is the battle over \nthe F-117 that occurred many years ago when the Air Force wanted to \nstop buying F-117s. Thank goodness my predecessor, Senator Sam Nunn, \nwho was then chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, forced \nthe Air Force to buy more F-117s. Ironically, part of the Air Force's \nargument was that they wanted to shift funding and focus to buying more \nF-22s. The F-117 was critical to establishing air dominance over Iraq \nin Desert Storm, and we can thank Congress for recognizing the need for \nmore F-117s years ago.\n  There are several other examples, such as the Goldwater-Nichols \nReorganization Act of 1986 and the establishment of Special Operations \nCommand in 1987, both of which were strongly opposed by the Pentagon. \nOther examples are continuation of the V-22 program and prohibition \nagainst retiring U-2s and B-52s, all of which are paying dividends \nbeyond what the military expected, including in Iraq and Afghanistan \ntoday.\n  I wish to address a comment Senator Levin and others have made \nregarding previous Secretaries of Defense and Chairmen of the Joint \nChiefs supporting only 183--or 187 now, with the addition of four F-22s \nwe are buying in the supplemental. First, that number of 183 originally \nwas established not on the basis of any study or analysis--never a \nstudy that came out and said we need 183 and we are going to be basing \nour decision on that--but it was based on PBD 753, which is inside \nWashington baseball, which was an OSD budget drill 2 days before \nChristmas in 2004, in which the Air Force had absolutely no input. \nNeither the Chief of Staff nor the Secretary was involved. A number of \n``183'' or ``187'' has always been budget driven and not strategically \ndriven.\n  There have been at least 10 studies done on F-22 numbers over the \npast 10 years. Of those, only one, the Joint Air Dominance Study done \nby DOD in 2005, recommended 183 F-22s. However, that study was based on \nonly needing F-22s in a single-threat scenario and which also used a \nfixed budget.\n  Senator Levin mentioned the comments General Cartwright made in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee hearing 2 weeks ago. And he relies \nheavily on the statement General Cartwright made. General Cartwright \nresponded to a question I asked, and my question to General Cartwright \nwas: General, you say you support terminating the F-22 program at 187. \nHas there been any one single study, in the Air Force or outside the \nAir Force, any analysis done that recommends we terminate the program \nat 187? General Cartwright's statement to me was: Yes; there is a study \ngoing on in the Air Force right now that says we should terminate the \nprogram at 187.\n  Well, unfortunately for General Cartwright, we now know no study was\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\ndone. It is our understanding that the comment of General Cartwright is \nbeing corrected for the record and that we are receiving a corrected \nstatement coming to the committee shortly.\n  I wish to quote from a statement by Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell \nthat was made last Tuesday with respect to the comments of General \nCartwright. This comment is quoted in the Daily Report. It now turns \nout that a recent study touted by Pentagon leadership as the \njustification for terminating the F-22 fighter isn't a study at all but \na series of briefings by DOD's program analysis and evaluation shop in \nthe Air Force. That word comes from the Pentagon's top spokesman, Geoff \nMorrell, who told the Daily Report late Tuesday that the study, or \nwhatever it is, is: Not so much a study as work products.\n  Asked to describe the nature and timing of this study, Morrell told \nthe Daily Report:\n\n       What I think General Cartwright was referring to . . . is \n     two different work products--\n\n  One by the PA shop and one by the Air Force--\n\n     and not so much a study.\n\n  Since PDB 753, only 183 F-22s have been programmed in the budget, \nwith fiscal year 2009 being the last year of funding. To say previous \nSecretaries of Defense and Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs supported this \nis misleading since, until the fiscal year 2010 budget bill process, a \ndecision on whether to buy more F-22s would be deferred to future \ndecisionmakers. It is perhaps with this in mind that Secretary Gates \nhimself decided last year to request additional F-22s in the fiscal \nyear 2009 supplemental, and he did, in order to keep the line open and \npreserve the next administration's option for procurement of the F-22.\n  I know the former President, President Bush, did not want to see the \nprogram terminated. They can say what they want to on the other side, \nbut having had personal conversations, I know what his feeling was \nabout this great aircraft. He could have terminated the program, but he \ndid not terminate the program. It is this administration that is \nseeking to terminate this program.\n  There have been five previous Secretaries of the Air Force, six \nprevious Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force, seven previous Secretaries \nof Defense before this one, and eight previous commanders of Air Combat \nCommand who have said we need more F-22s. We have supported this \nprogram from day one. We have continued to reduce the number from the \noriginal 781, now down to 187. The current Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce, whose letters have been quoted and inserted in the Record where \nhe says we should cap it at 187, has testified time and time and time \nagain in recent days and in recent weeks and who has written me letters \nstating that the military requirement for F-22s is not 187, it is 243, \nbut he says we can't afford it. Therefore, he has to salute his boss. \nHis boss is a political appointee--Secretary Gates--and the political \nappointee says we are going to cap it at 187; therefore, that is the \ndirection in which we are going to go and the direction in which you \nhave to salute the flag and move on.\n  I am going to close my comments at this time and turn to my colleague \nfrom Connecticut. Before I do so, I will quote somebody who is not \npolitical, somebody who is not an appointee, somebody who is a former \nChief of Staff of the Air Force. That is GEN Merrill McPeak, who, last \nweek, in an unsolicited statement, came out and said, when he talked \nabout terminating the F-22 production rate at 187:\n\n       I think it's a real mistake. . . . The airplane is a game-\n     changer and people seem to forget that we haven't had any of \n     our soldiers or Marines killed by enemy air since 1951. . . . \n     It's been half a century or more since any enemy aircraft has \n     killed one of our guys.\n       The F-22 is at the top end. We have to procure enough of \n     them for our ability to put a lid on, to dictate the ceiling \n     of any conflict. We certainly need some figure well above \n     200. That worries me because I think it is pennywise and \n     pound foolish to expose us in a way this much smaller number \n     does. . . . That's taking too much high-end risk.\n\n  General McPeak is a supporter of this administration and, as far as \nwe can tell, he is not a consultant for any major defense contractor. \nFor this reason, I think his comments deserve significant attention and \ncredibility.\n  I will stop at this point, but I will say more later. I now turn to \nmy colleague, Senator Dodd, who I will say has been a great champion on \nthis issue, a great partner in support of not just the men and women of \nthe Air Force and our other branches that depend on this weapon system \nto protect America and our soldiers in the field but also a great \nprotector from an economic standpoint.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains for those of us in \nopposition?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 44\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask to be recognized for 10 minutes, and if I need a \nlittle more, I will ask for it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend Senator Chambliss for his eloquent \nand persuasive argument about why this amendment is a dangerous one, \nand I say that respectfully. I have great admiration for Carl Levin and \nJohn McCain, but there are serious problems with this approach, from a \nnational security standpoint as well as a manufacturing and industrial \nbase standpoint.\n  To put this into context for our colleagues, we are being asked to \nauthorize $1.75 billion, or two-tenths of 1 percent of the budget \nbefore us of $680 billion. We are told there are at least 25,000 direct \njobs and 95,000 direct and indirect jobs at stake for that $1.75 \nbillion--again, two-tenths of 1 percent of the budget--which Senator \nChambliss has offset, by the way. It is not an expenditure that is not \ngoing to be accounted for.\n  We are going to put those jobs at risk--not because this industry is \nin trouble, unlike the automobile industry, which we bailed out to the \ntune of $63 billion, by the way--understanding the reason many of us \nsupported that was to maintain an industrial manufacturing base.\n  In this case, we lead the world in aerospace. Nobody comes even close \nto the ability of the United States to produce the most sophisticated \naircraft in the world. Yet with an industry doing relatively well--\nalthough commercial orders are way down, which is causing serious \nproblems but that is as a result of the economic conditions. We are \nunwilling to come up with $1.75 billion or two-tenths of 1 percent to \nput those many jobs at risk, not to mention retreating on our air \nsuperiority.\n  One of the critical components of national security is maintaining \nsuperiority both at sea and in the air. The F-22, by any estimation, is \nthe most superior aircraft in the world. It is not even close in terms \nof competitors. Yet with the numbers we have and that we are relying \non, we leave ourselves way short of the earlier projected numbers.\n  As Senator Chambliss pointed out, the testimony over the years of \nthose who advocated this program has been significant. In fact, in the \nletter most recently received from General Corley, head of the Air \nCombat Command Office, headquartered at Langley, VA, June 9, it points \nout how serious this would be in terms of exposing our Nation to \nnational security risks. The head of the Air National Guard Bureau, \nLieutenant General Wyatt, makes the same claim. Chief of Staff \nSchwartz, before he changed his mind a week earlier, advocated the F-22 \nas well, and its importance.\n  From both a manufacturing perspective and job loss, at a time when \nunemployment rates are skyrocketing, this body is about to lay off \nanywhere from 25,000 to 90,000 people--at a time when unemployment \nrates are going up, because we decided that $1.75 billion is too \nexpensive at this juncture, even though we have offset it, and we have \nput that many jobs at risk, not because the industry is failing or \nbecause it is a bad aircraft but because the Secretary of Defense and \nthe administration have decided this program isn't worthy of our \nsupport.\n  So explain to those 90,000 people--somewhere in that range--once they \nlose their jobs and get laid off, and they will--why it was we decided \ntoday, because of two-tenths of 1 percent of the budget, to move in a \ndifferent direction. Put aside, if you will, the $63 billion we spent \nto develop this aircraft.\n\n[[Page S7728]]\n\n  I raised these concerns expressed by our military commanders--again, \nmost notably, GEN John Corley of the Air Combat Command, LTG Harry \nWyatt of the Air National Guard--I have mentioned them. In my State, \nthere are 2,000 to 3,000 jobs at risk, and 1,000 of the jobs are down \nbecause commercial orders are down. So it is really 2,000 to 4,000 \npeople in my State who will lose their jobs.\n  No matter how much I care about the people in my State, I could not \noppose this exclusively on that basis. You ought to look nationwide. It \nis not just my State; it is all across the country.\n  I raised concerns about what this amendment would do to our global \ncompetitiveness and discussed the potential harm to our economy posed \nby terminating the world's most advanced fighter jet.\n  I raised concerns over the industry's ability to build the less \nsophisticated F-35--which has only one engine not two, and the word \n``stealthy'' applied to the F-35 is a myth; it is not as stealthy, even \nremotely, as the F-22--that the United States and its allies are \ncounting on buying over the next decade.\n  Mr. President, before I revisit these critically important arguments, \nlet's be clear on the context in which we are having this debate. The \nproponents of this amendment suggest they are saving taxpayers valuable \nresources in terminating the F-22. They claim such cost savings are \nwell worth the risk Generals Corley and Wyatt have warned us about.\n  But out of a total of $680 billion in the Defense authorization bill, \nthis amendment is valued at $1.75 billion. That is two-tenths of 1 \npercent of the total authorization. Since the planes are fully offset, \nthere are no real savings in this amendment.\n  Instead, this amendment will come at enormous cost to our security \nand our economy. We are in the midst of a national manufacturing \ncrisis. Everybody has talked about it. It is why we voted for so much \nsupport for the automobile industry only a few weeks ago right here in \nthis body.\n  According to the Federal Reserve's July 15, 2009, Industrial \nProduction and Capacity Utilization Report, manufacturing production \nhas declined 15.5 percent nationwide, between June 2008 and June 2009. \nI will repeat that: There has been an over 15 percent decline in our \nmanufacturing sector. This quarter's manufacturing production is the \nlowest in 27 years, which was the previous low point in production \nsince 1967, when the Fed started to keep track of the data.\n  We in Congress tried to respond to this crisis. We passed the \nEmergency Economy Stabilization Act, designed to relieve credit markets \nand get banks lending again.\n  We passed the $787 billion American Reinvestment and Recovery Act to \nstimulate the economy and boost demand in various sectors and put \npeople back to work.\n  We have provided $63 billion to Chrysler and General Motors to keep \ntheir production lines running--companies that were brought to their \nknees, in part, due to dismal business planning and severe \nmismanagement of their companies over the years.\n\n  Additionally, the government has acquired unprecedented equity stakes \nin these companies--8 percent in Chrysler and a whopping 60 percent in \nGeneral Motors.\n  I have not opposed these efforts. As chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, I worked with my colleagues who represent those States to \nprovide Federal assistance through the legislative process. But we took \nthis step because we were responding to a national manufacturing \ncrisis. We did it because we are responding to the dire and credible \nwarnings about the potential impact of the auto industry's collapse--\nparticularly in Midwestern States, which greatly depend on the auto \nbusiness.\n  I will discuss briefly another critically important manufacturing \nbase and its economic impact: the aerospace industry.\n  While my home State of Connecticut ranks 29th in total population, \naccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it ranks sixth in total \naerospace employment.\n  In 2008, according to the Connecticut Department of Labor, aerospace \nemployed over 36,000 residents of my State. So any discussion of \nterminating the fighter jet production has an outsize effect on the \npeople I represent.\n  I would not be arguing this case for the F-22 if it were strictly a \nparochial matter. We don't have a right to ask 99 other people \nexclusively because of something happening in our own States. The truth \nis, halting this production will have consequences for our industry's \nability to continue to build aircraft for our military. I will lay out \nthe argument for you.\n  The expertise of these people cannot be duplicated overnight. These \ntrained engineers, scientists, manufacturers, and machinists are highly \nskilled and trained. I am concerned their skill sets and experience are \nbeing taken for granted, without consideration for the peculiarities of \njet engine construction. That doesn't just hurt the workers and their \nfamilies; it hurts all of us. Let me explain how.\n  According to the Defense Contract Management Agency, there is a 20- \nto 24-month lag between payment for and production of jet engines. So \nthe number of planes ordered in any 1 given year doesn't correspond \nwith the delivery time of those engines.\n  Under Secretary of Defense Gates's plan in calendar year 2010, Pratt \n& Whitney is expected to make 48 F-22 engines and 19 F-35 engines, for \na total of 67 fighter jet engines. The following year, the number will \ndrop precipitously to a total of 43 engines, since the F-35 is not \nscheduled to begin what is called ``full-rate production'' until 2014.\n  Thus, in calendar year 2011, Pratt & Whitney will be producing 11 F-\n22 engines and 32 F-35 engines, for a total of 43 fighter engines. In \n2012, since there will be no F-22 production, there will only be 41 F-\n35 engines built.\n  The problem is even more acute when you compare overall military \nengines being built in 2010 versus 2011 and 2012. Under current plans, \nPratt & Whitney is expected to go from building 194 military engines to \n130 in 2011. That is an average drop of 33 percent in work volume.\n  What will happen? It is the same thing occurring in manufacturing \nStates all across the country: layoffs. Thousands and thousands of \npeople--not just in my State but across the country.\n  In the absence of military aircraft work orders for 3 years, \ncompanies will be forced to tell the legions of highly skilled \nengineers, technicians, and machinists--workers such as the Pratt & \nWhitney mechanics I introduced and mentioned last week--that they are \nnot needed now. They need to retrain. They need to find another \nvocation.\n  Then, 3 years later, after these workers have settled in a new job, \nor have retired, the Department of Defense and our allies will try to \nramp up production of the F-35. But they will not be able to. They will \nbe left scratching their heads, wondering: Why can't industry meet our \nproduction needs right now? No doubt, we will ask the same question on \nthe Senate floor.\n  To assume that the thousands of workers across the Nation who work on \nthe F-22 will stand idly by until 2014 when we begin to build the F-35 \nJoint Strike Fighter is naive at best. This argument I make is not new \nat all. The Defense Department recognized this point in the 2006 \nQuadrennial Defense Review, published by the military to identify the \nneeds and strategy of our Armed Forces.\n  The report stated that F-22 production should be extended ``through \nfiscal year 2010 with a multiyear acquisition contract to ensure the \nDepartment does not have a gap in fifth generation stealth \ncapabilities.''\n  At the same time, the F-35 was scheduled to begin construction in \n2010. Since then, of course, it has been pushed back 4 years to 2014. \nThere are some rumors that this date may be pushed back even further.\n  This means the military identified only 3 years ago--36 months ago--\nthe most recent published report of this type, that our Nation would \nsuffer a loss in aerospace manufacturing capability if fighter \nproduction doesn't have a seamless transition.\n  Their response was to ensure that we keep building F-22s until the F-\n35 reached full-rate production. Yet when the F-35 production schedule \nwas pushed back 4 years, we did not extend the F-22 production to \nstabilize our industrial base. That is why you have the job losses I \nhave mentioned.\n  Now we find ourselves in the very situation the Department of Defense \nwas\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\ntrying to avoid 36 months ago, as we face looming job losses across our \nNation, commercial orders down--losing these people on that basis and \nnow because of the vote we may take on this issue--and thus a \ndegradation of our ability to meet the aerospace production capability \nour national security requires. So I believe it is our duty and \nresponsibility to protect these workers from losing their employment \nand make sure our country retains a viable and competitive capacity in \nthe years ahead.\n  Let me also point out--and I did the other day on a national security \nbasis--that, again, superiority is critical. Right now, there are some \n40 nations that have the SU-27, which is a sophisticated aircraft, and \nthe MiG-29, which competes with the F-15 and the F-16. Forty nations \nhave that capability. I had a larger chart earlier--I don't have it \nwith me today--but there are little red and yellow dots all over this \nmap that indicate advanced surface-to-air missile capability where \nthere have been orders made or they have already been acquired. Our F-\n15s and F-16s are vulnerable to those surface-to-air missiles. All over \nthe globe they exist.\n  The F-22 literally could avoid the kind of detection these surface-\nto-air missiles provide. So we now have a capacity to be able to \nrespond. Now we may not--and as long as we are dealing with Afghanistan \nand Iraq, that is one issue. But, frankly, we have to prepare for \nsituations that could get a lot more dangerous for our Nation. The \nChinese and the Russians are aggressively pursuing a fifth generation \naircraft to compete with the F-22. And to say that the F-22 and the F-\n35 are virtually alike I think is a mistake. That is not the case at \nall. There is a difference.\n  From a national security standpoint as well, there was a reason why \nGeneral Corley and General Wyatt and others have made a case on these \naircraft. There is a reason why we invested some $65 billion to develop \nthis aircraft. There is a reason why the quadrennial report 36 months \nago warned about these gaps and what it would do to our industrial base \nand manufacturing.\n  I hope our colleagues, in the midst of all of this, would understand \nwhat is at stake. Again, here we are, on an economic basis, where many \njobs could be lost in our country with critical technology that hangs \nin the balance. It would be one thing if we were arguing here this \nplane was no longer needed, it was not going to do the job we thought \nit would do, it wasn't as sophisticated as we hoped it would be. Then \nyou might decide dropping this, giving up some jobs, may make some \nsense. But to give up an aircraft of this sophistication and this \ncapability, and simultaneously, in an economic situation such as we are \nin, to lose as we are predicting somewhere between 25,000 and 90,000 \njobs with this decision, for $1.75 billion in this budget--two-tenths \nof 1 percent out of a $680 billion authorization bill, I think is \nterribly shortsighted.\n  I hope my colleagues would listen to these arguments, would debate \nand understand there is an ability, to reach a compromise where we can \ngo forward with production, reduce some of the cost that the proponents \nargue for in this amendment, and then move toward together. But to make \nthe decision that we may make in the next hour and a half or so would \nbe a great danger for our Nation.\n  I appreciate my colleague Senator Chambliss giving me the opportunity \nto respond on this issue, and I thank him for his work as well in \nmaking the case to our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans. This \nought not to be an issue that divides along those lines at all. We need \nto understand what is at stake for our Nation, both in terms of our \nmanufacturing base as well as the national security needs that have \nbeen identified.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe two letters, one from General Corley and one from General Wyatt.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Department of the Air Force,\n\n\n                              Headquarters Air Combat Command,\n\n                         Langley Air Force Base, VA, June 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: Thank you for your letter and the \n     opportunity to comment on the critical issue of F-22 fleet \n     size. At Air Combat Command we have held the need for 381 F-\n     22s to deliver a tailored package of air superiority to our \n     Combatant Commanders and provide a potent, globally arrayed, \n     asymmetric deterrent against potential adversaries. In my \n     opinion, a fleet of 187 F-22s puts execution of our current \n     national military strategy at high risk in the near to mid-\n     term.\n       To my knowledge, there are no studies that demonstrate 187 \n     F-22s are adequate to support our national military strategy. \n     Air Combat Command analysis, done in concert with \n     Headquarters Air Force, shows a moderate risk force can be \n     obtained with an F-22 fleet of approximately 250 aircraft.\n       While OSD did not solicit direct input from Air Combat \n     Command, we worked closely with our Headquarters in ensuring \n     our views were available. We realize the tough choices our \n     national leadership must make in balancing current \n     warfighting needs against the fiscal realities our Nation \n     faces.\n       The F-22, a critical enabler of air dominance, plays a \n     vital role and indispensable role in ensuring joint freedom \n     of action for all forces and underpins our ability to \n     dissuade and deter. Thank you for your continued support of \n     the U.S. Air Force and Air Combat Command.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             John D.W. Corley,\n\n                                                    General, USAF,\n     Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: Thank you for your inquiry and the \n     opportunity for me to discuss what I believe to be a serious \n     threat to the Air National Guard's ability to fulfill our \n     Nation's highest strategic priority; defending the Homeland. \n     The ANG has proudly performed the bulk of this mission, while \n     simultaneously participating in overseas contingency \n     operations, with aircraft that are rapidly nearing the end of \n     their service life. While I believe our Nation has the \n     capacity to recapitalize the ANG, I am not aware of any plan \n     that commits to doing so. As such, we are in need of an \n     immediate solution in order to ensure that America's most \n     cost effective force can continue to perform its most \n     important mission.\n       While a variety of solutions abound, I believe the nature \n     of the current and future asymmetric threats to our Nation, \n     particularly from seaborne cruise missiles, requires a \n     fighter platform with the requisite speed and detection to \n     address them. The F-22's unique capability in this arena \n     enables it to handle a full spectrum of threats that the \n     ANG's current legacy systems are not capable of addressing. I \n     am fond of saying that ``America's most important job should \n     be handled by America's best fighter''.\n       Indeed, I am keenly aware of the severe strain that our \n     current economic situation has placed on the Department of \n     Defense as it attempts to modernize for an ever evolving \n     threat environment. Given this reality, finding more \n     efficient ways to protect our Nation's interests at home and \n     abroad is the new imperative. Many say this will mean making \n     tough choices, but I believe we can maintain our vitality by \n     making smart choices; leveraging the cost effective and dual \n     use nature of the ANG is the answer. Basing F-22s (and \n     eventually F-35s) at strategic ANG locations throughout the \n     United States while simultaneously making them available to \n     rotationally support worldwide contingency operations is the \n     most responsible approach to satisfying all of our Nation's \n     needs.\n       Again, thank you for your inquiry and your continued \n     support of the Air National Guard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Harry M. Wyatt III,\n\n                                         Lieutenant General, USAF,\n                                     Director, Air National Guard.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield myself 1 minute to give the \nfigures relative to the F-35 production, which are the Pentagon \nfigures. I am not sure where my good friend from Connecticut got his \nfigures on future F-35 production. But the figures from the Pentagon \nare that there are 30 in this year's budget; in next year's budget, \nfiscal year 2011, they plan 70 F-35s; in fiscal year 2012, 109 F-35s; \nin fiscal year 2013, 119 F-35s. Those are far different than the \nnumbers which my friend from Connecticut just gave.\n  I am not sure the source of his numbers. Perhaps he can give us those \nnumbers at a later time.\n  At this point, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if I may respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I wanted to state where the numbers came from. They are \nfrom the Defense Contracting Management Agency. That is where the \nnumbers came from.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n[[Page S7730]]\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, today, I would like to speak in strong \nsupport of the Levin-McCain amendment which strips $1.75 billion in \nspending for additional F-22s. These are fighter jets the military does \nnot want and does not need. This is a Cold War system, in a post-9/11 \nworld, that is underperforming and overpriced. To force this purchase, \nagainst the best judgment of our military leadership and Commander in \nChief, weakens our ability to keep our Nation safe.\n\n  The White House and Pentagon agree that continuing the F-22 \nproduction line decreases our military readiness by wasting resources \nthat could be much more usefully employed. And it is not a partisan \nissue. Presidents Obama and Bush; Defense Secretaries Gates and \nRumsfeld; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, and \nhis two predecessors; and the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce all agree that the F-22 is not the most efficient or effective \nwarplane to meet our current and future defense needs.\n  The F-22 has not flown one mission over Afghanistan or Iraq, because \nit is not the best weapon to meet the challenges we are currently \nfacing.\n  This system was designed to counter Soviet fighters at the end of the \nCold War. And its continued purchase deprives the military of $1.75 \nbillion it requested for other critical priorities, such as building \nthe capability to protect our troops and defeat insurgencies.\n  With ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, we cannot afford to \ndisregard the views of our military. And in these tough economic times, \nwe cannot afford to adopt an irresponsible approach to defense \nspending. These facts speak for themselves, and the stakes are simply \ntoo high. What more evidence do we need?\n  The F-22 prepares us for the wars of the past; the wars we have \nalready won. Today, we must look forward and make tough decisions for \nthe future. We must heed the advice of our military leaders, such as \nSecretary Gates, to rebalance our defense budget. And enhance our \ncapabilities to succeed against current and future threats. This \nincludes preparing for a wide spectrum of conflict and continuing to \nengage in counterinsurgency.\n  Madam President, this debate is not just about the future of F-22s. \nIt is about changing the way we do business. It is about accepting this \nrebalancing and ending unnecessary waste. And it is about matching \nvital national security interests with commensurate levels of funding.\n  The F-22 is the first test of our willingness to make the tough \nchoices necessary to truly prioritize defense spending.\n  As Secretary Gates said last week:\n\n       The grim reality is that with regard to the budget, we have \n     entered into a zero-sum game. Every defense dollar diverted \n     to fund excess or unneeded capacity--whether for more F-22s \n     or anything else--is a dollar that will be unavailable to \n     take care of our people, to win the wars we are in, to deter \n     potential adversaries, and to improve capabilities in areas \n     where America is underinvested and potentially vulnerable. \n     That is a risk I cannot accept and I will not take.\n\n  Madam President, I want to align myself with the remarks of Secretary \nGates, and reiterate to my colleagues that this is a risk none of us \nshould be willing to take.\n  Many of my colleagues have spoken of the sacrifice and cost such a \ndecision incurs in terms of jobs. They are right, and I share their \nconcern about jobs; especially in these tough times. I know this makes \nour decision today hard, and no one wants to do anything that will \nhinder job creation and growth. But it is with these economic \nconstraints in mind that we must also consider the implications of \nspending nearly $2 billion on a defense program that our military \nleadership says it simply does not need.\n  Building more F-22s does not allow for smart or efficient growth of \nour workforce. Moreover, the number of jobs lost on the F-22 will \nlikely be matched by increased production of the F-35, which is a newer \nand more capable warplane. American workers are needed to meet this and \nother defense priorities, which strengthen our national security. Jobs \nshould follow, as opposed to dictate, our defense needs.\n  For those concerned about cuts, I point out that the budget proposed \nby the President and Secretary Gates represents an increase, not a \ndecrease, in defense spending. But this is not just an increase for the \nsake of spending.\n  Rather, it is a budget that recognizes that over the last two \ndecades, the nature of conflict and war has fundamentally changed. It \nrecognizes that we must continue to build the capacity to confront a \nwide spectrum of challenges--conventional and unconventional; regular \nand irregular--and better prepare for a future in which we will \ncontinue to engage in counterinsurgency.\n  Today, we must do what is in America's best interest. Today, we must \nfocus on weapons systems that offer the maximum versatility and \neffectiveness, and prepare the military against the widest range of \nthreats. And today, we must plan for our current and future \ncounterinsurgency needs, as shaped by our experiences in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  It is in this regard that I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Levin-McCain amendment, and adopt a better approach to \ndefense spending.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be charged equally on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding time \non this important debate.\n  As we consider the future of the F-22 program, it is important for us \nto remember the most fundamental goal we have for our defense industry \nand the way we have met that goal for many decades. That goal is to \ngive our men and women in uniform technology and equipment that is far \nsuperior to that of our enemy so they can protect themselves and defend \nour Nation. It has been our mission from the time of the Wright \nbrothers to the days of Rosie the Riveter, to the era of stealthy \ntechnology.\n  But maintaining that technology has depended on an important \npartnership and that is a partnership between the Pentagon, which \ndetermines the needs of our war fighters, and industry, which does the \nresearch and design and builds the next generation of military \nequipment that meets those needs. It is a partnership that is vital to \nour military strength, to our economy, and to the health of our \ndomestic industrial base.\n  Unfortunately, it is also a partnership that is being weakened by \namendments such as the one we are considering today. Instead of \ntreating military procurement such as the partnership that it is, this \namendment envisions it as a one-way street. This amendment cancels a \nvital military program without adequate thought of the men and women we \nrely on to design and build the equipment our war fighters depend on \nwithout any consideration of the fact that if we end the F-22 program, \nwe are cutting a link in technology that we will not be able to repair \novernight.\n  As many of you know, this is not the first time I have come to the \nfloor to talk about the erosion of our Nation's industrial base. It \nlikely will not be the last. That is because protecting our domestic \nbase is not about just one company or one program or one State or one \nindustry. This is about our Nation's economic stability, it is about \nour future military capability, and it is about the ability to retain \nskilled family-wage jobs in communities throughout the country.\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\n  Just last week, the Aerospace Industries Association issued a major \nreport that finds the Pentagon failed to consider industrial effects \nwhen choosing strategies. That report urged the Pentagon to take into \naccount the impact decisions such as the one to stop production of the \nF-22 make on our manufacturing base. That report also noted that our \nmanufacturing base was not taken into account in past Quadrennial \nDefense Reviews, and when Secretary Gates unveiled his program cuts in \nApril, he specifically said defense industry jobs were not a factor in \nhis decisions.\n  As our country faces two difficult but not unrelated challenges--\nsafeguarding our country in a dangerous world and rebuilding a \nfaltering economy--ignoring the needs of our industrial base should not \nbe an option. Whether it is the scientists who are designing the next \ngeneration of military satellites or whether it is the engineers who \nare improving our radar systems or the machinists assembling our war \nplanes, these industries and their workers are one of our greatest \nstrategic assets. What if they, all of a sudden, were not available? \nWhat if we made budgetary and policy decisions that did not take into \naccount the need of making sure we have a strong domestic workforce in \nour country?\n  Actually, that is not impossible or even unthinkable. It is actually \nhappening today. We need to be clear about the ramifications of \namendments such as the ones we are considering today because once we \ngive up on producing this technology, once we say that certain research \nand development is no longer needed, we lose that. We lose it and we \ncannot rebuild it overnight.\n  Today, as we consider a critical tool for the future of our military \nacross the globe, we have to also remember the partnership we have \nbuilt with our industrial base because, unless we consider the needs of \nthat partnership, we are not only going to continue to lose some of our \nbest-paying American jobs, we are going to lose the backbone of our \nmilitary might.\n  Supporting continued F-22 production will help defend against \npotential threats, it will protect family-wage jobs, and, most \nimportantly, it will preserve our domestic base. That is important \nbecause we do not know what conflict will come in the future. We don't \nknow what our challenges will be 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 years from now. \nIf we lose our engineering or our production base and we face a \nchallenge in the future and go back to rebuild that, it will never \nhappen. We will be at a disadvantage in whatever future conflict we \nmight face.\n  I urge our colleagues to think about the long-term interests of this \ndecision. I oppose the amendment and I look forward to further debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 35\\1/2\\ minutes, the \nopponents have 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield to the Senator from Arizona as much of that time \nas he requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the chair. I, again, thank my \nfriend, the distinguished chairman, for proposing this amendment. I \nthank the distinguished chairman for being the sponsor of this \namendment. It is a privilege to work with him on this as well as many \nother issues.\n  This amendment is probably the most impactful amendment I have seen \nin this body on almost any issue, much less the issue of defense. It \nboils down to whether we are going to continue the business as usual of \nonce a weapons system gets into full production it never dies or \nwhether we are going to take the necessary steps to reform the \nacquisition process in this country.\n  The F-22, in itself, is $1.75 billion. That is an impressive number \nanyplace outside the beltway. But more important than that, it is a \nsignal that we are not going to continue to build weapons systems that \nare plagued with cost overruns, which outlive their requirements for \ndefending this Nation and, very frankly, starts to gain control of the \nacquisition process which is completely out of control.\n  The Government Accountability Office recently concluded that there \nwere over $295 billion in cost overruns in the last several years--$295 \nbillion in cost overruns. Recently, a close friend of mine and great \nleader and former Secretary of the Navy wrote an article in the Wall \nStreet Journal. He stated:\n\n       When John McCain was shot down over Hanoi in 1967, he was \n     flying an A-4 sky hawk. That jet cost $860,000.\n\n  By the way, I didn't know that cost to the taxpayers I had caused. \nBut the jet cost $860,000.\n\n       Inflation has risen by 700 percent since then. So Mr. \n     McCain's A-4 cost $6.1 million in 2008 dollars. Applying a \n     generous factor of three for technological improvements, the \n     price for a 2008 Navy F-18 fighter should be $18 million. \n     Instead, we are paying about $90 million for each new \n     fighter. As a result, the Navy cannot buy sufficient numbers. \n     This is disarmament without a treaty.\n       The situation is worse in the Air Force.\n\n  Then Secretary Lehman says:\n\n       In 1983, I was in the Pentagon meeting that launched the F-\n     22 Raptor. The plan was to buy 648 jets beginning in 1996 for \n     $60 million each. . . .\n\n  That was in 1983 dollars.\n\n       Now they cost $350 million apiece and the Obama budget caps \n     the program at 187 jets.\n\n  Then he adds:\n\n       At least they are safe from cyberattack since no one in \n     China knows how to program the '83 vintage IBM software that \n     runs them.\n\n  He then goes on to cite other problems, including Navy shipbuilding \nfiascoes, et cetera.\n\n     . . . the Army's Future Combat System that was meant to re-\n     equip the entire Army, the 400 percent cost overrun of the \n     new Air Force weather satellite . . .\n\n  And similar cost overruns.\n  It is out of control, I say to my colleagues. I will match my \ncommitment to equipping the men and women in the military with that of \nanyone in this body, but it has to stop, and this vote on the F-22 will \ndetermine whether it is business as usual with the earmarking and pork-\nbarreling of billions of dollars which has bred corruption--we have \nformer Members of the Congress residing in Federal prison--or whether \nwe are going to finally get it under control.\n  Who better to be a spokesperson, in my view, than our Secretary of \nDefense? I have known and admired many Secretaries of Defense. I know \nof no one whom I admire more than Secretary Gates. He gave a very \nimportant speech, on July 16, at the Economic Club of Chicago--a \nremarkable speech. I hope all my colleagues would have the chance to \nread it. In part of it he says, about the problems we are having in \ndefense spending:\n\n       First, there is the Congress, which is understandably \n     concerned, especially in these tough economic times, about \n     protecting jobs in certain states and congressional \n     districts. There is the defense and aerospace industry, which \n     has an obvious financial stake in the survival and growth of \n     these programs.\n       And there is the institutional military itself--within the \n     Pentagon, and as expressed through an influential network of \n     retired generals and admirals, some of whom are paid \n     consultants to the defense industry, and some who often are \n     quoted as experts in the news media.\n\n  Secretary Gates goes on to say:\n\n       As a result, many past attempts by my predecessors to end \n     failing or unnecessary programs went by the wayside. \n     Nonetheless, I determined in a triumph of hope over \n     experience, and the President agreed--\n\n  I wish to emphasize my strong support and appreciation for the \nPresident's stand on this issue.\n\n     --and the President agreed, that given the urgency of the \n     wars we are in, the daunting global security environment we \n     will inhabit for decades to come, and our country's economic \n     problems, we simply cannot afford to move ahead with business \n     as usual.\n\n  Then, later on, he talks about the F-22.\n\n       Air superiority and missile defense--two areas where the \n     budget has attracted the most criticism--provide case \n     studies. Let me start with the controversy over the F-22 \n     fighter jet. We had to consider, when preparing for a future \n     conventional state-on-state conflict, what is the right mix \n     of the most advanced fighter aircraft and other weapons to \n     deal with the known and projected threats to U.S. air \n     supremacy. For example, we now have unmanned aerial vehicles \n     that can simultaneously perform intelligence, \n     reconnaissance--\n\n  Et cetera.\n       The President's budget would buy 48 of the most advanced \n     UAVs. We also took into consideration the capabilities of the \n     newest manned combat aircraft program, the stealth F-35 Joint \n     Strike Fighter. The F-35 is 10 to 15 years newer than the F-\n     22.\n\n  He goes on to say how important the F-35 is, and then he says:\n\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\n\n       The F-22 is clearly a capability we do need--a niche, \n     silver-bullet solution for one or two potential scenarios--\n     specifically the defeat of a highly advanced enemy fighter \n     fleet. The F-22, to be blunt, does not make much sense \n     anyplace else in the spectrum of conflict.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, would you ask yourselves why the F-22 has never \nflown over Iraq or Afghanistan. It has been in production for nearly 5 \nyears. It has never flown over Iraq or Afghanistan. And I want to \nemphasize that I think it is an important fighter. We are building 187 \nof them. The question before this body is why we continue to build \nmore, whether we continue to build more, or the F-35, the Joint Strike \nFighter, which goes to the Marine Corps and the Navy and the Air Force. \nIs this the weapons system we need to balance our entire capability of \nmanned aircraft?\n  I would ask my colleagues, since the F-22 was on the drawing boards \nand moved into production, look at the advancement in unmanned aerial \nvehicles. I say that as an old pilot. The unmanned aerial vehicles have \nbeen performing a magnificent job both in Iraq and Afghanistan. They \nhave been a critical element sometimes on the battlefields. And this \nPresident's budget understands that and gives extreme priority to that.\n  So as we go on, in light of these factors, Secretary Gates goes on to \nsay:\n\n       With the support of Air Force leadership, I concluded that \n     183--the program of record since 2005, plus four more added \n     in the FY 09 supplemental--was a sufficient number of F-22s \n     and recommended as such to the President.\n       The reaction from parts of Washington has been predictable \n     for many of the reasons I described before. The most \n     substantive criticism is that completing the F-22 program \n     means we are risking the future of U.S. air supremacy. To \n     assess this risk, it is worth looking at real-world potential \n     threat and assessing the capabilities that other countries \n     have now or in the pipeline.\n\n  The fact is, in the view of the President of the United States, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nChief of Staff of the Air Force, and most any objective observer of the \nmilitary scene, they believe the F-22 is important, we need to have \nwhat we have, but it is now time to move on to the F-35, the Joint \nStrike Fighter.\n  So this amendment really means, are we going to look at the real and \ncompelling needs we have to have in order to win the war in \nAfghanistan, continue our success in Iraq, and put our funds into that \nkind of equipment and weapons systems or are we going to continue?\n  Finally, I have great sympathy for the Senator from Georgia and other \nSenators who have come to the floor. I understand the sincerity of \ntheir views. I respect them. I would also point out, though, that to \nargue we should build weapons systems in the name of jobs is not what \nwe should be about. What we should be about is procuring and building \nthe best weapons systems to ensure our national security and how we can \nbest equip the men and women who are in harm's way all around the world \ntoday.\n  So I understand the economic impact, particularly in these hard \ntimes. My sympathy goes out to the communities that are dependent on \nthe contracts for the F-22 aircraft. All I can say to them is we will \ndo everything we can to help you and your families and make the \nadjustments, and there will be--we continue to increase spending on \ndefense. We hope that we will be able to provide you with the necessary \njobs and manufacturing that would be devoted to what we have \nascertained as our national defense weapons systems procurement \npriorities, I say with sympathy to my colleagues who are deeply \nconcerned about the loss of jobs in these difficult economic times. But \nthis is not the way to provide jobs. Our obligation is to defend this \nNation.\n  So I think this amendment is overdue. I think it will be a \nsignificant, a very significant amendment, as I said before, as to \nwhether we will get our priorities straight and listen to our esteemed \nSecretary of Defense, our President, our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, and other military leaders in whose hands we entrust to make \nthe tough decisions. I understand the final decision is here in \nCongress, but I also don't think we should dismiss the arguments that \nhave been made by I think one of the finest men to ever serve this \ncountry, and that is Secretary of Defense Gates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Utah?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I will be happy to yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, during his July 16 address, the Secretary \nof Defense, Robert Gates, said the military needed maximum versatility \nto bring to bear in a wide range of armed conflicts. Last January, he \nargued that ``our military must be prepared for a full spectrum of \noperations, including the [insurgent] type of combat we are facing in \nIraq and Afghanistan as well as large-scale threats that we face from \nplaces like North Korea and Iran.''\n  I could not agree more with Secretary Gates. However, just as our \nNation unwisely disregarded the hard-learned lessons of how to fight \ncounterinsurgency operations after Vietnam, the Defense Department \nseems poised to make similar errors by limiting our capability to \ndefeat the air threat of today and tomorrow: the integrated air defense \nsystem.\n  This advanced system is composed of extended-range Russian surface-\nto-air missiles such as the S-300 and advanced fighters such as the Su-\n30, which have already been sold in large numbers to China and India. \nTogether, these systems make penetrating hostile airspace extremely \ndifficult, if not deadly, for aircraft lacking the F-22's advanced \nstealth technology and capability for sustained supersonic speeds. It \nis these capabilities that enable the Raptor to have the unique \ncapability to conduct stealth operations at any time of day or night.\n  Secretary Gates argues for ceasing production of the F-22 after only \n187 are built because we will not face what the Pentagon refers to as a \n``near-peer adversary'' for the foreseeable future.\n  For the sake of our Nation, I hope he is right. However, I believe \nthis statement misses a critical point: advanced integrated air defense \nsystems are comparably inexpensive and readily affordable by nations \nsuch as Iran, with its insistence on developing nuclear weapons.\n  History provides ample examples of the effective use of integrated \nair defense systems by nations that lack the resources to be considered \na near-peer adversary of the U.S. As retired LTG Michael Dunn recently \nnoted, North Vietnam defended its territory during the Vietnam war with \nwhat, at the time, was an advanced air defense system. This system, \ncomprised of surface-to-air missiles and fewer than 200 fighters, was \nable to shoot down 2,448 American aircraft.\n  The 1973 War between Israel and Egypt is another example. The \nEgyptians learning from their recent defeats built an integrated air \ndefense umbrella under which its forces were able to initially make \nsignificant territorial gains, while the Israeli Air Force faced \nserious losses. Only when the Egyptians advanced beyond the range of \ntheir surface-to-air missiles' umbrella was the Israeli Air Force able \nto inflict a significant blow.\n  A more contemporary example is the loss in the 1990s of an F-117 \nNighthawk to the Serbians, who were not equipped with the latest air \ndefense system.\n  Despite such examples, some argue additional F-22s are not necessary \nsince stealthy jet-powered unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, which are \nstill under development, will play an increasingly vital role in \ndestroying critical ground targets. This is true for threats on the \nground, but I am unaware of any plans to operationally deploy a UAV \nthat can dogfight existing or next-generation Russian and Chinese jet \nfighters, which will be hunting these UAVs.\n  Our forces could be confronted with the next generation Russian and \nChinese fighters soon. There have been numerous media reports the \nRussian Government is developing a new stealthy aircraft, presumably to \ncounter the F-22. This aircraft called PAK-FA, is being developed \njointly with the Indian Government. Additional media sources cite \nChina's development of a similar twin engine, stealth aircraft known as \nthe J-12.\n  Some argue that the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter can tackle those \nthreats and defeat this new generation of advanced aircraft. While the \nF-35 is a\n\n[[Page S7733]]\n\nvery capable stealth aircraft, it was designed to complement the F-22, \nnot replace it. The fact is the F-35 is neither as capable a fighter \nnor as stealthy as the F-22. For example, the F-35 does not have, nor \ncan be upgraded to use, the supercruise engines increasingly needed in \ntoday's stealth operations.\n  Remember the F-22 is the NASCAR racer of this air-dominance team. \nFast and unseen, the Raptor will punch a hole in an enemy's defenses, \nquickly dispatching any challenger in the air and striking at the most \nimportant ground targets. The Joint Strike Fighter is the rugged SUV of \nthe team. Impressive, but not as maneuverable or capable of sustained \nsupersonic speeds, the F-35 will exploit the hole opened by the F-22 \nand attack additional targets and directly support our ground forces. \nThis is not to say the F-35 is not a highly capable stealthy aircraft. \nBut the F-35's role is to supplement the F-22, not substitute for it. \nOnly by utilizing the strengths of both aircraft do we ensure air \ndominance for the next 40 years.\n  Furthermore, if the F-22 is such a boondoggle, why do our allies such \nas Japan and Australia want to spend billions to purchase the aircraft? \nWhy does Australia, for instance, plan to purchase up to 100 F-35s and \nlarge numbers of UAVs, and yet remains interested in the F-22? Perhaps \nit is because Australia understands the Russians and the Chinese are \ndeveloping even more sophisticated surface-to-air missile systems and \nstealth fighters, threats the F-22 is uniquely designed and equipped to \ndestroy.\n  Others point out the F-22 has not been deployed in support of our \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is true. However, there were \nrecent plans to deploy the F-22 to the Persian Gulf. But according to \nthe July 9, 2008, edition of the widely respected Defense News, the \nPentagon overruled those plans, citing concerns about ``strategic \ndislocation.'' This means the F-22 is hardly a dinosaur. It is a weapon \nthat can change the balance of power in a region and deter our \nadversaries.\n  In conclusion, I am reminded of a point author Michael Korda made in \nhis book about the Battle of Britain. He observed that even though the \ntwo British prime ministers before Winston Churchill pursued a policy \nof appeasement, they also committed their government to develop and \nprocure the three pieces of equipment: the Spitfire fighter, Hurricane \nfighter and radar, which were to ensure that nation's survival during \nthe Battle of Britain.\n  I hope the Senate will profit from these lessons of history and vote \nagainst the McCain-Levin amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time remains for the proponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 21 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask Senator Wyden, how much time does he need?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I believe 10 minutes would be plenty.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise this morning to support the Levin-\nMcCain amendment. It seems to me that buying more F-22s at this point \nwould meet the very definition of government waste.\n  What you have is a situation where the Pentagon, which, suffice it to \nsay, has not exactly been shy over the years in terms of calling for \nadditional weapons, is on record as saying this is unnecessary. \nFurther, I have been out talking with members of the Guard at home and \ntrying to get their sense of what is needed in this dangerous time, and \nthey have never once mentioned something like this.\n  They talk, for example, about body armor. They talk about boots. They \ndon't talk about more F-22s. Suffice it to say, when the Congress is \nnow having a debate about trying to find additional money for health \ncare, for example, to go out and spend close to $2 billion to buy seven \nmore F-22 fighters the Air Force says it doesn't want defies common \nsense.\n  My home State, for example, would love to hire back police and other \nessential workers who have been laid off. Instead of building seven \nplanes, we could be restoring infrastructure and developing renewable \nenergy. Again, in my home State, we have had budget shortfalls. We have \nseen reductions in essential services, law enforcement being one. The \ndebate is not about necessary steps to ensuring a strong national \ndefense. The question is about whether the U.S. Congress wants to spend \nclose to $2 billion to pay for more fighter jets the Air Force does not \nwant.\n  It is also important to remember that the F-22 is not being purchased \nfor wars the United States is currently fighting. Certainly, the \nTaliban and Iraqi insurgents do not have an Air Force. The F-22 is \nbeing purchased to fight in possible future conflicts with other \ncountries that may have an air force. While I strongly believe the \nPentagon ought to be able to prepare for such possibilities, it is the \nPentagon that is telling us we don't need these additional F-22s.\n  It is also important to note that the Pentagon has purchased 187 F-\n22s. There is not a debate about whether the United States ought to \nhave fighters in our arsenal. The question is whether the Air Force \nneeds 194 of them instead of 187. We have a very good Secretary of \nDefense, Robert Gates. The Secretary has said that 187 is sufficient to \ncombat current and future threats. He is the one who said that more are \nnot needed. He is the one who said:\n\n       We must break the old habit of adding layer upon layer of \n     cost, complexity, and delay to systems that are so expensive \n     and so elaborate that only a small number can be built, and \n     that are then usable only in a narrow range of low \n     probability scenarios.\n\n  Secretary Gates has hit the nail about as perfectly on the head as \none can. He and our country want the strongest defense possible. But \nthere are ways to make better use of that $1.75 billion than on seven \nmore F-22s.\n  I serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. I know there \nare threats to our forces every single day. I see the Senator from \nGeorgia who serves on the Intelligence Committee. He believes strongly \nabout this as well. We need to make sure we are protecting our troops \nin harm's way, but we have a variety of choices in order to secure the \nprotection our troops have been in need of. I intend to work with \nChairman Levin, Secretary Gates, the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, and the President to ensure we replace the current F-15 with \nmore capable and safer fighters.\n  Last month, I visited with some of the 3,000 members of the Oregon \nNational Guard's 41st brigade combat team, as they trained for their \ncurrent deployment to Iraq. Not a one of the soldiers told me that \ntheir big concern was whether the Air Force would have 194 F-22s \ninstead of 187. They talked to me instead about the best vehicles, the \nbest medical care if they are injured, about the best body armor. Not \none of them mentioned the F-22.\n  I am not voting against the F-22. I am voting for the soldier, the \ntaxpayer. They both deserve our government's greatest protection at \nthis critical time in our history.\n  I urge colleagues to support the Levin-McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to address the F-22 program. \nFor the past week as the debate has swirled around on this program I \nhave not spoken on the subject. My colleagues know that I have strongly \nsupported the F-22 program over the past two decades. Why? Because it \nis without question the world's most advanced fighter aircraft. It's \ncapabilities far outstrip anything else in the world. There simply is \nno match.\n  When the Advanced Tactical Fighter Program began more than 20 years \nago, no one could foresee what the world would look like in 2009. We \nplanned to build 750 F-22s in order to match the Soviet Union's assumed \nfar greater number of advanced fighters. The F-22 was designed with a \ngoal of defeating 10 Soviet fighters apiece. The strategy was that \nusing a combination of stealth and an advanced radar the F-22 would be \nable to attack Soviet fighters long before the adversary knew they were \nthere.\n  I am pleased to note that 20 years later as we train with the F-22 \nour Air Force pilots report that is exactly what it can do. Time after \ntime as we exercise with the F-22, the results are nearly the same. The \nF-22 defeats all\n\n[[Page S7734]]\n\nadversaries nearly with the same predictions as the designers hoped it \nwould do.\n  What has changed, however, is that the Soviet Union no longer poses \nthe threat that was assumed by the Defense Department in the 1980s. So \nthen, critics say, why do we need to continue to buy more? We will soon \nhave 187 aircraft that should be sufficient.\n  They note that the F-22 hasn't been used in Afghanistan. While that \nis considered a clear argument that it isn't needed, it is laughable. \nAs far as I know al- Qaida and the Taliban don't have an air force. The \nF-22 is designed to defeat conventional military forces. It is \ndesigned, for example, to counter a conventional attack by an adversary \nagainst one of its neighbors. Were the Chinese to attack Taiwan, the F-\n22 would provide an incredible counter to the Chinese. The same would \nbe true if a resurgent Russia were to try to reclaim countries in the \nBaltics. Unless we truly believe that we will never face another nation \nstate in a conventional conflict then the F-22 is indeed necessary.\n  At 187 aircraft, the F-22 provides a very credible deterrent to those \nnations. Is it sufficient? Perhaps. Will the Joint Strike Fighter \nreplace it, not a chance. The Joint Strike Fighter, we expect, will be \na terrific aircraft, but it is designed primarily to attack ground \ntargets. In a battle against the F-22, it would likely lose each \nengagement. With better trained pilots and tactics, the Joint Strike \nFighter could probably give the F-22 a run for its money, but it was \nnever designed to replace the F-22 and should not be viewed as such.\n  To me what is maddening about this debate is the sense that the \ndecision is so clear cut that the F-22 program should be killed that it \nis only parochial politics that could keep it alive. That is pure \nhogwash.\n  The Nation has invested more than $65 billion to develop and buy 187 \naircraft. If we choose to buy more F-22s we will do so at a very \nreasonable price--about $150 million. While that is not cheap by any \nstretch of the imagination, it is far cheaper than what we paid to \ninitiate the program. And, if we kill the program and decide that we \nneed to restart it in a few years, it is far cheaper than we would have \nto pay to resuscitate production.\n  This is not a boondoggle. We don't have critics saying the program is \nflawed and should be killed. Everyone agrees it is a great aircraft. \nWhile some of my colleagues obviously support the program because it \nmeans jobs in their States, others like myself who have no F-22 jobs in \ntheir States support the program because of its capabilities and their \nconcern for the future. Why then has it become an issue over which to \nveto a bill? Why are the stakes so high with this program?\n  I have the greatest respect for the President and the current \nSecretary of Defense. I have supported both in almost every initiative \nthey have advocated. But I see in this case a pattern that I have \nwitnessed over and over again.\n  Time after time our new leaders, both civilian and military, look at \na program and see all the reasons why it isn't the right one. For \nexample, in the early days of the Clinton administration the C-17 \nprogram was nearly terminated because the production of the aircraft \nwasn't performing up to expectations. I recall 2 years prior to that \nthe Appropriations Committee recommended a pause in funding for the C-\n17, not because we had lost confidence in the program. We still \nbelieved in the requirement for the aircraft, but the program wasn't \nperforming. Up to that point, we had appropriated funds for 16 C-17s in \ntotal, but not a single one had been delivered, and there were very few \ncoming together on the factory floor in Long Beach. We weren't \nrecommending cancellation, but it served notice that attention was \nneeded. However, the attention that the program received was mostly \nfrom critics who sought its termination.\n  When the Clinton administration came into office many of the new \nofficials were convinced that the C-17 should be terminated. In that \ninstance the Pentagon mandated a study to determine whether the C-17 \nwas still required. Luckily the conclusion was that yes the plane was \nstill needed and those who were calling for its cancellation, including \nsome in Congress, would not get their way.\n  It was only a few years earlier that Secretary Cheney determined that \nthe V-22 should be terminated. He was justifiably concerned that the \nprice was increasing and that the program was taking longer than \nplanned. It took the concerted effort of the Congress to stand up and \nsay that we would not allow the program to be terminated. Certainly \nthere were those in the Pentagon who agreed with the Secretary, but the \nMarines did not.\n  I am told that a few years prior to that my good friend Senator \nRudman weighed in with Chairman Stevens to overrule the Air Force who \nwanted to kill the F-117 after the production of only one squadron of \naircraft. I should point out that the F-117 was not built in New \nHampshire. There might have been some modest amount of work associated \nwith the plane in his state, but the reason that Senator Rudman \ninsisted that we keep buying the F-117 was because of its unique \ncapabilities not for any parochial reason.\n  My colleagues all know the history of the B-2 program. It was started \nas a classified program in 1981. The Air Force was going to build 132 \nbombers. We expected it to cost between $20 and $25 billion in total. \nThe contractor built a huge state of the art factory out in the high \ndesert of California to handle the production of the aircraft. Because \nit was highly classified every precaution had to be taken to protect \nnational security all of which dramatically increased the cost to \nproduce the aircraft.\n  Clearly the contractor and Air Force were overly optimistic on the \ncost and schedule of the program. Within 5 years it was clear that the \nprogram was not going to be completed within $25 billion. As \ndevelopment delays occurred, costs continued to escalate. The Air Force \nwas unwilling to devote more resources to the program so in a series of \nmoves it consistently delayed production of the aircraft and \ntransferred dollars appropriated to build the aircraft to be used \ninstead to cover higher development costs. By the time I became \nchairman, it was clear that the program would exceed its budget, but it \nwas also clear that if it were successful it would provide an unmatched \ncapability to this Nation. As costs mounted, the Defense Department \ndetermined that it would not be able to purchase all 132 aircraft. \nFirst production was cut to 75 and eventually it dropped to 20. In 1996 \nas the program was being killed, the contractor offered to produce \nthree per year for several years at a price of about $600 million per \ncopy. However, by that time support for the program had eroded so that \nneither the Pentagon nor the Congress would take up the offer. Instead, \nby only buying a total of 21 aircraft, we invested over $2 billion per \nplane making it the most costly aircraft in history.\n  This situation isn't unique to aircraft programs. In the case of \nshipbuilding, I remember vividly Secretary Cheney's decision to cancel \nthe Seawolf submarine. As a result of that decision, the three Seawolf-\nclass submarines that were eventually built were very expensive. \nBecause we only bought three, the average cost of each submarine was \nmore than $4 billion. Had we built the 29 originally planned, I can \nonly speculate about the cost, but it would certainly have been less \nthan the price we are now paying for its replacement. What is even more \ngalling is that during that time we were still building the capable \nSSN-688 Los Angeles class submarines and only paying about $800 million \napiece for them. Instead of reinvigorating that program, we cancelled \nthe Seawolf program and proceeded with the New Attack submarine, now \ncalled the Virginia class, in order to move to a cheaper submarine. \nRegrettably, I have to report that the cost of the Virginia class \nsubmarine is so high that we have only been able to afford to purchase \none per year. When I became chairman we were buying four Los Angeles \nclass submarines a year and paying only 1/3 the cost of the Virginia \nclass. Is the Virginia a better submarine? Surely it is. The \ntechnological advances that the Nation has developed between the time \nthe Los Angeles subs were designed and this decade have allowed for \nsubstantial improvements. Is it better than the Seawolf? That is \ndebatable.\n  The pattern I have watched during my tenure is a mix of four things.\n\n[[Page S7735]]\n\nFirst, programs are cancelled before or as they reach maturity. Why? \nSometimes because new leadership wants to go in a new direction more \noften, and important costs increase and schedules are delayed which \nerode the support for the programs. Sometimes programs are cancelled \nbecause we believe the promised replacement will be more capable or \ncheaper. And sometimes we argue times have changed and we don't need \nthem. In a few cases it is clear that the program wasn't performing as \nexpected and should be terminated.\n  For the F-22 some will argue it is too expensive. That was the \nargument against the V-22 program. Some say we simply don't need any \nmore. That was the argument used to kill the B-2. Would we like to have \nmore B-2s in the inventory today? I, for one, surely would.\n  Others will say the threat doesn't warrant buying more F-22s. This is \nwhere I have my gravest concern. Some experts will tell you that we \nknow that potential adversaries are working on fifth generation \nfighters. If in 5 years the Chinese unveil a new fifth generation \nfighter and begin to produce it in numbers will we regret the decision \nto kill the F-22, I believe we would.\n  I am told that no one is likely to be able to develop and build an F-\n22 equivalent aircraft for a generation. The skill and funding required \nto do so exceeds any foreign nation's ability. But in my view, they \nmight not be able to design an F-22 themselves, but that doesn't mean \nthey can't steal the plans.\n  We were told that the North Koreans were years away from a long range \nmissile, then were surprised when they unveiled the Taepo dong. We were \nsurprised when Pakistan conducted a nuclear test. We were shocked when \nthe Soviet Union collapsed and most Americans were shocked when they \nlearned about al-Qaida after 9/11. if there is one thing that shouldn't \nsurprise us is that we cannot foretell the future.\n  So as my colleagues deliberate on the F-22 program I come down on the \nside of caution. I believe it makes more sense at this time to continue \nto produce the program to hedge our bets against the future.\n  To my knowledge there isn't a single worker in the State of Hawaii \nwhose job is dependent of continuing production of the F-22, but I \nbelieve the program merits continued production.\n  I believe it is unfortunate that the debate on this matter has taken \non an overblown proportion. One can make the case that 187 could be \nsufficient. Our Secretary and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs agree that \nis the case. But just like the Marines argued for continuing to produce \nthe V-22, the leaders of our Air National Guard and those in charge of \nflying the aircraft argue that we need more--even though the Defense \nSecretary said it should be cancelled.\n  When some say well, the Air Force leaders say they have enough, I \nwill remind my colleagues that the Air Force said the same thing about \nthe F-117 after we only produced one squadron.\n  When some say we should kill this and move on to the Joint Strike \nFighter, I remember the Seawolf debate. We killed that submarine to \nbuild a cheaper alternative. Will we do the same thing here and be \ndisappointed in the cost of the so-called alternative?\n  On February 2, 1989, I was selected as the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Defense of the Appropriations Committee. For the past \n20 years, it has been my distinct honor to serve either as the chairman \nof the ranking member of this subcommittee. As my colleagues all know, \nthe defense subcommittee has the largest budget of any of our \nAppropriations subcommittees, and to many of us it is probably the most \nimportant of our subcommittees. It has required a great deal of my time \nand attention over the past 20 years. For me it has been a labor of \nlove. I have the greatest respect for the men and women of this Nation \nwho are willing to serve and who guarantee constitutional freedoms for \nthe rest of us. It has been my priority to support their cause during \nthis period.\n  As I consider the F-22, I do so with the past twenty years as my \nguide. In my opinion what I have learned has taught me to be cautious \nas we kill programs. Therefore today I will cast my vote to continue \nthe F-22 program.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am going to continue to support \nproduction of the F-22 Raptor because we are still hearing strong \nindications from top military leaders that we need additional aircraft. \nLast month, General Corley, the Commander of the Air Force Air Combat \nCommand, wrote that ending procurement of the F-22 would put our \nability to execute our nation's military strategy at ``high risk'' over \nthe ``near to mid-term.''\n  In addition, LTG Harry M. Wyatt III, the Director of the Air National \nGuard, has stated that these aircraft are particularly important for \nhomeland defense missions, including addressing potential threats from \ncruise missiles.\n  GEN Merrill McPeak, retired, the former Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce, also recently added that ending F-22 procurement ``is a real \nmistake,'' and that ``we certainly need some figure well above 200.''\n  I am also not prepared to vote to end production because I have yet \nto see a conclusive study indicating that 187 F-22s are enough. In \nfact, as late as May 19 of this year, GEN Norman A. Schwartz, the Chief \nof Staff of the Air Force, told the House Armed Services Committee that \n``243 F-22s is the right number. . . .''\n  The United States has made a significant investment in the F-22 \nprogram. Before terminating it, we must see in unequivocal terms how \nthe defense planning process has determined that requirements and \nthreats have changed to stop production at 187.\n  The next Quadrennial Defense Review--QDR--which outlines our national \nsecurity strategy--is scheduled for submission by the Department of \nDefense in early 2010. This important document shapes how our military \nwill respond to threats to our national security. The timing of today's \nvote ignores this review.\n  I will feel more confident making a decision on this important \nprogram after reading the QDR, as it will shape our national security \nstrategy for years to come. As GEN James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during his confirmation hearing for \nhis second 2-year term, ``The military requirement right now [for the \nF-22A] is associated with the strategy that we are laying out in the \nQuadrennial Defense Review.''\n  While I realize that there are compelling arguments on both sides of \nthis issue, I do not believe we have enough information at this time to \nshut down the F-22 line and terminate the program at 187 aircraft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 11 minutes; the \nSenator from Michigan has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am not sure how many other Senators \nwant to speak or whether the opponents have speakers remaining on their \nside.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, Senator Inhofe indicated a desire to \nspeak. He is tied up in an EPW Committee hearing. He may be able to get \nhere.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We would like to be at the end of the line, Senator McCain \nand I.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I will be happy to make some comments. Then Senator \nMcCain and Senator Dodd and the Senator from Michigan could close it \nout. If Senator Inhofe comes in, we will give him a couple of minutes.\n  Madam President, would the Chair notify me when I have used 5 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I want to make a couple of quick \ncomments relative to some of what has been said. First, with regard to \nSenator Wyden's comments concerning the National Guard, sure, all of us \nwant to make sure we equip our Guard, our Reserve, as well as our \nactive-duty force with all the needs they have. I would cite him to the \nletter of General Wyatt, who is the head of the Air Force Guard. \nGeneral Wyatt says the F-22 is uniquely qualified to fill the needs the \nGuard has for its national security mission. To even slightly indicate \nthat the Guard has issues with this program is simply not correct. The \nGuard is on record as being a strong supporter of this program.\n  I have a letter from retired GEN David Bockel, retired from the \nUnited States Army. He now is the acting executive director of the \nReserve Officers Association. Let me quote part of this:\n\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\n\n       War plans of the United States are predicated upon \n     technological air dominance to provide asymmetric advantage \n     for victory. Military experts believe the current cap of 187 \n     F-22s is an inadequate number of aircraft to ensure no future \n     threat can impede the U.S. air dominance. The minimum number \n     of F-22s required to ensure a strong defense is 250.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of retired General Bockel be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Reserve Officers Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2009.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: The Reserve Officers Association, \n     representing 65,000 Reserve Component members, supports \n     additional procurement of the F-22 Raptor Aircraft. ROA urges \n     Congress to authorize and appropriate funds for continued \n     production of the F-22 Raptor.\n       War plans of the United States are predicated upon \n     technological air dominance to provide asymmetric advantage \n     for victory. Military experts believe the current cap of 187 \n     F-22 is an inadequate number of aircraft to ensure no future \n     threat can impede U.S. air dominance. The minimum number of \n     F-22s required to ensure a strong defense is 250.\n       Potential adversary nations are committed to producing \n     their own fifth-generation aircraft in the immediate future. \n     Not providing further funding for this crucial weapons system \n     places at risk our nation's ability to meet known and near \n     future threats. The United States can ill afford a fighter \n     gap or to rely on legacy aircraft.\n       Thank you for your efforts on this key issue, and other \n     support to the military that you have shown in the past. \n     Please feel free to have your staff call ROA's legislative \n     director, Marshall Hanson, with any question or issue you \n     would like to discuss.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              David R. Bockel,\n\n                                     Major General, USA (Retired),\n                                        Acting Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I also have quoted earlier the comments by an active-\nduty general, a guy I consider a great American hero, not just because \nhe falls in that category of wearing the uniform of the United States, \nbut he is standing up to the personnel at the Pentagon. He is saying: \nYou guys are wrong.\n  For an active-duty general to do that takes significant courage. This \nis a guy I want in the foxhole with me. That is General Corley, \ncommander of Air Combat Command, who very clearly says in a letter that \nwe have previously entered into the Record that a fleet of 187 F-22s \nputs execution of our national military strategy at high risk in the \nnear to midterm and that the minimum number of F-22s we need, in his \nopinion, is 381.\n  I want to also talk for a minute about Senator McCain's comments on \nthe cost. This is an expensive weapons system, but it is also the most \nsophisticated weapons system ever designed by mankind. Most \nimportantly, it is doing its job. It is doing its job in a very \nprofessional way. Instead of costing the $350 million Senator McCain \nstated in his earlier statements, because of a multiyear procurement \ncontract we entered into between the Pentagon and the Air Force, as \napproved by this body--and I know Senator McCain objected to that and I \nunderstand that--but by a vote of 70 to 28, that multiyear contract was \napproved by this body as well as by the House. As a result, instead of \npaying the $350 million per copy he alluded to, we are today, under \nthat multiyear contract, paying $140 million a copy. That is in \ncomparison to the $200 million a copy that will be paid for every \nsingle F-35 we are buying in this budget. The figure for 200 F-35s in \nthis budget exceeds $6 billion.\n  There are a number of people who are watching this debate out there \ntoday. Certainly those folks at the Pentagon are anxiously awaiting the \nresults of the vote. The White House is anxiously awaiting the results \nof the vote. The Chinese are anxiously awaiting this vote. Let me tell \ncolleagues why. I want to quote from an article of July 19 from a \ngentleman named Robert D. Fisher, Jr., who is a senior fellow with the \nInternational Assessment and Strategy Center. He writes:\n\n       Though the Chinese government says next to nothing and the \n     U.S. Government says very little, what is known about China's \n     fifth-generation fighter program is disturbing. Both of \n     China's fighter manufacturers, the Shenyang and Chengdu \n     Aircraft corporations, are competing to build a heavy fifth-\n     generation fighter, and there are serious indicators China \n     may be working on a medium-weight fifth-generation fighter \n     similar to the F-35. China can be expected to put a fifth-\n     generation fighter on its future aircraft carriers, and it \n     can be expected to build more than 187.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 19, 2009]\n\n                        F-22 Fighters for Japan\n\n                       (By Richard D. Fisher Jr.)\n\n       If Japan's long-standing effort to acquire the Lockheed-\n     Martin F-22 Raptor fifth-generation superfighter falls victim \n     to Washington power politics, the United States may \n     inadvertently encourage an Asian arms race over which it may \n     have little control.\n       It is fortunate for the United States that in what may be \n     the last year a deal is possible, Senate Appropriations \n     Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye and his supporters have \n     decided to lead an effort to reverse a 1998 law barring \n     foreign sale of the F-22.\n       Through Mr. Inouye's efforts Japan now knows a slightly \n     degraded export model of the Raptor may take five years to \n     develop and cost about $290 million a plane for about 40, \n     compared to the estimated $150 million the U.S. Air Force \n     pays.\n       Japan's long-standing quest to obtain the F-22, however, \n     may be shot down amid the intense political struggle over the \n     F-22s very future. President Obama and Defense Secretary \n     Robert M. Gates have made termination of F-22 production at \n     187 planes a symbolic goal of their effort to cut defense \n     spending and reorient U.S. military strategy. This has been \n     challenged recently by the House Armed Services Committee, \n     which approved the production of 12 more Raptors, and a \n     Senate committee that approved production of seven more. \n     However, the administration immediately threatened a veto, \n     and the F-22's opponents are working hard to ensure that \n     production ends in 2011 as currently planned.\n       After 2011, the F-22's costs will grow significantly, so \n     Japan and its U.S. supporters have little time to nail down a \n     deal. However, some U.S. officials have long doubted that \n     Japan can afford to pay for the F-22, which is why the George \n     W. Bush and Obama administrations have not seriously promoted \n     the F-22 for Japan. Mr. Gates reportedly favors selling Tokyo \n     the smaller, somewhat less capable and less expensive \n     Lockheed-Martin F-35 Lighting II.\n       While Japan may also purchase the F-35, there are two \n     important reasons Washington should fully support Japan's \n     goal to acquire the F-22. First, the F-22 will be the only \n     combat aircraft capable of countering China's expected fifth-\n     generation fighters. Second, selling Japan the Raptor may \n     become a critical nonnuclear means for Washington to help \n     Japan deter a China on its way to becoming a military \n     superpower by the 2020s. If Washington cannot provide \n     decisive nonnuclear means to deter China, Japan may more \n     quickly consider decisive deterrents such as missiles and \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Though the Chinese government says next to nothing and the \n     U.S. government says very little, what is known about China's \n     fifth-generation fighter program is disturbing. Both of \n     China's fighter manufacturers, the Shenyang and Chengdu \n     Aircraft corporations, are competing to build a heavy fifth-\n     generation fighter, and there are serious indicators China \n     may be working on a medium-weight fifth-generation fighter \n     similar to the F-35. China can be expected to put a fifth-\n     generation fighter on its future aircraft carriers, and it \n     can be expected to build more than 187.\n       Furthermore, China's development of anti-access \n     capabilities such as anti-ship ballistic missiles, its \n     buildup of nuclear-missile and anti-missile capabilities and \n     space-warfare weapons will increasingly undermine U.S. \n     strategic guarantees for Japan. China's development of long-\n     range anti-air and surface-to-air missiles also threatens the \n     electronic support aircraft critical to the ``networked'' \n     U.S. air-warfare paradigm, meaning that jet fighters could \n     quickly lose force-multiplying radar aircraft, tankers and \n     communication satellites. As such, Japan is correct to prefer \n     the F-22, which reportedly can fly 300 to 400 mph faster and \n     two miles higher than the F-35--an aircraft optimized for \n     attack, not air-superiority missions.\n       If Japan is serious about the F-22 and its military \n     security, it will have to pay for both. But if Washington is \n     serious about sustaining a strategic alliance, it should sell \n     the Raptor to Japan and be prepared to do more as China's \n     military looms larger.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. There is another group watching very anxiously out \nthere. It is a group of men and women who wear the uniform of the U.S. \nAir Force. They are lieutenants, captains, and majors. They are \nwatching this anxiously because they are saying to themselves: I signed \nup to be a part of a U.S. Air Force that believes in putting men and \nwomen in cockpits, men and women who are going to carry the fight to \nthe enemy. What am I hearing from Members of Congress? What am I \nhearing from the leadership at the Pentagon? That we are going to move \naway from the most advanced fighter in the world today and move to a\n\n[[Page S7737]]\n\nsmaller fighter? That we are going to move away from fighters maybe \neven altogether by going to UAVs? Is this the Air Force I signed up \nfor?\n  I can tell my colleagues why they are anxiously awaiting the outcome. \nThey have talked to me time and time again about the fact that they are \nconcerned about their future in the U.S. Air Force. The worst thing we \ncan do is to discourage those brave men and women who want to make a \ncareer of the Air Force and want to be wearing the two, three, and four \nstars one of these days. I assure my colleagues those lieutenants and \nthose captains and those majors are watching what this body does from a \npolicy standpoint today. They know where their leadership at the \nPentagon is coming from. They don't like what they are hearing. They \nare now looking to Congress to fulfill the role that John Hamre, the \ndirector of CSIS, has said time and time again, and that is to \nobjectively review the budget the Pentagon sends to the hill. We are in \nthe process of doing that and exercising the type of oversight we \nshould exercise.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield 2 minutes to Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I know almost everything that can be \nsaid has been said. Having served on the Armed Services Committee for \nquite some time and having watched this, what is kind of worrisome to \nme is that when we started out the F-22 program, the fifth generation \nfighter program, at that time they were talking about 750. Then the \nnumbers started coming down and approached, I guess, 243. The Air Force \nofficials have repeatedly stated that no fewer than that would be \nsufficient with a moderate level of risk.\n\n  My concern has been the same concern I have when we are talking about \nground capability, when we see countries such as China and Russia \npassing us up in areas. I will not bring up the NLOS cannon right now. \nBut there are many places where our prospective enemies have better \nequipment than we do. We do know China has their J-12s; and Russia, I \nbelieve they are calling theirs the T-50s. We do know those are fifth-\ngeneration fighters. It is very disturbing to me that we would consider \nstopping at this point when this is not going to be adequate to get us \nout of the medium-risk category.\n  So I certainly support the effort to maintain those seven. Quite \nfrankly, when Senator Chambliss offered the amendment to expand it by \nseven, I was thinking we should really be shooting for more, and I \nthink he agreed with that. However, apparently with the exports out \nthere and with the additional seven that were put in, in the committee, \nthat would be enough to keep the line open. So I strongly support the \neffort to keep those numbers where they are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time do the opponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, if the Senator from Arizona would go, and then \nSenator Dodd, and then myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we would be glad to yield a couple more \nminutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield 2 additional minutes to the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Three, four. I ask the Senator, do you want to go ahead \nnow?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I will wait a couple of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will be fairly brief. This argument \nhas been made, and we pretty well covered most of the issue. I would \nremind my colleagues that all the things we do are a matter of choice \nbecause we do not have unlimited amounts of funding, obviously, and if \nyou spend money on one project, then obviously you may have to spend \nless on another. That is the case of the F-35, if we do not eliminate \nthis $1.75 billion.\n  But most importantly, I want to point out again, this amendment is \nmore than just about a weapons system. This amendment is about whether \nwe will stop doing business as usual; that is, continuing to fund \nweapons systems that are no longer needed and unnecessary. We are not \nsaying the F-22 is not a good aircraft. We are saying it is time to end \nthe production of the F-22.\n  The President of the United States has threatened to veto this entire \nbill. That is not good for the men and women in the military to have to \ngo through this whole process over again. The Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and, very \nimportantly, the Secretary of Defense, who has served now under two \nPresidents and has gained the respect and appreciation of all of us for \nhis service--Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Secretary of \nDefense Gates' speech last July 16 to the Economic Club of Chicago be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Assistant \n           Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs).\n\n                        Economic Club of Chicago\n\n  (As Delivered by Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, Chicago, IL, \n                        Thursday, July 16, 2009)\n\n       Thank you, Secretary Daley, for that kind introduction.\n       It's an honor to be at the Economic Club of Chicago. I \n     certainly appreciate the special arrangements you made to \n     have me here this afternoon.\n       I thank all the distinguished citizens of this great city \n     who came here today. I am mindful I am speaking in the \n     adopted hometown of my boss. President Obama sends his \n     greetings, as do Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod and the rest \n     of the Chicago crew. They are no doubt discovering that \n     Washington is the true ``Windy City.''\n       The issue that brings me here today is central to the \n     security of all Americans: the future of the United States \n     military: How it should be organized, equipped--and funded--\n     in the years ahead, to win the wars we are in while being \n     prepared for threats on or beyond the horizon. Earlier this \n     year, I recommended to President Obama--and he \n     enthusiastically agreed--that we needed to fundamentally \n     reshape the priorities of America's defense establishment and \n     reform the way the Pentagon does business--in particular, the \n     weapons we buy, and how we buy them. Above all, to prepare to \n     wage future wars, rather than continuing the habit of \n     rearming for previous ones.\n       I am here on relatively short notice to speak publicly \n     about these matters because Congress is, as we speak, \n     debating the president's defense budget request for the next \n     fiscal year, a budget request that implements many needed \n     reforms and changes. Most of the proposals--especially those \n     that increase support for the troops, their families, and the \n     war effort--have been widely embraced. However, some of the \n     crucial reforms that deal with major weapons programs have \n     met with a less than enthusiastic reaction in the Congress, \n     among defense contractors, and within some quarters of the \n     Pentagon itself. And so I thought it appropriate to address \n     some of these controversial issues here--in a place that is, \n     appropriately enough not only the adopted home of our \n     Commander-in-Chief, but also a symbol of America's industrial \n     base and economic power.\n       First, some context on how we got to this point. President \n     Obama's budget proposal is, I believe, the nation's first \n     truly 21st century defense budget. It explicitly recognizes \n     that over the last two decades the nature of conflict has \n     fundamentally changed--and that much of America's defense \n     establishment has yet to fully adapt to the security \n     realities of the post-Cold War era and this complex and \n     dangerous new century.\n       During the 1990s, the United States celebrated the demise \n     of the Soviet Union and the so-called ``end of history'' by \n     making deep cuts in the funding for, and above all, the size \n     of the U.S. military, including a 40 percent drop in the size \n     of the Active Army. This took place even as a post-Cold War \n     world grew less stable, less predictable, and more turbulent. \n     The U.S. military, with some advances in areas such as \n     precision weaponry, essentially became a smaller version of \n     the force that held off the Soviets in Germany for decades \n     and expelled Iraq from Kuwait in 1991. There was little \n     appetite for, or interest in, preparing for what we call \n     ``irregular warfare''--campaigns against insurgents, \n     terrorists, militias, and other non-state groups. This was \n     the bipartisan reality both in the White House and in \n     Congress.\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\n       Of course, after September 11th, some things did change. \n     The base defense budget--not counting spending for the wars--\n     increased by some 70 percent over the next eight years. \n     During this period there were important changes in the way \n     U.S. forces were organized, based and deployed, and \n     investments were made in new technologies such as unmanned \n     aerial vehicles. However, when all was said and done, the way \n     the Pentagon selected, evaluated, developed, and paid for \n     major new weapons systems and equipment did not fundamentally \n     change--even after September 11th.\n       Indeed, the kinds of equipment, programs, and capabilities \n     needed to protect our troops and defeat the insurgencies in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan were not the highest priority of much of \n     the Defense Department, even after several years of war.\n       I learned about this lack of bureaucratic priority for the \n     wars we are in the hard way--during my first few months on \n     the job as the Iraq surge was getting underway. The \n     challenges I faced in getting what our troops needed in the \n     field stood in stark contrast to the support provided \n     conventional modernization programs--weapons designed to \n     fight other modern armies, navies, and air forces--that had \n     been in the pipeline for many years and had acquired a loyal \n     and enthusiastic following in the Pentagon, in the Congress, \n     and in industry. The most pressing needs of today's \n     warfighter--on the battlefield, in the hospital, or at home--\n     simply lacked place and power at the table when priorities \n     were being set and long-term budget decisions were being \n     made.\n       So the most important shift in President Obama's first \n     defense budget was to increase and institutionalize funding \n     for programs that directly support those fighting America's \n     wars and their families. Those initiatives included more \n     helicopter support, air lift, armored vehicles, personnel \n     protection equipment, and intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance assets for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n     In addition, we also increased funding for programs that \n     provide long-term support to military families and treatment \n     for the signature wounds of this conflict--such as traumatic \n     brain injury and post traumatic stress.\n       But, while the world of terrorists and other violent \n     extremists--of insurgents and IEDs--is with us for the long \n     haul, we also recognize that another world has emerged. \n     Growing numbers of countries and groups are employing the \n     latest and increasingly accessible technologies to put the \n     United States at risk in disruptive and unpredictable ways.\n       Other large nations--known in Pentagon lingo as ``near-\n     peers''--are modernizing their militaries in ways that could, \n     over time, pose a challenge to the United States. In some \n     cases, their programs take the form of traditional weapons \n     systems such as more advanced fighter aircraft, missiles, and \n     submarines.\n       But other nations have learned from the experience of \n     Saddam Hussein's military in the first and second Gulf wars--\n     that it is ill-advised, if not suicidal, to fight a \n     conventional war head-to-head against the United States: \n     fighter-to-fighter, ship-to-ship, tank-to-tank. They also \n     learned from a bankrupted Soviet Union not to try to outspend \n     us or match our overall capabilities. Instead, they are \n     developing asymmetric means that take advantage of new \n     technologies--and our vulnerabilities--to disrupt our lines \n     of communication and our freedom of movement, to deny us \n     access, and to narrow our military options and strategic \n     choices.\n       At the same time, insurgents or militias are acquiring or \n     seeking precision weapons, sophisticated communications, \n     cyber capabilities, and even weapons of mass destruction. The \n     Lebanese extremist group Hezbollah currently has more rockets \n     and high-end munitions--many quite sophisticated and \n     accurate--than all but a handful of countries.\n       In sum, the security challenges we now face, and will in \n     the future, have changed, and our thinking must likewise \n     change. The old paradigm of looking at potential conflict as \n     either regular or irregular war, conventional or \n     unconventional, high end or low--is no longer relevant. And \n     as a result, the Defense Department needs to think about and \n     prepare for war in a profoundly different way than what we \n     have been accustomed to throughout the better part of the \n     last century.\n       What is needed is a portfolio of military capabilities with \n     maximum versatility across the widest possible spectrum of \n     conflict. As a result, we must change the way we think and \n     the way we plan--and fundamentally reform--the way the \n     Pentagon does business and buys weapons. It simply will not \n     do to base our strategy solely on continuing to design and \n     buy--as we have for the last 60 years --only the most \n     technologically advanced versions of weapons to keep up with \n     or stay ahead of another superpower adversary--especially one \n     that imploded nearly a generation ago.\n       To get there we must break the old habit of adding layer \n     upon layer of cost, complexity, and delay to systems that are \n     so expensive and so elaborate that only a small number can be \n     built, and that are then usable only in a narrow range of \n     low-probability scenarios.\n       We must also get control of what is called ``requirements \n     creep''--where more features and capabilities are added to a \n     given piece of equipment, often to the point of absurdity. \n     The most flamboyant example of this phenomenon is the new \n     presidential helicopter-- what President Obama referred to as \n     defense procurement ``run amok.'' Once the analysis and \n     requirements were done, we ended up with a helicopter that \n     cost nearly half a billion dollars each and enabled the \n     president to, among other things, cook dinner while in \n     flight under nuclear attack.\n       We also had to take a hard look at a number of weapons \n     programs that were grotesquely over budget, were having major \n     performance problems, were reliant on unproven technology, or \n     were becoming increasingly detached from real world \n     scenarios--as if September 11th and the wars that followed \n     had never happened.\n       Those of you with experience in the technology or \n     manufacturing sectors have at some point probably faced some \n     combination of these challenges in your own businesses. But \n     in the defense arena, we faced an additional, usually \n     insurmountable obstacle to bring rationality to budget and \n     acquisition decisions. Major weapons programs, irrespective \n     of their problems or performance, have a habit of continuing \n     long after they are wanted or needed, recalling Ronald \n     Reagan's old joke that a government program represents the \n     closest thing we'll ever see to eternal life on this earth.\n       First, there is the Congress, which is understandably \n     concerned, especially in these tough economic times, about \n     protecting jobs in certain states and congressional \n     districts. There is the defense and aerospace industry, which \n     has an obvious financial stake in the survival and growth of \n     these programs.\n       And there is the institutional military itself--within the \n     Pentagon, and as expressed through an influential network of \n     retired generals and admirals, some of whom are paid \n     consultants to the defense industry, and some who often are \n     quoted as experts in the news media.\n       As a result, many past attempts by my predecessors to end \n     failing or unnecessary programs went by the wayside. \n     Nonetheless I determined in a triumph of hope over \n     experience, and the president agreed, that given the urgency \n     of the wars we are in, the daunting global security \n     environment we will inhabit for decades to come, and our \n     country's economic problems, we simply cannot afford to move \n     ahead with business as usual.\n       To this end, the president's budget request cut, curtailed, \n     or ended a number of conventional modernization programs--\n     satellites, ground vehicles, helicopters, fighters--that were \n     either performing poorly or in excess to real-world needs. \n     Conversely, future-oriented programs where the U.S. was \n     relatively underinvested were accelerated or received more \n     funding.\n       For example, we must sustain and continually improve our \n     specialized strategic deterrent to ensure that our--and our \n     allies'--security is always protected against nuclear-armed \n     adversaries. In an initiative little noticed, the President's \n     program includes money to begin a new generation of ballistic \n     missile submarines and nearly $700 million in additional \n     funds to secure and assure America's nuclear deterrent.\n       Some of our proposed reforms are meeting real resistance. \n     They are called risky. Or not meeting a certain military \n     requirement. Or lacking in study and analysis. Those three \n     words--requirements, risk, and, analysis--are commonly \n     invoked in defense matters. If applied correctly, they help \n     us make sound decisions. I've found, however, that more often \n     they have become the holy trinity of the status quo or \n     business as usual.\n       In truth, preparing for conflict in the 21st century means \n     investing in truly new concepts and new technologies. It \n     means taking into account all the assets and capabilities we \n     can bring to the fight. It means measuring those capabilities \n     against the real threats posed by real world adversaries with \n     real limitations, not threats conjured up from enemies with \n     unlimited time, unlimited resources, and unlimited \n     technological acumen.\n       Air superiority and missile defense--two areas where the \n     budget has attracted the most criticism--provide case \n     studies. Let me start with the controversy over the F-22 \n     fighter jet. We had to consider, when preparing for a future \n     potential conventional state-on-state conflict, what is the \n     right mix of the most advanced fighter aircraft and other \n     weapons to deal with the known and projected threats to U.S. \n     air supremacy? For example, we now have unmanned aerial \n     vehicles that can simultaneously perform intelligence, \n     reconnaissance, and surveillance missions as well as deliver \n     precision-guided bombs and missiles. The president's budget \n     request would buy 48 of the most advanced UAVs--aircraft that \n     have a greater range than some of our manned fighters, in \n     addition to the ability to loiter for hours over a target. \n     And we will buy many more in the future.\n       We also took into consideration the capabilities of the \n     newest manned combat aircraft program, the stealth F-35 Joint \n     Strike Fighter. The F-35 is 10 to 15 years newer than the F-\n     22, carries a much larger suite of weapons, and is superior \n     in a number of areas--most importantly, air-to-ground \n     missions such as destroying sophisticated enemy air defenses. \n     It is a versatile aircraft, less than half the total cost of \n     the F-22, and can be produced in quantity with all the \n     advantages produced by economies of scale--some 500 will be \n     bought over the next five years, more than 2,400 over the \n     life of the program. And we already have eight foreign \n     development partners. It has had development problems to be \n     sure, as has every advanced military aircraft ever fielded. \n     But if properly\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\n     supported, the F-35 will be the backbone of America's \n     tactical aviation fleet for decades to come if--and it is a \n     big if--money is not drained away to spend on other aircraft \n     that our military leadership considers of lower priority or \n     excess to our needs.\n       Having said that, the F-22 is clearly a capability we do \n     need--a niche, silver-bullet solution for one or two \n     potential scenarios--specifically the defeat of a highly \n     advanced enemy fighter fleet. The F-22, to be blunt, does not \n     make much sense anyplace else in the spectrum of conflict. \n     Nonetheless, supporters of the F-22 lately have promoted its \n     use for an ever expanding list of potential missions. These \n     range from protecting the homeland from seaborne cruise \n     missiles to, as one retired general recommended on TV, using \n     F-22s to go after Somali pirates who in many cases are \n     teenagers with AK-47s--a job we already know is better done \n     at much less cost by three Navy SEALs. These are examples of \n     how far-fetched some of the arguments have become for a \n     program that has cost $65 billion--and counting--to produce \n     187 aircraft, not to mention the thousands of uniformed Air \n     Force positions that were sacrificed to help pay for it.\n       In light of all these factors, and with the support of the \n     Air Force leadership, I concluded that 183--the program of \n     record since 2005, plus four more added in the FY 09 \n     supplemental--was a sufficient number of F-22s and \n     recommended as such to the president.\n       The reaction from parts of Washington has been predictable \n     for many of the reasons I described before. The most \n     substantive criticism is that completing the F-22 program \n     means we are risking the future of U.S. air supremacy. To \n     assess this risk, it is worth looking at real-world potential \n     threat and assessing the capabilities that other countries \n     have now or in the pipeline.\n       Consider that by 2020, the United States is projected to \n     have nearly 2,500 manned combat aircraft of all kinds. Of \n     those, nearly 1,100 will be the most advanced fifth \n     generation F-35s and F-22s. China, by contrast, is projected \n     to have no fifth generation aircraft by 2020. And by 2025, \n     the gap only widens. The U.S. will have approximately 1,700 \n     of the most advanced fifth generation fighters versus a \n     handful of comparable aircraft for the Chinese. Nonetheless, \n     some portray this scenario as a dire threat to America's \n     national security.\n       Correspondingly, the recent tests of a possible nuclear \n     device and ballistic missiles by North Korea brought scrutiny \n     to the changes in this budget that relate to missile defense. \n     The risk to national security has again been invoked, mainly \n     because the total missile defense budget was reduced from \n     last year.\n       In fact, where the threat is real or growing--from rogue \n     states or from short-to-medium range missiles that can hit \n     our deployed troops or our allies and friends--this budget \n     sustains or increases funding. Most of the cuts in this area \n     come from two programs that are designed to shoot down enemy \n     missiles immediately after launch. This was a great idea, but \n     the aspiration was overwhelmed by the escalating costs, \n     operational problems, and technological challenges.\n       Consider the example of one of those programs--the Airborne \n     Laser. This was supposed to put high-powered lasers on a \n     fleet of 747s. After more than a decade of research and \n     development, we have yet to achieve a laser with enough power \n     to knock down a missile in boost phase more than 50 miles \n     from the launch pad--thus requiring these huge planes to \n     loiter deep in enemy air space to have a feasible chance at a \n     direct hit. Moreover, the 10 to 20 aircraft needed would cost \n     about $1.5 billion each plus tens of millions of dollars each \n     year for maintenance and operating costs. The program and \n     operating concept were fatally flawed and it was time to face \n     reality. So we curtailed the existing program while keeping \n     the prototype aircraft for research and development.\n       Many of these decisions--like the one I just described--\n     were more clear-cut than others. But all of them, insofar as \n     they involved hundreds of billions of dollars and the \n     security of the American people, were treated with the utmost \n     seriousness by the senior civilian and military leadership of \n     the Pentagon. An enormous amount of thought, study, \n     assessment, and analysis underpins these budget \n     recommendations including the National Defense Strategy I \n     issued last summer.\n       Some have called for yet more analysis before making any of \n     the decisions in this budget. But when dealing with programs \n     that were clearly out of control, performing poorly, and \n     excess to the military's real requirements, we did not need \n     more study, more debate, or more delay--in effect, paralysis \n     through analysis. What was needed were three things--common \n     sense, political will, and tough decisions. Qualities too \n     often in short supply in Washington, D.C.\n       All of these decisions involved considering trade-offs, \n     balancing risks, and setting priorities--separating nice-to-\n     haves from have-to-haves, requirements from appetites. We \n     cannot expect to eliminate risk and danger by simply spending \n     more--especially if we're spending on the wrong things. But \n     more to the point, we all--the military, the Congress, and \n     industry--have to face some iron fiscal realities.\n       The last defense budget submitted by President George W. \n     Bush for Fiscal Year 2009 was $515 billion. In that budget \n     the Bush administration proposed--at my recommendation--a \n     Fiscal Year 2010 defense budget of $524 billion. The budget \n     just submitted by President Obama for FY 2010 was $534 \n     billion. Even after factoring inflation, and some of the war \n     costs that were moved from supplemental appropriations, \n     President Obama's defense request represents a modest but \n     real increase over the last Bush budget. I know. I submitted \n     them both. In total, by one estimate, our budget adds up to \n     about what the entire rest of the world combined spends on \n     defense. Only in the parallel universe that is Washington, \n     D.C., would that be considered ``gutting'' defense.\n       The fact is that if the defense budget had been even \n     higher, my recommendations to the president with respect to \n     troubled programs would have been the same--for all the \n     reasons I described earlier. There is a more fundamental \n     point: If the Department of Defense can't figure out a way to \n     defend the United States on a budget of more than half a \n     trillion dollars a year, then our problems are much bigger \n     than anything that can be cured by buying a few more ships \n     and planes.\n       What is important is to have a budget baseline with a \n     steady, sustainable, and predictable rate of growth that \n     avoids extreme peaks and valleys that are enormously harmful \n     to sound budgeting. From the very first defense budget I \n     submitted for President Bush in January 2007, I have warned \n     against doing what America has done multiple times over the \n     last 90 years by slashing defense spending after a major \n     conflict. The war in Iraq is winding down, and one day so too \n     will the conflict in Afghanistan. When that day comes, the \n     nation will again face pressure to cut back on defense \n     spending, as we always have. It is simply the nature of the \n     beast. And the higher our base budget is now, the harder it \n     will be to sustain these necessary programs, and the more \n     drastic and dangerous the drop-off will be later.\n       So where do we go from here? Authorization for more F-22s \n     is in both versions of the defense bill working its way \n     through the Congress. The president has indicated that he has \n     real red lines in this budget, including the F-22. Some might \n     ask: Why threaten a veto and risk a confrontation over a \n     couple billion dollars for a dozen or so planes?\n       The grim reality is that with regard to the budget we have \n     entered a zero-sum game. Every defense dollar diverted to \n     fund excess or unneeded capacity--whether for more F-22s or \n     anything else--is a dollar that will be unavailable to take \n     care of our people, to win the wars we are in, to deter \n     potential adversaries, and to improve capabilities in areas \n     where America is underinvested and potentially vulnerable. \n     That is a risk I cannot accept and I will not take.\n       And, with regard to something like the F-22, irrespective \n     of whether the number of aircraft at issue is 12 planes or \n     200, if we can't bring ourselves to make this tough but \n     straightforward decision--reflecting the judgment of two very \n     different presidents, two different secretaries of defense, \n     two chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff, and the current \n     Air Force Secretary and Chief of Staff, where do we draw the \n     line? And if not now, when? If we can't get this right--what \n     on earth can we get right? It is time to draw the line on \n     doing Defense business as usual. The President has drawn that \n     line. And that red line is a veto. And it is real.\n       On a personal note, I joined CIA more than 40 years ago to \n     help protect my country. For just about my entire \n     professional career in government I have generally been known \n     as a hawk on national security. One criticism of me when I \n     was at CIA was that I overestimated threats to the security \n     of our country.\n       Well, I haven't changed. I did not molt from a hawk into a \n     dove on January 20, 2009. I continue to believe, as I always \n     have, that the world is, and always will be, a dangerous and \n     hostile place for my country with many who would do America \n     harm and who hate everything we are and stand for. But, the \n     nature of the threats to us has changed. And so too should \n     the way our military is organized and equipped to meet them.\n       I believe--along with the senior military leadership of \n     this nation--that the defense budget we proposed to President \n     Obama and that he sent to Congress is the best we could \n     design to protect the United States now and in the future. \n     The best we could do to protect our men and women in uniform, \n     to give them the tools they need to deter our enemies, and to \n     win our wars today and tomorrow. We stand by this reform \n     budget, and we are prepared to fight for it.\n       A final thought. I arrived in Washington 43 years ago this \n     summer. Of all people, I am well aware of the realities of \n     Washington and know that things do not change overnight. \n     After all, the influence of politics and parochial interests \n     in defense matters is as old as the Republic itself. Henry \n     Knox, the first secretary of war, was charged with building \n     the first American fleet. To get the support of Congress, \n     Knox eventually ended up with six frigates being built in six \n     different shipyards in six different states.\n       But the stakes today are very high--with the nation at war, \n     and a security landscape steadily growing more dangerous and \n     unpredictable. I am deeply concerned about the long-term \n     challenges facing our defense establishment--and just as \n     concerned that the political state of play does not reflect \n     the reality that major reforms are needed, or that tough \n     choices and real discipline are necessary.\n       We stand at a crossroads. We simply cannot risk continuing \n     down the same path--where our spending and program priorities \n     are increasingly divorced from the very real threats of today \n     and the growing ones of tomorrow. These threats demand that \n     all of\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\n     our nation's leaders rise above the politics and parochialism \n     that have too often plagued considerations of our nation's \n     defense--from industry to interest groups, from the Pentagon \n     to Foggy Bottom, from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the \n     other. The time has come to draw a line and take a stand \n     against the business-as-usual approach to national defense. \n     We must all fulfill our obligation to the American people to \n     ensure that our country remains safe and strong. Just as our \n     men and worn in uniform are doing their duty to this end, we \n     in Washington must now do ours.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am a student of history, and there is \none particular President whom I have grown, along with historians, to \nappreciate more and more for his two terms as President of the United \nStates; that is, Dwight David Eisenhower. We were at peace during \nPresident Eisenhower's term, and many believe that perhaps the war in \nVietnam might have been avoided if we had heeded his wise counsel. \nThere are many things President Eisenhower did to contribute to this \nNation both in war and in peace.\n  On several occasions, I have reread his farewell speech of January \n17, 1961. In his speech, President Eisenhower said:\n\n       In the councils of government, we must guard against the \n     acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or \n     unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential \n     for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will \n     persist. We must never let the weight of this combination \n     endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should \n     take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable \n     citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge \n     industrial and military machinery of defense with our \n     peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may \n     prosper together.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much \n     the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather \n     those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and \n     without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex \n     struggle with liberty at stake.\n\n  I would only add to President Eisenhower's farewell address to the \nNation--which is compelling in many ways--that the words should be \nchanged from ``military-industrial complex'' to ``military-industrial-\ncongressional complex.''\n  What we are seeing here, with the advice and counsel of our \nPresident, of our Secretary of Defense, of our uniformed military, with \nrare exception, is a recommendation that we stop with this aircraft and \nbuild another--not that we stop building fighter aircraft for our \ninventory, not that we stop defending this Nation with weapons systems \nwe need. We are even defending a weapons system's continued production \nthat has never flown in the two wars in which we are engaged.\n  So I urge my colleagues to understand the impact of this amendment. \nIf we are able to succeed, it is going to send a signal that we are \nstopping business as usual, and we must move forward providing the men \nand women with the necessary means to win the struggles we are in \nthroughout the world, especially two wars. So I urge my colleagues to \nunderstand that sacrifices will be made. Jobs will be lost. It will \ncause disruption in some communities. But our first obligation is the \ndefense of this Nation and the use of scarce defense dollars in the \nmost effective fashion.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I have 2 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, first of all, let me begin where I did a \nfew moments ago; that is, with my great respect for Carl Levin and John \nMcCain and for their work in this area.\n  Let me begin with a point my friend from Arizona has made. There is \nnothing more important than the national security of our Nation. It is \nthat very argument which brings those of us on this side of the table \nin support of this program and in opposition to this amendment.\n  This program is a critically important program to maintain \nsuperiority--not parity but superiority--which has always been our goal \nin protecting our national security interests. It was the very Pentagon \nitself which advocated we move forward with this program only 36 months \nago. Obviously, people can change their minds. But over the months, \nwhen they were preparing for the needs of our Nation, it was the \nCommission on the Future of Aerospace, authorized by this Congress, \nwhich concluded the following. They said that ``the Nation immediately \nreverse the decline in and promote the growth of a scientifically and \ntechnologically trained U.S. aerospace workforce,'' adding that ``the \nbreakdown of America's intellectual and industrial capacity is a threat \nto national security and our capability to continue as a world \nleader.''\n  It was the Pentagon, only 36 months ago in their Quadrennial Review, \nthat said the following--and they said in this report--that: The F-22 \nproduction should be extended through fiscal year 2010 with a multiyear \nacquisition contract to ensure the Department does not have a gap in \nfifth-generation stealth capabilities.\n  There are reports that the F-35 could be delayed an additional 11 \nmonths--what we have already heard about. That creates a gap of 5 years \nthat we are talking about. The danger of losing not just any jobs, \nanywhere from 25,000 to 90,000 aerospace workers is not insignificant.\n  Four days ago, we were warned there has been in excess of a 15-\npercent decline in our industrial capacity in the aerospace industry. \nThis will hit us even further. The ability to have a workforce capable \nof building these aircraft we need in the 21st century is at risk. That \nis why the issue not only of the technical capability of the aircraft \nbut the workforce to produce it is at stake with this amendment. And I \nsay that respectfully. But we have this gap in production, which we \nhave been warned about now by the Pentagon--not by the industry itself, \nby the Pentagon, by the very Commission this Congress authorized to \ndetermine what our capacities were and the industrial capacity in \naerospace. We are defying both reports and both recommendations by \ncanceling this program at this number and placing at risk the future \ngeneration of superior aircraft that we need in the 21st century.\n  So again, Madam President, I urge my colleagues, respectfully, to \nreject this amendment. There is a compromise, in my view, available to \nend up with a number far less than the originally projected numbers. \nBut to cancel the program prematurely and create the gap in our \nproduction capabilities is a great danger for our Nation, not to \nmention these jobs which are critically important to our Nation and its \nfuture.\n  For those reasons, I urge the rejection of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I commend the leaders of the committee. \nI also commend Senator Chambliss and Senator Dodd for their Herculean \nefforts here to try to stave off the closure of the line. I try to put \nmyself in the shoes of others when I take a position on an issue. What \nI say comes from the heart and not because of a lack of respect for the \nefforts they have shown in support of their constituents.\n  We have just come out of 8 years where we have seen our national debt \ndouble. We have incurred as much new debt for our country over the last \n8 years as we did in the previous 208 years. We are looking, this year, \nat a 1-year deficit higher than any in the history of our country. It \nis believed to be well over $1 trillion.\n  If you go back to 2001 and look at the cost overruns for major \nweapons systems, in 2001 it was about $45 billion. Last year, that \nnumber had grown to almost $300 billion. We say to our folks who are \nrunning the Pentagon, the Department of Defense: Tell us which weapons \nsystems you need and those you do not. And Secretary Gates has said \nvery clearly, as Gordon England did as well, his deputy, and the last \nPresident and this President: We do not need more F-22s. We have F-15s. \nWe have F-16s. We have F-18s. Before too many more years, we will have \nabout 2,500 F-35s.\n  My hope is we will be smart enough--if people are displaced, if the \nF-22 is\n\n[[Page S7741]]\n\nnot continued in production--my hope is we will be smart enough, since \nLockheed has a role in building the F-35, some of the folks--hands that \ncan build an F-22 can certainly help build F-35s. I would hope that \nwould be the case.\n  The last thing I would ask everyone to keep in mind--as an old naval \nflight officer, I used to think about and I still think about how much \nit costs to fly an aircraft for an hour. It is anywhere from $20,000 to \n$40,000 for the F-22. It is just too much money.\n  Thanks very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in terms of the alleged gap, there is no \ngap. The QDR said we should be building fighters, F-22 production, into \nfiscal year 2010. As a matter of fact, what we are now doing is \nexceeding that production with F-35s. We have 30 F-35s in this fiscal \nyear 2010 budget. There is no gap in fighter production.\n  As to whether the F-35 is a capable fighter, let me just read from \nwhat Secretary Gates says:\n\n       The F-35 is 10 to 15 years newer than the F-22, carries a \n     much larger suite of weapons, and is superior in a number of \n     areas--most importantly, air-to-ground missions such as \n     destroying sophisticated enemy air defenses. It is a \n     versatile aircraft, less than half the total cost of the F-\n     22. . . .\n\n  The F-22 is costing an awful lot more than has been represented here \nbecause they are asking now, if this amendment is defeated, that we \nwould be spending $1.75 billion for seven F-22s, which is approximately \n$250 million a copy for the ones the opponents of this amendment want \nto build this year.\n  The President of the United States, the last President of the United \nStates, the previous one; two Secretaries of Defense, this one and the \nprevious one; two Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the \nSecretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force say \nit is time to end production of the F-22 to move into greater \nproduction of the F-35 which will serve three services, not just one. \nIf not now, when? If not now, when? When will we end production of a \nweapons system, if not now, when we have both President Obama and \nPresident Bush trying to end it, Secretaries of Defense trying to end \nit, Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs trying to end the production of the F-\n22? We must now do what is sensible, that which is requested by \nSecretary Gates, not because he is saluting the Commander in Chief, as \nhas been suggested. He is not just saluting the Commander in Chief; he \nfeels deep in his gut that we must change the way we do business. We \nmust finally bring some of these systems to an end. That is why \nSecretary Gates so passionately believes we must bring production of \nthe F-22 to an end and move into greater production of the F-35--more \nF-35s produced in this budget than would be produced of the F-22 if \nthis amendment is defeated.\n  Madam President, I don't know if there is any more time. If there is, \nI yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will make some brief remarks here, and at \nthe conclusion we will determine whether there is an agreement on the \nother side so I can go ahead and lay down an amendment. But first I \nwant to discuss what that amendment will be. It is amendment No. 1628, \nand in a moment I will seek to offer it and get it pending. It is an \namendment I introduced with Senator Lieberman, Senator Bayh, and \nSenator McCain.\n  Like other Members of this body, we have watched recent events unfold \nin Iran with great concern. This year began with talk of warming ties \nand potentially reestablishing contact with Iran; that we would no \nlonger be afraid to talk to Iran and perhaps to even reach some kinds \nof agreements. In recent months, however, the Iranian regime has \ncontinued its support of terrorism, its illegal nuclear weapons program \nin defiance of its NPT obligations, and its engagement in violent and \ndeadly repression of its own citizens.\n  While the administration has made clear its intention to continue to \npursue high-level talks with Iran, an overture which the regime has not \nseen fit to even respond, the President has indicated that the window \nfor Iran to negotiate and demonstrate progress toward complying with \nits international obligations is not open indefinitely.\n  I think President Obama was correct when he said:\n\n       Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon would not only be a threat \n     to Israel and a threat to the United States, but would be \n     profoundly destabilizing in the international community as a \n     whole and could set off a nuclear arms race in the Middle \n     East that would be extraordinarily dangerous for all \n     concerned, including for Iran.\n\n  In May, the President indicated that Iran would have until December \nto show meaningful improvement. More recently, French President Nicolas \nSarkozy said on behalf of the G8 nations that they will give Iran until \nSeptember 2009 to agree to negotiations with respect to its nuclear \nactivities or face tougher sanctions.\n  If negotiations do not prove fruitful, the United States must be \nready to act quickly to increase pressure on Iran to end its support \nfor terrorist groups and its illegal nuclear program.\n  The Kyl-Lieberman amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that \nthe President should sanction the Iranian Central Bank if, by December, \nIran has not verifiably halted its uranium enrichment activities, as \nwell as come into full compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty and the Additional Protocol.\n\n       By sanctioning the Central Bank of Iran--Bank Markazi--our \n     Nation would send the message that we will use all methods at \n     our disposal to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and oppose \n     sponsors of terror.\n\n  The case against the Iranian Central Bank is strong. It is knee-deep \nin the regime's illicit activities. Last year, Deputy Secretary of the \nTreasury Robert Kimmit revealed that between 2001\n\n[[Page S7742]]\n\nand 2006 the bank had moved $50 million from banks in London to \nHezbollah front organizations in Beirut. Hezbollah, of course, is a \nterrorist organization.\n  It also processes transactions for Iranian banks that already face \nU.S. sanctions. The Central Bank of Iran is instrumental in helping \nIranian banks--the very ones this body voted overwhelmingly to sanction \nin 2007--to avoid sanctions. In March 2008, the Financial Crimes \nEnforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury warned financial \ninstitutions about the illicit behavior of the Central Bank of Iran. \nHere is what the advisory said:\n\n       The Central Bank of Iran and Iranian commercial banks have \n     requested that their names be removed from global \n     transactions in order to make it more difficult for \n     intermediary financial institutions to determine the true \n     parties in the transaction. They have also continued to \n     provide financial services to Iranian entities designated by \n     the U.N. Security Council in its Resolutions 1737 and 1747. \n     The U.S. Department of Treasury is particularly concerned \n     that the Central Bank of Iran may be facilitating \n     transactions for sanctioned Iranian banks.\n\n  Under U.S. law, institutions that aid entities covered by financial \nsanctions are liable to penalties. The Central Bank's activities \nclearly warrant such action, and sanctioning the bank would increase \nthe effectiveness of existing measures. I urge my colleagues to support \nour amendment at such time as we are able to get a vote on it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my friend \nfrom Arizona, Senator Kyl, for his very strong statement. I rise to \nspeak in support of this bipartisan amendment which I have cosponsored \nalong with Senator Kyl, Senator Bayh, and Senator McCain.\n  As you know, President Obama has made a historic offer to Iran's \nleaders, inviting them to engage in direct diplomacy to resolve the \noutstanding differences between our two countries. As the President has \nrepeatedly said, the door is open for the Iranians to come in out of \nthe cold, if they choose to do so. It is by suspending their illicit \nnuclear activities and ending their support for terrorism that the \nIranians have a clear path to ending their international isolation and \ntaking their rightful place in the community of nations.\n  Unfortunately, as Senator Kyl said, it has now been more than 3\\1/2\\ \nmonths since the formal offer of engagement was made by President \nObama, and there has been no reply from the Iranians. Meanwhile, Iran's \nillicit nuclear activities have continued to speed forward, in \nviolation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. Thousands of \nadditional centrifuges are being installed, and more and more fissile \nmaterial is being stockpiled.\n  At the same time, Iran's support for terrorist proxies in Iraq, in \nLebanon, and in the Palestinian Authority areas has continued. And, of \ncourse, over the past month we and the rest of the world have watched \nwith horror as the Iranian regime has engaged in a brutal crackdown \nagainst its own people, who have sought no more than basic human \nrights.\n  President Obama, together with our international allies, has been \nvery clear that we will not wait indefinitely for the Iranians to \nrespond to our offer of talks, nor will we enter into negotiations--if \nthat is the willingness of the Iranians--that go on without end. Two \nweeks ago, at the annual G8 summit in Italy, the President joined with \nother world leaders to make clear to the Iranians that they have until \nthe G20 summit in Pittsburgh, at the end of September, to return to the \nnegotiating table or face the consequences.\n  The amendment Senators Kyl, Bayh, McCain, and I have put forward \nwould place the full weight of the U.S. Senate behind the time frame \nthat the President and the G8 have articulated. Our amendment expresses \nour strong hope that Iran seizes this historic opportunity for direct \ndialogue.\n  We also make clear that if the Iranians have failed to engage with us \ndiplomatically by the time of that G20 summit 2 months from now, it is \nour preference that multilateral sanctions be imposed through the \nUnited Nations Security Council. However, the Iranian Government--the \nregime that controls the people of Iran--must also understand that the \nUnited States is itself prepared to put in place what Secretary of \nState Clinton a while ago referred to as crippling sanctions in the \nevent that they in Tehran continue to flaunt the will of the \ninternational community.\n  Specifically, our amendment asks the President to impose sanctions on \nthe Central Bank of Iran and other banks involved in proliferation and \nterrorist activities, in the event that the Iranians haven't entered \ninto negotiations that are serious by the time of the Pittsburgh summit \nor if they haven't suspended enrichment and reprocessing activities \nwithin 60 days of that summit.\n\n  The Central Bank of Iran is the financial lifeline of that regime. It \nis an entity that our own Treasury Department says has engaged in \ndeceptive financial practices and facilitated the efforts of other \nIranian banks that are involved in bankrolling proliferation and \nterrorist activities to avoid international sanctions, and that have \nthemselves been sanctioned by the U.N. and our Treasury Department as a \nresult.\n  I will say this. The idea of imposing sanctions on the Iranian \nCentral Bank is not new. It has already been endorsed by a bipartisan \nmajority in this Chamber. Last year, the Senate Banking Committee, \nunder Chairman Dodd, adopted bipartisan legislation by a vote of 19 to \n2 to urge the President to immediately impose sanctions against the \nCentral Bank. Also last year, the House of Representatives passed such \nlegislation that urged immediate sanctions.\n  More recently, the legislation that Senators Bayh, Kyl, and I \nintroduced this spring--the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act, S. \n908--in addition to the other steps it takes--also expresses the sense \nof the Senate that the President should impose sanctions against the \nCentral Bank of Iran.\n  I am very grateful to report that S. 908, the Iran Refined Petroleum \nSanctions Act, now has 67 Members of the Senate, a strong bipartisan \ngroup of 67, or two-thirds, as cosponsors of that legislation. These \ncosponsors range all across the ideological spectrum of Members of the \nSenate, and clearly make the point to Iran and to the rest of the world \nthat whatever other differences we have, we stand together here as a \nstrong majority and beyond the Senate in our concern about the nuclear \nproliferation and terror-sponsoring activities of the Iranian \nGovernment.\n  You might say, if you are one of the 67 cosponsors of S. 908--which \ndoes more than this amendment does but includes it--you have already \nspoken in favor of this amendment.\n  This amendment, I want to point out and make clear, in no way ties \nthe President's hand in his diplomacy with Iran. That is not our \nintent. The amendment is about empowering the President, giving him \nadditional leverage in his diplomacy, by endorsing the same timetable \nthat came out of the G8 summit a short while ago. The effect is this, \nand I will repeat: The Iranians must appreciate that there will be \nconsequences if they fail to respond to the international community's \ndiplomatic initiatives; in other words, if they continue to speed their \nnuclear program forward.\n  I think this amendment will send an unmistakable message to the \nfanatical regime in Tehran, in support of the G8, in support of \nPresident Obama: Either you can engage with the United States and the \nworld community and take steps to suspend your nuclear activities or \nyou can continue on your current course, in which case you will face \nthe crippling sanctions this sense-of-the-Senate resolution calls for.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before my colleague Senator Lieberman \nleaves the floor, I wish to thank him for this amendment. We are \nworking right now to see if we can get the amendment pending and \npossibly a voice vote, because it is clear it is a very important \namendment and one where I think we need to express very strongly the \nsense of the Senate, given the situation as it exists in Iran.\n  I wish to thank Senator Lieberman, and right now it is my \nunderstanding that your side is checking to see if it is an agreeable \namendment. Hopefully,\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\nwe will get that decision and move forward with it right away on a \nvoice vote, if that is agreeable to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Arizona. I am encouraged by \nthat. And in talking to the other cosponsors, we would be happy to have \na voice vote. It would send a message.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment is straightforward and \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that there should be a date certain--\nand soon--by which Iran is required to end its nuclear program or face \nsevere sanctions. The amendment expresses that if the Iranian regime \nhas not accepted the offer of the United States of direct diplomatic \ntalks by the time of the G20 summit in late September or if it has not \nsuspended all of its nuclear enrichment and reprocessing activities \nwithin 60 days after the summit, and if the U.N. Security Council does \nnot adopt new and significant and meaningful sanctions on the regime, \nthe President should sanction the Central Bank of Iran.\n  The situation with respect to Iran is nearing the crisis point, if it \nis not there already. We have all watched the brutal crackdown in the \nstreets of Tehran and elsewhere as the Iranian regime imposed the \nresults of a fraudulent election. We have been astonished by the \ncourage and resolve of those Iranian citizens who have protested for \ntheir own inalienable rights in the face of repression. And we have \nknown that, while these dramatic events have played themselves out, the \nIranian regime has continued its enrichment of uranium, growing ever \ncloser to the day on which it has a nuclear weapons capability.\n  The Iranian regime has gotten away with too much for too long. Its \nillicit nuclear activities, combined with its development of \nunconventional weapons and ballistic missiles, support for Hezbollah \nand other terrorist groups, and its repeated threats against Israel and \nthe United States, represent a real and growing threat to the security \nof the United States and the Middle East. It is in the interest of the \nUnited States, and the world's other great powers, to achieve an end to \nthe Iranian nuclear program.\n  The administration has held out an ``open hand,'' making clear that \nit intends to open direct talks with Iran. Yet 3\\1/2\\ months since the \nPresident's formal offer, the Iranian government has made no response, \nnor has it suspended its enrichment activities, as required by U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions. Time is not on the side of those pushing \nthe Iranians to cease these dangerous actions. Administration officials \nand others, including the French President, have stated that they will \nnot wait interminably while the Iranian nuclear program proceeds.\n  At the G-8 summit 2 weeks ago, the assembled leaders agreed that the \nIranians do not have forever, and that they should return to the \nnegotiating table by the time of the G-20 summit in September. This \namendment puts the Senate on record behind that timeframe, irrespective \nof any Senator's individual view about the likelihood of agreement \nsoon.\n  Make no mistake: we must not wait interminably. According to the \nIAEA's latest report, Iran has increased its stockpile of low enriched \nuranium by some 60 percent in the previous 6 months, and has brought \nthe number of active centrifuges above 7,000. The IAEA also reported \nthat Iran denied inspectors access to the Arak heavy water reactor. As \nthe threats--including to the State of Israel--continue.\n  As the Secretary of State has recently articulated, should Iran \ncontinue to defy the international community, it must face severe \nsanctions. Should the regime not take up the historic offer extended to \nit, this resolution advocates sanctions on the Iranian Central Bank, \nthe country's major connection to the international financial system. \nThe U.S. Treasury Department has stated that the central bank has \nengaged in deceptive financial practices and facilitated the movement \nof funds to those involved in proliferation and terrorist activities. \nThis must end, and in fact 67 Senators have cosponsored legislation--\nthe Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act--that urges the President to \nsanction the central bank.\n  By adopting this resolution, we will send an unmistakable message to \nthe government of Iran that its actions are unacceptable and will \nresult in real and severe consequences if continued. The administration \nhas offered to talk; the ball is in the Iranian court, and if that \nregime continues down its destructive path, we have no choice but to \nimpose crippling sanctions for its continued defiance.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Let me point out again, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment, an important sense of the Senate but certainly one that \nallows the administration the latitude it needs in its handling of its \nrelations with Iran.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would first ask to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to recognize that tremendously \nhard work both the chair of the Armed Services Committee and ranking \nmember are doing. We are very proud of the chairman, coming from \nMichigan, and of all of his excellent work in standing up for the \ntroops. This bill is another example of that.\n  I would like to congratulate him and the Senator from Arizona for \nworking together on this very important bill.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment on health \ncare. We are hearing a lot, as we hear from colleagues, many \ncolleagues--not every one but many colleagues on the other side of the \naisle--about the need to be against health care reform, to be a ``no.''\n  We all know that saying no to health care reform means we are going \nto have the status quo. ``No'' equals the status quo. For too many \nfamilies, too many businesses all across this country, that is \nabsolutely not acceptable.\n  The status quo works, it is good--for special interests making \nprofits off the current system. But it is bad for American families, \nAmerican small businesses, American manufacturers that are trying to \npay the bills and trying to make sure health care is available for the \nemployees.\n  We need change. We are here because the system, with all of its good \nparts--and there are many strengths in the American system--is also \nbroken in too many cases for people. We want to build on what works and \nwhat is great and we want to fix what is broken.\n  Right now our current health care system is bankrupting too many \nfamilies. We know over 60 percent of bankruptcies are linked to medical \nexpenses, and 75 percent of families who file bankruptcy actually have \nhealth insurance. Those with insurance, on average, are putting out \nmedical expenses of over $18,000 when they file--even though they have \nan insurance policy.\n  There are many families--we are not only talking about those who do \nnot have health insurance, but those who do who find themselves in very \ndifficult situations.\n  I am constantly amazed when I hear the argument about: We can't do \nany kind of reform because reform means putting a bureaucrat between \nyour doctor and yourself. You and your doctor can't make decisions \nabout what you need for your health care.\n  Do you know who stands between you and your doctor right now? An \ninsurance company, an insurance company bureaucrat. Your doctors can't \njust give you whatever tests they wish. You are not able to get \nwhatever care you need for your family. The first call they make is to \nthe insurance company, and it decides.\n  Reform is about putting health care decisions back in the hands of \ndoctors and patients and being able to create a system that actually \nworks for people. That is what it is all about.\n  I set up online the Health Care People's Lobby for those I represent \nin the State of Michigan so they could share their stories. We have a \nlot of folks lining the halls who represent all kinds of interests, all \nkinds of special interests, and they tell us what they think should be \nhappening or not happening. But in Michigan we have set up the Health \nCare People's Lobby so people can share their stories about the real\n\n[[Page S7744]]\n\nworld operating under the current system.\n  If the system worked today, there would be no reason for us to be \nhere. We would be working on something else. But the fact is, we are \nspending twice as much on health care as any other country and have 47 \nmillion people at any one time who do not have health insurance. Those \ntwo numbers don't add up.\n  On top of that, people who are currently covered are battling every \nday to try to get what they thought they were paying for or to make \nsure their family is covered or that test or procedure or medicine can \nbe covered.\n  One constituent of mine in Michigan, Sandra Marczewski from \nWaterford, MI, wrote to me that she and her husband have been without \ninsurance for 7 months now. She writes:\n\n       You have no idea the fear I walk around with every day.\n\n  That is too many people in Michigan, over a million people in \nMichigan, without insurance altogether, and millions more who are \nfearful every day if they lose their job, their health care goes with \nit, for themselves and their families. People every night are putting \nthe kids to bed and worrying about whether someone is going to get \nsick, saying a prayer: Please, God, don't let the kids get sick. Don't \nlet me get sick. I have to be able to go to work so I can make sure we \nstill have our health care.\n  There are a lot of people, as I mentioned before, who make a lot of \nmoney off of the status quo, off of the current system. It is no \nsurprise they don't want to change it. All the ads we see, all the \nthings going on, all the scare tactics that are going on--and there are \nplenty of scare tactics going on right now--all of that is about trying \nto scare people and raise red flags. It is easy just to be no, no, no. \nWe certainly hear that around here all the time, people who are just \nsaying no to any kind of progress or change or making things better for \npeople.\n  The reality is, the status quo for a lot of folks means more profit, \nand that is underlying a lot of the motivation of what is going on \nright now. Our job is to make sure the American people can afford \nhealth care and have the care they need for their families. For too \nmany families, the status quo means insecurity, expenses, and fear that \ncome along with not knowing whether they are going to be able to afford \nthe health care they have from month to month and whether they will, in \nfact, even have health care.\n  We are here because when it comes to health care, American families \nand businesses are in a serious crisis, and they are asking us for \naction. The status quo is not good enough anymore. It is not working. \nIt is going to bankrupt families, businesses, and the country. High \nhealth care costs are causing cuts in benefits, increases in premiums, \nadding to the ranks of the uninsured at alarming rates. Even those who \nhave insurance, as I indicated before, are feeling the pain of the \ncurrent system. Every day in America families are forced to choose a \ndifferent doctor because their health care plan was changed, because \ntheir employer can no longer afford the old plan they had.\n  Skyrocketing health care costs make American businesses less \ncompetitive in the global economy. It costs us jobs, and I can speak \ndirectly to that coming from the great State of Michigan.\n  Every day in America, families see their health care plan benefits \neroding because they cannot keep up with high premiums, copays, and \ndeductibles. Every day in America, people decide to skip a doctor visit \nand the medication and treatment they know they need because they \ncannot afford the payment--in the greatest country in the world--\nbecause the expense is too high. Year after year, as health care costs \nincrease, American families are losing the very parts of their health \ncare they value most: their choice of doctor, hospital, and insurance \nplans; their choice of treatments; the security and stability that \ncomes from knowing they are covered if anything goes wrong. That is \nwhat we are about fixing. That is what we will fix as we do health care \nreform.\n  Recently, Families USA found that the average costs of family \ncoverage in the workplace rose 78 percent in 7 years--78 percent. \nDuring those years, health insurance company profits ballooned 428 \npercent. At the same time, wages went up about 15 percent. So wages go \nup 15 percent, health insurance profits go up 428 percent, and premiums \njust keep rising for businesses and individuals.\n  The fact is, we cannot wait to get started on reform. The status quo \nis not acceptable and ``no'' equals the status quo. So we are here \nworking with colleagues to get it done. Doing nothing is not \nacceptable.\n  Recently, the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation released a \nreport that projects if Federal reform efforts are not enacted within \n10 years, the cost of health care for businesses could double and the \nnumber of uninsured could rise to over 65 million people with middle-\nclass families being hit the hardest. The report shows if health care \nreform is not enacted, individuals and families would see health care \ncosts dramatically increased.\n  Total individual and family spending on premiums and out-of-pocket \ncosts could increase 68 percent in the next 10 years. I cannot imagine \n68 percent out-of-pocket costs. That is if we do nothing, if we listen \nto those just saying no. Even under the best-case scenario, health care \ncosts would likely increase, according to this report, at least 46 \npercent. And I can tell you absolutely wages are not going to go up 46 \npercent. Businesses could see their health care costs doubled within 10 \nyears. The report found that employer spending on premiums would more \nthan double, and even in the best-case economic condition, employer \nspending on health care will rise 72 percent. The result would likely \nbe far fewer Americans being able to be offered insurance or accepting \nemployer-sponsored insurance. Estimates suggest a drop of 56 percent of \nAmericans who are now covered by their employers, dropping from 56 to \n49 percent in 10 years.\n  So there are many numbers. There are numbers that relate to the \npublic programs of Medicaid and children's health insurance and the \nincreased cost there as well and what will happen if we do nothing. The \namount of uncompensated care in the health care system will increase, \nand the worst-case scenario: the total of uncompensated care could \ndouble.\n  By the way, when we say ``uncompensated care,'' that does not mean \nsomebody is not paying for it. That is why our premiums, if you have \ninsurance, go up so much. It means someone can't afford to see a \ndoctor, can't take their children to the doctor, so they don't get the \ntests on the front end that they need or they don't see a doctor. They \nwait until they are really sick, and then they go to the emergency \nroom. They are served, as they should be, and it is the most expensive \nvenue in which to do ongoing care for people. But they are served, and \nthen guess what happens. Everyone who has insurance sees their rates go \nup to pay for it.\n  That is what it means when we say that covering the uninsured will \nlower costs as we go out. I mean it will take time to do this, but over \ntime what we are doing is working to change the way we pay for health \ncare now because we pay for it in the most expensive way, by ignoring \nthe problem, not focusing on health and wellness and primary care but \nwaiting until people are in the worst possible situation: they go to \nthe emergency room, they get care when they are sicker than they \notherwise would be if they could see a doctor. And then we pay for it. \nThat is what we want to change and will change under health care \nreform.\n  So this is about many facets. We know we have a system in America \nthat works for many; they are blessed. We are blessed to have health \ninsurance. For the many who have insurance, it allows them to cover \ntheir family needs. The system works well. But for many others it does \nnot. And the reality is, we all pay for a system that does not work \neffectively for everyone. We all end up paying because the reality is, \nyou can say: Well, I am not going to buy a car, I do not need car \ninsurance; I am not going to buy a house, I do not need house \ninsurance, but sooner or later, you are going to get sick, and just \nbecause you don't have health insurance does not mean there is not \ngoing to be a cost for yourself and your family.\n  We are a great country. We can do better than what we are doing \ntoday. We have to do better. We are working hard to have a bipartisan \neffort that will move reform forward in this country, to make a real \ndifference to\n\n[[Page S7745]]\n\nchange the system so it works for everyone and begins to lower the cost \nover time of what is happening, the explosion in health care costs in \nthis country.\n  The option of saying no is not good enough. ``No'' equals the status \nquo. We just cannot have that. The public gets it. It is time for us to \nget it as well and move forward. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1628\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up the Lieberman-Kyl amendment and \nask for its immediate consideration. It is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Kyl, for \n     himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. McCain, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1628.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on imposing sanctions with \n                respect to the Islamic Republic of Iran)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1232. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON IMPOSING SANCTIONS WITH \n                   RESPECT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran, combined with its development of \n     unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles and support for \n     international terrorism, represent a grave threat to the \n     security of the United States and United States allies in \n     Europe, the Middle East, and around the world.\n       (2) The United States and other responsible countries have \n     a vital interest in working together to prevent the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring a \n     nuclear weapons capability.\n       (3) As President Barack Obama said, ``Iran obtaining a \n     nuclear weapon would not only be a threat to Israel and a \n     threat to the United States, but would be profoundly \n     destabilizing in the international community as a whole and \n     could set off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that \n     would be extraordinarily dangerous for all concerned, \n     including for Iran.''.\n       (4) The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly \n     called attention to the illicit nuclear activities of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran, and, as a result, the United \n     Nations Security Council has adopted a range of sanctions \n     designed to encourage the Government of the Islamic Republic \n     of Iran to cease those activities and comply with its \n     obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \n     Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, \n     and entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the \n     ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'').\n       (5) The Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on \n     several Iranian banks, including Bank Melli, Bank Saderat, \n     Bank Sepah, and Bank Mellat, for their involvement in \n     proliferation activities or support for terrorist groups.\n       (6) The Central Bank of Iran, the keystone of Iran's \n     financial system and its principal remaining lifeline to the \n     international banking system, has engaged in deceptive \n     financial practices and facilitated such practices among \n     banks involved in proliferation activities or support for \n     terrorist groups, including Bank Sepah and Bank Melli, in \n     order to evade sanctions imposed by the United States and the \n     United Nations.\n       (7) On April 8, 2009, the United States formally extended \n     an offer to engage in direct diplomacy with the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran through negotiations with the \n     five permanent members of the United States Security Council \n     and Germany (commonly referred to as the ``P5-plus-1 \n     process''), in the hope of resolving all outstanding disputes \n     between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States.\n       (8) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has yet \n     to make a formal reply to the April 8, 2009, offer of direct \n     diplomacy by the United States or to engage in direct \n     diplomacy with the United States through the P5-plus-1 \n     process.\n       (9) On July 8, 2009, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France \n     warned that the Group of Eight major powers will give the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran until September 2009 to accept \n     negotiations with respect to its nuclear activities or face \n     tougher sanctions.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran should--\n       (A) seize the historic offer put forward by President \n     Barack Obama to engage in direct diplomacy with the United \n     States;\n       (B) suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing \n     activities, including research and development, and work on \n     all heavy-water related projects, including the construction \n     of a research reactor moderated by heavy water, as demanded \n     by multiple resolutions of the United Nations Security \n     Council; and\n       (C) come into full compliance with the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty, including the additional protocol to \n     the Treaty; and\n       (2) the President should impose sanctions on the Central \n     Bank of Iran and any other Iranian bank engaged in \n     proliferation activities or support for terrorist groups, as \n     well as any other sanctions the President determines \n     appropriate, if--\n       (A) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran--\n       (i) has not accepted the offer by the United States to \n     engage in direct diplomacy through the P5-plus-1 process \n     before the Summit of the Group of 20 (G-20) in Pittsburgh, \n     Pennsylvania, in September 2009; or\n       (ii) has not suspended all enrichment-related and \n     reprocessing activities and work on all heavy-water related \n     projects within 60 days of the conclusion of that Summit; and\n       (B) the United Nations Security Council has failed to adopt \n     significant and meaningful additional sanctions on the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The amendment is in the name of Senators Kyl and \nLieberman. I am calling it up on their behalf.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1628) was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator \nfrom Michigan. Republicans and I believe most Democrats want health \ncare reform this year. The President said he wants health care reform \nthis year. Republicans want health care reform this year. We want to \nmake sure it is done right. Let me put it this way: If we were in an \noperating room and a seriously ill patient came in and we knew we had \nonly one chance to save that patient's life and to make that patient \nhealthy, our goal would not be to see if we could do it in the next \nweek, it would be to see if we could get it right.\n  So far, the proposals we have seen coming out of the committees have \nnot gotten it right. One might say: Well, that is a Republican view of \nDemocratic proposals. Perhaps it is. But the proposals we have seen \ncoming out of the Senate HELP Committee and out of the House of \nRepresentatives flunk the most important test, which is cost. The most \nimportant test is whether Americans can afford their health care and, \nafter we get through fixing it, whether they can afford their \ngovernment. According to virtually everyone we have heard from, the \nlegislation we have seen simply does not meet that test.\n  In my opinion, what we should do instead is start with the framework \nof the bill sponsored by Democratic Senator Wyden and Republican \nSenator Bennett which has 14 cosponsors--8 Democrats, 6 Republicans. \nThis is a different sort of framework that offers virtually every \nAmerican coverage, does so without any Washington takeover or \ngovernment-run programs without raising the debt one penny, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office. Remember, I said that is a \nframework. I do not agree with every single part of that bill, although \nI am a cosponsor, but it may be a much better place to start than what \nwe have seen so far.\n  That is not just my opinion. Lately, we have heard a lot about the \nMayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. President Obama has talked a lot about \nthe Mayo Clinic. The point is, at the Mayo Clinic and a few other \nclinics around the country, there have been significantly better \noutcomes. In other words, if you go there and come out, you are more \nlikely to be well, and at a lower cost. And the question is, Why?\n  The President has repeatedly pointed to the Mayo Clinic, Democratic \nSenators point to the Mayo Clinic, and Republican Senators point to the \nMayo Clinic. Here is what the Mayo Clinic had to say on Friday about \nthe legislation that is being considered in the House of \nRepresentatives:\n\n       Although there are some positives in the current House Tri-\n     committee bill, including insurance for all and payment \n     reform demonstration projects--the proposed legislation \n     misses the opportunity to help create higher quality, more \n     affordable health care for patients. In fact, it will do the \n     opposite.\n\n  That is the Mayo Clinic talking.\n\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\n\n       In general, the proposals under discussion are not patient \n     focused or results oriented. Lawmakers have failed to use a \n     fundamental lever--a change in Medicare payment policy--to \n     help drive necessary improvements in American health care. \n     Unless legislators create payment systems that pay for good \n     patient results at reasonable costs, the promise of \n     transformation in American health care will wither. The real \n     losers will be the citizens of the United States of America.\n\n  That is the Mayo Clinic talking about the bill we are beginning to \nsee in the House of Representatives.\n  I think the prudent thing to do is to try to make that bill better or \nstart over and certainly not try to pass a 1,000-page or 2,000-page \nbill in 1 week or 10 days without knowing what is in it, as we did with \nthe stimulus bill earlier this year.\n  That is not just the opinion of the Mayo Clinic. Here is a letter to \nHouse Members on July 16, a few days ago, from a number of clinics, \nincluding the Mayo Clinic. These are the Intermountain Healthcare, \nGundersen Lutheran Health System, the Iowa Clinic, the Marshfield \nClinic, the Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative, ThedaCare, and \nWisconsin Hospital Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It goes on to say:\n\n       On behalf of some of the nation's leaders in health care \n     delivery--\n\n  These are the people whose hospitals we go to, whose clinics we go to \nwhen we are sick or when we hope to stay well--\n\n     we write to you to comment on the House bill.\n\n  They say:\n\n       We applaud the Congress for working on this. However, we \n     have got significant concerns.\n\n  They go on to say there are three of them.\n  The first is about the Medicare-like public plan, as they call it, a \npublic plan with rates based on Medicare. They say it will have a \nsevere negative effect on their facilities, that they lose a lot of \nmoney every year, hundreds of millions of dollars. Because what happens \nis that Medicare, a government-run plan, pays its doctors and its \nclinics and its hospitals about 80 percent of what private insurance \ncompanies are paying. So roughly 177 million of us have private \ninsurance of one kind or another. If a doctor sees you, he gets paid \n100 percent. But if you go to one of these clinics and hospitals, they \nare paid according to the government rate, which is roughly 80 percent \nof the private rate. These clinics say that is not sustainable for \nthem, and that if that continues, some of those providers, such as the \nMayo Clinic, will eventually be driven out of the market. What market? \nThe market for Medicare patients. Those are the 45 million senior \nAmericans who absolutely depend on Medicare for their service because \nfor most of them, that is their only option. If that is the case, what \nthat means is they will not be able to go to the Mayo Clinic or to the \nMeritCare Health System or to the Iowa Clinic or to the doctor they \nchoose because that doctor will not be a part of the Medicare system \nbecause of low reimbursement.\n  So that is the first objection these clinics make to the bill they \nsee coming because the bill they see coming proposes to create another \ngovernment-run plan with government-set rates.\n  The second objection they have is geographic payment disparities. \nThey say that we are a big country and there ought to be differences in \nthe pay among different geographies.\n  Third, and maybe this is the most important of all, that the \nPresident has said and many of us in the Senate have said we need to \nchange the way we pay for medical care, and we ought to pay more for \nvalue, for quality, for results, and less for volume--in plain English, \nnot how many patients a doctor can see but how many of his or her \npatients stay well or get well.\n  We have talked about that for weeks here in our hearings. But what \nthese respected voices in medicine are saying is that the legislation \nwe see today--and understand, this is not even in a bill that has \npresented to us in the Senate yet in a way upon which we can act--does \nnot meet the test for that. The legislation we have seen so far is \nrunning into a lot of trouble.\n  David Broder, the respected columnist from the Washington Post, said \nthat the plans which have been passed in a partisan way are ``badly \nflawed'' and ``overly expensive.'' I mean, the Democratic plans; we \nhave Republican plans that we would like to be considered. I mentioned \nthat the Wyden-Bennett plan, which is the only really bipartisan plan \nhere, has not been given one bit of consideration so far in the Senate. \nAnd then Senator Burr and Senator Coburn have a plan, Senator Gregg has \na plan, and Senator Hatch has a plan. We all have different ideas. As I \nsaid, we would like for them to be considered, today I'm talking about \nthe Democratic plans that are now being considered.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, of course, is the nonpartisan office \nin this Congress that we count on as an umpire to tell us what we are \nreally doing. It is not supposed to have any political rhetoric. Last \nThursday, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas \nElmendorf was asked at a Senate Budget Committee hearing what he \nthought about the bills which had begun to emerge.\n  He said:\n\n       The legislation significantly expands the Federal \n     responsibility for health care costs.\n\n  In other words, here we go, at a time when we are in a recession and \nwhere the President's proposals for other programs will add more to the \ndebt in the next 10 years, three times as much as we spent in World War \nII, and we are talking about legislation that would add another $2 \ntrillion. We haven't dealt with cost which is where we ought to start. \nLook at the 250 million who have health care and ask the question: Can \nyou afford it? Then after we get through fixing it, can you afford your \ngovernment? And what the head of the CBO is saying, as far as the \ngovernment goes, the answer is no.\n  Then the Lewin Group, a well-respected private agency, was asked what \nwould happen if we had a government-run program which many of us \nbelieve will lead to another Washington takeover. We are getting \naccustomed to this, Washington takeovers of banks, of insurance \ncompanies, of student loans, of car companies, now maybe of health \ncare. The Lewin Group said 88 million people will lose their private \nemployer-sponsored insurance. How could that happen? It could happen \nbecause a small employer or a big employer would see one of these plans \nthat is beginning to come out take place. To be specific, the Senate \nHELP Committee plan says you either have to provide everybody who works \nfor you insurance or pay $750. There are a lot of employers who cannot \nafford to provide everybody the kind of insurance that is envisioned. \nSo they will say: OK, we will pay the $750 fine to the government. What \nhappens? All those employees lose their health insurance. Where do they \ngo? Into the Government plan. That is their option. Some of them may \nhave a choice of other plans, but if they do have a choice and one of \nthe choices is a government-run plan, it may have the same future the \nMayo Clinic and others were saying Medicare was causing to them.\n  The government will set a low price for the doctors and a low price \nfor the clinics. So all these employees who now have insurance that \nthey like will lose that insurance because of the passage of this bill. \nThe government will set the provider rates and physician rates low, and \nso they will be part of a government plan for which many doctors and \nmany hospitals and many clinics will not offer services. It is similar \nto giving somebody a bus ticket to a bus station with no busses.\n  Then there are the Medicare cuts. According to the Washington Post \nlast week, Medicare cuts will pay for one-half the cost of health care \nfor the uninsured in one of the bills being proposed.\n  If we are to find savings in Medicare and take from the 45 million \nelderly people who depend on Medicare, every bit of those savings ought \nto be put back into Medicare and not spent on some new program. I don't \nthink legislation that is paid for half by Medicare cuts is going to go \nvery far in this Chamber.\n  Then there are the employer taxes. According to the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses, the House version has an 8-\npercent Federal payroll tax. I mentioned the Senate\n\n[[Page S7747]]\n\nversion, a $750 annual fine per employee, if the employer doesn't offer \ninsurance. The NFIB, small businesses, estimates that will lose about \n1.6 million jobs.\n  How could that be? Well, if a small employer or even a large one has \ngovernment-mandated costs added and they have less money, they will \nhire less employees. That is one of the options they have.\n  Then there is the income surtax. There is a whole string of trouble \nfor these bills. USA Today on Monday said: It is the highest tax rate \nin a quarter of a century that is proposed: A 45-percent top tax rate \nwith all taxes included.\n  Then rationing, there are provisions in this bill which would have \nthe government make decisions about which treatment you will have and \nhow long you will have to wait to see a doctor.\n  Finally--I say ``finally'' because this is the subject I want to \nspend a moment on--there is the Medicaid State taxes. Sometimes this \ngets confusing. Mr. President, 177 million Americans have private \ninsurance, but a lot of people have government insurance now. Veterans \ndo. Military people have TRICARE insurance. About 45 million older \npeople have Medicare. But then there is a program called Medicaid, \nwhich is the largest government-run program. About 60 million people \nare in it now. The Federal Government pays about 57 percent of it, and \nthe States pay 43 percent. Every Governor I know--and I was once one--\nhas struggled with the Medicaid Program. I once came up here in the \nearly 1980s and asked President Reagan to take it all, let the Federal \nGovernment run it and give us Governors all of kindergarten through the \n12th grade. I thought that would be a good swap.\n  I saw a couple of Democratic Governors earlier today, and we talked \nabout the story every Governor faces. If you have an extra dollar and \nyou want to put it in higher education so you can improve the quality \nof the University of Colorado or Tennessee or keep tuition from going \nup, what happens to it? That dollar is stolen because it has to go in \nthe increasing Medicaid cost. It is an inefficiently managed program. \nThe Federal Government keeps changing the rules. The Governors have to \nget permission from Washington whenever they make minor changes. It is \ndemolishing State governments right and left.\n  If our real goal is to help people, then why under these new plans do \nwe say to low-income people--defined as, say, a family of four who \nmakes less than $32,000--your only option is going to be to go in the \nMedicaid Program under this plan. It is estimated by the Congressional \nBudget Office and others that 15 or 20 million Americans will be added \nto the 60 million in the Medicaid Program. What will they find when \nthey get there? They will find that 40 percent of the doctors don't see \nMedicaid patients. When we add another 15 or 20 million people to it, \nit may be a larger number. Why don't they do see Medicaid patients? For \nthe same reason the Mayo Clinic warned about this government plan in \nits letter. It is because Medicaid only pays its doctors and its \nhospitals about 72 percent of what Medicare pays.\n  If you are confused by that, it works out pretty simply. Medicare \npays 80 percent of what the private insurers pay, and Medicaid pays \nabout 72 percent of what Medicare pays. If you are a doctor or a clinic \nor a hospital, you get paid about 60 percent, if you are helping a \nMedicaid patient, of what you would if you were helping one of us who \nhas his or her own private health care. You can see that will be a \npernicious trend. If we continue to dump low-income people into a \ngovernment-run Medicaid Program, that is what will happen.\n  There is another thing that happens with Medicaid. Many members of \nthe committees working on this bill said: We can't let that happen. We \ncan't be inhumane and just say we are out here to help people who are \nuninsured, and we are going to dump 20 million of them into a \ngovernment-run program that doesn't have enough doctors and hospitals \nand clinics. We will have to raise what we pay to doctors and clinics. \nThat sounds good, but that is very expensive, particularly for a \nprogram such as Medicaid that, according to the Government \nAccountability Office, $1 out of every $10 is fraudulent, is wasted. \nThat is $32 billion a year. That is the program we are going to expand? \nThat is the program we are going to say to low-income people: \nCongratulations, go into this program where you are not likely to find \na doctor every time you want one, and there are a lot of hospitals and \nclinics that will not take you because we will not pay them for that.\n  Because Senators and Congressmen hear that, they say: We will raise \nthe rates. Here is the proposal: The proposal is, we are going to \nincrease the number of people who are eligible for Medicaid by 133 to \n150 percent of the Federal poverty level. That is a substantial \nincrease. Then, if we are going to do that and put many more people \ninto the program, we are going to have to order an increase in what we \npay the doctors and the clinics to serve them, maybe up to 83 or 85 \npercent of the Medicare level.\n  Let me talk about what that would do in one State. We called the \nState Medicaid director in Tennessee. Our program is called TennCare. \nWe said: What would it cost Tennessee if we increase coverage of \nMedicaid up to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level? The answer \ncame back, nearly $600 million a year. That is the State's share of the \ncost which is a little more than a third. The Federal Government's \nshare is twice that. So the Federal Government is saying: That is all \nright. We know Tennessee doesn't have the money to do that, so we will \npay it all for the first 5 years. Then, after 5 years, so the talk \ngoes--and we were told, when we were working on this bill, this is an \nassumption--we will shift these costs back to Colorado, back to \nTennessee. Back comes what in today's dollars is about $600 million to \nthe State of Tennessee.\n\n  Remember what I said. This is a program doctors don't want to go to \nbecause they don't get paid very well. So we will have to increase the \namount of money we pay doctors. So if States are required to pay \ndoctors and providers under the Medicaid system 110 percent of what \nMedicare is paid, that still isn't what doctors and hospitals get, if \nthey see somebody with private health insurance. That is about the same \namount of money, about $600 million added just for the State cost, \nwhich brings the total new state cost for paying physicians and \nhospitals more and for all the new people in the Medicaid Program to \n$1.2 billion. That is a huge amount of money.\n  We throw around dollars up here and figures that make any amount of \nmoney seem unimaginable. What is $1 trillion, what is $10 trillion, \nwhat is $40 billion. We former Governors can imagine it. I figured it \nout. If in 5 years you shifted back to the State of Tennessee just its \nshare of those costs from the expansion of Medicaid and paying the \ndoctors and hospitals more, the bill for the State of Tennessee to pay \nthe increased Medicaid costs would be an amount of money that equals a \nnew 10-percent State income tax.\n  The truth is, for our State--and I believe for almost every State--it \nis an amount of money that nobody has enough taxes to pay. You can run \npoliticians in and out and defeat them for raising taxes all day long, \nand they still couldn't come up with ways to pay for it. In other \nwords, these bills are based on a premise and assumption that will \neither bankrupt the States or, if the Federal Government says we will \npay for it all, it will add $5, $6, $700 billion more over 10 years to \nthe legislation we are considering.\n  We need to think that through. Is that the best way to help people \nwho are low income? I don't think so. I think there are much better \nways. The Wyden-Bennett framework is a better way. It rearranges the \ntax deductions we have for people who have health insurance from their \nemployers and it says: Let's take the available money and give the \nmoney to low-income people who then buy private health insurance. It \nmay be a very basic plan. But at least they would have health \ninsurance, and they wouldn't be stuffed in a government program 40 \npercent of the doctors wouldn't see and that many of the best clinics \nand hospitals wouldn't allow them to come in.\n  We have been told already by the Congressional Budget Office that \nproposal would not add a penny to the debt. Not only does it not create \na new government program, it actually makes the Medicaid Program, \nexcept\n\n[[Page S7748]]\n\nfor Americans with Disabilities, history. In other words, if you are \npoor, you are not stuffed into a program that nobody else would want to \njoin anyway. You have a chance to buy your own insurance, and you are \nnot consigned to the worst run government program we have today.\n  So there are some real possibilities with health care, and there are \nsome plans on the table that will lead us in the right direction. We \nhave advice from distinguished Americans with a stake in this--which is \nevery single one of us--but the most distinguished are those who deal \nwith it every day. The Mayo Clinic is saying the proposed legislation \nmisses the opportunity to help create higher quality, more affordable \nhealth care for patients. In fact, it will do the opposite.\n  Shouldn't we slow down and get it right? Shouldn't we get it right? \nThis is the only chance we have to do this. If we do it wrong, we will \nnot be able to undo it. This is 16, 18 percent of the American economy \nwe are talking about. People have tried to do it for 60 years, and they \nfailed.\n  The only way we will do it is if we do it together. The Democrats \nhave big majorities over on that side. They do in the House. But that \nis not the way things usually happen around here. The President has \nsaid--and I take him at his word--and many of the leaders have said--\nand I take them at their word--that we would like to get 70, 80 votes \nfor the health care result. We would too.\n  But in order to do that, we are going to have to do it the way we \nusually do when we have bipartisan events around here. We get some \nDemocrats and some Republicans and they sit down with the President and \nthey share ideas and they agree on some things. They don't just say: \nOK, here it is, and we are going to vote down almost every significant \nidea you have on the way through.\n  I respect the fact that Senator Baucus is trying to do that in the \nFinance Committee, and perhaps he will succeed, working with Senator \nGrassley and others. But this is going to take some time. It cannot be \ndone overnight. There are many sections to this bill. Each of them \nmight be 500 pages long. They have enormous consequences to \nindividuals. That is why we have all these clinics writing and saying: \nIf you do it the way it looks like you are going to do it, you may \ndrive us out of the business of helping Medicare patients.\n  Do we really want to do that? Do we really want to say to 45 million \nAmericans who depend on Medicare: We are going to pass a bill that will \naccelerate the process whereby respected clinics and the doctor you \nmight choose will not see you anymore because they cannot afford to \nbecause the government will not pay them under the system we have?\n  So I would suggest we start over, literally, conceptually; start over \nand listen to these clinics and doctors and focus on the delivery \nsystem and focus, first, on those 250 million Americans who already \nhave health insurance and ask the question: Can they afford it? And, \nwhat could we do to make it possible for those Americans to afford it? \nAnd can we do it in a way that permits us to be able to honestly say \nwhen we are through that those same 250 million Americans can afford \ntheir government when we are through without adding to the debt?\n  Then let's look at the 46 million people who are uninsured. Of \ncourse, we need for them to be insured. But the fact is, 11 million of \nthe uninsured are already eligible for programs we already have; 10 \nmillion or so are noncitizens--half of them legally here, half of them \nnot; a large number of them are making $75,000 a year and could afford \nit but just do not buy it; and another significant number are college \nstudents.\n  So we are going to have to go step by step by step and see in what \nlow-cost way we can include a large number of these 46 million \nAmericans, who are not part of the system, in the system. But that is \nthe wrong place to start. That is the place to end.\n  So, Mr. President, all I am saying is, on the Republican side of the \naisle we can tell you what we are for. Some of us are for the Wyden-\nBennett bill with our Democratic colleagues. That is the only \nbipartisan bill before us today. It has not even been seriously \nconsidered by this body, but it is there, and it has significant \nsupport in the House. We have two doctors over here: Dr. Barrasso, who \nhas been an orthopedic surgeon for 25 years, and Dr. Coburn from \nOklahoma, an OB/GYN doctor. They would like to be involved in the \nprocess. So far their ideas are not really being adopted in the result \nwe might have. We have Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, one of the \nmost respected Senators, who has been a part of many bipartisan \nefforts, and he has his own bill. He would like to be more a part of \nit, but his ideas do not fit the way things are going. But the way \nthings are going are too expensive for the Congressional Budget Office \nand take us in the wrong direction, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n  So maybe we ought to step back and say: Well, let's listen to these \nother ideas. Let's go very carefully. Let's work with the President. \nLet's see if we can get a result. Let's keep a four-letter word out \nthere that is a good word; and that is ``cost,'' and make sure we focus \nfirst on the 250 million Americans who have health insurance and make \nsure they can afford it; and, second, make sure when we finish fixing \nhealth care that those same Americans can afford their government.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    July 16, 2009.\n     Hon. Ron Kind,\n     Longworth House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Kind: On behalf of some of the nation's \n     leaders in health care delivery, we write to you today to \n     comment on the House health care reform bill introduced \n     earlier this week. We would like to thank you for the \n     opportunity to comment on this legislation. We applaud the \n     Congress for its commitment to passing comprehensive health \n     care delivery system reform this year. However, we have \n     significant concerns about the current language of the bill \n     and we ask that these concerns, set forth below, be addressed \n     before the committee action is concluded.\n\n\n                       Medicare-like Public Plan\n\n       First, we are concerned that a public plan option with \n     rates based on Medicare rates will have a severe negative \n     impact on our facilities. Today, many providers suffer great \n     financial losses associated with treating Medicare patients. \n     For example, several of the systems that have signed onto \n     this letter lost hundreds of millions of dollars under \n     Medicare last year. These rates are making it increasingly \n     difficult for us to continue to treat Medicare patients. The \n     implementation of a public plan with similar rates will \n     create a financial result that will be unsustainable for even \n     the nation's most efficient, high quality providers, \n     eventually driving them out of the market. In addition, \n     should a public plan with inadequate rates be enacted, we \n     will be forced to shift additional costs to private payers, \n     which will ultimately lead to increased costs for employers \n     who maintain insurance for their employees. We believe all \n     Americans must have guaranteed portable health insurance, but \n     it is critical that we not lose sight of the need to ensure \n     adequate and equitable reimbursement.\n\n\n                     Geographic Payment Disparities\n\n       Second, our health care systems are among the most cost-\n     efficient in the country in caring for Medicare patients. \n     However, many of us operate in states with some of the lowest \n     Medicare reimbursement rates in the nation. Current physician \n     payments due to geographic disparities are actually greater \n     under Medicare than under commercial insurance. This may be \n     difficult to believe, given the government's rate-setting \n     power, but flows from the fundamentally flawed payment \n     methodology. To date, health care reform proposals simply \n     continue the current payment methodology, despite the fact \n     that formula changes have been identified to address this \n     problem. We support payment changes that work to reduce \n     geographic disparities, rather than perpetuating the flaws in \n     the current payment system. While we believe that the \n     Institute of Medicine study is a good first step, we \n     encourage Congress to take this further and enact payment \n     reforms that will address the existing disparities.\n\n\n                          Value Index Proposal\n\n       Third, consistent with statements from President Obama, we \n     believe that focusing on, defining, measuring, and paying for \n     value is essential for controlling cost within the U.S. \n     health care system. The system must be reformed to compensate \n     for value instead of volume. We believe inserting a value \n     index into various aspects of the Medicare payment system \n     (e.g., physician fee schedule, hospital rates) is the means \n     to accomplish this end goal of compensating for quality \n     rather than quantity.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this \n     legislation. We urge you to address the above-stated \n     concerns, which will demonstrate that Congress is serious \n     about preserving the best parts of the existing health\n\n[[Page S7749]]\n\n     care delivery system. If we can be of assistance to you \n     moving forward, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n         Everett Clinic, Gundersen Lutheran Health System, \n           HealthPartners, Intermountain Healthcare, Iowa Clinic, \n           Marshfield Clinic, Mayo Clinic.\n         MeritCare Health System, Park Nicollet Health System, \n           Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative, ThedaCare, \n           Wisconsin Hospital Association, Wisconsin Medical \n           Society.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, throughout this Nation's history, our \nfreedom--and at times our very survival--has rested squarely on the \nshoulders of the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am proud to know many \nof these brave warfighters we have. We rely upon their training and \ndiscipline. We depend upon their service and their sacrifice. In \nreturn, we owe them nothing but the very best.\n  That means keeping our commitment to every soldier, sailor, airman, \nand marine at every stage in their career--from the day they report for \ntraining to the day they retire and beyond.\n  We can start to honor this commitment in the most basic way by \nensuring that their facilities are safe and adequate. That is why I \nplan to offer an amendment that would help eliminate vegetative \nencroachment on training ranges. Excessive vegetation can actually \nrender training grounds unusable. If a training range is heavily \novergrown, it can lead to dangerous situations, including fires and \nobstructive lines of sight.\n  In a recent study by the U.S. Army, 70 percent of the facilities \nsurveyed are experiencing limitations due to uncontrolled vegetation. \nThis is unacceptable. We must take action now.\n  My amendment calls upon the Secretary of Defense to perform a \ncomprehensive study of training ranges across every branch of the \nmilitary. We must develop a plan to reclaim any overgrown land for its \nrightful use by our fighting men and women of America. This will help \nus ensure that we can train them adequately and safely so they can \nfully prepare for any mission they are assigned to perform.\n  But we cannot stop there. Our commitment begins on the day someone \nvolunteers for service in the Armed Forces. But it does not end, even \nafter their service has drawn to a close. That is why I believe it is \nimportant to extend dislocation benefits to every servicemember, \nincluding those whose service is coming to an end.\n  Over the course of a career in the American military, a service man \nor woman and their family may be ordered to relocate a number of \ntimes--moving here, moving there, this assignment, that assignment. \nEach move can be quite costly. From basic travel expenses to the \npurchase of household goods to utilities to rent, it takes a lot to \nrelocate an entire family.\n  Since 1955, Congress has helped members of the service defray these \ncosts by paying a ``dislocation allowance'' to each person we reassign \nto a new duty station. This eases the financial burden on military \nfamilies and means that personnel decisions can be made without fear of \nbreaking the bank--at least for most servicemembers, that is.\n  Unfortunately, those who retire are not covered under the current \nsystem, despite the fact that their final orders may require a \npermanent change of station. So after years of supporting service men \nand women when we ask them to relocate, we abandon them at the time of \ntheir final move. We leave them to fend for themselves, even though the \nexpenses they incur will be as high as ever, and even though their \nincome has been reduced to half of what they had been paid during \nActive Duty.\n  So we simply cannot stand for this. We cannot allow those who have \nserved us honorably to be left out in the cold at the end of their \ncareers. We must offer these benefits to all Members of our Armed \nForces, even those who have been asked to move for the last time.\n  That is why I am calling for a study to examine the feasibility of \nextending the dislocation allowance to retiring servicemembers. We \nshould find a way to make this work. The cost of moving demands it. Our \nservicemembers support it. And, most importantly, it is the right thing \nto do for our troops.\n  Colleagues, Members of this great body, let's come together to stand \nfor those who sacrifice on our behalf and protect this great country of \nours that allows us to do what we do in America, with freedom and \nopportunity. Let's provide our men and women in uniform with the \nsupport they need at every stage of their careers--from the first day \nof basic training to the day they are discharged.\n  Cutting down on vegetation encroachment will keep our trainees safe \nand help prepare them for years of honorable service. When that service \nends, dislocation benefits will help them retire with some measure of \nfinancial security.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting these \ninitiatives I put forth. We owe our troops nothing less.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about \nhealth care and the need for health care reform in the country today. I \nthink most Americans would agree we need to do everything we can to \nmake affordable health insurance available to every American and, \nhopefully, that is what this health reform debate will be about.\n  Unfortunately, we are seeing a pattern develop here that has been \ngoing on all year--since the President took office--that has many \nAmericans alarmed at the rapid pace we are spending and borrowing, \nimposing new taxes, and taking over various aspects of the American \neconomy. I know a lot of Americans are alarmed and some are outraged. \nMore than any other comment, I am hearing Americans say: Why don't you \nslow down and read the bills before you continue the expansion of \ngovernment.\n  Now we are talking about health care, and we see that same pattern of \ncrisis and rush and it ``has to be done today, hair's on fire'' type of \nmentality here in Washington so that we almost have to call this a \n``son of stimulus'' health care bill. Because certainly the last time \nthe President tried to ram a massive bill through Congress before we \nhad a chance to read it, we ended up with this colossal stimulus \nfailure that has actually resulted in the loss of jobs in America and a \nburden of debt on our children that is almost unimaginable. It makes no \nsense for us to follow that same pattern with health care--nearly 20 \npercent of our economy--to have a government takeover with a bill we \nhaven't even completely seen yet, that is supposed to be passed in the \nnext 2 weeks, even though the bill wouldn't take effect until 2013. \nWhat is the rush? The whole purpose of the Senate is to be the place \nwhere the legislation comes to cool down, where we deliberate, we look \nat the details. The President himself has admitted he is not aware of \nthe details of the bill he is out selling every day.\n  We do have serious problems in health care that we need to fix. The \nunfortunate thing is I have no confidence that the President actually \nwants to make health insurance affordable and available to all \nAmericans because when he was in the Senate, Republicans proposed a \nnumber of alternatives that would have done that. Yet in every case--\nevery opportunity he had to make health insurance more available and \naffordable to Americans--he voted no. Let's review some of them, \nbecause I think we have to recognize that the point of this health care \ndebate is not to make sure every American is insured, but to make sure \nthe government is running our health care system. The most personal and\n\n[[Page S7750]]\n\nprivate part of our lives they are talking about turning over to \nbureaucrats at the Federal level. This makes no sense.\n  What we could do is be fair to those who don't get their health \ninsurance at work. If people get their health insurance at work, as we \ndo here in Congress, your employer can deduct the cost of it and the \nemployee is exempt from paying taxes on those benefits. That is \nequivalent to about a $5,000 a year benefit to families who get their \nhealth care or health insurance at work. Why can't we offer that same \nfairness to Americans who don't get their health insurance at work? It \nis something I actually proposed here in the Senate while President \nObama was a Senator, that we would give fair tax treatment; at least \nlet them deduct it from their taxes. He voted no, as did I believe \nevery Democrat, and they killed the bill in the House. This was basic \nfairness to make health insurance a little more affordable to people \nwho didn't get it at work. The President voted no.\n  We hear a lot of talk about how we need a government plan to make the \nprivate plans more competitive. Why not make all the insurance \ncompanies compete with insurance companies all over the country instead \nof what we do now? A lot of Americans don't know that the reason we \ndon't have a competitive private health insurance market is that the \nFederal Government makes it impossible. You have to buy your health \ninsurance in the State where you live, so a few insurance companies \nbasically have monopolies in every State of the country. What if \nsomeone such as myself who lived in South Carolina could look all \nacross the country, find a policy I wanted at a better price, and buy \nit? Why can't we do that? Well, I proposed we do that. We introduced it \non the Senate floor. It would have created a competitive health \ninsurance market and allowed people to buy all over the country. Barack \nObama voted no, as did all of the Democrats, to kill the bill. Now they \nare talking about: Well, we need a government option to create some \ncompetition, to have a real competitive market. He voted against it.\n  What about allowing Americans who put money in a health savings \naccount, or their employer puts it in there for them--their own money--\nwhy not let them use that money to pay for a health insurance premium \nif they don't get it at work? It sounded like a good idea to me, to \nmake it a little bit easier, a little more affordable to have your own \nhealth insurance, so I proposed that bill here in the Senate. Barack \nObama voted no, as did all of the Democrats, and they killed the bill.\n  What about the idea of allowing a lot of small employers--I was a \nsmall businessman for years. It was hard to buy health insurance as a \nsmall employer, but I did. It cost me a lot of money, a lot more than \nthe big employers. But what about allowing a lot of small employers to \ncome together and form associations and buy health insurance so they \ncould offer it to their employees less expensively? Well, it is a good \nidea that was offered right here on the floor of the Senate by \nRepublicans. Barack Obama voted no, as did most of the Democrats, and \nthey killed the bill.\n  There is a long list here I could go through, but every single bill, \nevery single health reform idea that has been proposed here, the \nPresident, when he was in the Senate, voted against. Everything that \nwould have made health insurance available and affordable to the \naverage American who doesn't get their insurance at work was voted no \nby this President.\n  Now he is saying, We need the government to take it over because it \nis not working. The reason it is not working is we won't let it work. \nThe part of health insurance, the health care system that works the \nbest today is when you have your own health insurance and you pick your \nown doctor and you and your doctor decide what kind of health care you \nare going to get. It is not a perfect system, and insurance companies \nhave a lot of work to do to make things work better because I have to \nargue with them a lot myself. But the part of the health care system \nthat doesn't work is the part that the government runs, Medicaid and \nMedicare, the SCHIP and TRICARE. Some of the people who get those \nbenefits such as our seniors say Medicare works fine, but, \nunfortunately, doctors don't want to see them coming because Medicare \nand Medicaid don't cover the cost of even seeing a patient. So many \nphysicians are closing their practices to our seniors because they have \ngovernment health insurance. Government health care does not pay enough \nfor the physician and the hospital to see the patient, so they shift \nthe cost over to the private market.\n  The worst part of all of these government plans is they are trillions \nof dollars in debt--debt that our children are going to have to pay \nback. These programs are broke. Yet they want to expand these programs. \nThey want to take the part of health care that is not working and \nessentially force it on every American. They want every American to \nhave a Medicaid plan where doctors don't want to see us coming because \nwe are not paying enough of their costs.\n  As I look at this whole health care reform debate--and I am glad to \nsee the President out taking shots at me for saying we have to stop him \non this, because we have been on a rampage since he took office, \npassing one government program after another, expanding spending and \ndebt at levels we have never imagined in this country. It is time to \nslow down and take stock of where we are. Other countries that have to \nlend us money to keep us going are beginning to wonder, Can we pay our \ndebts? We have doubled our money supply by the Federal Reserve, and \nthat means big inflation, higher interest rates. Yet we are moving \nahead with this health care plan that is going to expand our debt as a \nnation, raise taxes on small businesses that create the jobs. It looks \nas if we are going to penalize Americans who don't decide to buy health \ninsurance, and we are moving again toward a government program that we \nknow won't work. There is not one Federal program that has worked as \nadvertised, that has worked to the budget we said it would be to. This \nweek we have had announcements of what we have already passed as far as \nstimulus over the last year is going to mean trillions of dollars--\ntrillions of dollars--we are going to have to borrow and that our \nchildren are going to have to pay back.\n\n  I appeal to my colleagues: We don't need to rush through a bill in \nthe next 2 weeks before we go on our August break that affects one-\nfifth--20 percent--of our total economy, that gets the government to \neffectively take over the most personal and private service that we ask \nfor as Americans. We don't need to pass a bill such as that, that we \nwon't even have time to read. What the President and I think a lot of \nthe proponents of this bill are afraid of is if we are able to go home \non the August break and we take this bill and we put it on the Internet \nwhere people can read it, and radio talk shows and bloggers all around \nthe country are able to tell the American people what this bill is and \nwhat it will do, and get past this utopian rhetoric that we are hearing \nfrom the President and look at the nuts and bolts, because everything \nhe is saying this bill is going to do the Congressional Budget Office \nand other experts are saying, No, it isn't going to work that way. It \nisn't going to save us money, it is going to raise our taxes, it is \ngoing to cost jobs in America, and it isn't going to fix health care.\n  We need to go back to the basics, including some of what I have \nmentioned already, that would reform health care and make private \nhealth insurance work better, make it more affordable, and get it into \nthe hands of more Americans. Why should we give up on freedom and move \nto a government plan when we haven't even given freedom a chance to \nwork in health care?\n  I know the government can't run health care and I don't want them \nrunning my plan. One of the best ideas I have heard in this debate is \nwhatever we pass, Congressmen and Senators ought to have to take that \nhealth plan. I am going to have an amendment to that effect if they try \nto get this on the floor before August.\n  But I appeal to my colleagues: Let's listen to the American people. \nLet's stop this rampage toward bigger and bigger government. Let's take \nour time and look at this bill and, for once, do something right. Our \nhealth depends on it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the widows and orphans \namendment. This is the dastardly subject we have been dealing with for \nyears, where there is an offset from an insurance payout, that \nservicemembers pay insurance premiums and/or retirees pay premiums, \nwhich is offset by Veterans Department disability compensation, which \notherwise the veteran's surviving spouse and children would be able to, \nunder existing law, be eligible for both, but there is an offset.\n  This particular amendment is going to eliminate that offset. Every \nyear, we come to the floor on the Defense authorization bill and we \noffer the amendment and we have an overwhelming vote in the Senate. \nEvery year, it goes to conference and, for years and years, in the \nconference committee with the House, they would say you cannot pass an \namendment that would even reduce the offset for widows and orphans. \nOnly in the last couple years have we had some modest reduction of the \noffset. Then, on an earlier piece of legislation this year, we had a \nlittle bit more reduction of the offset. What this amendment will do is \ncompletely eliminate the offset.\n  I wish to point out at the outset, I have a letter from the Military \nCoalition, and I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Military Coalition,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: The Military Coalition (TMC), a \n     consortium of nationally prominent military and veterans \n     organizations, representing more 5.5 million members plus \n     their families and survivors would like to thank you for your \n     sponsoring of Amendment No. 1515 of FY2010 NDAA (S. 1390). \n     This Amendment, like your bill, S. 535, would repeal the law \n     requiring a dollar-for-dollar deduction of VA benefits for \n     service connected deaths from the survivors' SBP annuities. \n     The elimination of this survivor benefit inequity is a top \n     legislative goal for TMC in 2009.\n       We strongly believe that if military service caused a \n     member's death, the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation \n     (DIC) the VA pays the survivor should be added to the SBP \n     benefits the disabled retiree paid for, not substituted for \n     them. In the case of members who died on active duty, a \n     surviving spouse with children can avoid the dollar-for-\n     dollar offset only by assigning SBP to the children. That \n     forces the spouse to give up any SBP claim after the children \n     attain their majority--leaving the spouse with only a $1,154 \n     monthly annuity from the VA. Those who give their lives for \n     their country deserve fairer compensation for their surviving \n     spouses. Your amendment would also end this inequity.\n       The Military Coalition again thanks you for sponsoring this \n     Amendment to restore equity to this very important survivor \n     program and encourages your colleagues vote for its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n       The Military Coalition:\n\n       Air Force Association, Air Force Sergeants Association, Air \n     Force Women Officers Associated, American Logistics \n     Association, AMVETS, Army Aviation Assn. of America, Assn. of \n     Military Surgeons of the United States, Assn. of the US Army, \n     Association of the United States Navy, Commissioned Officers \n     Assn. of the US Public Health Service, Inc.

This letter supports this legislation. It is \nfrom the Military Coalition. The Military Coalition is a group of 34 \norganizations, and their signatures are on the letter--alphabetically, \nfrom the Air Force Association all the way to the last one on the list \nof 34, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. All those \norganizations that you would expect are in between; there are 34 of \nthem endorsing this amendment.\n  I wish to tell you about this particular amendment. I filed this \nbill--and this is nonpartisan--years ago with Senator Sessions and \neight other original cosponsors. It will repeal the law that takes \nalmost $1,200 per month from families who have lost a loved one because \nof military service. This survivors benefit plan, otherwise known\n\n[[Page S7752]]\n\nby its initials as SBP, is an annuity paid by the Defense Department. \nSurvivors receive the benefit when either a military retiree pays a \npremium as income insurance for their survivors or when a servicemember \ndies on Active Duty.\n  The other law is dependency and indemnity compensation, referred to \nby its initials DIC. It is a survivor benefit paid by the Veterans' \nAdministration. Survivors receive this benefit when the military \nservice caused the servicemember's death.\n  What this amendment will do is fix this longstanding problem in the \nmilitary survivor benefits system. The problem is, it requires a \ndollar-for-dollar reduction of the survivor benefits from the SBP, paid \nby the Department of Defense, offsetting against the dependents and \nindemnity compensation, DIC, paid by the Veterans' Administration.\n  You know the great quote, following one of America's bloodiest wars, \nby President Lincoln in his second inaugural address--and the war was \nstill raging at that point. He said that one of the greatest \nobligations in war is to ``finish the work we are in; to bind up the \nNation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle''--in \nother words, the veterans--``and for his widow and his orphan.''\n  Following Lincoln's advice to honor truly our servicemembers, they \nneed to know their widows and orphans, their survivors, will be taken \ncare of. We certainly agree that the U.S. Government must take care of \nour veterans, their widows, and their orphans. In keeping with that \nprinciple, we need to repeal this offset that denies the widows and \norphans the annuity their deceased loved ones have earned on Active \nDuty or have purchased for them. A retired military member can purchase \nthis SBP, and it is an insurance policy so their survivors will have \nincome.\n  Over in the Veterans' Administration, we have a law that says, if you \nare disabled a certain percentage, we are going to take care of you. \nOne should not offset the other--particularly, when somebody has paid \npremiums on an insurance policy.\n  Well, that dollar-for-dollar offset is what has me so agitated for a \ndecade now. I have already explained that, for the survivors benefit \nplan, there are two ways to qualify: The military retiree goes out and \nvoluntarily pays into an insurance program with their retirement \nincome. Later, the statute was added that the survivors benefit plan is \navailable to an Active-Duty servicemember if they are killed as a \nresult of military service. For retirees, the SBP is an insurance \nprogram that protects the income of survivors; and for Active-Duty \nmilitary members, SBP is compensation for the servicemembers' \nbeneficiaries.\n  On the other hand, the dependents indemnity compensation is a benefit \npayment to the survivors of a servicemember who dies from a service-\nconnected condition. For almost a decade, I have fought to repeal the \nlaw that requires the dollar-for-dollar offset of these two very \ndifferent benefits. Back in 2005, the Senate took the step in the right \ndirection and passed, by a vote of 92 to 6, my amendment to repeal that \noffset. When it got down to the conference committee, you know what \nhappened. In the 2008 Defense authorization bill, we cracked the door \nto eliminating the offset. In the conference committee negotiations \nwith the House, we made some progress when we got a special payment of \n$50 per month, which would now increase to $310 per month by 2017 \nbecause of money savings found in the tobacco legislation passed \nearlier this year.\n  Our efforts have been important steps in the right direction, but \nthey are not enough. We must meet our obligation to the widows and \norphans with the same sense of honor as was the service their loved \nones had performed. We need to completely offset this SBP and DIC. We \nmust continue to work to do right by all those who have given this \nNation their all and especially for the loved ones they may leave to \nour care.\n  In that letter that I have had entered into the Record, it says:\n\n       The elimination of this survivor benefit inequity is the \n     top legislative goal for [the Military Coalition] in 2009.\n\n  I will not take the time to read the names of the 34 organizations \nthat signed the letter, but they are all fairly well known to every one \nof us.\n  On February 24 of this year, during a joint session of the Congress, \nthe President said:\n\n       To keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will \n     raise their pay, and give our veterans the expanded health \n     care and benefits they have earned.\n\n  I say amen to that. I ask that President Obama help us end this \ninjustice to widows and orphans of our Nation's heroes.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire if there is someone else who wants to \nspeak now, because if there would not be, I would like to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object. Let's dispose of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona objects.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object to the Senator from Florida going into morning \nbusiness until we dispose of the amendment. Then he can do it right \naway.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I merely inquired if another Senator wants to \nspeak. Certainly, I would withhold asking for a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I intend to speak on the Thune amendment \nand was scheduled to speak in the next few minutes. If it is OK with \nthe floor leaders, if my colleague will speak for a brief amount of \ntime, I am happy to go after him. It is up to the floor managers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Florida, we will \nfind out if there are others who want to speak on his amendment. If \nnot, we are in favor of disposing of his amendment. Part of the \nagreement we made, in order for us to proceed, was that if anyone came \nto the floor to speak on the pending amendment, that Senator would have \npriority. If it is agreeable to the Senator from Florida, the Senator \nfrom New York would go ahead and then we could go back to him speaking \nin morning business.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course. It is my understanding the Senator \nfrom South Carolina had just spoken as in morning business. That is why \nI was inquiring. I am very grateful to the ranking member of the \ncommittee for us to go ahead and dispose of this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Why don't we wait until after the Senator from New York \nfinishes, to make sure there is no one else who wants to speak on the \namendment of the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if my colleague needs 5 minutes, I am \nhappy to yield to him, if I would come after that. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. NELSON of Florida pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 1484, S. 1485, S. 1486, and S. 1487 are located in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if the Senator from Florida is prepared, I \nhave conferred with the ranking member, the Senator from Arizona, and \nwe are prepared to voice vote the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1515) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, \nand I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1618\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know we are not now on the Thune \namendment. I know we have gone aside to other amendments and that we \nwill be debating Thune tomorrow morning, but there are so many of my \ncolleagues who want to speak, and I have a lot to say. So I will speak \nfor 5 minutes tomorrow morning, but I will give the bulk of my speech \nthis afternoon.\n\n[[Page S7753]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise in staunch opposition to the Thune amendment. I \nbelieve it is a dangerous amendment that would go far beyond \nauthorizing gun possession for self-defense and not only create a \nserious threat to public safety but also severely undercut American \nfederalism.\n  Amendment No. 1618, authored by Senator Thune, would force States and \nlocalities from across the Nation to permit individuals from other \nStates to carry hidden and loaded handguns in public, even where the \nelected representatives of those States have chosen to bar these \npersons from possessing firearms. The legislation would require every \nState with concealed carry legislation to honor concealed carry \nlicenses issued by any other State so long as they abide by the State's \nlocation restrictions for concealed carry.\n  This amendment is a bridge too far and could endanger the safety of \nmillions of Americans. Each State has carefully crafted its concealed \ncarry laws in the way that makes the most sense to protect its \ncitizens. It is obvious what is good for the safety of people in New \nYork City or Philadelphia or Chicago or Miami or Los Angeles is not the \nsame thing that is needed in rural Idaho or rural Tennessee. Yet this \namendment, in one fell swoop, says the protections some States feel \nthey need to protect law enforcement, to protect its citizenry, would \nbe wiped away.\n  The amendment will incite the dangerous race to the bottom in our \nNation's gun laws. Let's examine the lineup of people who could carry \nconcealed weapons in 48 States under this amendment. And I don't \ndisparage each State for doing what it wants within its own borders, \nbut why impose that on States outside their borders?\n  Arizona law allows a concealed carry permit to be issued to an \napplicant who is a known alcoholic. So alcoholics would be in the \nlineup. They could carry a concealed weapon in States outside of \nArizona simply because Arizona allowed them to do so.\n  Texas, which is one of the top 10 sources of guns recovered in crimes \nin New York City, a city in which I reside, is obliged to issue a \npermit to a person who has been convicted repeatedly of illegally \ncarrying a handgun. Therefore, we can place arms traffickers in this \nlineup.\n  Mississippi law leaves access to concealed carry permits for members \nof hate groups.\n  Alaska and Vermont allow adult residents of their States to carry a \nconcealed weapon without a license or background check as long as they \nare allowed to possess a gun, even if they have committed violent \nmisdemeanors, have committed misdemeanor sex offenses against minors or \nare dangerously mentally ill and have been voluntarily committed to a \nmental institution.\n  Again, each State has its own views. The State of Vermont is a \nbeautiful State. It is different from New York State in many ways, and \nthe laws that fit for Vermont don't necessarily fit for New York.\n  A 17-year-old Crip or Blood from New York--a member of a gang; \ndangerous, maybe violent--could head to Vermont, obtain a Vermont \ndriver's license, buy a gun, and return to New York or he could buy a \nwhole bunch of guns and return to New York. When law enforcement stops \nhim, a loaded gun tucked in his pants or a whole bunch of guns in his \nbackpack, all he would have to do is claim he is a Vermonter visiting \nNew York, show his Vermont ID, and the New York Police Department would \nbe unable to stop him. This runs shivers down the spines of New York \npolice officers, of New York sheriffs, of New York law enforcement. And \nit doesn't just apply to New York. This could apply to any large State.\n  Imagine law enforcement stopping one of these characters with a \nbackpack full of guns--a known member of a major gang--and having to \nlet them go. Imagine how empowered gun smugglers and traffickers would \nfeel. Their business would boom. These are people who make money by \nselling guns illegally to people who are convicted felons. They could \ngo to the State with the weakest laws, get a concealed carry permit--if \nthat State allowed it, and in all likelihood it might--and then start \nbringing concealed guns into neighboring States and States across the \ncountry. Their business would boom, but our safety would be impaired. \nImagine routine traffic stops turned into potential shootouts.\n  Police officers in New York have the safety and the peace of mind in \nknowing that the only people who might legally have a gun are those who \nhave been approved by the police department. That is how we do it in a \ncity such as New York. We have had our problems with crime. Thank God \nit is much lower now, due to the great work of the New York City \npolice. But now they would be totally unprepared, walking on tiptoe. \nAnd if the criminal simply said: I am from this State--wow. I shudder \nat the thought.\n  Beyond the very real threat this poses to law enforcement and the \nsafety of our police officers and the safety of our citizens, it would \ncreate a logistical nightmare. A police officer making a stop of a car \nwould have to have in front of him or her the laws of all 45 States \nthat now allow or whose residents would now be allowed or even whose \npeople had gotten carry permits who would now be allowed to carry \nconcealed weapons in New York.\n  What about States rights? I have not been on the side--it is \nobvious--of the gun lobby for as many years as I have been here in the \nHouse and Senate. I have always believed, though, there is a right to \nbear arms and that it is unfair to say the second amendment should be \nseen through a pinhole and the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, \nseventh, and eighth amendments should be seen broadly. I don't think \nthat is fair.\n  But every amendment has limitations. Through the years when I have \nbeen involved in this issue, the NRA and other gun groups have argued, \nfrankly, that the States ought to make their own decisions. All of a \nsudden we see a 180-degree hairpin turn. Now they are saying that the \nStates cannot make their own decisions. Why is it that every other \nissue should be resolved by the States except this one? The amendment \nflies in the very face of States rights arguments and takes away \ncitizens' rights to govern themselves.\n  I say to my colleagues who have laws and citizenry who probably want \nthe laws not drawn as tightly as my State, if you open up this door, \none day you will regret it. Because if you say that the Federal \nGovernment should decide what law governs, you are taking away States' \nright to govern themselves.\n  In the 1990s, after the passage of the Brady Act, the National Rifle \nAssociation funded multiple legal challenges to it, citing the 10th \namendment, that the right to bear arms therefore resided in the States. \nIndeed, Mary Sue Falkner, who was then a spokesman for the NRA, said at \nthe time:\n\n       This is not a case about firearms per se, but about whether \n     the Federal Government can force States and local governments \n     against their will to carry out Federal mandates.\n\n  Similarly, in reference to Brady, the NRA's chief lobbyist said that \nthe Federal Government was getting too much involved in State affairs.\n  The gun lobby's rallying cry has always been, ``Let each State \ndecide.'' But with this amendment, again, a 180-degree flip.\n  Clearly, large urban areas merit a different standard than rural \nareas. To gut the ability of local police and sheriffs to determine who \nshould be able to carry a concealed weapon makes no sense. It is wrong \nto take away any State's rights to make decisions about what can make a \nresident safer. A one-size-fits-all approach to community safety leads \nus down a very precarious road.\n  Make no mistake, this is a serious amendment. It is, even though not \nthe intention of the author, a dangerous amendment. There will be \nneedless suffering, injuries, and deaths if this amendment is agreed \nto.\n  I talked to my colleague Senator Thune. We are friends. We saw each \nother in the gym this morning. He said to me: What about truckdrivers \nwho have the gun in the cab of their truck and ride across State lines? \nI am sympathetic to that. I supported laws that allow police officers \nin New York to carry their gun when they cross over into New Jersey to \nshop or whatever. But you do not need this law to deal with that \nproblem, because it creates so many other issues. There are ways we can \ndeal with the problem that the Senator from South Dakota brought up\n\n[[Page S7754]]\n\nto me in the gym this morning, without decimating State laws that \nprotect individual safety.\n  Make no mistake about it, this amendment would affect every State in \nthe country, but I do not see the Governors on board. It would affect \nevery city in the country. I don't see the mayors on board. It would \naffect every county in the country, but I don't see the sheriffs on \nboard. It would affect every town in the country, but I don't see \npolice chiefs on board.\n  Before we rush to judgment, shouldn't we ask our Governors, our \nmayors, our sheriffs, our police chiefs if this will make our \ncommunities safer or less safe? If this will put the men and women, the \nbrave men and women who defend us and protect us on police forces, in \njeopardy? Why don't we seek their guidance?\n  I urge my colleagues to give thoughtful and careful consideration to \nthe consequences of the Thune amendment. I believe if they do, they \nwill vote against it tomorrow at noon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we meet here today we are discussing \nthe Defense authorization bill. We debate it each year. It is basically \nan authorization for the expenditure of funds in defense of America. It \nis a significant bill with a lot of different parts. I commend the \nSenators who have brought this to the floor, Senator Carl Levin, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, and his Republican \ncounterpart, Senator John McCain.\n  I know this bill is important and I know we will be returning to \nsubstantive amendments on this bill very shortly. But while we have \nthis break in the action, I want to address another issue which is \nbeing debated in almost every corridor on Capitol Hill, and that is the \nissue of health care reform. It is an interesting issue and an amazing \nchallenge to this Congress, to try to grapple with the health care \nsystem in the most prosperous Nation on Earth.\n  Despite our prosperity, we know there is something fundamentally \nflawed with our health care system. We spend more than twice as much \nper person in America on health care as any other country, and the \nresults do not show that money is being well spent. Many other \ncountries, spending a fraction of what the United States spends, end up \nwith very different and much better results in terms of survival from \ncertain diseases and illness, and mortality rates. There is something \nto be learned here about how we can be more effective in providing \nhealth care for our citizens and not break the bank.\n  Most Americans know what I am talking about when I talk about cost, \nbecause they are facing cost issues every day. They know health \ninsurance premiums in America in the last several years have gone up \nthree times faster than the incomes and wages of Americans. We have \nlearned it is not unusual for one-fourth of Americans to spend 1 out of \nevery $10 in income for health insurance. Some, a smaller group but a \nsignificant group, spend up to $1 out of every $4 in income on health \ninsurance. The number keeps going through the roof with no end in \nsight. It worries us, not just as individuals and members of families, \nbut businesses that are trying to do the right thing for their \nemployees and be competitive.\n  It worries units of government because, whether it is your State \ngovernment providing assistance for Medicaid or whether it is the \nFederal Government concerned about Medicare and Medicaid, the costs of \nhealth care are growing so quickly that they could easily put us into a \nperpetual debt situation, something we do not want to see, something we \ncannot leave to our children.\n  Now we are debating in the House and in the Senate, in a variety of \ndifferent committees, how to change this health care system. Needless \nto say, it is a contentious debate. There are a lot of different points \nof view. There are some people and companies in America that want no \nchange in our health care system. Most people do. Some don't. Many of \nthose who are resisting change, who are unwilling to support the \nPresident's efforts to move us in this direction, are the very same \ncompanies and people who are profiting from the current system.\n  Make no mistake, when you spend billions of dollars on a system, much \nmore than any other country, you are going to end up in a situation \nwhere many people are profiting handsomely from the current system. \nWhen you talk about reform--reducing the cost, reducing the payments, \nbeing more cost effective--these people see money going out the window, \nand they are going to fight it.\n  That is what the battle is all about. We have been through it before, \nand now we have returned to it. But in addition to cost, there is also \nthe issue of the availability of health insurance. This morning's \nChicago Tribune, on the front page, told the story of a man who sadly \nis one of the victims of this situation. He lives in a suburb of \nChicago, and he works as a doorman at one of the buildings. He had a \nbad back. He finally was told--he tried a lot of conservative \ntreatment; it just did not work--you are going to have to have back \nsurgery.\n  So he did what he was supposed to do. He went to his insurance \ncompany and said: The doctor is recommending a surgery, and I want to \nknow if it will be covered by my health insurance. Well, the health \ninsurance company sent back to him written confirmation that the costs \nof the surgery would be covered by his health insurance. So he went \nthrough with the surgery and ended up incurring $148,000 in medical \nbills.\n  I think you know how this story ends. They turned in the bills to the \ninsurance company, and they denied them. They said: We did not really \napprove this surgery. You should have taken a more conservative \napproach to it.\n  Well, he thought he had done everything he was supposed to. What \nfollowed was a battle with this insurance company, day after day, month \nafter month, while people were saying: Send us the $148,000. This man \nof limited means was fighting to finally get this health insurance \ncompany to pay what they promised to pay. It took him months.\n  When it was all over, Mr. Napientek, Michael Napientek, ended up with \ncoverage. Had he failed to get the coverage for that surgery, it would \nhave wiped out his entire life's savings. That is the reality of health \ncare. That is the situation too many people find themselves in, so \nvulnerable in a situation where one medical bill denied by an insurance \ncompany bureaucrat can literally wipe out their life's savings.\n  We can do better. We have to do better. That is what this debate is \nall about. First, we have to reduce the cost of health care for \nfamilies and businesses and governments across America. There are ways \nto do that. We can lower costs to make sure every American has access \nto insurance. We can make it clear that no one can be turned down for \ninsurance coverage because of a preexisting condition. We can make \ncertain there is no discrimination in the premiums that are charged \nindividual Americans because one is a male and another female; one is a \ncertain age and another not. We can make certain there is more fairness \nin the way people are treated by these health insurance companies.\n  This idea of denying coverage for preexisting conditions, imagine how \nfrustrating that must be to realize that if you turned in a claim this \nyear on your health insurance because you had a bad back, and you went \nto the doctor next year, when it came time for surgery they would not \ncover it.\n  This happened to a friend of mine, a fellow I grew up with in East \nSt. Louis, IL, in the trucking business. He not only owned the \nbusiness, he drove the trucks. When he reached 60 years of age, his \nback was killing him. Well, at that point his company had lost its \nhealth insurance. Why? Because the wife of one of the employees had a \nsick baby. Her sick baby incurred a lot of medical bills, and the cost \nof health insurance went through the roof. They\n\n[[Page S7755]]\n\nhad to cancel the company's health insurance, give the employees some \nmoney, and say: Fend for yourself.\n  He was in the same boat. He went out to get private health insurance, \ncomplained about a bad back. The following year when the doctor said he \nneeded back surgery, he turned in a claim to his health insurance \ncompany, and they said: No, it is a preexisting condition. We will not \ncover your back surgery.\n  Do you know what he had to do? He ended up filing a worker's \ncompensation claim claiming that his back injuries had to do with \nbouncing around in a truck for 30 or 40 years, not an unreasonable \nconclusion. Do you know who he sued? He sued himself. He sued as an \nemployee of the company. He sued himself as owner of the company.\n  Is that crazy to reach that point? And he won, incidentally. They \nsaid it is subject to worker's compensation. We will pay for the \nsurgery.\n  He had done everything right, providing health insurance for his \nemployees until he could not afford it, trying to get private insurance \nfor himself at the age of 60, then turning in a claim and being turned \ndown. He could have been wiped out by that surgery, just as the man on \nthe front page of the Chicago Tribune.\n  We are all in this vulnerable situation because the health insurance \ncompanies have so much power over our lives. I listen to those on the \nother side of the aisle who come--not all of them but many--every \nsingle day and say we do not need to change this system. Who are they \ntalking to? Who are they listening to? They are not listening to people \nlike these who find out every day that they do not have coverage, that \nthe cost of insurance is too high, that their doctor is in a debate \nwith a clerk at an insurance company over whether they are going to get \nthe necessary and proper treatment for a medical condition. That is the \nreality.\n  There are many ways to address this, and we should. We have to \naddress it by making sure everyone has access to health insurance \nregardless of preexisting conditions, health status for a medical \ncondition. We have to get rid of the so-called lifetime caps.\n  Imagine that a diagnosis tomorrow that you or someone you love in \nyour family has a chronic condition that is going to call for medical \ntreatment for a long period of time, and then you realize there will \ncome a moment when that health insurance company would say: We are out \nof here. You just broke the bank. You hit the cap on your policy.\n  We have to put an end to that. We also have to limit the out-of-\npocket expenses individuals have to pay. There comes a point where \npeople cannot afford this expense. We have to require equal treatment \nfor men and women--Black, White, and brown, young and old, whether they \nlive in a rural area or in a city.\n  We have to make sure if a health insurance policy in America is \noffered, it is a good policy that covers the basic needs. There are \npolicies that do not. They sell health insurance you can afford, and \nguess what. It is worthless. That is not good for America and it is not \ngood for our families.\n  There are ways to lower costs. We ought to be pushing for prevention. \nWe ought to be trying to find ways to keep people well, incentives for \nthe right conduct and healthy outcomes. Right now there is not much of \na reward or an incentive for wellness. We also have to give support to \nsmall businesses. When we look at the insured in America, most of them \nare small business employees and their children. The poorest people in \nAmerica are covered by Medicaid, the government health insurance, as \nthey should be.\n  Folks are fortunate, like myself, under the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program, and most others who have health insurance policies, \nto have coverage. But the folks in the middle who get up and go to work \nevery day for the small businesses of America--and their kids--are the \nones who do not have coverage. We can do better.\n  One of the proposals before us in Congress is to make sure small \nbusinesses can start getting into pools where they can use that pooling \npower to reach out and have health insurance coverage that is \naffordable. That is within our reach.\n  Senator Reed is on the Senate floor today. He and I were fortunate \nenough to be at lunch today when our colleague from Connecticut, Chris \nDodd, got up and spoke about what had happened in the HELP Committee, \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, in preparing a \nbill on health care reform. There were 800 amendments filed. They met \nfor 61 days. Some 400 amendments were considered and voted on. Over 100 \nof those were from the Republican side of the aisle. They were trying \ntheir best to create a bipartisan compromise to get through the bill.\n  But Senator Dodd came up and talked about this, not in terms of a \nspecific bill and its provisions; he talked about the historic \nopportunity we have. He said for many of us, for most of us now serving \nin the Senate, this may be the only time in our political careers when \nwe can change the health care system for the better; when we can make \nsure that people in America have a better chance to be able to afford \nthe cost of health care.\n\n  He certainly inspired us when he pulled out this magazine and showed \nus a picture of our colleague, Senator Teddy Kennedy, on the cover of \nNewsweek, and the quote from Ted Kennedy that says: ``We're almost \nthere.''\n  There is a long essay in here about Ted Kennedy's terrific public \ncareer and how much of it has been spent on this issue of health care; \nwhat it meant to him personally when his son was diagnosed with bone \ncancer and had to have his leg amputated; what he went through in a \nplane crash; when he has seen others and what they have gone through.\n  Teddy Kennedy reminds us that these opportunities do not come around \nvery often. There is lots we can debate and argue about, but at the end \nof the day the American people want to see the debate end. They want to \nsee us acting together responsibly for health care that is centered on \npatients; to make sure they have a health insurance policy they like, \nthat they can keep; to make certain they have a good strong \nconfidential relationship with their doctors for themselves and their \nfamilies; to make sure, as well, they are not excluded from coverage \nfor preexisting conditions; to make sure that health insurance is going \nto be affordable; and to make sure it covers all Americans.\n  We can do it. We are a great and prosperous nation. We have a \nPresident who is committed to it. And working with him on a bipartisan \nbasis we can get this done. We can work with the health care \nprofessionals--the doctors, the nurses, those leading hospitals--who \ncan show us the way to reduce the cost of care without reducing its \nquality.\n  This is our chance. For those who are saying no, that they want the \nstatus quo, they do not want to change it, only a small percentage of \nAmericans agree with them. Most Americans agree what I have talked \nabout today needs to be done. We have to overcome those voices of \nnegativity and doubt who continue to come to the Senate floor, those \nwho create fear of change.\n  Let me tell you, this is a great, strong country that tackles big \nproblems. We have never been assigned a bigger assignment than this \none, health care for America. It touches all 300 million of us. We have \nto make sure it is done fairly, done effectively, and done quickly. If \nwe let this drag out for months beyond this year, it is going to be \nharder and harder for us to reach our goal.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work toward \nthat goal, make certain that President Obama's leadership is rewarded \nwith health care reform that does make a difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1501\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment that I \nam cosponsoring with my friend and fellow cochair of the Senate \nNational Guard Caucus, Senator Leahy. We will be introducing a \nbipartisan amendment to strengthen one of our Nation's most important \nmilitary and civilian resources, the National Guard.\n  The National Guard, as I think everybody in this body knows, has a \nlong and proud history of contributing to America's military operations \nabroad while providing vital support and security to civil authorities \nat home.\n  Since September 11, 2001, our citizen soldiers and airmen have taken \non\n\n[[Page S7756]]\n\ngreater responsibilities and risk, from fighting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan to providing critical disaster assistance in the United \nStates.\n  Now we see the tremendous value of the National Guard forces every \ntime we look as they confront terrorists, provide critical support in \nunique areas such as Afghanistan where the agribusiness development \nteams are working to help provide agricultural know-how and better \nincome to the farmers of Afghanistan, to areas where they provide \nwater, food, and health supplies to victims of natural disasters.\n  Furthermore, the Guard is a tremendous value for the capability it \nprovides our Nation. It provides 40 percent of the total military force \nfor around 4.5 percent of the budget. In other words, the Guard \nprovides tremendous bang for the buck.\n  There is no doubt today we are asking more from the men and women of \nthe National Guard than ever before, often at great cost to their \nfamilies and their own lives.\n  I think this means we have a heavy responsibility to support our \ncitizen soldiers and airmen in their unique dual mission of developing \nmilitary support abroad and providing homeland defense stateside.\n  While serving abroad, National Guard troops serve under Air Force and \nArmy Commands in what is known as title 10 status, which refers to the \nsection in the U.S. Code dealing with the military. But when the Guard \noperates at home, they serve under the command and control of the \nNation's Governors in title 32 status.\n  I had the honor of serving as commander in chief of the Missouri \nNational Guard for 8 years. I can tell you that Missouri has a wide \nrange of natural and sometimes human disasters ranging from tornadoes \nand floods to blizzards and ice storms. I called out the Guard for \nevery single one of those and several more I probably cannot even \nremember: threatened prison insurrections, other civil disobedience, to \ntracking down escapees from prison. Right after Katrina--I think it was \nabout a year after Katrina--I visited Jefferson Barracks, MO, where one \nof our National Guard engineer units is stationed.\n  They told me proudly that when Katrina hit, they immediately sent one \nof their National Guard battalions to Katrina. They had all the \nequipment, the high-wheeled vehicles, the communications equipment. \nThey did such a wonderful job, the adjutant general of Louisiana called \nand said: You have two more battalions; send us another one. They said: \nThat is where the problem comes in. We only have equipment for one out \nof three battalions. The Guard was one-third resourced. We could have \nsent them down there in tennis shoes and a taxicab, but they needed the \nequipment that an engineer battalion has to deal with the problems of \nthe aftermath of the floods and the hurricane. I think there is a lot \nmore we can do to make this unique arrangement work more smoothly. The \nGuard will continue to play a critical role in response to another \nnatural disaster or, heaven forbid, terrorist attack. To the men and \nwomen of the National Guard, we say: Thank you for that support.\n  But more needs to be done. The amendment we are introducing today to \nstrengthen the Guard consists of two planks which are designed, first, \nto increase the Guard's voice inside the Pentagon and, second, to \nclarify how the Federal military support to civil authorities will \noccur here at home.\n  We would give the Chief of the National Guard more muscle in the \nPentagon, providing a seat for him on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. With \n40 percent of the force, one would think that big a portion of our \ntotal military capability would deserve to sit with the outstanding \nleaders of the Army, the Air Force, the Marines, and others who are \nthere. One would think this large a segment of our force would be \nrepresented. When we have big decisions on the future of our resource \nallocation for the military--title X and, in this case, also title \nXXXII--they ought to be at the table.\n  Last year--I thank my colleagues--we successfully authorized the \npromotion of the Chief of the National Guard to the rank of four-star \ngeneral in last year's empowerment legislation. Additionally, this \nyear's empowerment amendment will make certain that the Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau has a Vice Chief in the grade of lieutenant \ngeneral. When you are dealing with that many problems, there is a major \noperation that needs to be handled by a deputy to the four-star Chief \nof the National Guard. It is critical to the day-to-day operations of \nthe National Guard Bureau and to ensure the Guard is adequately \nrepresented inside the Pentagon.\n  This amendment will also fill the gaps between civilian and military \nemergency response capabilities. We would give the National Guard \nBureau, in consultation with the States' adjutant generals, budgetary \npower to identify, validate, and procure equipment essential to their \nunique domestic missions so they will be better prepared to respond to \nemergencies here at home. The next time they call for a second engineer \nbattalion, I hope we have the equipment to send one to whatever State \nor maybe our own State where they are needed.\n  The amendment also supports the designation of National Guard general \nofficers as commanders of Army North and Air Force North commands. This \nwill ensure unity of effort and of command between the National Guard \nin the 54 States and territories and the very important U.S. North \ncommand which protects the United States in the continental United \nStates.\n  Finally, our amendment gives State Governors tactical control of \nFederal troops responding to emergencies inside their State or \nterritory. Time and time again, we have seen Reserve units stationed \nwithin close proximity to a natural or manmade disaster forced to stand \nby and watch when they could have been assisting injured victims in \npreventing loss of property. This amendment ensures that all available \nmilitary forces be utilized as early as possible in an emergency \nsituation. This way, our State leaders can act more quickly and \ndecisively to mitigate disasters at home. Our citizen soldiers stand \nready to defend the Nation, secure our homeland from natural disasters \nand terrorist attacks, and are now fighting overseas in the war on \nterror. Neither the homeland response nor the Federal military support \nmissions of the Guard are likely to diminish in importance at any time \nin the foreseeable future. In fact, the need for the National Guard is \ngreater now than ever before. Now more than ever, as budgets are \nconstrained and entitlements continue to grow at alarming rates, we \nshould not be looking to reduce the Guard but, rather, fully to man and \nequip it.\n  We have a responsibility to give the Guard the equipment, resources, \nand bureaucratic muscle they need to meet their critical dual mission. \nIn order to do so, it is imperative we strengthen the decisionmaking \ncapability of Guard leaders within the Department of Defense and make \nsure they are at the table.\n  As one former leader of the Guard said: If you want us in on the big \nplays, at least let us in the huddle when you are planning to call \nthose plays. That is what this amendment does.\n  I thank my colleagues for their past support of the Guard. I join \nwith Senator Leahy in asking for continued support of the National \nGuard by voting for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1597\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending Thune amendment and call up my amendment No. 1597.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback], for himself, Mr. \n     Bayh, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1597.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of \n State should redesignate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XII, add the following:\n\n[[Page S7757]]\n\n     SEC. 1232. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REDESIGNATION OF NORTH \n                   KOREA AS A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On October 11, 2008, the Department of State removed \n     North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, on \n     which it had been placed in 1988.\n       (2) North Korea was removed from that list despite its \n     refusal to account fully for its abduction of foreign \n     citizens, proliferation of nuclear and other dangerous \n     technologies and weapon systems to terrorist groups and other \n     state sponsors of terrorism, or its commission of other past \n     acts of terrorism.\n       (3) On March 17, 2009, American journalists Euna Lee and \n     Laura Ling were seized near the Chinese-North Korean border \n     by agents of the North Korean government and were \n     subsequently sentenced to 12 years of hard labor in a prison \n     camp in North Korea.\n       (4) On April 5, 2009, the Government of North Korea tested \n     a long-range ballistic missile in violation of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions 1695 and 1718.\n       (5) On April 15, 2009, the Government of North Korea \n     announced it was expelling international inspectors from, and \n     recommissioning, its Yongbyon nuclear facility and ending its \n     participation in disarmament talks.\n       (6) Those actions were in violation of the June 26, 2008, \n     announcement by the President of the United States that the \n     removal of North Korea from the list of state sponsors of \n     terrorism was dependent on the Government of North Korea \n     agreeing to a system to verify its declarations with respect \n     to its nuclear programs.\n       (7) On May 25, 2009, the Government of North Korea \n     conducted a second illegal nuclear test, in addition to \n     conducting tests of its ballistic missile systems launched in \n     the direction of the western United States.\n       (8) North Korea has failed to acknowledge or account for \n     its role in building and supplying the secret nuclear \n     facility at Al Kibar, Syria, has failed to account for all \n     remaining citizens of Japan abducted by North Korea, and, \n     according to recent reports, continues to engage in close \n     cooperation with the terrorist Iranian Revolutionary Guard \n     Corps on ballistic missile technology.\n       (9) There have been recent credible reports that North \n     Korea has provided support to the terrorist group Hezbollah, \n     including by providing ballistic missile components and \n     personnel to train members of Hezbollah with respect to the \n     development of extensive underground military facilities in \n     southern Lebanon, including tunnels and bunkers.\n       (10) The 2005 and 2006 Country Reports on Terrorism of the \n     Department of State state, with respect to Cuba, Iran, North \n     Korea, and Syria, ``Most worrisome is that some of these \n     countries also have the capability to manufacture WMD and \n     other destabilizing technologies that can get into the hands \n     of terrorists. The United States will continue to insist that \n     these countries end the support they give to terrorist \n     groups.''.\n       (11) President Barack Obama stated that actions of the \n     Government of North Korea ``are a matter of grave concern to \n     all nations. North Korea's attempts to develop nuclear \n     weapons, as well as its ballistic missile program, constitute \n     a threat to international peace and security. By acting in \n     blatant defiance of the United Nations Security Council, \n     North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the \n     international community. North Korea's behavior increases \n     tensions and undermines stability in Northeast Asia. Such \n     provocations will only serve to deepen North Korea's \n     isolation. It will not find international acceptance unless \n     it abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and \n     their means of delivery.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Secretary of State should designate North Korea as a \n     country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism for purposes of--\n       (1) section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 \n     (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)) (as continued in effect pursuant to \n     the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. \n     1701 et seq.));\n       (2) section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. \n     2780); and\n       (3) section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2371).\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan amendment put \nforward by Senator Bayh and myself. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Kyl and Inhofe be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This is a bipartisan resolution and sense of the \nSenate that the administration should relist North Korea as a state \nsponsor of terrorism. As my colleagues know, the Bush administration, \nthrough a great deal of hoopla, listed North Korea as a state sponsor \nof terrorism. They took them off the list in spite of such terrible and \nerratic behavior as nuclear weapons, missile technology, and now taking \nU.S. citizens hostage and holding them. Nonetheless, the Bush \nadministration, as part of the six-party talks, did an agreement, a \ndeal to delist them as a state sponsor of terrorism. All that got us \nwas more nuclear weapons, more missiles being sent off, more \nprovocative action by the North Koreans, and a dismal situation.\n  What we are asking with the amendment is that it is a sense of the \nSenate that North Korea should be relisted as a state sponsor of \nterrorism.\n  In that regard, I wish to enter a few items in the Record to be \nprinted at the end of my presentation that are currently in the news. \nThis is yesterday's front page of the Washington Post where it talks \nabout ``[North] Korea's Hard-Labor Camps: On the Diplomatic Back \nBurner.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this full article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is an old story. Unfortunately, we know very well \nabout the gulags that exist in North Korea and the 200,000 people we \nbelieve are in those. Here is today's Washington Post. This was new \ninformation I found shocking: North Korea building mysterious military \nties with the military junta in Burma now taking place and the \npossibility of them giving military equipment and supplies, I suppose \npossibly even nuclear arms and missile technology, to the military \ngovernment in Burma.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record at the end \nof my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If that is not enough to relist them as a state \nsponsor of terrorism, I don't know what is. But there is a full record \nwe can go forward with on relisting North Korea as a state sponsor of \nterrorism. At the outset, I think we ought to look at this and say this \nis an extremely tough situation for the United States. It is one on \nwhich we need to take aggressive action to confront them on what they \nare doing to militarize some of the worst places and worst actors \naround the world and what North Korea is doing to threaten interests of \nthe United States.\n  All this is taking place while Kim Jong Il is ill. To what degree, we \ndon't know for sure. A succession is being discussed. Of what nature, \nwe are not sure. But clearly North Korea is doing the most provocative \nthings they have probably done in the history of that provocative \nnation. It is taking place right now. We should notice it and recognize \nthese are terrorist actions. We should clearly call for them to be \nrelisted.\n  I have, many times, spoken before regarding the long and outrageous \nlist of crimes of the Kim regime. I will not go through those again at \ngreat length. But I will say the crimes committed by the North Korean \nregime include not only those external and diplomatic of nature--\nviolating agreements, treaties, conventions, and proliferating \ndangerous technologies to the world's worst actors--but the regime has \nalso committed massive and unspeakable crimes against the North Korean \npeople themselves who for decades have been beaten, tortured, raped, \ntrafficked, starved, used as medical experiments, subjected to \ncollective familial punishment, and executed in the most brutal and \npainful ways. If you want further details on that, read yesterday's \nWashington Post article.\n  Hundreds of thousands languish in the gulag and concentration camps \nspread out over the entire country. All the while, the world watches \nand wrings its collective hands. As we pledged never again, we watch as \nyet again another criminal regime commits a genocide. Never again \nbecomes yet again.\n  I have introduced legislation to address these issues. I hope the \nForeign Relations Committee can find time to take it up.\n  The amendment before us today deals with another aspect of the North \nKorean criminal state, its longstanding and robust sponsorship of \ninternational terrorism. The amendment would place the Senate on record \nas standing for the proposition that North Korea's hostile and \nprovocative actions will not be ignored. Indeed, they will have \nmeaningful consequences under the law. This amendment, of which Senator \nBayh is the lead cosponsor, expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nSecretary of State should redesignate North Korea as a state sponsor of \nterrorism based on its nuclear and missile\n\n[[Page S7758]]\n\nproliferation, abductions, and material support for terrorist groups.\n  On October 11, 2008, the State Department removed North Korea from \nthe list of state sponsors of terrorism on which it had been placed \nsince 1988. At the time, this is what President Bush said to the North \nKorean regime upon announcing that North Korea would be removed. He \nsaid:\n\n       We will trust you only to the extent that you fulfill your \n     promises. If North Korea makes the wrong choices, the United \n     States will act accordingly.\n\n  They have made the wrong choices. We should act accordingly.\n  At the same time, then Candidate Obama said:\n\n       Sanctions are a critical part of our leverage to pressure \n     North Korea to act. They should only be lifted based on North \n     Korean performance. If the North Koreans do not meet their \n     obligations, we should move quickly to reimpose sanctions \n     that have been waived and consider new restrictions going \n     forward.\n\n  They have not lived up to their obligations. They have continued \nprovocative actions. They should be relisted.\n  Let's examine how well the North Korean regime has lived up to its \ncommitment since being removed from the list. Since removal last \nOctober, the North Korean regime has done the following: launched a \nmultistage ballistic missile over Japan in violation of U.N. Security \nCouncil sanctions; kidnapped and imprisoned two American journalists \nand sentenced them to 12 years of hard labor in a North Korean prison \ncamp; pulled out of the six-party talks vowing never to return; kicked \nout international nuclear inspectors and American monitors; restarted \nits nuclear facilities; renounced the 50-year armistice with South \nKorea; detonated a second illegal nuclear weapon; launched additional \nshort-range missiles; is preparing to launch long-range missiles \ncapable of reaching the United States; and today news accounts are \nreporting about North Korean proliferation to the Burmese junta, \nincluding perhaps nuclear proliferation.\n  Add to this a long history of other ongoing illicit operations that \nfinance the North Korean regime's budget, including the following: \nextensive drug smuggling; massive and complex operations to counterfeit \nU.S. currency, many of which are believed to be in wide circulation; \nmoney laundering; terrorist threats by the regime against the United \nStates, Japanese, and South Korean civilians. That is what this regime \nand group has done and is doing. That is some of what they have done \nsince they were delisted from the terrorist list.\n  What have we done in response? The U.N. Security Council has passed \nanother sanctions resolution similar to the same resolution North Korea \nhas brazenly violated to get us to this point. In 2006, the State \nDepartment, in its terrorism report, said this about keeping North \nKorea on the list: North Korea ``continued to maintain their ties to \nterrorist groups.''\n  They said:\n\n       Most worrisome is that some of these countries [including \n     North Korea] also have the capability to manufacture [weapons \n     of mass destruction] and other destabilizing technologies \n     that can get into the hands of terrorists.\n\n  If that was the justification for the terror list in 2006, certainly \nNorth Korea's actions today fit that standard--perhaps even more so \nthan back then, and I believe it is more so.\n  We cannot have it both ways. If we removed North Korea from the \nterrorism list last year as a reward for its dubious cooperation on \nnuclear weapons, we would only be reversing that step by adding it back \nafter the regime betrayed its commitments and followed up with hostile \nand provocative actions.\n  I would also like to address this issue: It often has been raised \nwith me--and the Secretary of State herself has raised this indirectly \nwith me--that the multiple statutes that control the list of state \nsponsors of terrorism do not provide the legal ability for the \nSecretary of State to redesignate. I think this argument is flawed, and \nI would like to summarize that by reading the relevant portions of each \nof these acts, because here is the key point on it, that they are \nsaying: Well, we have to find factual basis that is different from the \nfirst round for us to do that. We are going through a legal review of \ndoing this. But here the state sponsor of terrorism list is controlled \nunder two different acts: the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign \nAssistance Act.\n  As to countries covered by the prohibition, it says this. This is \nquoting from the Arms Export Control Act:\n\n       The prohibitions contained in this section apply with \n     respect to a country if the Secretary of State determines \n     that the government of that country has repeatedly provided \n     support for acts of international terrorism.\n\n  That is what it says in the Arms Export Control Act. The list I have \njust read goes through what has taken place, and they are clearly and \nrepeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism. It \ndoes not say anything about they cannot be relisted or we have to go \nthrough some elaborate finding process, that it cannot be based on \nactions they have done. These are the actions they have done in the \nlast 6 months that are of public record. And it says the Secretary of \nState makes this determination and has fairly wide discretion to be \nable to do it.\n  Under section 628 of the Foreign Assistance Act, it says: The United \nStates shall not provide any assistance to any country if the Secretary \nof State determines that the government of that country has repeatedly \nprovided support for acts of international terrorism.\n  Again, the statute is very broad in its statement. It does not say \nanything about they cannot relist them. It says they can do this on the \ndiscretion of the Secretary of State.\n  I do not know why we need to wait any longer, with the actions this \ngovernment has taken and even with these most recent ones reported \ntoday of working with Burma or of the publicly done ones we know about \nof nuclear weapons detonation or the ones of missile technology being \nlaunched. Why do we need to wait longer?\n  I recognize this is a sense of the Senate, so it is just a sense of \nthis body. But this body has had a strong impact in prior actions when \nwe took a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to list the Revolutionary \nGuard in Iran, that we believed they should be listed as a state \nsponsor of terrorism. The administration acted not long after that to \nlist them as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n  I believe if this body took strong action here now and said we \nbelieve North Korea should be relisted as a state sponsor of terrorism, \nit would send a very strong and proper signal to the administration--\nnot that we are doing your job, but we believe this is the case and \nthis is something that is meritorious toward North Korea and its \nactions.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan Bayh-\nBrownback amendment and vote for this amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 20, 2009]\n\n       N. Korea's Hard-Labor Camps: On the Diplomatic Back Burner\n\n                           (By Blaine Harden)\n\n       Seoul.--Images and accounts of the North Korean gulag \n     become sharper, more harrowing and more accessible with each \n     passing year.\n       A distillation of testimony from survivors and former \n     guards, newly published by the Korean Bar Association, \n     details the daily lives of 200,000 political prisoners \n     estimated to be in the camps: Eating a diet of mostly corn \n     and salt, they lose their teeth, their gums turn black, their \n     bones weaken and, as they age, they hunch over at the waist. \n     Most work 12- to 15-hour days until they die of malnutrition-\n     related illnesses, usually around the age of 50. Allowed just \n     one set of clothes, they live and die in rags, without soap, \n     socks, underclothes or sanitary napkins.\n       The camps have never been visited by outsiders, so these \n     accounts cannot be independently verified. But high-\n     resolution satellite photographs, now accessible to anyone \n     with an Internet connection, reveal vast labor camps in the \n     mountains of North Korea. The photographs corroborate \n     survivors' stories, showing entrances to mines where former \n     prisoners said they worked as slaves, in-camp detention \n     centers where former guards said uncooperative prisoners were \n     tortured to death and parade grounds where former prisoners \n     said they were forced to watch executions. Guard towers and \n     electrified fences surround the camps, photographs show.\n       ``We have this system of slavery right under our nose,'' \n     said An Myeong Chul, a camp guard who defected to South \n     Korea. ``Human rights groups can't stop it. South Korea can't \n     stop it. The United States will have to take up this issue at \n     the negotiating table.''\n\n[[Page S7759]]\n\n       But the camps have not been discussed in meetings between \n     U.S. diplomats and North Korean officials. By exploding \n     nuclear bombs, launching missiles and cultivating a \n     reputation for hair-trigger belligerence, the government of \n     Kim Jong Il has created a permanent security flash point on \n     the Korean Peninsula--and effectively shoved the issue of \n     human rights off the negotiating table.\n       ``Talking to them about the camps is something that has not \n     been possible,'' said David Straub, a senior official in the \n     State Department's office of Korean affairs during the Bush \n     and Clinton years. There have been no such meetings since \n     President Obama took office.\n       ``They go nuts when you talk about it,'' said Straub, who \n     is now associate director of Korean studies at Stanford \n     University.\n       Nor have the camps become much of an issue for the American \n     public, even though annotated images of them can be quickly \n     called up on Google Earth and even though they have existed \n     for half a century, 12 times as long as the Nazi \n     concentration camps and twice as long as the Soviet Gulag. \n     Although precise numbers are impossible to obtain, Western \n     governments and human groups estimate that hundreds of \n     thousands of people have died in the North Korean camps.\n       North Korea officially says the camps do not exist. It \n     restricts movements of the few foreigners it allows into the \n     country and severely punishes those who sneak in. U.S. \n     reporters Laura Ling and Euna Lee were sentenced last month \n     to 12 years of hard labor, after being convicted in a closed \n     trial on charges of entering the country illegally.\n       North Korea's gulag also lacks the bright light of \n     celebrity attention. No high-profile, internationally \n     recognized figure has emerged to coax Americans into \n     understanding or investing emotionally in the issue, said \n     Suzanne Scholte, a Washington-based activist who brings camp \n     survivors to the United States for speeches and marches.\n       ``Tibetans have the Dalai Lama and Richard Gere, Burmese \n     have Aung San Suu Kyi, Darfurians have Mia Farrow and George \n     Clooney,'' she said. ``North Koreans have no one like that.''\n\n\n                         Executions as Lessons\n\n       Before guards shoot prisoners who have tried to escape, \n     they turn each execution into a teachable moment, according \n     to interviews with five North Koreans who said they have \n     witnessed such killings.\n       Prisoners older than 16 are required to attend, and they \n     are forced to stand as close as 15 feet to the condemned, \n     according to the interviews. A prison official usually gives \n     a lecture, explaining how the Dear Leader, as Kim Jong Il is \n     known, had offered a ``chance at redemption'' through hard \n     labor.\n       The condemned are hooded, and their mouths are stuffed with \n     pebbles. Three guards fire three times each, as onlookers see \n     blood spray and bodies crumple, those interviewed said.\n       ``We almost experience the executions ourselves,'' said \n     Jung Gwang Il, 47, adding that he witnessed two executions as \n     an inmate at Camp 15. After three years there, Jung said, he \n     was allowed to leave in 2003. He fled to China and now lives \n     in Seoul.\n       Like several former prisoners, Jung said the most arduous \n     part of his imprisonment was his pre-camp interrogation at \n     the hands of the Bowibu, the National Security Agency. After \n     eight years in a government office that handled trade with \n     China, a fellow worker accused him of being a South Korean \n     agent.\n       ``They wanted me to admit to being a spy,'' Jung said. \n     ``They knocked out my front teeth with a baseball bat. They \n     fractured my skull a couple of times. I was not a spy, but I \n     admitted to being a spy after nine months of torture.''\n       When he was arrested, Jung said, he weighed 167 pounds. \n     When his interrogation was finished, he said, he weighed 80 \n     pounds. ``When I finally got to the camp, I actually gained \n     weight,'' said Jung, who worked summers in cornfields and \n     spent winters in the mountains felling trees.\n       ``Most people die of malnutrition, accidents at work, and \n     during interrogation,'' said Jung, who has become a human \n     rights advocate in Seoul. ``It is people with perseverance \n     who survive. The ones who think about food all the time go \n     crazy. I worked hard, so guards selected me to be a leader in \n     my barracks. Then I didn't have to expend so much energy, and \n     I could get by on corn.''\n\n\n                          Defectors' Accounts\n\n       Human rights groups, lawyers committees and South Korean-\n     funded think tanks have detailed what goes on in the camps \n     based on in-depth interviews with survivors and former guards \n     who trickle out of North Korea into China and find their way \n     to South Korea.\n       The motives and credibility of North Korean defectors in \n     the South are not without question. They are desperate to \n     make a living. Many refuse to talk unless they are paid. \n     South Korean psychologists who debrief defectors describe \n     them as angry, distrustful and confused. But in hundreds of \n     separate interviews conducted over two decades, defectors \n     have told similar stories that paint a consistent portrait of \n     life, work, torment and death in the camps.\n       The number of camps has been consolidated from 14 to about \n     five large sites, according to former officials who worked in \n     the camps. Camp 22, near the Chinese border, is 31 miles long \n     and 25 miles wide, an area larger than the city of Los \n     Angeles. As many as 50,000 prisoners are held there, a former \n     guard said.\n       There is a broad consensus among researchers about how the \n     camps are run: Most North Koreans are sent there without any \n     judicial process. Many inmates die in the camps unaware of \n     the charges against them. Guilt by association is legal under \n     North Korean law, and up to three generations of a \n     wrongdoer's family are sometimes imprisoned, following a rule \n     from North Korea's founding dictator, Kim Il Sung: ``Enemies \n     of class, whoever they are, their seed must be eliminated \n     through three generations.''\n       Crimes that warrant punishment in political prison camps \n     include real or suspected opposition to the government. ``The \n     camp system in its entirety can be perceived as a massive and \n     elaborate system of persecution on political grounds,'' \n     writes human rights investigator David Hawk, who has studied \n     the camps extensively. Common criminals serve time elsewhere.\n       Prisoners are denied any contact with the outside world, \n     according to the Korean Bar Association's 2008 white paper on \n     human rights in North Korea. The report also found that \n     suicide is punished with longer prison terms for surviving \n     relatives; guards can beat, rape and kill prisoners with \n     impunity; when female prisoners become pregnant without \n     permission, their babies are killed.\n       Most of the political camps are ``complete control \n     districts,'' which means that inmates work there until death.\n       There is, however, a ``revolutionizing district'' at Camp \n     15, where prisoners can receive remedial indoctrination in \n     socialism. After several years, if they memorize the writings \n     of Kim Jong Il, they are released but remain monitored by \n     security officials.\n\n\n                       South's Changing Response\n\n       Since it offers a safe haven to defectors, South Korea is \n     home to scores of camp survivors. All of them have been \n     debriefed by the South Korean intelligence service, which \n     presumably knows more about the camps than any agency outside \n     of Pyongyang.\n       But for nearly a decade, despite revelations in scholarly \n     reports, TV documentaries and memoirs, South Korea avoided \n     public criticism of the North's gulag. It abstained from \n     voting on U.N. resolutions that criticized North Korea's \n     record on human rights and did not mention the camps during \n     leadership summits in 2000 or 2007. Meanwhile, under a \n     ``sunshine policy'' of peaceful engagement, South Korea made \n     major economic investments in the North and gave huge, \n     unconditional annual gifts of food and fertilizer.\n       The public, too, has been largely silent. ``South Koreans, \n     who publicly cherish the virtue of brotherly love, have been \n     inexplicably stuck in a deep quagmire of indifference,'' \n     according to the Korean Bar Association, which says it \n     publishes reports on human rights in North Korea to ``break \n     the stalemate.''\n       Government policy changed last year under President Lee \n     Myung-bak, who has halted unconditional aid, backed U.N. \n     resolutions that criticize the North and tried to put human \n     rights on the table in dealing with Pyongyang. In response, \n     North Korea has called Lee a ``traitor,'' squeezed inter-\n     Korean trade and threatened war.\n\n\n                           An Enforcer's View\n\n       An Myeong Chul was allowed to work as a guard and driver in \n     political prison camps because, he said, he came from a \n     trustworthy family. His father was a North Korean \n     intelligence agent, as were the parents of many of his fellow \n     guards.\n       In his training to work in the camps, An said, he was \n     ordered, under penalty of becoming a prisoner himself, never \n     to show pity. It was permissible, he said, for bored guards \n     to beat or kill prisoners.\n       ``We were taught to look at inmates as pigs,'' said An, 41, \n     adding that he worked in the camps for seven years before \n     escaping to China in 1994. He now works in a bank in Seoul.\n       The rules he enforced were simple. ``If you do not meet \n     your work quota, you do not eat much,'' he said. ``You are \n     not allowed to sleep until you finish your work. If you still \n     do not finish your work, you are sent to a little prison \n     inside the camp. After three months, you leave that prison \n     dead.''\n       An said the camps play a crucial role in the maintenance of \n     totalitarian rule. ``All high-ranking officials underneath \n     Kim Jong Il know that one misstep means you go to the camps, \n     along with your family,'' he said.\n       Partly to assuage his guilt, An has become an activist and \n     has been talking about the camps for more than a decade. He \n     was among the first to help investigators identify camp \n     buildings using satellite images. Still, he said, nothing \n     will change in camp operations without sustained diplomatic \n     pressure, especially from the United States.\n\n\n                       Inconsistent U.S. Approach\n\n       The U.S. government has been a fickle advocate.\n       In the Clinton years, high-level diplomatic contacts \n     between Washington and Pyongyang focused almost exclusively \n     on preventing the North from developing nuclear weapons and \n     expanding its ballistic missile capability.\n       President George W. Bush's administration took a radically \n     different approach. It famously labeled North Korea as part \n     of an ``axis of evil,'' along with Iran and Iraq. Bush met \n     with camp survivors. For five years, U.S. diplomats refused \n     to have direct negotiations with North Korea.\n       After North Korea detonated a nuclear device in 2006, the \n     Bush administration decided\n\n[[Page S7760]]\n\n     to talk. The negotiations, however, focused exclusively on \n     dismantling Pyongyang's expanded nuclear program.\n       In recent months, North Korea has reneged on its promise to \n     abandon nuclear weapons, kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors, \n     exploded a second nuclear device and created a major security \n     crisis in Northeast Asia.\n       Containing that crisis has monopolized the Obama \n     administration's dealings with North Korea. The camps, for \n     the time being, are a non-issue. ``Unfortunately, until we \n     get a handle on the security threat, we can't afford to deal \n     with human rights,'' said Peter Beck, a former executive \n     director of the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North \n     Korea.\n\n\n                        A Family's Tribulations\n\n       Kim Young Soon, once a dancer in Pyongyang, said she spent \n     eight years in Camp 15 during the 1970s. Under the guilt-by-\n     association rule, she said, her four children and her parents \n     were also sentenced to hard labor there.\n       At the camp, she said, her parents starved to death and her \n     eldest son drowned. Around the time of her arrest, her \n     husband was shot for trying to flee the country, as was her \n     youngest son after his release from the camp.\n       It was not until 1989, more than a decade after her \n     release, that she found out why she had been imprisoned. A \n     security official told her then that she was punished because \n     she had been a friend of Kim Jong Il's first wife and that \n     she would ``never be forgiven again'' if the state suspected \n     that she had gossiped about the Dear Leader.\n       She escaped to China in 2000 and now lives in Seoul. At 73, \n     she said she is furious that the outside world doesn't take \n     more interest in the camps. ``I had a friend who loved Kim \n     Jong Il, and for that the government killed my family,'' she \n     said. ``How can it be justified?''\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 21, 2009]\n\n     Clinton: U.S. Wary of Growing Burmese, North Korean Military \n                              Cooperation\n\n                           (By Glenn Kessler)\n\n       Bangkok, July 21--The Obama administration is increasingly \n     concerned that nuclear-armed North Korea is building \n     mysterious military ties with Burma, another opaque country \n     with a history of oppression, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton said Tuesday.\n       ``We know that there are also growing concerns about \n     military cooperation between North Korea and Burma, which we \n     take seriously'' Clinton told reporters after talks in the \n     Thai capital. ``It would be destabilizing for the region. It \n     would pose a direct threat to Burma's neighbors.''\n       U.S. officials traveling with Clinton, who is in Thailand \n     to attend a regional security forum, said the concerns about \n     Burma and North Korea extend to possible nuclear cooperation. \n     North Korea has a long history of illicit missile sales and \n     proliferation, including secretly helping to build a Syrian \n     nuclear reactor that was destroyed in 2007 by Israeli jets.\n       ``This is one of the areas we'd like to know about,'' said \n     one official. ``We have concerns, but our information is \n     incomplete.''\n       Burma, also known as Myanmar, is regarded as one of the \n     world's most oppressive nations, run by generals who have \n     enriched themselves while much of the country remains \n     desperately poor. North Korea is an equally grim country, \n     with vast prison camps and an ailing dictator, Kim Jong Il.\n       The evidence of growing Burmese-North Korean cooperation \n     since formal ties were restored in 2007 is extensive, but the \n     full extent of the military relationship is unclear.\n       The nuclear connection is even murkier, but intelligence \n     agencies have tracked suspicious procurement of high-\n     precision equipment from Europe, as well as the arrival in \n     Burma of North Korean officials associated with the company \n     connected to the Syria reactor, according to David Albright, \n     director of the Institute for Science and International \n     Security in Washington.\n       ``Something may be going on, but no one has any proof. It \n     is a mix of suspicions and concerns,'' Albright said, adding \n     that close examination of satellite imagery of suspected \n     nuclear sites has turned up no evidence. But he said that the \n     purchases of high-precision equipment were especially \n     troubling because the equipment did not make sense for use in \n     missiles and it was shipped to educational entities that had \n     connections to Burmese nuclear experts.\n       Japanese officials last month also arrested three people \n     for attempting to illegally export dual-use equipment to \n     Burma, via Malaysia, under the direction of a company \n     involved in the illicit procurement for North Korean military \n     programs.\n       Moreover, Albright said, European and U.S. intelligence \n     agencies have identified people associated with Namchongang \n     Trading Corp., a North Korean company also known as NCG, as \n     working in Burma. NCG reportedly provided the critical link \n     between Pyongyang and Damascus, acquiring key materials from \n     vendors in China and probably from Europe and secretly \n     transferring them to a desert construction site near the \n     Syrian town of Kibar.\n       The State Department last month cited NCG for being \n     ``involved in the purchase of aluminum tubes and other \n     equipment specifically suitable for a uranium enrichment \n     program since the late 1990s.''\n       U.S. officials have observed other troubling connections. \n     The U.S. Navy last month closely tracked Kang Nam 1, a rusty \n     North Korean freighter, after the government in Pyongyang \n     tested a nuclear weapon. Although U.S. officials were never \n     completely certain the ship was headed to Burma, the ship \n     returned to North Korea after the United States, China and \n     other countries put pressure on Burma to respect a United \n     Nations resolution barring most North Korean weapons exports.\n       Photographs that have emerged in recent weeks also show an \n     extensive series of 600 to 800 tunnel complexes and other \n     underground facilities built in Burma with North Korean \n     technical assistance near its new capital, Naypyidaw. North \n     Korean officials can be spotted in the photos, which were \n     taken between 2003 and 2006 and posted on the Web site of \n     YaleGlobal Online by journalist Bertil Lintner, an expert on \n     Burma.\n       Burma has uranium deposits, but as a signatory to the \n     nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it is required to allow \n     inspections of any nuclear facilities. Russia in 2007 agreed \n     to help build a 10-megawatt light-water reactor in Burma, but \n     little appears to have come of the project.\n       At the news conference, Clinton also strongly criticized \n     the Burmese government for its well-documented use of gang \n     rape as a military tactic, organized by Burmese officers, \n     against ethnic minorities. A new offensive against the Karen \n     ethnic group has sent more than 4,000 refugees fleeing across \n     the border into Thailand in recent weeks.\n       ``We are deeply concerned by reports of continuing human \n     rights abuses within Burma, particularly by actions that are \n     attributed to the Burmese military concerning the \n     mistreatment and abuse of young girls,'' Clinton said.\n       The Obama administration is conducting a review of its \n     Burma policy, which Clinton said has been placed on hold \n     while Washington awaits the outcome of the trial of Nobel \n     Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\n       ``We have made clear we expect fair treatment of Aung San \n     Suu Kyi, and we have condemned the way that she has been \n     treated by the regime in Burma, which we consider to be \n     baseless and totally unacceptable,'' Clinton said.\n       The National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi's party, won a \n     landslide electoral victory in 1990, but the military \n     leadership refused to accept it. Since then, she has been \n     under house arrest for most of the time, as have hundreds of \n     her supporters.\n       In May, just days before Suu Kyi's six-year term under \n     house arrest was due to expire, the government put her on \n     trial for an incident involving a U.S. citizen who swam \n     across Rangoon's Lake Inya to reach Suu Kyi's lakefront \n     bungalow and allegedly stayed there one or two nights.\n       Suu Kyi was taken to Rangoon's notorious Insein Prison on \n     charges of violating the terms of her detention by hosting a \n     foreigner, which could bring a three- to five-year prison \n     term, according to Burmese opposition officials. Suu Kyi, 63, \n     is said to be in poor health and has recently been treated \n     for dehydration and low blood pressure.\n       ``Our position is that we are willing to have a more \n     productive partnership with Burma if they take steps that are \n     self-evident,'' Clinton said. She called on Burmese \n     authorities to ``end the violence against their own people,'' \n     including ethnic minorities, ``end the mistreatment of Aung \n     San Suu Kyi'' and release political prisoners.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Kerry, is prepared to comment and speak. I ask \nunanimous consent that at the conclusion of his remarks, the Senator \nfrom Delaware be recognized as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, obviously North Korea's actions in recent \nweeks--months, really; testing a nuclear device on May 25 and launching \nballistic missiles on July 4--received the appropriate objection in \nmany different ways of China, Japan, South Korea, the United States, \nand many other countries. Clearly, those actions threaten to undermine \nthe peace and security of northeast Asia, and the U.S. response to \nthose actions ought to be and, I believe, is already resolute. China \nresponded very clearly. The sanctions have been toughened--individual \nsanctions for the first time. A number of steps were taken by both the \nUnited Nations and China. China, incidentally, has been unprecedented \nin the personalization of some of the sanctions that it has put into \nplace.\n  I know the Senator from Kansas cares, obviously, enormously about the \nunderlying issue here. But I have to say this amendment, while well \nintended, simply does not do what it is supposed to do. It has no \nimpact other than the sense of the Senate: sending a message which at \nthis particular moment, frankly, works counterproductively to other \nefforts that are underway.\n\n[[Page S7761]]\n\n  Right now, the Secretary of State is meeting at ASEAN. Right now, the \nvarious countries involved in this delicate process are working to \ndetermine how to proceed forward with respect to getting back to talks \nand defusing these tensions. For the Senate just to pop on an amendment \nlike this at this moment in time not only sends a signal that \ncomplicates that process, but I think it also, frankly, will make it \nmore difficult to secure the return of two American journalists, Laura \nLing and Euna Lee.\n  It simply is an inappropriate interference without a foundation, I \nmight add--without a foundation--in the law. Let me be very specific. \nWhen President Bush lifted the designation of terrorism--in fact, \nnothing that the Senator from Kansas has laid out here actually is \nsupported either by the intelligence or by the facts. I could go \nthrough his amendment with specificity. Let me give an example. This is \nfrom the findings in his amendment:\n\n       On March 17, 2009, American journalists . . . were seized \n     near the Chinese-North Korean border by agents. . . .\n\n  He is citing that as a rationale for putting them back on the list. \nWell, the fact is, the families themselves, as well as the two \njournalists--but the families--have acknowledged that they, in fact, \nwere arrested for illegally crossing the border. So that is \ninappropriate. But not only is it inappropriate to cite a fact that is \nnot a fact, but it is not a cause for putting somebody on the terrorism \nlist.\n  Nowhere do any of the actions cited here fit into the statutes that \napply to whether somebody is designated as appropriately being on the \nterrorism list. Let me be more specific about that. When President Bush \ntook them off the list, here is what they said. This is the President's \ncertification:\n\n       The current intelligence assessment satisfies the second \n     statutory requirement for rescission. Following a review of \n     all available information, we see no credible evidence at \n     this time of ongoing support by the DPRK for international \n     terrorism, and we assess that the current intelligence \n     assessment, including the most recent assessment published \n     May 21, 2008, provides a sufficient basis for certification \n     by the President to Congress that North Korea has not \n     provided any support for international terrorism during the \n     preceding 6-month period.\n\n  There is no intelligence showing to the contrary, as we come to the \nfloor here today, and it is inappropriate for the Senate simply to step \nin and assert to the contrary.\n  Moreover, the President said:\n\n       Our review of intelligence community assessments indicates \n     there is no credible or sustained reporting at this time that \n     supports allegations (including as cited in recent reports by \n     the Congressional Research Service) that the DPRK has \n     provided direct or witting support for Hezbollah, Tamil \n     Tigers, or the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Should we obtain \n     credible evidence of current DPRK support for international \n     terrorism at any time in the future, the Secretary could \n     again designate DPRK a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n  Well, we have not. It simply does not fit under the requirements.\n  We need to use the right tools. This amendment is flawed and I am \nconvinced could actually undermine what I know is going on right now in \nterms of efforts by a number of different parties to try to move this \nprocess forward. This is not the way a responsible Senate ought to go \nabout trying to deal with an issue with this kind of diplomatic \nconsequence.\n  The relisting, incidentally, has no practical effect in terms of \nanything it would do with respect to our current policy other than \nraise the issue with respect to the Senate at this moment but, as I \nsay, inappropriately with respect to the statutes it concerns.\n  President Bush actually preserved all the existing financial \nsanctions on North Korea at the time he lifted the terror designation, \nand he kept them all in place by using other provisions of law.\n  The fact is, this administration has, in fact, responded in order to \nput real costs on North Korea for its actions. We led the international \neffort at the United Nations Security Council, and we did enact \nsweeping new sanctions on North Korea, and by all accounts they are \nbiting.\n  The U.N. Security Council resolution 1874, passed unanimously, \nimposed the first ever comprehensive international arms embargo on \nNorth Korea. Those sanctions are now beginning to take effect. A North \nKorean ship suspected of carrying arms to Burma turned around after it \nwas denied bunkering services in Singapore, and the Government of Burma \nitself warned that the ship would be inspected on arrival to ensure \nthat it complied with the U.N. arms embargo. So that is real. That is \nhappening. Significantly, China has agreed to impose sanctions both on \nNorth Korean companies and individuals involved in nuclear and \nballistic missile proliferation.\n  So the sanctions that were recently imposed by the Obama \nadministration, in concert with the international community, are having \na real impact. So I think we ought to give them time to work. I do not \nthink we ought to come in here and change the dynamics that, as I say, \nI know are currently being worked on by the Secretary of State. As we \nare here in the Senate today, those meetings are taking place. It is \nbetter for the United States and the international community to focus \nour efforts on concrete steps rather than resort to a toothless and \nsymbolic gesture. This will have no impact ultimately because we are \nstill going to go down our course, but it can ripple the process which \nthe administration has chosen to pursue.\n  I might also point out, the President and Secretary of State have \nbeen closely communicating with allies and with partners in the region. \nThey are currently involved in discussions with China, Russia, South \nKorea, and Japan on this issue. Even as we debate the issue here, the \neffort at the ASEAN Forum is specifically geared to try to coordinate \nour approach with our treaty allies and with others. We ought to give \nthe administration the opportunity to succeed.\n  Third, obviously all of us reject the recent actions taken by North \nKorea. There is no doubt about that. But it was not so long ago that we \nwere actually making some progress on the denuclearization effort. And \nobservers of the region--those who are expert and who follow it \nclosely--are all in agreement as to the rationale which has driven \nNorth Korea to take some of the actions it has taken.\n  I was in China about a month and a half ago. I spent some time with \nChinese leaders on this issue because one of the tests took place while \nI was there and I saw the Chinese reaction up close and personal. I saw \nthe degree to which they were truly upset by it, disturbed by it, and \ntook actions to deal with it. The fact is that they explained it, as \nhave others, as a reaction by North Korea to perhaps three things: No. \n1, the succession issues in North Korea itself; No. 2, the policies of \nthe South Korean Government over the course of the last year or so; and \nNo. 3, the fact that while they had nuclear weapons and had been \nengaged in a denuclearization discussion with the United States, most \nof the focus appeared to have shifted to Iran, and there was some sense \nthat the focus should have remained where those nuclear weapons \ncurrently exist.\n\n  So I believe we need to preserve diplomatic flexibility in the weeks \nand months ahead. There is an appropriate time for the administration \nto come to us. There is an appropriate way for us to deal with this \nissue, to sit down with the administration, to make it clear to them \nthat we think we ought to do this, to talk with them about it, to \nengage in what the rationale might be under the law. But as I say, none \nof the reasons that are legitimate under the law for, in fact, a \ndesignated country as going on the terrorist list is appropriate or fit \nhere. I think that is the most critical reason of all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the floor \nmanager on the majority side for this unanimous consent which allows me \nto proceed now under morning business.\n  I wish to say a word or two about the Defense authorization bill \nwhich is before us, and then I want to pivot. I will talk about the \nhealth of our Nation's defense, but also about the health care of our \npeople.\n  Let me start off by extending my thanks to the leaders of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Levin and Senator McCain, and their staffs \nfor the good work they have done. I wish to thank Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland for his contributions as well. Standing here on the floor, I am \nlooking at Senator Reed, a graduate of the\n\n[[Page S7762]]\n\nMilitary Academy at West Point, and right across the aisle, at Senator \nMcCain, a graduate of the Naval Academy. It is great to have that kind \nof experience here in the Senate. They are sitting on opposite sides of \nthe aisle, coming from schools that are sometimes thought to be rivals, \nbut they are able to work together when we need them to.\n  I wish to express my thanks to the President and to the Secretary of \nDefense Bob Gates. We have learned that in the last 7 years, cost \noverruns from major weapons systems in this country grew from about $45 \nmillion in 2001 to last year almost $300 billion, a growth over 7 years \nin cost overruns for major weapons systems in 2001 of $45 million and \nlast year almost $300 billion. What we need is for the administration \nas well as the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs to say to the \nfolks on the Armed Services Committee, but also to say to us in the \nSenate and in the House: These are the weapons systems we need, these \nare the threats we believe we face as a nation, and to give us some \nsense of priorities of the weapons systems we should support and fund, \nthe troop levels we need and, frankly, the weapons systems we don't \nneed and the troop levels we don't need.\n  I was privileged to follow on the heels of the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Kaufman, about a month and a half ago to Afghanistan and \nPakistan. He and Senator Reed, I think, led that CODEL and shared with \nus our needs in that part of the world. We need a military strategy and \nwe also need a civilian strategy in Afghanistan, and I think this \nadministration has given us a good two-pronged approach. We have good \nnew leadership there on the military side. Basically, though, they said \nour job here is counterinsurgency. We need more troops, more trainers \nto train the Afghans and to train the military side, and then the \ncivilian side. We also need mobility in terms of a lot of additional \nhelicopters, about 150 new helicopters or additional ones coming in to \nprovide the mobility to move our men and women all over the southern \npart of Afghanistan, and to meet the Taliban threat.\n  The kind of weapon we don't use there or don't need there, I will be \nvery blunt, is the F-22 which we discussed and debated here for the \nlast several days, a fighter aircraft that has been around for a dozen \nor so years. We are still building more of them, but they have never \nflown a flight mission in Iraq and never flown a flight mission in \nAfghanistan either. The F-22 is limited in what it can do. It basically \nis a fighter, air-to-air combat. The Afghans, the Taliban, don't have \nfighter aircraft. In Iraq, the folks we are fighting there don't have \naircraft. Meanwhile, we have F-15s, F-16s, F-18s. We are going to build \n2,500 F-35s, for less than half the price of the F-22, which not only \ndo dog fights but can also do ground-to-air support and a variety of \ndifferent functions that the F-22 cannot for a lot less money. The \nadministration, I think wisely, said as hard as it is sometimes to stop \nthe production line on aircraft, in this case the F-22, in terms of \nwhat is cost effective, we need to refocus on the F-35 and on \ncounterinsurgency, preparing for those kinds of challenges we face. We \nvoted to do that, a 58-to-40 vote. I was very pleased with the vote and \nI commend everyone who voted as they did, and, frankly, the people who \ntook the opposite view. There were some tough issues to deal with, I \nknow particularly from folks in whose States the aircraft are being \nproduced and systems for those aircraft are being produced. I know it \nis difficult to accept. But I am encouraged by that vote.\n  My hope is we will pay heed to some of the priorities sent to us by \nthe Secretary of Defense, which are designed to make sure we spend \nmoney on weapons systems that we are likely to need in the 21st \ncentury--certainly in the next decade or two or three--and I think with \ntoday's vote, we are on a better path to do that.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Sort of pivoting, if I can, after having said a word about the health \nof our Nation's defense, let me talk about the health of the people in \nour country. Some of my colleagues are probably getting tired of \nhearing me say this, but when talking about health care, I mention four \nthings: No. 1, we spend more money for health care than any other \nnation on Earth. No. 2, we don't get better results. No. 3, we have \n14,000 people in this country today losing their health care. No. 4, \nsome 47 million Americans today don't have health insurance, don't have \nhealth care. We have to do better than this. We have to do better than \nthis. I believe we can.\n  There has been a big focus, as there should be, on extending health \ncare coverage to 47 million folks who don't have it, and we need to \naddress that, obviously. Having said that, the other concern we need to \naddress is reining in the growth of health care costs. We are getting \nclobbered as a nation in terms of being able to compete with the rest \nof the world where we pay so much more money for health care than any \nother nation, and employers pay, and we are getting clobbered as a \nFederal Government with the cost of Medicare and Medicaid, and State \ngovernments trying to bear their share of the cost of Medicaid. They \nsee enormous pressures on their State budgets.\n  Over lunch today, I said to my colleagues in our caucus meeting that \nwouldn't it be great if somehow we could have our cake and eat it too. \nI said that with a piece of chocolate cake staring me right in the \nface. But as it turned out, there are delivery systems, if you will, of \nhealth care in this country where they are not necessarily having their \ncake and eating it too, but where they are able to provide better \nhealth care, better outcomes, at a lower price. Think about that: \nbetter health care, better outcomes, better quality of health care at a \nlower price.\n\n  The names are beginning to become familiar to us. Some are already \nfamiliar: Mayo in Minnesota, and now they have an operation down in \nFlorida too to see if that model will work in Florida, and it has; \nKaiser Permanente in northern California, an outfit called \nIntermountain Health--all of these are nonprofits--Cleveland Clinic in \nCleveland, OH, an outfit called Geisinger in Hershey, PA; there is what \nis called a health care cooperative in the State of Washington, I \nbelieve it is around Puget Sound, called Puget Sound Cooperative where \nthey have been able to emulate this interesting result of better \nquality outcomes, better health care, lower prices.\n  What we need to do is to attempt not only to extend health care \ncoverage to folks who don't have it--47 million--but to rein in the \ngrowth of health care costs. The idea that health care costs grow at 2 \nor 3 or 4 percent over the consumer price index, to continue to do that \nis going to cripple us economically and competitively as a nation. It \nis going to cripple our ability to rein in our large and growing \ndeficits.\n  In the last 8 years in this Nation we ran up as much new debt as we \ndid in the first 208 years of our Nation's history. Think about that: \nIn the last 8 years, we ran up as much new debt in this country as we \ndid in our first 208 years as a nation. This year we are on track to \nhave the biggest single-year deficit we have ever had. We are also in \nthe worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and we are \ntrying to stimulate the economy and get it moving. I am encouraged that \nit is starting to move, but that is a huge deficit, coming on the heels \nof, frankly, 8 years where we spent like drunken sailors, and I know \nhow drunken sailors spend. It is not a pretty sight, and this is, \nfrankly, not a pretty sight either.\n  We need to go to school on the Mayos, the Geisingers, the Cleveland \nClinics, the Kaiser Permanentes, the Puget Sounds, the Intermountain \nHealths, and see what we can learn from them. What is their secret? How \nare they able to do this, better outcomes, less price?\n  As it turns out, there are a number of things they do in common. I \nwish to mention a few of them today. Among the things they do, they \nhave literally brought on to their staff the doctors at Cleveland \nClinic, for example, who provide health care. They are on staff at the \nCleveland Clinic. The same is true at Mayo and these other nonprofits.\n  I saw an interesting special on CNN a couple of weekends ago. They \nwere interviewing a number of people who worked at the Cleveland \nClinic. They interviewed a fellow who is a doctor, a cardiologist, as I \nrecall. He used to be in private practice. He said, in the old days \nwhen I was on my own in private practice or group practice, I got paid, \ncompensated, for the number of hearts I operated on. If somebody came \nto me\n\n[[Page S7763]]\n\nand they had a heart problem and it could be addressed by diet or \nexercise or medicine, he said, usually I didn't prescribe those things. \nI didn't get paid for doing that. If they needed to have a heart \noperation and we could address their problem with an operation, he \nsaid, I got paid for that. As a result, I was more inclined to operate \non people's hearts than to use some approaches that were arguably more \ncost effective. He went on to say, now I work for the Cleveland Clinic. \nI am a staff doc here. I don't have to operate on people's hearts to be \ncompensated. I can provide good advice, help people with their diet \nproblems, their exercise problems, their weight problems. I can help \npeople better understand what their opportunities are with medicine. I \nstill get paid. Bingo.\n  So a light went off for me. Some of us are hearing quite a bit the \nneed to get away from these fee-for-service deals where we basically \nincentivize doctors, hospitals, and nurses to ask for and order more \nvisits, more procedures, more MRIs, more lab tests, for imaging, more \nx-rays, because they get paid for it, because they know that by doing \nmore of everything, they reduce the likelihood that they are going to \nbe sued. That sort of gets us in this conundrum where we overuse health \ncare. If we are going to have real success in drawing down the costs of \nhealth care, part of it will be addressing the issue of fee for \nservice, get away from that practice, and get away from the \noverutilization of the health care we have.\n  Let me mention some of the things they are doing at these five or six \nentities I mentioned, these nonprofits. Among the things they do is \ncoordinate care. I use my mom as an example. My mom is now deceased. \nShe lived in Florida for roughly the last 30 or so years of her life. \nShe had dementia; she had congestive heart failure; she had arthritis. \nShe had five doctors. The last years of her life that she was down \nthere, my sister and I would go down to visit my mom about every other \nmonth or so. We would take turns, and we would go with our mom to visit \nher doctors. These five doctors my mom had never talked to each other. \nIn fact, I don't think they knew that the other doctors existed. They \nwere all in the aggregate prescribing something like 15 different kinds \nof prescription medicines. We kept them at her home in what looked like \nmy dad's old fishing tackle box. It was compartmentalized with \nmedicines to take before breakfast, during breakfast, after breakfast; \nbefore lunch, during lunch, and throughout the day. Some of those \nmedicines my mom was prescribed, she didn't need to take. Somebody \nneeded to know what she was taking and say, You shouldn't be taking \nthese two medicines in combination; they are hurting you. We didn't \nhave good coordination of care of my mom.\n  One of the things these nonprofits do is coordinate the care that is \nprovided to my mom or anybody's mom or dad. Another thing that would \nhave been very helpful for my mom or other people in that situation is \nto have electronic health records. If my mom had an electronic health \nrecord such as we have in the VA and like we are developing in Delaware \nand some other States, when my mom went from doctor's office to \ndoctor's office they would know in each office who else she was seeing \nand the medicines she was being prescribed, the lab tests and \neverything. They would have it right there for her when she came for \nher regular visit.\n  We have a great ability to harness information technology or \nelectronic health care records, which are a big part of that. Our \nnonprofits I have talked about--the half dozen or so--have that in \ncommon. On wellness and prevention, we know it is not just from \nnonprofits but out in California is Safeway, and these people have \nsupermarkets all over America and several hundred thousand employees. \nTheir health care costs from 2004 to 2008 have been level and flat. \nThey have incentivized employees to do the right thing for themselves, \nin terms of holding down their weight, helping them get off tobacco, to \nfight obesity and lethargy, to get off the sofa, and to eat what is \nright; and there are antismoking campaigns and all kinds of stuff. So \nwe have a good model there to perform.\n  It is not just the nonprofits but a lot of employers are starting to \nget into this as well.\n  There are another one or two points I will mention on the nonprofits. \nOn chronic disease management, such as heart disease and diabetes, I am \ntold that about 80 percent of the cost of these chronic diseases can be \ncontrolled by four factors: diet, exercise, overweight/obesity, and \nsmoking. Those four factors control about 80 percent of the cost of our \nexpenditures on chronic care. If we work with those four items, we will \nhelp reduce the costs and provide better outcomes for people. We will \nalso hold down our costs. There are a couple lessons from the \nnonprofits and others. Part of it is pharmacy--making sure people who \nneed pharmaceutical medicines, small and large molecules, are taking \nthose, and somebody is checking to make sure they are taking what they \nneed.\n  Focusing on primary care, many of those people coming out of medical \nschools want to be specialists. They are not interested in being \nprimary care doctors. We need more primary care doctors. We need to \nchange the incentives to get more primary care doctors, which is what \nwe need. Another idea is for us to pool insurance costs. As my \ncolleagues know, we have the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. We \nhave an insurance pool where we pool all the Federal employees and \ntheir dependents and the retirees and their dependents into one large \npool to purchase health insurance. They get it at a not cheap price but \na pretty good price. One of the reasons why is, when you have a lot of \npeople in the purchasing pool, you get a good variety and much better \ncosts. If you think about the administrative costs for health \ninsurance, as a percentage of premiums, I am told, in the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefit Program, it is about 10 percent. When it comes \nto people buying individual policies and small businesses, their \nadministrative costs as a percentage of premiums are about 30 percent. \nSo the idea of creating large purchasing pools makes a whole lot of \nsense.\n  I will close here. The idea that we would pass health care \nlegislation and stop extending coverage for people who don't have it--\nif that is all we do, we have failed the American people. We have to do \nat least two things. One is extend coverage but also make sure the \ncoverage we extend provides better coverage, better quality outcomes \nand better health care and that we do so at a price that is diminished \nand does not continue to expand by several times the rate of inflation. \nWe can do that going forward. That is what we need to do.\n  My friends have been generous in allowing me to proceed. I see \nseveral Senators are anxious to get back into the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Kansas concerning North Korea.\n  I must say I was entertained by the outlook--as far as North Korea's \nbehavior is concerned--by the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I can't remember when I have disagreed more.\n  The State Department's 2008 Country Reports on Terrorism stated that \n``as part of the six-party talks process, the U.S. reaffirmed its \nintent to fulfill its commitment regarding the removal of the \ndesignation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terrorism in parallel \nwith the DPRK's actions on denuclearization and in accordance with \ncriteria set forth by law.''\n  They certainly haven't taken any action on denuclearization, and it \ncertainly hasn't been in accordance with the criteria set forth by law.\n  There was a problem with this trade, however. We delisted North \nKorea, and we got something worse than nothing. Facts are stubborn \nthings. In response to our action, Pyongyang has embarked on a pattern \nof astonishing belligerence and has reversed even the previous steps it \nhad taken toward the denuclearization prior to its removal from the \nterrorism list.\n  A few facts. In December 2008--just 2 months after the United States \nremoved Pyongyang from the list--North Korea balked at inspections of \nits nuclear facilities and ceased disablement activities at the \nYongbyon reactor. In March, the regime seized two American\n\n[[Page S7764]]\n\njournalists near the China-North Korean border and subsequently \nsentenced them to 12 years of hard labor in the North Korean gulag. \nThese are two American citizens who may have strayed over a border. \nDoes that mean they are sentenced to 12 years of hard labor in the most \nharsh prison camps in the world? What are we going to do about it? It \nis remarkable. Two weeks later, it tested a long-range ballistic \nmissile, in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and then \nannounced it was expelling international inspectors from Yongbyon, \nreestablishing the facility, and ending North Korean participation in \ndisarmament talks. In May, Pyongyang conducted its second nuclear test; \nin June, a North Korean ship suspected of carrying illicit cargo \ndeparted North Korea in likely defiance of U.N. Security Council \nobligations; and earlier this month, Pyongyang again launched short- \nand medium-range missiles into the Sea of Japan, including on the \nFourth of July.\n  All these are indications that the North Koreans somehow should not \nbe listed as terrorists? I think we ought to, frankly--I respect and \nappreciate my friend from Kansas. Maybe we ought to have a binding \nresolution, rather than a sense of the Senate. It is remarkable that \nthese events have taken place against a backdrop of belligerence and \nintransigence by North Korea. Pyongyang has never accounted for or even \nacknowledged its role in assisting the construction of a nuclear \nreactor in Syria, which the Israelis had to bomb. Similarly, it has \nrefused to provide a complete and correct declaration of its nuclear \nprogram. Of course, something we all know, which is one of the great \ntragedies in the history of the world, is this is a gulag of some \n200,000 people, where people are regularly beaten, starved, and \nexecuted. According to the Washington Post, most of them work 12- to \n15-hour days until they die of malnutrition-related illnesses, usually \nat around the age of 50. They are allowed just one set of clothes. They \nlive and die in rags, without soap, socks, underclothes or sanitary \nnapkins. It is a horrible story.\n  It is not an accident that the average South Korean is several inches \ntaller than the average North Korean. This regime may be the most \nrepressive and oppressive and Orwellian in all the world today. So the \nChinese have been serious--according to Mr. Kerry, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, the Chinese have been resolute on the issue of the ship \ninspections. The U.N. Security Council resolution calls for monitoring \nand following of the ship, and if the decision is made that they need \nto board a North Korean ship, if the North Koreans refuse, then the \nfollowing ship cannot board but can follow them into a port, where the \nport authorities are expected to board and inspect the vessel. And then \nthat violation is reported to the U.N. Security Council. That ought to \nrouse some pretty quick action. I don't share the confidence of the \nSenator from Massachusetts that if a North Korean ship goes into a port \nat Myanmar, you will see likely action, except maybe the offloading of \nwhatever materials are being bought by Myanmar.\n  Look, the North Koreans have clearly been engaged in selling anything \nthey can to anybody who will buy it because they need the money--\nwhether it be drugs, counterfeit currency, nuclear technology or \nmissiles. Every time we have held onto the football, like Lucy, they \nhave pulled it away.\n  I think this is a very modest proposal of the Senator from Kansas. I \npoint out that years and years of six-party talks, different party \ntalks, negotiations, conversations, individuals who have been assigned \nas chief negotiators who then end up somehow negotiating, with the end \nbeing further negotiations, has failed.\n  If the North Koreans continue to test weapons, test missiles, sooner \nor later, they will match a missile with a weapon that will threaten \nthe United States of America. Right now, those missiles they are \ntesting go over Japanese territory. I think it is pretty obvious we are \ndealing with a regime of incredible and unbelievable cruelty and \noppression of their own people. The newly published Korean bar \nassociation details the daily lives of the 200,000 political prisoners \nestimated to be in the camps. Eating a diet of mostly corn and salt, \nthey lose their teeth, their gums turn black, their bones weaken and, \nas they age, they hunch over at the waist.\n  This is a regime that, in any interpretation of the word, is an \noutrageous insult to the world and everything America stands for and \nbelieves in. I believe they will pose a direct threat, over time, to \nthe security of not only Asia but the world. They were able to export \ntechnology all the way to Syria, obviously. Why should they not be able \nto export that to other parts of the world?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment by the \nSenator from Kansas, and I hope we can vote on that sooner rather than \nlater.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nBennett from Utah as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from Arizona. I think he \nunderstands more than anybody in this body the situation and what \nhappens in a gulag-type situation. That has drawn me to the topic of \nNorth Korea for a couple years--the human rights abuses. Hundreds and \nthousands of North Koreans are fleeing to be able to simply get food, \nand a couple hundred thousand of them are in the gulag system. It is \nunbelievable that this can happen in 2009. We have Google Earth that \ncan even show this. But we just say: OK, that is the sort of thing that \nhappens there. It is mind-boggling to me that we wouldn't act \nresolutely.\n  I appreciate the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, who is a distinguished Senator and is very \nbright and experienced in foreign policy. I could not disagree with him \nmore about North Korea. We have had an ongoing dialog and discussion \nabout this. He makes the point that we should not pop this on the bill.\n  I have been trying for months for us to relist them as terrorists. \nThey should not have been delisted in the first place. It was a \nterrible process move on the Bush administration to try to move the \ntalks forward, saying we are going to delist you and you are going to \ndo something for us. Pyongyang and Kim Jong Il said thank you very \nmuch, and now we are going to stick it in your face, which is what they \nhave continued to do. I have listed the things, as the Senator from \nArizona has mentioned as well.\n\n  The thought that we are acting resolutely, to me, is an insult to the \npeople in North Korea who have lived under this oppressive regime. We \nare not acting resolutely toward North Korea. We are not putting any \nsanctions on them. We have asked for international sanctions, but why \naren't we willing to put sanctions on ourselves? If we think this is \nsuch a proper course to follow, and we are willing to push it on an \ninternational body, why wouldn't we be willing to do it ourselves? Why \nwouldn't we be willing to list them as a terror nation, as a state \nsponsor of terror? I don't understand that; why, if it is good in the \ninternational arena, we wouldn't do it ourselves.\n  Plus, we need to have teeth into this. This is a modest--a modest--\nproposal. It is a resolution, a sense of the Senate that North Korea \nshould be relisted as a state sponsor of terrorism. We are not \nrelisting them. That is an administration call. We are saying we, as a \nbody, given the provocative actions that have taken place since they \nhave been delisted clearly merits the relisting of North Korea as a \nstate sponsor of terrorism. That is our opinion, and that is what we \nare saying to the administration.\n  Without a foundation in the law, it is clearly--as I read \npreviously--allowed for the Secretary of State to determine that the \ngovernment of that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of \ninternational terrorism. That is the actual wording of the law in the \nArms Export Control Act. Clearly, they have acted to sponsor \ninternational terrorism with their relation with Burma, with the \nmissiles, with the nuclear weapons, and with the proliferation they \nhave done and continue to do.\n  He says, and is suggesting, that delisting has no practical effect. I \nbelieve it does have a practical effect, and it certainly does on the \nadministration's stance toward North Korea\n\n[[Page S7765]]\n\nand their international posture toward North Korea. Plus, it has a \npractical effect on what we can provide for as far as aid from the \nUnited States to North Korea. We shouldn't be providing aid to the \nNorth Koreans. We should provide food aid, if we can monitor it. We \nshouldn't be giving oil to the North Koreans. That should be limited so \nthe administration cannot do that. They would not be able to if they \nare listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n  Mr. President, it will hurt the people of North Korea and those who \nare in the North Korean gulags if we don't relist them. It recovers any \nvestige of hope they might have that at some point in time somebody of \nenough stature, such as the United States Government, is going to take \nenough notice that they are going to put pressure on the North Korean \nregime. I have talked with some people who were refuseniks in the \nSoviet Union, in a Soviet gulag during an era where we had far less \ncommunication capacity than we do today, and yet they were able to get \nmessages at that point in time into the Soviet gulag that the Americans \nwere putting pressure on the Soviet Union and the lack of human rights \nin the Soviet Union, and it gave them hope. It gave them hope in the \nSoviet gulag.\n  If we can pass this, it can give people in the gulags in North Korea \nhope that somebody is at least paying enough attention to put pressure \non this, and maybe they may be able to live longer, or actually live at \nall. It can give them hope, instead of ``abandon hope all ye who enter \nhere,'' as it says at the entrance to Inferno and as it is in the gulag \nsystem in North Korea.\n  So it is a modest resolution, and I would hope my colleagues would \nvote overwhelmingly for this resolution to relist North Korea as a \nstate sponsor of terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1528\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside and that amendment No. 1528 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself, \n     Mr. Graham, Mr. Begich, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. \n     Thune, proposes an amendment numbered 1528.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide authority to increase Army active-duty end \n  strengths for fiscal year 2010 as well as fiscal year 2011 and 2012)\n\n       Strike section 402 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 402. ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY FOR INCREASES OF ARMY ACTIVE-\n                   DUTY END STRENGTHS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2010, 2011, \n                   AND 2012.\n\n       (a) Authority to Increase army Active-Duty End Strength.--\n       (1) Authority.--For each of fiscal years 2010, 2011, and \n     2012, the Secretary of Defense may, as the Secretary \n     determines necessary for the purposes specified in paragraph \n     (2), establish the active-duty end strength for the Army at a \n     number greater than the number otherwise authorized by law up \n     to the number equal to the fiscal-year 2010 baseline plus \n     30,000.\n       (2) Purpose of increases.--The purposes for which an \n     increase may be made in the active duty end strength for the \n     Army under paragraph (1) are the following:\n       (A) To increase dwell time for members of the Army on \n     active duty.\n       (B) To support operational missions.\n       (C) To achieve reorganizational objectives, including \n     increased unit manning, force stabilization and shaping, and \n     supporting wounded warriors.\n       (b) Relationship to Presidential Waiver Authority.--Nothing \n     in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of \n     the President under section 123a of title 10, United States \n     Code, to waive any statutory end strength in a time of war or \n     national emergency.\n       (c) Relationship to Other Variance Authority.--The \n     authority in subsection (a) is in addition to the authority \n     to vary authorized end strengths that is provided in \n     subsections (e) and (f) of section 115 of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n       (d) Budget Treatment.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Secretary of Defense increases \n     active-duty end strength for the Army for fiscal year 2010 \n     under subsection (a), the Secretary may fund such an increase \n     through Department of Defense reserve funds or through an \n     emergency supplemental appropriation.\n       (2) Fiscal years 2011 and 2012.--(2) If the Secretary of \n     Defense plans to increase the active-duty end strength for \n     the Army for fiscal year 2011 or 2012, the budget for the \n     Department of Defense for such fiscal year as submitted to \n     Congress shall include the amounts necessary for funding the \n     active-duty end strength for the Army in excess of the \n     fiscal-year 2010 baseline.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Fiscal-year 2010 baseline.--The term ``fiscal-year 2010 \n     baseline'', with respect to the Army, means the active-duty \n     end strength authorized for the Army in section 401(1).\n       (2) Active-duty end strength.--The term ``active-duty end \n     strength'', with respect to the Army for a fiscal year, means \n     the strength for active duty personnel of Army as of the last \n     day of the fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to introduce \nthis amendment with a bipartisan group of cosponsors. To state it \nbriefly, it extends the authorized end strength of the U.S. Army by \n30,000 over the next 3 years, effective with the commencement of fiscal \nyear 2010. It doesn't mandate this increase, but it expands the \nauthority of the Secretary of Defense, obviously, with the support and \nauthorization of the President of the United States, the Commander in \nChief, to extend the end strength of the U.S. Army. End strength means \nhow many soldiers can the U.S. Army have. Of course, it does this to \nreduce the tremendous stress on the U.S. Army, which is carrying the \nburden of combat in two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan today, and over \nthe next year or 18 months will be in this unique position.\n  Progress has been made, thank God, in Iraq, and the Iraq Security \nForces are progressively taking over responsibility for keeping the \nsecurity in their country. The drawdown of American soldiers is \nhappening in a methodical and responsible way, and I again express my \nappreciation to President Obama that it is happening in that way. At \nthe same time, we are increasing our troop presence in Afghanistan. \nBottom line: The demand for members of the U.S. Army on the battlefield \nover the next year, 18 months, at the outside 2 years, is going up. If \nthe supply remains constant, that means the stress on every soldier in \nthe U.S. Army and his or her family will not be reduced. As a matter of \nfact, it will go up. The term for this--which I will get to in a \nminute--in the Army is ``dwell time.''\n  This is an amendment that began with members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, and a comparable amendment in the House Armed \nServices Committee, recognizing, as we all do, the tremendous stress \nthat our Army is under, the extraordinary job they are doing in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  This is really the next great generation of the American military. \nBut we see in it some tough statistics: the increase in mental health \nproblems, the increase in divorces of members of the service, and, \nworse, of course, the increase in suicides.\n  There are many things we have supported in this Senate and the \nCongress--and the administration has--to respond to each one of those \nproblems. But in a way, the most direct thing we can do is to increase \nthe size of the U.S. Army so there is less pressure on every soldier in \nthe Army, in this sense. Every time we add another soldier to the U.S. \nArmy--and we are talking about authorization to add 30,000 more--it \nmeans that much more time every other member of the U.S. Army can spend \nback at base retraining, preparing and, most important of all, spending \ntime with their families.\n  As I know the Presiding Officer knows--and I know the President of \nthe United States knows it too--the good news is that the Secretary of \nDefense, Bob Gates, who has done and is doing an extraordinary job for \nour country with, of course, the support and authorization of President \nObama, yesterday announced that he would be temporarily increasing the \nActive-Duty end strength of the U.S. Army by 22,000 soldiers over the \ncourse of the next 3 years.\n  I cannot sufficiently express my words of appreciation for Secretary \nGates's decision. He acted by employing the emergency authority he has \nin an authorization of the use of force and a built-in statutory waiver \nhe has up to 3 percent of existing end strength to expand the size of \nthe Army. This amendment, which had been planned,\n\n[[Page S7766]]\n\nand was in the committee before this great action by Secretary Gates \nyesterday, is now before us, and I am honored to offer this amendment \nwith a bipartisan group of cosponsors who are listed on this amendment \nas a way to do two things: The first is that it literally increases \nfrom 547,000 to 577,000-plus the authorized end strength of the U.S. \nArmy, and to leave that authority there in case there is a need that \nSecretary Gates and the President see in the coming 3 years to raise \nthe number.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding that the amendment authorizes the \nadditional forces Secretary Gates said yesterday in his speech that we \nneed--or the day before yesterday. Why do we need to put this into the \nbill?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Two reasons. The first is that it is a bit beyond what \nSecretary Gates did. He authorized using the extraordinary powers he \npossesses as Secretary in this time of conflict up to 22,000 for the \nnext 3 years. The amendment authorizes--doesn't mandate, doesn't \nappropriate--30,000 for the next 3 years. So it gives some latitude, \ndepending on how conditions go in Iraq and Afghanistan, to go a bit \nfurther--8,000 more, if necessary, over the next 3 years.\n  Second, I say to my friend from Arizona, when this amendment started, \nwe didn't know Secretary Gates was going to do this. I am grateful he \ndid, but this amendment now--frankly, as Secretary Gates himself said \nto me yesterday, and I appreciate it and I don't think he would mind if \nI repeated it on the Senate floor--gives the Senate and Congress the \nopportunity to essentially vindicate and support the step that the \nSecretary has made and, as he put it, send a message from the Senate to \nthe members of the U.S. Army that help is on the way.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And there is no doubt that the Army very badly needs the \nhelp now and in the foreseeable future.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. My friend from Arizona is absolutely right. There is \nno doubt, based on the demand, certainly temporarily, over the next 18 \nmonths, perhaps 2 years, as we are drawing down in Iraq, but not as \nrapidly as we are adding forces in Afghanistan, that there is at least \na temporary need for more than the authorized 547,000 members of the \nU.S. Army.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And if I could question the Senator further, perhaps this \nwould illuminate any requirement for stop loss or for involuntary \nextensions in a combat area.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Absolutely. As a matter of fact, one of the reasons \nSecretary Gates gave yesterday I will read:\n\n       The decision to eliminate the routine use of ``stop loss'' \n     authority in the Army requires a larger personnel flow for \n     each deploying unit to compensate for those whose contract \n     expires during the period of deployment.\n\n  So, yes, this makes it possible to end the use of stop loss, which is \nessentially, in layman's terms, a way to require people to stay \nactively deployed longer than they originally were going to be \ndeployed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Arizona. We have illuminated \nmost of the reasons in our exchange why this amendment is important. I \nwill simply add a few more things Secretary Gates said yesterday, which \nis:\n\n       The army has reached a point of diminishing returns in \n     their multiyear program to reduce the size of its training \n     and support ``tail.''\n\n  That is the training and support which supports the Active-Duty Army.\n\n       The cumulative effect of these factors is that the Army \n     faces a period where its ability to continue to deploy combat \n     units at acceptable fill rates is at serious risk.\n\n  Here is the point I just made in response to Senator McCain's \nquestion.\n\n       Based on current deployment estimates, this is a temporary \n     challenge--\n\n  A temporary point of stress. We hope and pray that is true. It \ncertainly looks like it is--\n\n     which will peak in the coming year and abate over the course \n     of the next 3 years.\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to the Secretary of Defense, we heard from \nthe Army's Chief of Staff, GEN George Casey, and Secretary of the Army \nPete Geren, who have been advocates within the Pentagon for this \nincrease in end strength, and I thank them for that. Admiral Mullen, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, told our Armed Services Committee earlier \nthis year that the light at the end of the tunnel, as he put it, is \nstill more than 2 years away, and that is only if everything goes \naccording to plan, which in combat, obviously, often does not.\n  Again, I say this is an authorization; it is not a mandate. I will \nadd that Secretary Gates announced yesterday that he will find a way to \nfund the additional troops in this year and fiscal year 2010--the one \nthat begins October 1--by reprogramming other funds appropriated to the \nPentagon for fiscal year 2011, which is the budget that will be \npresented to us next year, if it is probable that the Department of \nDefense will require funding as part of its normal operations, and more \nlikely as part of the OCO fund--the overseas contingency operation \nfund--which supports our presence in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I cannot say enough, I know all of us in the Senate believe we cannot \nsay enough, in gratitude to the members of the U.S. Army who are \nleading the battle for us against the Islamic extremists and terrorists \nwho attacked us on 9/11/01. We owe them a debt we can never fully \nrepay.\n  One thing we can do, that Secretary Gates did yesterday and the \nSenate can do in this amendment, is to send a message to our troops in \nthe field that help is on the way in the most consequential way, which \nis additional members of the Army.\n  I ask that when the vote be taken, it be taken by the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Again I say to my colleagues I am doing that, although \nI expect there will be very strong support for this, because I believe \nit is the most visible way for this Senate to send the message to the \nU.S. Army of appreciation and gratitude, to them and their families, \nthat help is on the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me commend Senator Lieberman and others \nwho support this amendment. We in the Armed Services Committee are very \nsupportive of previous increases; indeed, we led the way on some of \nthem. Because of the stress on the Army and the number of commitments \nwhich had been made in Iraq and Afghanistan, we must give the kind of \nsupport to our troops they deserve and the American people want us to \ngive.\n  One of the ways we can reduce some of the stress is by increasing the \nend strength so the dwell time is more sufficient and there are other \npositive spinoffs as well from this kind of increase in the authorized \nend strength.\n  The Secretary made a very powerful speech the other day when he \ncalled for an increase of 22,000, I believe, in the end strength. That \nend strength is temporary, it is almost as large as this--not quite; \nthis is 30,000, but this is surely in the ballpark. It is appropriate. \nIt is authority, it is not mandatory, and I think it is a very positive \nsignal to send to our men and women in uniform and to their families. I \nvery much support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, briefly I thank Senator Levin, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, not just for his strong \nstatement of support now but for the support he has given during our \ncommittee's deliberations to the goal of achieving an increase in Army \nend strength.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1475\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am going to talk about an amendment we\n\n[[Page S7767]]\n\nhave not yet cleared unanimous consent for it to be brought up. I am \nhopeful that will come. But in order to advance the issue, I intend to \ntalk about my amendment, No. 1475, without offering it at this time. I \nthink it is an appropriate amendment to talk about at this point \nfollowing Senator Lieberman's amendment because his amendment deals \nwith increasing our forces.\n  One of the reasons it is important to do that is the stress that the \nrestricted numbers provide on our military personnel. Senator Lieberman \nmentioned, and I will repeat, the number of suicides and attempted \nsuicides by our young men and women serving in the military has \nincreased and one of the reasons, frankly, is that the repeated \ndeployments and the length of the deployments have added to the stress \nof our servicemen.\n  Health experts agree that there is most likely a combination of \nfactors leading to this increase in suicides. Many of these factors are \nsimply the results of the prolonged conflict that our Nation finds \nitself in, including multiple deployments, extended separations from \nfamily and loved ones, and the overwhelming stress of combat \nexperiences; each placing a unique and tremendous strain on the men and \nwomen of our all-volunteer force.\n  But while Congress has recognized these strains, and acted to help \nprovide relief by increasing the size of our forces and thereby \nreducing the number and frequency of deployments, we cannot as easily \nremedy the stress or mental trauma created by combat experience.\n  For those who have had to witness the ugliness and devastation of war \nfirst-hand, they have encountered something very unnatural for the \nhuman mind to comprehend or accept. For these service members, \nrecovering from these experiences involves a long and arduous journey \nin learning to identify, control and cope with a wide array of \nemotions. And this learning process is often only accomplished with the \nguidance and management of highly trained mental or behavioral health \nspecialists.\n  In this light, we in Congress have acted to increase funding for more \nmental health providers and improved access for our troops and their \nfamilies, and we have sharpened the focus of the military on addressing \nthese care needs. That is very positive and has had a very positive \neffect.\n  What we must now focus on, and direct the military's attention to, is \nthe potentially harmful practice of administering antidepressants to a \npopulation that frequently moves throughout a theatre of war and is \ntherefore susceptible to gaps in mental health management. We are not \ncertain they are getting the follow-up care they need.\n  A 2007 report by the Army's fifth Mental Health Advisory Team \nindicated that, according to an anonymous survey of U.S. troops, about \n12 percent of combat troops in Iraq, and 17 percent of combat troops in \nAfghanistan, are taking prescription antidepressants or sleeping pills \nto help them cope with this stress. This equates to roughly 20,000 \ntroops on such medications in theatre right now.\n  What I find particularly troubling, when reviewing these figures, is \nthat the Pentagon has yet to establish an official clearinghouse that \naccurately tracks this kind of data. In fact, the Army's best reported \nestimate can only tell us that the authorized or prescribed drug use by \ntroops in Iraq and Afghanistan is believed to be evenly split between \nantidepressants--mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or \nSSRIs--and prescription sleeping pills. My amendment would provide us \nwith the information so we know what is happening with the use of these \ndrugs.\n  Providing that this best estimate contains some degree of accuracy, \nit is important for us to also recognize that many of these same \nantidepressants, after strong urging by the FDA, recently expanded \ntheir warning labels to state that young adults--ages 18-24 years old--\nmay be at an elevated risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior while \nusing the medication. This same age group--18-24 years old--represents \n41 percent of our military forces serving on the front lines in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  While keeping this warning label in mind, it is imperative that my \ncolleagues understand that nearly 40 percent of Army suicide victims in \n2006 and 2007 are believed to have taken some type of antidepressant \ndrugs--and overwhelmingly these SSRIs. And as I mentioned at the \nbeginning of this statement, the number of Army suicides reported each \nmonth are outpacing each preceding month.\n  This class of antidepressants--these SSRIs--are unlike most earlier \nclasses of psychiatric medications in that they were, from their \ninception, specifically designed for use as an antidepressant --that \nis, they were engineered to target a particular process in the brain \nthat plays a significant role in depression and other anxiety \ndisorders. More significantly, however, these SSRIs are unlike most \nother antidepressant medications because they are still allowed by \nDepartment of Defense policy to be prescribed to service members while \nthey are deployed and directly engaged in overseas operations.\n  Now, to be fair, there is widespread consensus in the community of \nprofessional mental health providers, and empirical evidence to \nsupport, that SSRIs do offer significant benefit for the treatment of \nposttraumatic stress and some forms of depression. And although there \nare some side effects, they are reportedly much milder and shorter in \nduration than other antidepressants. Additionally, SSRIs are also \nbelieved to potentially prevent, or at least some believe, lesson the \nmore harmful long-term effects of posttraumatic stress disorder.\n  My concern, however, and hopefully that of my Senate colleagues, is \nnot the long-term efficacy of these SSRIs, but more pointedly the \nvolume and manner in which these drugs are being administered to our \nservice men and women overseas.\n  You see, unlike medications that work on an as-needed basis, SSRIs \nonly begin to work after having been taken every day--at a specific \ndosage--for a significant period of time. This frequently translates to \na 3 to 6 week latency period before the therapeutic effect materializes \nand patients begin to feel improvement. In light of the population I \nhave been discussing, there are two very readily apparent problems with \nthis shortcoming--first, is that service members serving in forward \noperating areas, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, are quite frequently \nsubject to moving between bases or into other areas--some so remote \nthat there may be no trained mental health provider available to \nadminister the treatment and to make sure it is effective.\n  Second, and more importantly, is that this initial period is when \npatients, particularly younger patients, often suffer an escalation in \nthe severity of depression and/or anxiety.\n  In essence, DOD may be prescribing SSRIs to its service members, \nwithout the assurance that they will remain in a capacity to be \nobserved by a highly trained mental health provider. Worse yet, these \nsame patients may very likely find themselves ordered off to conduct \ncombat operations during this same latency period.\n  Let's return our focus back to the alarming increase in the number of \nmilitary and veteran suicides reported in 2008 and 2009.\n  At what point do we step forward to direct that action be taken by \nDOD to capture, track and report this data? And at what point do we \nensure that DOD is properly prescribing, dispensing and administering \nthese drugs to our troops without having in place the necessary \ncontrols and or patient management practices?\n  As a first step in this direction, the amendment I intend to \nintroduce will accomplish a better understanding as to the potential \nmagnitude of this issue. This amendment directs the Department of \nDefense to capture, at a macro level--at a macro level, not individual \ninformation, without divulging or violating any protected patient \nhealth information--the volume and types of antidepressants, \npsychotropics or antianxiety drugs being prescribed to our men and \nwomen serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will also require DOD, \nbeginning in June of 2010 and then annually thereafter through 2015, to \nreport to Congress an accurate percentage of those troops currently and \npreviously deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since 2005 who have been \nprescribed these types of drugs.\n  I wish to reiterate that this measure specifically directs the \ndisclosure of\n\n[[Page S7768]]\n\nthis information by DOD to be done in such a way as to not violate the \nindividual patient privacy rights of our service men or women as \ndefined by HIPAA.\n  This legislation further directs DOD to contact the National \nInstitute of Mental Health and provide any and all data as determined \nnecessary by the Institute to conduct a scientific peer reviewable \nstudy to determine whether these types of prescriptions, and/or the \nmethod in which they are being prescribed and administered by DOD, are \nin any way contributing to the rising number of suicides by \nservicemembers or Iraq or Afghanistan veterans.\n  I want to specifically address one issue I have heard from some who \nexpress concern about this amendment by saying it would stigmatize, in \nthe eyes of our troops, those seeking mental health care. Nothing could \nbe further from what this amendment does. This amendment would collect \ninformation in an anonymous manner, and it will be invisible to the \nservicemembers serving on the front line.\n  The men and women serving in our military, and equally so their \nfamilies, deserve our utmost assurance that we are doing everything in \nour power to see that our Nation's warfighters are provided the best \nmedical care available. An integral part of our commitment must also be \nto ensure that these service men and women volunteering to serve our \nNation are not being exposed to what may potentially endanger them when \nthey seek medical care and mental health service.\n  This amendment is very simple. It asks us to gather information so we \ncan make a judgment in a macro sense, without violating the individual \nprivacy of our service men and women. It allows us to gather the \ninformation, to have the best information. This Congress has a proud \nrecord of providing the necessary resources for the health care of our \nwarriors and their families.\n  This amendment will complement that by making sure that we have the \nanalytical tools to make sure we are providing the right type of mental \nhealth services to our service men and women who are in theater. It \ngets us the information in order to judge what is being done today.\n  I would hope my colleagues would agree that we would want to have \nthis information, and I hope at a later time I will have the \nopportunity to actually offer the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Leahy \nbe added as a cosponsor on the amendment which we just adopted, the \nLieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1688\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise in support of this vital \namendment in order to correct disparities among the Small Business \nAdministration's, SBA, small business contracting programs. Building on \nmy efforts to bring true parity to the programs, this amendment will \ncreate a more equitable and flexible method for Federal agencies to \nfairly allocate Federal procurement dollars to small business \ncontractors across the Nation. Earlier this year, I offered an \namendment, cosponsored by my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, to \ncreate parity as part of S. 454, the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform \nAct of 2009. Unfortunately, that amendment was not accepted.\n  For years it has been unclear to the acquisition community what, if \nany, is the true order of preference when determining which small \nbusiness contracting program is at the top of the agency's priority \nlist. The SBA's regulations state that there is parity among the \nprograms, and this had been the general practice in effect until two \nGovernment Accountability Office decisions were released on September \n19, 2008, and May 4, 2009.\n  The decisions stated that the Historically Underutilized Business \nZone--HUBZone--program had preference over all other small business \ncontracting programs. While the interpretation benefits HUBZone \nbusinesses, it comes at the expense of other vital small business \ncontracting programs. This targeted amendment provides equity for the \nSBA's small business contracting programs.\n  The amendment provides Federal agencies with the necessary \nflexibility to satisfy their government-wide statutory small business \ncontracting goals. This amendment makes clear to purchasing agencies \nthat contracting officers may award contracts to HUBZone, service-\ndisabled veterans, 8(a), or women-owned firms with equal deference to \neach program. It would provide these agencies with the ability to \nachieve their goaling requirements equally through an award to a \nHUBZone firm, a service-disabled veteran-owned small business, and a \nsmall business participating in the 8(a) business development program. \nAnd of course this list will also include women-owned small businesses \nonce the women's procurement program is fully implemented by the SBA.\n  In addition, this amendment brings the SBA's contracting programs \ncloser to true parity by giving HUBZones a subcontracting goal. \nHUBZones are the only small business contracting program without a \nsubcontracting goal. In addition, the amendment authorizes mentor \nprotege programs modeled after those used in the 8(a) program for \nHUBZones, service-disabled veteran and women-owned firms.\n  The essence of true parity is where each program has an equal chance \nof competing and being selected for an award. During these difficult \neconomic\n\n[[Page S7769]]\n\ntimes, it is imperative that small business contractors possess an \nequal opportunity to compete for federal contracts on the same playing \nfield with each other.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1500\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the section 1072 \nof S. 1390, National Defense Authorization Act of 2010. This section \nauthorizes the Comptroller General of the United States to assess \nmilitary whistleblower protections.\n  As everyone knows, I strongly believe whistleblowers play an \nimportant role in the accountability of all government. This should \nalso be true for the men and women who wear uniforms and serve in the \nArmed Forces.\n  In 1988, Congress passed legislation that gave members of the armed \nservices unique whistleblower protections. Despite this military \nwhistleblower law, I have concerns that military whistleblowers could \nbe underserved by the regulations and processes created by the \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, and the DOD, Office of Inspector General, \nOIG.\n  During the course of my own investigation of several military \nwhistleblower cases, I learned some matters which may question how \neffectively military whistleblower reprisal cases are handled by the \nDOD and DOD OIG. The Government Accountability Office, GAO, has noted \nin its past work that the effectiveness of the Federal protection for \nmilitary whistleblowers rests principally on a two-stage process of \ninvestigation and administrative review. The first stage involves a \nDOD, service, or guard inspector general's investigation of the \nspecific facts and interpretation of issues associated with a \nwhistleblower reprisal allegation. In the second stage of the \ninvestigation/administrative review process, the DOD OIG reviews and \napproves the findings of the service or guard inspectors general. This \nreview is designed to provide assurance that the findings and \nrecommendations in a report were made in compliance with applicable \ninvestigatory guidelines and meet legal sufficiency. The second stage \nof this procedure is crucial for the military whistleblower process to \nwork as intended.\n  In addition to the tasking included in S. 1390, the military \nwhistleblower reprisal appeal process should be examined by the GAO as \nwell. The military whistleblower law, 10 USC Sec.  1034, gives the \nBoards for the Correction of Military Records--BCMR--of each armed \nservice the appeal authority in these often unique and complex matters. \nI believe the report requested by the underlying bill is important and \nI support its inclusion. However, it is important for the GAO to also \nstudy the effectiveness of the BCMR appeal process to ensure military \nwhistleblowers are afforded a fair administrative process to combat \nreprisal.\n  Last year, I first introduced the idea of a GAO military \nwhistleblower study when I requested this work of the Acting \nComptroller General Gene L. Dodaro in a letter dated July 18, 2008. I \nfollowed up on my letter to the GAO with a legislative proposal through \na filed amendment to the Defense Department appropriations bill for \n2009 which instructed the GAO to conduct a comprehensive analysis of \nthis issue. Unfortunately, that amendment did not make it through the \nlegislative process. I thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain \nfor including this sensible military whistleblower study in the current \nbill.\n  Accordingly, I offer this latest amendment to include a review and \nanalysis of the military whistleblower reprisal appeals heard by the \nBoards for the Correction of Military Records.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2010 authorizes almost $680 billion for the Department of \nDefense and the national security programs of the Department of Energy.\n  The bill provides pay and health care to servicemembers and their \nfamilies; funds troops with the equipment and resources they need to \nfight and provide security; strengthens our ability to train foreign \nmilitaries and protect against IEDs and rogue nuclear threats; and \nterminates questionable weapons programs.\n  It also includes legislation to complete the James A. Lovell Federal \nHealth Care Center in Illinois.\n  It gives the VA and the Navy the authority they need to finalize a \nmodel partnership between the North Chicago VA Medical Center and the \nNaval Health Clinic Great Lakes.\n  This is a model that the Departments hope can be replicated around \nthe country.\n  Combining separate Federal hospitals will provide better care for our \nservicemembers and veterans while saving valuable taxpayer dollars.\n  Given the conflicts we face abroad, this bill provides the right \namount to spend in support of our troops. Today, the United States is \nthe world's leader in defense spending. Last year, U.S. military \nspending accounted for almost half of the world's total military \nspending. We spend more than the next 46 countries combined. U.S. \nmilitary spending, combined with that of our close allies, makes up 72 \npercent of all military spending in the world. Our defense budget is \nsix times larger than China's and 100 times larger than Iran's.\n  These funds make good on a promise to our men and women in our \nmilitary. Our troops continue to do everything we ask of them in the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. These conflicts have taken an \nextraordinary toll on servicemembers and their families that we cannot \nforget.\n  The Armed Forces, particularly the Army and the Marine Corps, will \ncontinue to be heavily stressed, even as we start to redeploy our \nforces from Iraq. Servicemembers still do not have enough dwell time \nbetween deployments and the Army has seen a troubling rise in the \nnumber of suicides. These are indications of the strain that multiple \nand continued deployments are taking on the force. The President \nrequested increasing the size of the Army to 547,400 soldiers and \nincreasing the Marine Corps to 202,100 Marines, while preventing cuts \nin Navy and Air Force personnel. This bill supports the President's \nrequest. It also authorizes an additional 30,000 soldiers in 2011 and \n2012, should the Secretary of Defense believe such troops are \nnecessary. Additional soldiers and marines will help ease the burdens \ncaused by multiple deployments.\n  More personnel will give each service more breathing room to care for \nits wounded warriors. Others can continue the fight while injured and \nill servicemembers can recover in wounded transition units.\n  This legislation creates a task force to assess the policies and \nprograms that support the care and transition of recovering wounded and \nseriously ill members of the Armed Forces. The task force will consider \nwhether servicemembers have sufficient access to care for posttraumatic \nstress disorder and traumatic brain injury, the signature injury of the \nwars. It will look at how well we help injured warriors transition from \nthe Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  The task force will also review the support available to family \ncaregivers as they care for recovering injured and seriously ill \nmembers of the Armed Forces. For every servicemember successfully \nrecovering from a serious injury or illness, there is often a family \nmember who has put the brakes on his or her life to care for that \nperson.\n  Last week, my office received a call from the family of Jordan Hoyt, \na soldier from Barry, IL. He was seriously injured in Afghanistan and \nis receiving care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center here in \nWashington. His wife Haley has moved to Washington to be near Jordan \nwhile he goes through months of surgery and rehabilitation. She has \nbrought with her their infant child, who was born while Jordan was away \nserving his country. Haley is from Quincy. She has left her family \nbehind to help Jordan recover from his injury. She has also delayed her \neducational plans to study criminal justice. Haley is 19 years old. \nAfter Jordan leaves Walter Reed, the couple will return to Quincy to \nlive with her mother, who has already provided them with incredible \nsupport. While taking care of wounded servicemembers is our basic \nresponsibility, we also need to support the families whose lives have \nbeen up-ended by the wars. I commend the committee for including this \ntask force to look at the needs of family caregivers.\n  This President inherited many challenges at home and abroad, \nincluding two wars and a challenging situation in\n\n[[Page S7770]]\n\nPakistan. This bill supports President Obama's new direction in \naddressing these priorities. In June, our military redeployed from \nIraq's cities under the Status of Forces Agreement concluded by the \ngovernment of Iraq and the previous administration. The Iraqis must \ncontinue to take responsibility for their own future.\n  I commend the President's increased focus on defense and development \nin Afghanistan; preventing the reemergence of the Taliban and al-Qaida; \nand strengthening economic, agricultural, educational, and democratic \ndevelopment. These goals are important to development in Afghanistan, \nbut they are essential to our military's strategy. I support the \nNational Defense Authorization Act and commend Chairman Levin and \nSenator McCain for their leadership.\n  Almost 3,000 soldiers from the Illinois Army National Guard are \ncurrently deployed to Afghanistan. Members of the Illinois Guard's 33rd \nInfantry Brigade Combat Team are helping train the Afghan National \nPolice and providing force protection at military bases. It has been a \ndifficult deployment, with many casualties. Gen William Enyart, the \nAdjutant General of Illinois, has had to attend the funerals of too \nmany of his soldiers. He sent me an article he had written this spring. \nWhy do the young soldiers serve, he asked? This is what he wrote. They \nserve because:\n\n       They are our kids, they are our protectors. They are what \n     stand between us and chaos. They don't have to be asked to \n     serve. They don't have to be asked to go into danger. They do \n     it, not out of hate, not out of vengeance, but out of love. \n     Love of family, love of community, love of fellow soldier.\n\n  I think he is right. Members of the Armed Forces and their families \nmake these sacrifices to keep our country safe. We owe them much in \nreturn. This bill takes one step by providing them the resources they \nneed. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and to send it to \nthe President for his signature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/21/senate-section/article/S7770-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns about the \nadministration's failure to make the deadline of issuing a report on \nthe Guantanamo detainee policy. Today's deadline, similar to the \nJanuary 2010 closure deadline, was self-imposed. It concerns me that \nthe administration maintains that closure will occur even though the \nexecution of this process has been less than stellar.\n  In January, on his very first full day in office, President Obama \nsigned the order to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in 12 \nmonths. The President created separate task forces to examine closure \nand detainee issues. These task forces were developed and staffed by \nthe Obama administration to achieve successful closure in 1 year. The \nproduct of this review is to include a report on a broader detainee \npolicy.\n  Today marks the first deadline in this process. It was set to be the \ndate of release and publication of the task force report on a broader \ndetainee policy going forward. The administration's failure to meet the \ndeadline appears to me to be the ``canary in the coal mine'' that a \nJanuary closure of Guantanamo without a detailed plan is an exercise in \nfutility.\n  Yet the White House downplays the missed deadline and publicly states \nthat the January closure is still on track. Is it? Despite not having a \nplan and missing a deadline for a key integral part of the closure \nprocess, the administration claims it can still meet the overall \ndeadline of closure by January 1. I find that notion suspect at best \nand completely absurd at worst.\n  In May, a Gallup Poll indicated that 65 percent--65 percent--of \nAmericans oppose the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. \nEven so, the administration intends to follow its timeline and close \nGuantanamo by January 2010. The task force examining the cases of the \nremaining 229 detainees has only reviewed half the necessary caseload \nthus far.\n  The Justice Department hopes to complete its review by an October \nreporting deadline, but that benchmark is quickly slipping away too. \nThis review process has taken twice the amount of time the \nadministration thought it would take. Yet keeping Guantanamo open \nbeyond January is inexplicably still not an option in the \nadministration's view.\n  Recently, media reports are circulating that the administration's \nGuantanamo closure plan has been fraught with political miscalculation \nand internal dissension. Moreover, the complex nature of this issue \nwill undoubtedly force the transfer of detainees inside the United \nStates. Since the announcement of the President's intention to close \nGuantanamo, I have joined other Senators in pointing out the lack of \nplanning and clear miscalculation of this decision. That pool has grown \nand a groundswell of bipartisan support is signaling the White House to \n``pump the brakes.''\n  In May, the Senate voted 90 to 6 to strip out funding in the fiscal \nyear 2010 war spending request that would authorize $80 million for the \ntransfer of detainees to the interior of the United States of America. \nNow that the failure to meet this deadline has been reported by outlets \nsuch as the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and New York Times, \nthe administration still does not get it. Senior administration \nofficials are letting hubris get in the way. This is neither the proper \nmanner nor the time to close Guantanamo.\n  There should have been more study of this issue prior to setting us \non a course for closure. It is easy to say that Guantanamo can be \nclosed when you are a candidate for President. It is even easier to \nsign an order on your very first full day in office as President that \nsays in 12 months Guantanamo will close. What is hard is taking a \ndeliberative, methodical approach and then formulating the proper plan \nto balance the safety of this country with the needs of lawful \ndetention. Had the administration conducted a careful and thorough \nreview of this issue, the conclusion would have been that Guantanamo \nfulfills both requirements. Instead, the administration has painted \nitself into a corner.\n  Clearly, the administration miscalculated and underestimated the \ndepth and breadth of this issue. From the onset, the administration has \ntried to reverse-engineer the process for closing Guantanamo--starting \nfrom the end and working backward. If changes are not made immediately, \nadministration officials will force this issue on American cities and \ntowns in just 185 days. They will limp across the finish line. We have \n185 days until Guantanamo is closed. The days until the plan is \nreleased ARE a big question mark. They are going to limp across the \nfinish line on January 22, 2010, and herald their accomplishments a \nvictory despite its ill-conceived planning and three stooges-like \nmanner of execution.\n\n  Guantanamo is still an asset to this country. It complies with \ninternational treaties and exceeds the standards of domestic \ncorrections facilities. I don't see how anyone who is honest about this \nmatter can characterize it in any other way, especially when there is \nnot a sufficient replacement located domestically to meet the Justice \nDepartment's needs. It is my fervent hope that the President and \nAttorney General will reconsider their ill-considered plan to close \nGuantanamo and recognize the obvious, that a $200 million facility that \nis already operational and in compliance with international treaties \nshould not be shuttered.\n  This is an important issue. I don't think the American people are \ngoing to stand to have these very dangerous people brought on shore to \nour country when we have a $200 million facility that meets \ninternational treaty obligations sitting there doing the job. I think \nthe administration needs to get\n\n[[Page S7771]]\n\nthis work done and needs to get it done the right way.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 3 weeks ago I sent a letter to families \nacross my home State of Washington asking for their help as we reform \nour broken health care system. I told them I wanted to pass a plan that \nprotects existing coverage when it is good, improves it when it is not, \nand guarantees care for the millions who have none. I asked them to \nshare their stories with me and ideas about how to make this vision a \nreality. I told them that I know health care is a very personal issue, \nbut also that personal stories have the power to change minds and \ntransform debates. The response to my request has been simply \noverwhelming.\n  I wish to share some of the stories that have been pouring into my \noffice--over 5,000 so far--because they underscore not only the \ndesperate need to fix our broken health care system but also the dire \nnecessity to get it done this year.\n  For too many families today, health care reform can't wait. I wish to \nshare a story from a letter I received from Rita from Seattle who sent \nme a story about her sister Janet. Janet was unemployed and had lost \nher health insurance when her throat began to hurt one day back in \n2004. She paid out of her own pocket to visit a health clinic and was \nsent home with antibiotics. Well, weeks later, she was still in a lot \nof pain and finally managed to get an appointment with a specialist, \nbut she was told she had to wait 6 weeks more to come in to get help. \nOnly after begging them for an appointment was she seen by the \nspecialist 3 days later and was told that the pain she had been living \nwith was in the late stages of an aggressive form of throat cancer. \nJanet died not long after that. It was a death that would have been \nprevented had she been able to see a specialist earlier.\n  Janet is not alone. A woman by the name of Kathleen from Puyallup, \nWA, sent in a story about her friend Kelly. Kelly had just been laid \noff from work when she came down with what she thought was the flu. She \ndidn't have any health insurance because she had been laid off from her \njob and she couldn't afford to go to the doctor, so she waited. Two \nweeks later she felt even worse, so she finally made an appointment to \ngo in for a checkup. Kelly never made it to the doctor. Her 7-year-old \nson found her dead on the couch on the morning she was supposed to go \nin. She died from an untreated ovarian cyst. Because Kelly didn't have \nhealth insurance, that little boy no longer has a mother.\n  I think the fact that these stories are possible in the greatest and \nrichest country in the world is simply shameful. No son should lose a \nmother simply because she can't afford care. No family should have to \nwatch a loved one suffer because insurance companies instead of doctors \nare making the decisions. That is why we so badly need to reform our \nhealth care system this year.\n  Our country has been working on this issue for over 60 years and we \nhave spent months and months this session alone working to put together \na reform package that works for all Americans. We have had over 6 \nmonths of hearings. We went through over 50 hours of public markups. We \ndebated over 200 amendments. So when I hear some of my colleagues from \nacross the aisle saying we should slow down, saying we should take more \ntime, or that we are trying to reform health care too fast, and when I \nsee some of them shrugging off every attempt we have made at engaging \nthem and bringing them into the process, I think of Kelly and I think \nof Janet and I think of all of the families out there right now with \nsick husbands or sick wives or sick kids. I think of all the small \nbusiness owners I have talked to who can't cover their employees. I \nthink of the people who have coverage, but are worried about losing it \ntoday in this uncertain economy. I think about all the working \nAmericans who are paying a hidden tax today in the form of rising \npremiums in order to cover those Americans who don't have access to \ncare. As a mother and as a Senator, I say enough is enough.\n  Yesterday we heard some pretty ugly and blatant rhetoric. One Member \nof the Senate who wants to protect the status quo, who doesn't want to \nmake any changes, said: ``If we're able to stop Obama on this, it will \nbe his Waterloo. It will break him.''\n  That is playing games with real lives in order to score cheap \npolitical points. Bucking health care reform isn't going to break the \nPresident of the United States. It will break American families. It \nwill break American businesses. It is going to break the bank.\n  Americans deserve better. The families of Janet and Kelly and the \nthousands of others who have written me deserve better. We can't play \npolitics with what is most important to our Nation's families--the \nhealth of their loved ones.\n  They say justice delayed is justice denied. Well, health care delayed \nis often health care denied. It was denied to Kelly, it was denied to \nJanet, and it gets denied to more Americans every single day we wait.\n  I call on all of our colleagues here in the Senate to work with us to \nrise above partisanship. We have a good plan right now. We are working \nto listen and bring everybody in and make it better. It will rein in \nthe costs with the goal of lowering them across the long term. It will \nmake sure all Americans have high quality, affordable coverage.\n  This issue is not going to go away if we don't do anything. It is not \ngoing to get better or easier if we wait. In fact, today, costs are \nrising at an unsustainable rate for those who do have insurance and \nmore and more Americans are losing their insurance every day.\n  We have been talking about reforming the health care system for a \nvery long time. I go home to my home State of Washington every weekend, \nand I am asked often now if it is the right time to tackle health care \nreform. In these difficult and challenging economic times when people \nare worried about paying their bills, worried about losing their jobs, \nworried about what is coming around the corner, they ask me if we are \nbiting off more than we can chew. I tell them: This is exactly the time \nwe need to act. Premiums are rising three times faster than wages \ntoday. Every day, 14,000 more Americans lose their health insurance. In \nthese already difficult times, I don't want to add losing health \ninsurance to the list of concerns our families have to deal with every \nday.\n  We know the current system is unsustainable. Even those people with \ngood coverage today are faced with massive costs and rising premiums. \nThat is why tackling this problem now has to be part of our long-term \neconomic recovery program.\n  Without health care reform, family budgets are going to continue to \nbe strapped, more Americans are going to lose their care, and we are \ngoing to hear more stories like Janet and Kelly. I hope we can put \naside the partisan rhetoric, I hope we can put aside the talk of: Slow \nthis down; it is too fast. This issue is imperative, and I urge my \ncolleagues to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to Senator Thune's amendment regarding concealed carry \nreciprocity. This legislation ignores the explosion of gun crime \nplaguing America's cities and putting an unnecessary burden on local \nlaw enforcement.\n  In my home State of Illinois, an entire generation of young people, \nmany of whom live in urban areas, is being decimated with gun violence. \nOn May 10 of 2007, a 16-year-old honor student named Blair Holt was \nshot to death while riding a Chicago city bus. When the shooter opened \nfire, Blair was shot while protecting a young girl with whom he was \nriding. The shooter was also a 16-year-old boy and an admitted member \nof the Gangster Disciples national street gang. Just the other day, \njustice was presented to him when he was given 100 years in prison by \nthe judge.\n  Similar tragic stories have only grown more frequent. In the first 6 \nmonths of 2009, Chicago alone logged 202 homicides, 84 percent of whom \nwere\n\n[[Page S7772]]\n\nshot to death. In comparison, in the same period of time, we lost 101 \ntroops in Iraq and 99 in Afghanistan.\n  The people of Chicago deserve better than life in a war zone. \nHundreds of Chicago public school students have been shot so far this \nyear. By the end of the school year in June, at least 36 had died.\n  Over the Fourth of July weekend, while most of us celebrated our \nNation's independence, Chicago suffered through an almost unparalleled \ntorrent of gun violence: 63 shootings were tallied, and 11 of them were \nfatal.\n  The carnage on Independence Day weekend led the Chicago Tribune to \ndemand on July 10: ``Where is our courage? Where is the indignation \nover the slaughter of Chicago's children?''\n  This is far too high a price to pay for inaction. I will say it \nagain: The people of Chicago deserve better than life in a war zone. \nStudents deserve better than being gunned down in the streets after \nschool and parents deserve better than having to raise families in the \nmidst of a bloodbath. We must work vigorously to combat the rampant gun \nviolence in our cities and urban areas.\n  As a registered gun owner myself, I respect the second amendment and \nresponsible gun ownership. However, I am deeply concerned about the \ndevastating consequences of guns falling into the wrong hands. To this \nend, I strongly believe we should keep firearms out of the hands of \nchildren, terrorists, and criminals, and in solving this problem we \nneed to provide local law enforcement officials with the support they \nso desperately need.\n  Concealed carry regulation is an issue best left to cities and States \nand not the Federal Government. It is our job as Federal legislators to \nenact measures that strengthen States' law enforcement efforts instead \nof arbitrarily increasing their burden. A national standard of \nreciprocity would ignore the challenges local law enforcement struggles \nwith on a daily basis when combating gangs and drug dealers in big \ncities.\n  I am not alone in my opposition to the Thune amendment. I join the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police and State lawmakers \naround the country in recognizing that this legislation would severely \nhamper efforts to combat gun crime in our Nation's urban areas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 2 letters from the the \nmayor of the city of Chicago, Mayor Daley, and the Major Cities Chiefs \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, July 17, 2009.\n     Hon. Roland W. Burris,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burris: I am writing to express the City of \n     Chicago's strong opposition to Senator Thune's amendment \n     regarding concealed carry reciprocity, and to urge you to \n     vote against this amendment as part of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (S. 1390).\n       Although the State of Illinois would not be affected \n     directly by its passage, this amendment runs the possible \n     risk of reinforcing current movements in the Illinois \n     legislature to pass concealed-carry laws, which would greatly \n     set back Chicago's efforts to curtail gun violence. Concealed \n     carry regulation is an issue best left to cities and states, \n     and not the Federal government. A national standard of \n     reciprocity would ignore the challenges local law enforcement \n     struggle with on a daily basis when combating gangs and drug \n     dealers in big cities.\n       Pasasge of this amendment would limit the ability of states \n     and local governments to protect their citizens with common-\n     sense and community-specific laws and regulations regarding \n     the carrying of hidden handguns. It would promote gun \n     trafficking by making it easier to transport firearms between \n     states without the fear of being apprehended by law \n     enforcement. The bill would also endanger the safety of our \n     police officers by making it more difficult to distinguish \n     between legal and illegal gun possession--ambiguity that \n     would have life or death consequences.\n       The City of Chicago continues to do all it can to protect \n     our communities from the gun violence of gangs and drug \n     dealers. It is a tireless effort that requires the \n     involvement of the community members, the hard work of local \n     law enforcement and sensible policy decisions made at all \n     levels of government. The Thune amendment would serve as an \n     obstacle to these efforts, and that is why I strongly urge \n     you to oppose this potentially debilitating legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard M. Daley,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Major Cities Chiefs Association,\n\n                                                    July 17, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, Hart Office Bldg., U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, Cannon Office Bldg., House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi: On behalf of \n     the Major Cities Chiefs, I am writing to express our strong \n     opposition to S. 845 and H.R. 1620, the Respecting States \n     Rights and Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2009. Because \n     we are responsible for public safety in the largest \n     jurisdictions in the United States, we recognize that this \n     legislation would be an enormous mistake.\n       This misguided legislation would undermine efforts by law \n     enforcement agencies across the Nation and thwart measures \n     already enacted by the states. Please know that we stand with \n     the more than 400 Mayors who have objected to this ill-\n     conceived proposal.\n       An oversimplification of carefully reasoned standards and \n     licensing provisions, the proposed measure would arbitrarily \n     overturn laws which have been tailored to the needs of \n     regions and local communities. Passage of this legislation \n     would be an affront to Federalism as it would force a state \n     to accept permits from other jurisdictions--whether or not \n     the permits comport with the laws of that state.\n       We are confident that members of Congress will respect the \n     authority of states, counties and cities to adopt their own \n     regulations regarding weapons and will not act with disregard \n     for the many reasonable and prudent laws already in place \n     across the Nation.\n       Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs call upon you to vote against \n     this dangerous and unconstitutional legislation.\n           All the best,\n\n                                           William J. Bratton,\n\n                                 Chief of Police, Los Angeles, CA,\n                      President, Major Cities Chiefs' Association.\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, as I said earlier, cities in every State \nface unique challenges that require tailored solutions. This is never \ntruer than with the issue of gun control. It is imperative that States \nset their own standards for concealed carry permits and are not \nobligated to honor permits awarded elsewhere with different, \npotentially less rigorous requirements. We must not tie the hands of \nState governments regarding their ability to protect and serve their \ncitizens.\n  I think that this legislation moves our national gun policy in the \nwrong direction. In their assessment of the recent gun violence, the \nTribune opined that ``The tragic loss of brave soldiers killed overseas \ngrabs media headlines and fuels the raging fires of political debate. \nMeanwhile, in another war right here in our own backyard, the killings \ncontinue, almost ignored.''\n  We cannot ignore this horrific situation any longer. We must not be \nconned into believing that easier access to firearms will reduce \nfirearm deaths. Rather than making it easier for people to bring \nconcealed weapons into other States, I hope my colleagues will get \nserious about addressing the urgent problem of gun crime in our cities \nand among our youth.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to not only vote against this amendment but \nto join me in working towards a real solution for this senseless cycle \nof death.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/21/senate-section/article/S7772-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7772-S7773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the community and \nbusiness leaders of Youngstown, OH, for showing the rest of the Nation \nwhat so many of us in Ohio already know: Youngstown is one of the \nNation's best places to start a business.\n  I have held some 140 community roundtables across Ohio's 88 counties \nat least once since I have been in the Senate, where I have met with \neducators, students, community and business leaders, and entrepreneurs \nand workers.\n  I have held a half dozen roundtables in the Mahoning Valley, \nincluding two in Youngstown, and have traveled across towns along the \nMahoning River and across its valley.\n  From the autoworker in Lordstown to the electrician in Warren, to the \ntechnology entrepreneur in Youngstown, to the small business owner in \nSalem, I am impressed by their unwavering commitment to rebuilding this \nregion.\n  Youngstown remains a great city in the face of many challenges, and \nits\n\n[[Page S7773]]\n\ndedicated and talented workforce is driving today's innovation and \ningenuity.\n  Each time I visit Youngstown, I learn something new--from Mayor \nWilliams, the fine, aggressive, very bright, young mayor of Youngstown, \nto Chamber of Commerce leader Tom Humphries, to dozens of teachers, \nsmall business people, workers, and citizens.\n  It is easy to see why Entrepreneur Magazine lists Youngstown as one \nof the top 10 U.S. cities to start a business. On the cover it says: \n``Youngstown, Ohio, anyone?''\n  In their August issue, Entrepreneur Magazine describes Youngstown as \na ``dreamer,'' where technology innovation is driving job growth and \nsustaining economic activity.\n  Bold plans and visionary leadership have set the stage for sustained \neconomic growth. Youngstown's healthy dose of all-American grit and \nhard work will turn economic potential into economic reality, driving \nregional economic expansion that can strengthen Ohio's middle class.\n  It takes what Entrepreneur Magazine called a ``concept revolutionary \nenough to help ignite a renaissance in this small city.''\n  It takes a community that understands a transformation must take \nplace from within--from the educators to innovators, from community \nactivists to the industry leaders. Faced with a choice, it takes the \nforesight to invest in the future and not dwell on the sometimes \ntroubled past.\n  Today, we are seeing the results of a decade-long process of renewal \nand rebirth for Youngstown, in Warren, and the entire Mahoning Valley.\n  More than a year ago, I made my first trip to the Youngstown Business \nIncubator, which is an example of community and business leaders \nnurturing startup companies that can strengthen the regional economy.\n  Nurtured in the Youngstown Business Incubator in 2002, Turning \nTechnologies, for example, has become one of the fastest growing \ntechnology companies in the Nation, according to Entrepreneur Magazine.\n  This is no accident. Mike Broderick, from Turning Technologies, and \nother emerging businesses, say they have relied on the affordable \nstartup costs, accessible resources, the transportation network that \ncriss-crosses western Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the community \ninvolvement that allowed businesses to thrive.\n  An important part of Youngstown's favorable business climate is \naccess to talented workers and students. Kent State's Trumbull campus \nis a model for workforce training among Ohio's colleges and \nuniversities. Their educators are training a legion of highly skilled \nworkers for Ohio's emerging high-tech industry.\n  But more must be done to close the gap between high unemployment in \nthat part of Ohio. My whole State is still afflicted by high \nunemployment and this terrible recession. More must be done to close \nthe gap between the high unemployment and the shortage of skilled \nworkers and emerging industries.\n  Congressman Tim Ryan, with whom the Presiding Officer and I both \nserved in the House of Representatives, and who represents Youngstown \nin the House, and I recently introduced the Strengthening Employment \nClusters to Organize Regional Success, or SECTORS Act.\n  SECTORS would help allow businesses, workforce development boards, \nlabor unions, and community colleges to connect skilled workers with \nworkforce and community needs. We will see that with Youngstown State \nUniversity in Youngstown, and with the Trumbull County branch of Kent \nState University.\n  SECTORS is not only a jobs skill bill, but an economic development \nbill. It is only one part of the citywide strategy to harness the \ntalented workforce and students.\n  Youngstown State University is training engineers and contributing to \nworkforce needs of an emerging advanced materials sector, involving \nadvanced chemical and composite engineering and nanotechnology. I have \nseen some of this technology in the Mahoning Valley, and it is ready to \ntake off.\n  YSU's science, technology, engineering, and math program, or STEM, \nteaches students the critical skills in the fields of advanced \nsciences, information technology, and engineering.\n  If our students succeed in the 21st century global economy, we must \ninvest in our young people, who will create the businesses and \nopportunities for future growth.\n  We must also ensure that our communities are part of economic revival \naround the State.\n  I met with the Mahoning Valley Organizing Collaborative at one of my \nroundtables. We sat for an hour and a half in the basement of a church, \nwith 15 community activists, who have a focus you wouldn't believe. \nThis is a collective effort of neighborhood groups, churches, and labor \nunions. It is another example of citizens taking ownership of their \ncommunity. It is revitalizing neighborhoods, surveying land to \ndetermine future economic use, and cleaning up crime-ridden \nneighborhoods. Ordinary citizens are organizing to make a difference, \nand it is working.\n  Yet another example of strategic economic development is the \nYoungstown 2010 Citywide Plan, which aims to revitalize the city of \nYoungstown with carefully planned economic development and urban \nplanning.\n  As Ohio cities experience population loss, Youngstown's efforts to \nmodernize infrastructure to serve current population needs is a \nharbinger of economic growth in the State.\n  All of these efforts are part of a collective strategy by workers, \nentrepreneurs, educators, and elected officials to tap into the \nregion's rich resources and innovative spirit. That is why Entrepreneur \nMagazine wrote about Youngstown, calling it the ``dreamer.'' Out of \nthese 10 cities, the other 9 are significantly larger than Youngstown, \nbut none could equal Youngstown in hope, focus, and energy.\n  I will read some things they said:\n\n       In the last decade, something special happened in this \n     northeast Ohio city. A new generation is envisioning things \n     we wouldn't have talked about 10 years ago. ``Let's clean the \n     slate and start over again'' is the radical transformation \n     going on in Youngstown right now.\n\n  Mike Broderick, of Turning Technologies, said:\n\n       I believe in most places we wouldn't have been able to \n     expand with the speed we did. The affordability here really \n     helped fuel our growth. I found Youngstown to be a brilliant \n     place for a startup.\n\n  It has been my pleasure to work with Congressman Ryan, Mayor \nWilliams, the Youngstown Business Incubator, Turning Technologies, and \nall of the community activists who are working hard to create new \nopportunities for a better and stronger Youngstown.\n  Ohio's dedicated workforce and hard-working community leaders are \nleading examples of how we can turn around our economy, create new \njobs, and how we can, across my State, and across the Mahoning Valley \nin Ohio, and across this country, rebuild our middle class.\n  Mr. President, before yielding the floor, I add that all of us who do \nthis work and are, frankly, blessed enough to get to serve in the \nSenate spend much of our time away from home or our families are back, \nin my case, in Ohio, or in Washington. Either way, we are away from \nfamilies more than we would like. I would like to, because today is my \nwife's birthday, wish her a happy birthday, if she is home watching \nthis. If she is not, I will tell her later. I could not be with her \ntoday in Ohio. I look forward to coming home this weekend.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/21/senate-section/article/S7773-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7773-S7774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING MASON RUDD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today with sadness to honor the \nlife of Mr. Mason Rudd, a good friend who died on July 5, 2009, at the \nage of 90. He was loved by many in my hometown of Louisville, KY, and \nhe will be missed.\n  Mason will be remembered as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and \nfamily man who did so much to make his adopted hometown a better place.\n  His American dream began at the University of Minnesota, where he \nfunded his college education with help from a tennis scholarship, \nparticipation in ROTC, and by selling doughnuts. In 1939, he graduated \nwith a degree in geology and petroleum engineering. After college, his \nservice in World War II led him to believe that he survived the war for \none reason--to\n\n[[Page S7774]]\n\nhelp others achieve and live better lives. And this he did.\n  Mr. Rudd spent a few years working as an engineer for Shell Oil and \nthen selling fire engines in Iowa until 1952 when he moved to \nLouisville. There he established Rudd Equipment Company, which \ndistributed heavy construction equipment. The company he built brought \nhim a large fortune which would serve him well when he undertook his \nmany altruistic pursuits.\n  Mason grew to love the city and especially the local university--the \nUniversity of Louisville. He contributed $1.4 million to the creation \nof a neurology professorship at the University of Louisville after his \nfirst wife Mary suffered a fatal stroke. His help facilitated the $3.6 \nmillion Bass-Rudd Tennis Center at the University of Louisville as well \nas the endowment for the Rudd Program for Young Artists at the Kentucky \nOpera to train young singers.\n  However, more important than the money, Mr. Rudd contributed \ninvaluable time and effort to the causes of health care and education.\n  Thirty years ago, this passion was clear to me when I served as \nJefferson County's judge-executive and it was my responsibility to \nappoint someone to the county's board of health. I reappointed him to \nthe board, just as those serving before me had and those after me did.\n  While serving on this board as well as in leadership positions at \nLouisville General Hospitals and Louisville's Jewish Hospital, his \nefforts provided everyone in the city with a healthier, safer life. His \nfellow members credit him with creating lead poisoning education \nprograms, a hazardous-materials task force in the health department, a \nmandate on sewage treatment, and primary care clinics for the \nuninsured.\n  His efforts also extended to helping the Louisville Free Library \nFoundation during his 16 years on the board there. Because of him the \nlibrary's book endowment is stronger and the children's reading program \ncontinues to grow. Most notably, in the year 2000 library fundraising \nefforts under his leadership made it possible to purchase computers for \nthe library.\n  Mr. Rudd leaves behind his wife Peggy: his daughter Betsy; and his \nson Michael. The life he led in his 90 years stands out as an example \nof service to his community and country which all Americans should \nhonor and strive to achieve. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/21/senate-section/article/S7774-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n        Command Master Chief Petty Officer Jeffrey James Garber\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Navy \nCommand Master Chief Jeffrey James Garber who passed away aboard the \nUSS Eisenhower on June 20, 2009.\n  Originally from Hemingford, NE, Master Chief Garber enlisted in the \nNavy in December 1983. His career was an impressive one. At sea his \nassignments included time aboard the USS Worden, USS Nimitz, USS \nPortland, and Strike Fighter Squadron 34; and he had been assigned to \nthe USS Eisenhower since June 2008. The Eisenhower is currently \noperating in the Arabian Sea in support of Operation Enduring Freedom \nand maritime security operations.\n  Master Chief Garber's military awards include the Meritorious Service \nMedal: Navy/Marine Corps Commendation Medal; Navy/Marine Corps \nAchievement Medal, six; Meritorious Unit Commendation; Good Conduct \nMedal, five; Navy Expeditionary Medal; National Defense Service Medal, \ntwo; Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal, \ntwo; Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, six; And Navy Recruiting Service \nRibbon.\n  On June 20, Command Master Chief Jeffrey James Garber was found \nunresponsive in a berthing space aboard the carrier, USS Dwight D. \nEisenhower. When he was found unresponsive in his stateroom at \napproximately 8:15 A.M. local time, a medical emergency was declared; \nand medical personnel were on the scene within minutes. Sadly, all \nefforts to revive him were unsuccessful, and Master Chief Garber was \npronounced dead of natural causes at 8:23 A.M. He was 43 years old. \nCommand Master Chief Garber has been posthumously awarded the Legion of \nMerit medal, recognizing his accomplishments as Command Master Chief \nand his 24 years of service to our Nation.\n  Command Master Chief Garber leaves behind his wife Amy, (Vogt) \nGarber, and his three children, Tayler, Paige and Josh, all of Virginia \nBeach; his parents Larry and JoAnn Kuester of York, NE; and his \nbrothers Joel and Jon. Throughout his career, those who knew him, \nadmired Master Chief Garber's professionalism, but also, genuinely \nliked him. He will forever be remembered by his family and friends as \nnot only the epitome of what a command master chief should be, but \nprimarily a loving husband, father, and son. I join all Nebraskans \ntoday in mourning the loss of Command Master Chief Garber and offering \nour deepest condolences to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/21/senate-section/article/S7774-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF NORTHWOOD, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On \nJuly 23-26, the residents of Northwood will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Founded in 1884, Northwood is located in Northeastern ND, and was \nnamed after Northwood, IA, a common starting point for pioneers \nsettling in the Dakota Territory. In its early years, the town grew \nrapidly, and continued to expand over the next century. It was honored \nin 1993 by the North Dakota League of Cities as City of the Year.\n  In 2007, Northwood was devastated by an EF4 tornado. Not a single \nbuilding was left untouched by this monstrous storm that wreaked havoc \non everything in its path. Homes and businesses were destroyed, yet \namidst all of the destruction, this community banded together, and with \nthe assistance of the federal government, it has successfully rebuilt.\n  Today, Northwood is a friendly and welcoming community that includes \na nine-hole golf course, a swimming pool, a strong business community, \nand a high quality education system. Additionally, the town remains \ntrue to its agricultural roots through its farming population.\n  The central point of Northwood's 125th anniversary celebration will \nbe the dedication of the new Northwood Public School and the Veteran's \nMemorial. Other activities, to name a few, include a community picnic, \na tractor pull, a teen dance, karaoke, a 5K walk and run, a craft show, \na kiddie parade, and a 3-on-3 basketball tournament.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Northwood, ND, and its \nresidents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the \nfuture. By honoring Northwood and all other historic small towns of \nNorth Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Northwood that have helped \nshape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine \ncommunity is deserving of our recognition.\n  Northwood has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/21/senate-section/article/S7774-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7774-S7775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING ABIGAIL KIMBELL\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a leader in \nAmerican forestry.\n  In February of 2007, Abigail Kimbell became the 16th Chief of the \nU.S. Forest Service. She was the first female in this role, a job she \nheld until July 5, 2009. During those 2\\1/2\\ years, she served with \ndistinction and accomplished much for the forests, grasslands, and \npeople of the United States.\n  Gail is credited with renewing the emphasis behind the Forest \nService's mission of ``Caring for the Land and Serving People'' and \nreconnecting programs and functions to that mission. She improved \nfirefighter safety and fire suppression cost containment. Gail showed \ngreat vision and leadership, pressing the agency to continually strive \nto meet a standard of excellence in its operations, both internally and \nin service to the public.\n  Gail emphasized the importance of quality water to the environment \nand our communities. She directed the agency's investment in the \neducation of children and youth, particularly those in underrepresented \ncommunities, to enhance their connection to the natural world.\n\n[[Page S7775]]\n\n  Gail's numerous and significant contributions span more than three \ndecades of public service. As a Forest Supervisor, she focused on \ncommunity collaboration to build understanding and support for an \neconomically and environmentally viable long-term timber sale program \nin Alaska. She also made bold land management decisions to ensure \nforests remained healthy by reducing hazardous fuels.\n  As associate deputy chief for the national forest system, Gail was \ncentral to the development of the Healthy Forests Initiative, including \nthe Healthy Forests Restoration Act. She also worked to improve \ninteragency cooperation.\n  As regional forester in the northern region, she oversaw the \ndevelopment and implementation of community wildfire protection plans \nin Idaho, Montana, and North Dakota. She also played a leading role in \nthe development of plans to delist the grizzly bear in the Yellowstone \nEcosystem. Gail pioneered the implementation of improved forest \nplanning with unprecedented public collaboration and ownership.\n  On July 31, 2009, Gail Kimbell will be retiring from the Forest \nService with 35-plus years of service to that agency and our country. \nHer dedication to the Forest Service mission ``to sustain the health, \ndiversity, and productivity of the Nation's forests and grasslands to \nmeet the needs of present and future generations'' will be forever \nappreciated by the people of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/21/senate-section/article/S7775-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:56 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2245.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. McCASKILL:\n  S. 1476. A bill to require all new and upgraded fuel pumps to be \nequipped with automatic temperature compensation equipment, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL.\n  Mr. President, today I am here to talk about a simple bill that would \ncorrect a serious injustice.\n  Each year U.S. consumers spend $2.57 billion more than they should \nfor gasoline and diesel fuel. This is because they are buying hot fuel. \nThe physics behind hot fuel are fairly simple. Retailers currently \nmeasure our gasoline as it if is stored at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. \nHowever, if the temperature increases, as it often does during the \nsummer or in warm climates, the gasoline expands so that consumers are \ngetting less energy per gallon of fuel. Yet, when consumers buy hot \nfuel, they are paying the same amount even though they are getting less \nenergy.\n  This problem can be easily solved by installing temperature \ncompensating equipment that will regulate the distribution of fuel \nbased on its temperature at the time of purchase. A similar policy was \nimplemented in Canada 15 years ago because retailers were losing money \ndue to the cold temperature of the fuel they were selling; and earlier \nthis year, the U.S. retailer Costco Warehouse, LLC agreed to install \nthis temperature compensating equipment as a result of a legal \nsettlement.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that would require all retailers \nof gasoline to install temperature compensating equipment on their \nretail fuel pumps. The Future Accountability in Retail Fuel Act of \n2009, or the FAIR Fuel Act, is not intended to be onerous. It would \nsimply require that within 6 years after enactment of this legislation \nall retail gasoline pumps would include automatic temperature \ncompensating equipment. Prior to that 6 year timeline, if a retailer \nreplaces their pumps, they must replace it with a pump that will be \nable to compensate for temperature fluctuations. Rural retail gasoline \nowners are exempt from this replacement requirement and the bill \nprovides grant assistance for small retail owners to retrofit or \npurchase pumps with temperature compensating equipment.\n  American families deserve to be treated fairly. They deserve to get \nwhat they pay for. With the current economic crisis and the high prices \nof gasoline, every penny we can save the consumer will go along way to \nhelping them survive these tough times. This legislation will help to \nachieve this goal. It will finally give consumers the fairness they \ndeserve.\n  I am pleased that this bill has been endorsed by the Owner-Operator \nIndependent Drivers Association, OOIDA, USPIRG and Consumer Watchdog. I \nlook forward to working with the members of the Commerce Committee and \nthe full Senate in getting this legislation passed. I think we owe it \nto the American consumers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SAVINGS PROVISION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act may be construed to preempt a State \n     from enacting a law that imposes an equivalent standard or a \n     more stringent standard concerning the retail sale of \n     gasoline at certain temperatures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1477. A bill to establish a user fee for follow-up reinspections \nunder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that would \ncharge a reinspection fee for goods that fail FDA inspection for good \nmanufacturing practices. Currently, businesses do not have to pay for \nthe second inspection if they fail. Essentially, then, the FDA is \nabsorbing this extra cost. This Nation faces difficult enough choices \nwithout subsidizing private companies that fail basic inspections. I am \npleased to credit the Bush administration for originally proposing this \nfee, which is again proposed in President Obama's fiscal year 2010 \nbudget. This fee carries proposed savings of an estimated $24 million \nper year, and could save as much as $115 million over 5 years.\n  We must ensure that U.S. taxpayer money is being used efficiently and \neffectively, and this measure would help in our ongoing efforts to \nstreamline government programs and reduce the Federal budget deficit. \nFDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach testified about these fees \nbefore the House Agriculture, Rural Development, and FDA Appropriations \nSubcommittee in 2006. He believes, and I agree, that the reinspection \nfee will motivate businesses to comply with long-established health and \nsafety standards. Businesses that do not meet Federal standards should \nbear the burden of the reinspection, rather than getting a free pass at \nthe taxpayer's expense.\n  One of the main reasons I first ran for the U.S. Senate was to \nrestore fiscal responsibility to the Federal budget. I have worked \nthroughout my Senate career to eliminate wasteful spending and to \nreduce the budget deficit. Unless we return to fiscally responsible \nbudgeting, Congress will saddle our nation's younger generations with \nan enormous financial burden for years to come. This bill is one small \nstep in that direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Begich, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 1480. A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to establish \na program to improve the health and education of children through \ngrants to expand school breakfast programs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Kohl to \nintroduce the Student Breakfast and Education Improvement Act as part \nof my continued efforts to improve student achievement in our Nation's \nschools. One part of student performance that is often overlooked is \nnutrition, which can have a significant impact on student achievement. \nI know many of my colleagues share my support for school programs that \nhelp alleviate hunger for the most in-need students, such as the Free \nand Reduced Price Lunch Program, as well as those programs that provide \nmore nutritious food, such as the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack \nprogram.\n  I am sure that I am not the only member of this body who grew up \nhearing that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I was \nlucky never to have to worry about going hungry, and my parents did not \nhave to choose between giving their children lunch or breakfast. The \nfact is, that is a choice many parents do have to make today, even if \nthey get the help of reduced price meals. The current economic \ndifficulties and rising unemployment have only increased the burdens \nfacing low income families in Wisconsin and around the country as they \nstruggle to provide nutritious meals for their children.\n  The Student Breakfast and Education Improvement Act would provide \ngrants for schools wishing to begin or expand universal school \nbreakfast programs. Studies show that kids who eat breakfast perform \nbetter in school and\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\non tests, and they tend to be less disruptive to the class. I have \nheard many stories from teachers, school nurses, and other school \nofficials over the years to confirm this. In fact, in my home State of \nWisconsin, the Milwaukee Public Schools have been working with the \nHunger Task Force for the past few years to implement universal school \nbreakfast programs, which they have in place now in more than 80 \nschools. This program, which has expanded in its second year, has \nproven popular with students, teachers, and parents.\n  This bill would target the most in-need schools--those with 65 \npercent or more of students eligible for the free and reduced price \nlunch program--with the funds necessary to implement a universal free \nbreakfast program. The grants, which could be used in a number of ways, \naim to help schools overcome the numerous barriers faced in trying to \ncreate a school breakfast program.\n  Our Nation faces a series of pressing education challenges in its \nschools, including most significantly a large achievement gap and \ngraduation rate gap among minority and low income students. After \ndecades of civil rights struggles, public education should provide all \nour students with access to equal opportunities, but the quality of \npublic education provided to students of color and low-income students \nin urban and rural Wisconsin and around the country still does not come \nclose to affording many of these students an equal chance for success. \nToo often these students learn in crumbling and outdated buildings, \nthey do not have the same access to high quality technology in their \nclassrooms, they are taught by the least experienced teachers, and they \noften do not have adequate access to important resources like school \ncounselors and nurses.\n  These and a number of other factors contribute to the achievement gap \nin our Nation's schools and the Federal Government can help to address \nthis gap by promoting smarter and more flexible accountability \nstructures and increased supports for schools during the upcoming \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Congress \nshould also help to address some of the many other issues facing our \nnation's students living in poverty issues that may not seem directly \nrelated to education, but impact the academic growth of students \nincluding hunger, affordable housing, and crime. This bill takes an \nimportant step to address hunger and also seeks to improve nutrition \neducation by providing funds to expand school breakfast programs, boost \ncollaboration between local farmers and schools, expand service-\nlearning opportunities in our classrooms, and improve nutrition \neducation programming for students.\n  In this economy, more and more parents are forced to make these kinds \nof decisions, and the school meal programs can provide a tremendous \nrelief. As we look forward to reauthorizing the Child Nutrition Act, it \nis vital that we take stock of the successes and limitations of \nexisting programs. School breakfast faces a number of hurdles that, \nquite simply, other school feeding programs do not. Chief of those is \ntime. For some students, getting to school early is impossible; for \nsome, the lure of breakfast is not a strong enough draw to get up \nearlier. These are problems that schools across the country are facing \nand solving with creativity and dedication. This legislation will help \nsupport the innovative work going on in some of our nation's schools \nand will help to scale up successful nutrition programs in other \nschools so that hopefully one day, none of America's students will \nstart the school day hungry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON, of Florida (for himself and Mr. Martinez):\n  S. 1484. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to create \nCatastrophe Savings Accounts; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, last year we were all \ntransfixed by the non-stop news coverage of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike \nas they grew into monster storms, crossing the Caribbean and Gulf of \nMexico and leaving a trail of misery in their wake. Ike, the third most \ndestructive storm in the history of the U.S., made landfall in \nGalveston, Texas, and then tracked through Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, \nMissouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, killing 112 people and causing more \nthan $24 billion in damage.\n  Since 2003, hurricanes and other tropical cyclones have caused more \nthan 2,000 deaths in the U.S. Forty percent of all hurricanes that make \nlandfall in the U.S. hit Florida.\n  Insured losses from hurricanes average more than $5.2 billion per \nyear. A recent study of hurricane-related damages over the last century \nsuggests that economic losses will double every 10 years. With more \nthan 50 percent of the U.S. population living within 50 miles of the \ncoast, and with 180 million people visiting the coast annually, the \nrisks to life and property are growing.\n  Hurricanes, however, do not just impact the coasts. These extreme \nevents also have national consequences, such as increased fuel prices, \ndisplaced populations, and severe inland flooding.\n  The American public is increasingly aware of the potential for high \nrecovery costs and financing of natural disaster losses. I cannot \noverstate the importance of prior preparation and insurance coverage \nfor large catastrophic risks--including natural disasters such as \nhurricanes and earthquakes--as well as efforts to promote a stable, \naffordable catastrophic insurance market.\n  This is why today Senator Martinez and I are introducing four bills: \nthe Commission on Catastrophic Disaster Risk and Insurance Act of 2009, \nS. 1487, the Policyholder Disaster Protection Act of 2009, S. 1486, the \nCatastrophe Savings Accounts Act of 2009, S. 1484, and the National \nHurricane Research Initiative Act of 2009, 1485. These bills take a \npro-active approach in addressing these natural catastrophe concerns.\n  The National Hurricane Research Initiative Act of 2009 will expand \nthe scope of fundamental research on hurricanes. The bill is aimed at \nimproving hurricane forecasting and tracking and helping us find better \nways to mitigate their impact. The Act will establish a National \nScience Foundation (NSF) grant program for hurricane and tropical \ncyclone research and bring together a task force, jointly chaired by \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, NIST, and NSF.\n  The second bill, the Commission on Catastrophic Disaster Risk and \nInsurance Act of 2009, establishes the bipartisan Commission on \nCatastrophic Disaster Risk and Insurance. This commission will assess \nthe condition of the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance \nmarkets in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in \n2005, as well as the four major hurricanes that struck the U.S. in \n2004. It will also evaluate the country's ongoing exposure to \nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and floods. Finally, the \ncommission will recommend and report legislative and regulatory changes \nthat will improve the domestic and international financial health and \ncompetitiveness of property and casualty insurance markets, assuring \nthe availability of adequate insurance when an insured event occurs, as \nwell as the best possible range of insurance products at competitive \nprices.\n  The Policyholder Disaster Protection Act of 2009 amends the Internal \nRevenue Code to allow property and casualty insurance companies to \ncreate tax-exempt disaster protection funds and to make tax deductible \ncontributions to those funds for the payment of policyholders' claims \narising from certain catastrophic events, such as windstorms, \nearthquakes, fires, and floods.\n  Finally, the Catastrophe Savings Accounts Act of 2009 amends the \nInternal Revenue Code to create tax-exempt catastrophe savings \naccounts. Individuals could take tax-free distributions from these \naccounts to pay expenses resulting from a presidentially declared major \ndisaster. The bill limits catastrophe savings account balances to \n$2,000 for individuals with homeowner insurance deductibles of not more \nthan $1,000, and the lesser of $15,000 or twice the homeowner's \ninsurance deductible for individuals with deductibles of more than \n$1,000.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, the entire country \nexperiences financial losses when hurricanes hit. It is time for us to \ntake the bull by the horns and pass legislation that plans in advance \nfor these and other natural disasters.\n  As we are in the hurricane season, it will become painfully apparent \njust\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\nhow precarious a lot of the construction is, how precarious building \ncodes are not being fairly and judiciously administered, and it will \nbecome evident what an economic disaster even a mild hurricane can \ncause when it hits the coast. And Lord knows, if the big one hits an \nurbanized part of the coast--and the big one is a category 4 or a \ncategory 5 hurricane--it is going to create economic chaos. It is going \nto cause the insurance industry to be on the brink of total collapse. \nAnd it will ultimately, just like Katrina, end up having the U.S. \nGovernment pay a major part of the economic bailout consequences of a \nnatural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake hitting the \nUnited States. We ought to get ahead of it and we ought to plan for it, \nand that is what this package of four bills Senator Martinez and I are \noffering will do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1484\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Policyholder Disaster \n     Protection Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Rising costs resulting from natural disasters are \n     placing an increasing strain on the ability of property and \n     casualty insurance companies to assure payment of homeowners' \n     claims and other insurance claims arising from major natural \n     disasters now and in the future.\n       (2) Present tax laws do not provide adequate incentives to \n     assure that natural disaster insurance is provided or, where \n     such insurance is provided, that funds are available for \n     payment of insurance claims in the event of future \n     catastrophic losses from major natural disasters, as present \n     law requires an insurer wishing to accumulate surplus assets \n     for this purpose to do so entirely from its after-tax \n     retained earnings.\n       (3) Revising the tax laws applicable to the property and \n     casualty insurance industry to permit carefully controlled \n     accumulation of pretax dollars in separate reserve funds \n     devoted solely to the payment of claims arising from future \n     major natural disasters will provide incentives for property \n     and casualty insurers to make natural disaster insurance \n     available, will give greater protection to the Nation's \n     homeowners, small businesses, and other insurance consumers, \n     and will help assure the future financial health of the \n     Nation's insurance system as a whole.\n       (4) Implementing these changes will reduce the possibility \n     that a significant portion of the private insurance system \n     would fail in the wake of a major natural disaster and that \n     governmental entities would be required to step in to provide \n     relief at taxpayer expense.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on Catastrophic \n     Disaster Risk and Insurance Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which struck the \n     United States in 2005, caused over $200 billion in total \n     economic losses, including insured and uninsured losses.\n       (2) Although private sector insurance is currently \n     available to spread some catastrophe-related losses \n     throughout the Nation and internationally, most experts \n     believe there will be significant insurance and reinsurance \n     shortages, resulting in dramatic rate increases for consumers \n     and businesses, and the unavailability of catastrophe \n     insurance.\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\n       (3) The Federal Government has provided and will continue \n     to provide billions of dollars and resources to pay for \n     losses from catastrophes, including hurricanes, volcanic \n     eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, and other disasters, at huge \n     costs to American taxpayers.\n       (4) The Federal Government has a critical interest in \n     ensuring appropriate and fiscally responsible risk management \n     of catastrophes. Mortgages require reliable property \n     insurance, and the unavailability of reliable property \n     insurance would make most real estate transactions \n     impossible. In addition, the public health, safety, and \n     welfare demand that structures damaged or destroyed in a \n     catastrophe be reconstructed as soon as possible. Therefore, \n     the inability of the private sector insurance and reinsurance \n     markets to maintain sufficient capacity to enable Americans \n     to obtain property insurance coverage in the private sector \n     endangers the national economy and the public health, safety, \n     and welfare.\n       (5) Multiple proposals have been introduced in the United \n     States Congress over the past decade to address catastrophic \n     risk insurance, including the creation of a national \n     catastrophic reinsurance fund and the revision of the Federal \n     tax code to allow insurers to use tax-deferred catastrophe \n     funds, yet Congress has failed to act on any of these \n     proposals.\n       (6) To the extent the United States faces high risks from \n     catastrophe exposure, essential technical information on \n     financial structures and innovations in the catastrophe \n     insurance market is needed.\n       (7) The most efficient and effective approach to assessing \n     the catastrophe insurance problem in the public policy \n     context is to establish a bipartisan commission of experts to \n     study the management of catastrophic disaster risk, and to \n     require such commission to timely report its recommendations \n     to Congress so that Congress can quickly craft a solution to \n     protect the American people.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to extend temporarily the 18-month period of \ncontinuation coverage under group health plans required under COBRA \ncontinuation coverage provisions so as to provide for a total period of \ncontinuation coverage of up to 24 months; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, today I rise to address a growing problem \nresulting from America's high levels of unemployment and economic \ndownturn. Congress is working to design health reform that will provide \naccess to quality, affordable insurance coverage for every American, \nbut as unemployment numbers continue to rise, help may not come in time \nto avoid coverage denials on the individual insurance market and \nunbearable economic strain for those job seekers whose COBRA coverage \nhas expired.\n  The Comprehensive Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 codified \n18 months of additional group rate coverage under employer sponsored \nplans following a triggering event such as job loss. This law has been \ninstrumental in providing continuity of health coverage for families. \nThe measure requires companies with over 20 employees to provide access \nto 18 months of continued coverage at the employee's expense, except in \ncases of firing for gross employee misconduct. Beneficiaries cover the \nadditional administrative expense, and may be charged up to 103 percent \nof their original premiums.\n  The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act provided help with health \ninsurance for families who lost their jobs after September 1, 2008 and \nthrough December of 2009. For those in this category, the federal \ngovernment provides nine months of subsidized premiums, with \nbeneficiaries covering 35 percent of premium costs. However, the \ndownturn started well before September of 2008.\n  For those that lost their job before September, and are still looking \nfor work, the situation is dire. Many are quickly facing the end of \ntheir 18 month eligibility period for COBRA. They hear about health \nreform but have no idea when it may come. Insurance exchanges to \nguaranteeing eligibility and reasonable premiums on the individual \nmarket could take years to set up. In the mean time, those who could \nhave afforded coverage under COBRA may instead have to resort to \nemergency room care and bankruptcy.\n  The Emergency COBRA Expansion Act of 2009 will give job seekers the \nopportunity to continue their COBRA coverage for up to an additional 6 \nmonths. The bill applies to all of those utilizing COBRA benefits as of \nthe date of bill passage, and would not extend anyone's coverage beyond \n12 months from the date of bill enactment. A year from now, our country \nwill be on the road to economic recovery, but in the meantime we need \nto help struggling families to stay insured and healthy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1489. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to create parity \namong small business contracting programs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise to introduce this bill \nin order to correct disparities among the Small Business \nAdministration's small business contracting programs. Building on my \nefforts to bring true parity to the program, this bill will create a \nmore equitable and flexible method for federal agencies to fairly \nallocate federal procurement dollars to small business contractors \nacross the nation. Earlier this year, I filed an amendment, cosponsored \nby my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, to create parity as part \nof S. 454, the Weapon\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\nSystems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. Unfortunately, that amendment \nwas not accepted.\n  For years it has been unclear to the acquisition community what, if \nany, the true order of preference is for determining which small \nbusiness contracting program is at the top of the agency's priority \nlist. The SBA's regulations state that there is parity among the \nprograms, and this had been the general practice in effect until two \nGovernment Accountability Office decisions were released on September \n19, 2008 and May 4, 2009.\n  The decisions stated that the Historically Underutilized Business \nZone, HUBZone, program had preference over all other small business \ncontracting programs. While the interpretation benefits HUBZone \nbusinesses, it comes at the expense of other vital small business \ncontracting programs. This targeted bill provides equity for the SBA's \nsmall business contracting programs.\n  The bill provides Federal agencies with the necessary flexibility to \nsatisfy their government-wide statutory small business contracting \ngoals. This bill makes clear to purchasing agencies that contracting \nofficers may award contracts to HUBZone, Service Disabled Veterans, \n8(a), or women-owned firms with equal deference to each program. It \nwould provide these agencies with the ability to achieve their goaling \nrequirements equally through an award to a HUBZone firm, a service-\ndisabled veteran-owned small business, and a small business \nparticipating in the 8(a) business development program. Of course this \nlist will also include women-owned small businesses once the women's \nprocurement program is fully implemented by the SBA.\n  In addition, this bill brings the SBA's contracting programs closer \nto true parity by giving HUBZones a subcontracting goal. HUBZones are \nthe only small business contracting program without a subcontracting \ngoal. In addition, the bill authorizes mentor protege programs modeled \nafter those used in the 8(a) program for HUBZones, service-disabled \nveteran and women-owned firms.\n  The essence of true parity is where each program has an equal chance \nof competing and being selected for an award. During these difficult \neconomic times, it is imperative that small business contractors \npossess an equal opportunity to compete for Federal contracts on the \nsame playing field with each other.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/21/senate-section/article/S7793-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 218--MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS FOR THE 111TH \n                                CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND \n                   COSTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THEIR \n                   FAMILIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Career members of the Armed Forces and their families \n     endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make \n     extraordinary sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-\n     year careers in protecting freedom for all Americans.\n       (2) The nature and extent of these demands and sacrifices \n     are never so evident as in wartime, not only during the \n     current combat operations, but also during the wars of the \n     last 60 years when current retired members of the Armed \n     Forces were on continuous call to go in harm's way when and \n     as needed.\n       (3) A primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n     sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of \n     retirement benefits, including lifetime health benefits, that \n     a grateful Nation provides for those who choose to \n     subordinate their personal life to the national interest for \n     so many years.\n       (4) Currently serving and retired members of the uniformed \n     services and their families and survivors deserve benefits \n     equal to their commitment and service to our Nation.\n       (5) Many employers are curtailing health benefits and \n     shifting costs to their employees, which may result in \n     retired members of the Armed Forces returning to the \n     Department of Defense, and its TRICARE program, for health \n     care benefits during retirement, and contribute to health \n     care cost growth.\n       (6) Defense health costs also expand as a result of \n     service-unique military readiness requirements, wartime \n     requirements, and other necessary requirements that represent \n     the ``cost of business'' for the Department of Defense.\n       (7) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts \n     to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE program, too \n     many of those efforts have been devoted to shifting a larger \n     share of the costs of benefits under that program to retired \n     members of the Armed Forces who have earned health care \n     benefits in return for a career of military service.\n       (8) In some cases health care providers refuse to accept \n     TRICARE patients because that program pays less than other \n     public and private payors and imposes unique administrative \n     requirements.\n       (9) The Department of Defense records deposits to the \n     Department of Defense Military Retiree Health Care Fund as \n     discretionary costs to the Department in spite of legislation \n     enacted in 2006 that requires such deposits to be made \n     directly from the Treasury of the United States.\n       (10) As a result, annual payments for the future costs of \n     servicemember health care continue to compete with other \n     readiness needs of the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have an \n     obligation to provide health care benefits to retired members \n     of the Armed Forces that equals the quality of their selfless \n     service to our country;\n       (2) past proposals by the Department of Defense to impose \n     substantial fee increases\n\n[[Page S7795]]\n\n     on military beneficiaries have failed to acknowledge properly \n     the findings addressed in subsection (a); and\n       (3) the Department of Defense has many additional options \n     to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that \n     do not disadvantage retired members of the Armed Forces who \n     participate or seek to participate in the TRICARE program, \n     and should pursue any and all such options rather than \n     seeking large increases for enrollment fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments for such retirees, and their families or \n     survivors, who do participate in that program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1648.

REPORT ON TAIWAN'S AIR FORCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Department of Defense's (DoD) 2009 \n     Annual Report on Military Power of the People's Republic of \n     China, the military balance in the Taiwan Strait has been \n     shifting in China's favor since 2000, marked by the sustained \n     deployment of advanced military equipment to the Chinese \n     military regions opposite Taiwan.\n       (2) Although the DoD's 2002 Report concluded that Taiwan \n     ``has enjoyed dominance of the airspace over the Taiwan \n     Strait for many years,'' the DoD's 2009 Report states this \n     conclusion no longer holds true.\n       (3) China has based 490 combat aircraft (330 fighters and \n     160 bombers) within unrefueled operational range of Taiwan, \n     and has the airfield capacity to expand that number by \n     hundreds. In contrast, Taiwan has 390 combat aircraft (all of \n     which are fighters).\n       (4) Also according to the DoD's 2009 Report, China has \n     continued its build-up of conventional ballistic missiles \n     since 2000, ``building a nascent capacity for conventional \n     short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) strikes against Taiwan \n     into what has become one of China's primary instruments of \n     coercion.'' At this time, China has expanded its SRBM force \n     opposite Taiwan to seven brigades with a total of 1,050 \n     through 1,150 missiles, and is augmenting these forces with \n     conventional medium-range ballistic missiles systems and at \n     least 2 land attack cruise missile variants capable of ground \n     or air launch. Advanced fighters and bombers, combined with \n     enhanced training for nighttime and overwater flights, \n     provide China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) with \n     additional capabilities for regional strike or maritime \n     interdiction operations.\n       (5) Furthermore, the Report maintains, ``the security \n     situation in the Taiwan Strait is largely a function of \n     dynamic interactions among Mainland China, Taiwan, and the \n     United States. The PLA has developed and deployed military \n     capability to coerce Taiwan or attempt an invasion if \n     necessary. PLA improvements pose new challenges to Taiwan's \n     security, which has historically been based upon the PLA's \n     inability to project power across the 100 nautical-mile \n     Taiwan Strait, natural geographic advantages of island \n     defense, Taiwan's armed forces' technological superiority, \n     and the possibility of U.S. intervention''.\n       (6) The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 requires that, in \n     furtherance of the principle of maintaining peace and \n     stability in the Western Pacific region, the United States \n     shall make available to Taiwan such defense articles and \n     defense services in such quantity ``as may be necessary to \n     enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense \n     capability,'' allowing that ``the President and the Congress \n     shall determine the nature and quantity of such defense \n     articles and services based solely upon their judgment of the \n     needs of Taiwan . . .''.\n       (b) Report to Congress on Taiwan's Current Air Force and \n     Future Self-Defense Requirements.--Not later than 90 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President \n     shall submit to Congress a report, in both classified and \n     unclassified form, containing the following:\n       (1) A thorough and complete assessment of the current state \n     of Taiwan's Air Force, including--\n       (A) the number and type of aircraft;\n       (B) the age of aircraft; and\n       (C) the capability of those aircraft.\n       (2) An assessment of the effectiveness of the aircraft in \n     the face of a full-scale concerted missile and air campaign \n     by China, in which China uses its most modern surface-to-air \n     missiles currently deployed along its seacoast.\n       (3) An analysis of the specific weapons systems and \n     platforms that Taiwan would need to provide for it's self-\n     defense and maintain control of its own air space.\n       (4) Options for the United States to assist Taiwan in \n     achieving those capabilities.\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\n       (5) A 5-year plan for fulfilling the obligations of the \n     United States under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide for \n     Taiwan's self-defense and aid Taiwan in maintaining control \n     of its own air space.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1654.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMMITMENT TO GLOBAL \n                   WAR ON TERROR.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The surge strategy executed in Iraq by General David H. \n     Petraeus and General Raymond T. Odierno in 2007 and 2008 was \n     highly successful in reducing levels of violence and enabling \n     the Iraqi government and security forces to gain credibility \n     and capability.\n       (2) President Obama articulated his general strategy for \n     Iraq during a speech at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, on \n     February 27, 2009, stating that a central goal is to ensure \n     that Iraq ``is sovereign, stable, and self-reliant''. During \n     the speech, the President outlined the President's objective \n     to ``transition to full Iraqi responsibility'' through the \n     ``responsible removal of our combat brigades from Iraq''.\n       (3) As part of the President's Iraq strategy, the President \n     also indicated the President's commitment to ensuring that \n     ``we preserve the gains we've made and protect our troops''. \n     Consequently, the United States and our allies have a \n     continued interest in maintaining these hard-fought security \n     gains, especially during the upcoming Iraqi provincial \n     elections, while simultaneously protecting the United States \n     military and civilian members still in Iraq.\n       (4) A key component of the President's plan for Iraq is to \n     retain a transitional force there to carry out several \n     distinct functions, including training, equipping, and \n     advising the Iraqi Security Forces, conducting targeted \n     counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilian and \n     military forces within Iraq. In accordance with this policy, \n     United States forces have largely withdrawn from Iraqi \n     cities, but the President expects that the transitional \n     force, to number between 35,000 and 50,000 United States \n     military servicemembers, will remain in Iraq for the \n     foreseeable future.\n       (5) President Obama articulated his emerging plan for \n     Afghanistan in a speech on March 27, 2009, stating that the \n     United States goal there is to ``disrupt, dismantle, and \n     defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent \n     their return to either country in the future''. To this end, \n     the current surge strategy in Afghanistan, spearheaded by \n     General Petraeus and General Stanley A. McChrystal, the new \n     commander of the NATO International Security Assistance \n     Force, is critical to providing security for the Afghan \n     populace, bolstering the Afghan security forces, and waging a \n     successful campaign against Islamic extremists of al Qaeda, \n     the Taliban, and affiliated groups.\n       (6) President Obama's laudable goals of disrupting \n     terrorist networks in Afghanistan and Pakistan and developing \n     increasingly self-reliant Afghan security forces necessitated \n     the surge of 17,000 additional United States troops to \n     increase the overall size of the NATO-led International \n     Security Assistance Force. These more robust forces, focusing \n     in the south and east portions of the country, will have an \n     enhanced ability to protect the Afghan population against a \n     resurgence of al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their allies, as \n     well as to provide greater ability for the Afghan government \n     to establish effective government control.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the global war on terror represents a critical effort \n     to protect the American people and ensure that future \n     generations may continue to enjoy the precious freedoms we \n     have today;\n       (2) the United States must remain committed to succeeding \n     in the global war on terror and fighting the forces of \n     Islamic extremism in Iraq and Afghanistan, including al \n     Qaeda, the Taliban, and other groups, that are intent on the \n     murder of innocent Americans, the destruction of the American \n     way of life, and the global proliferation of radical and \n     violent ideology;\n       (3) our military servicemembers and civilian United States \n     personnel serving in harm's way in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     other fronts in the global war on terror must be given any \n     and all resources they need to accomplish the missions that \n     have been asked of them, including the deployment of \n     additional forces, should United States commanders on the \n     ground deem that necessary;\n       (4) in Iraq, the hard-earned security gains won by our \n     servicemembers must be preserved, and the long-term United \n     States strategy there must continue to reflect that essential \n     goal;\n       (5) the President's plan for Iraq is fundamentally sound \n     and represents a responsible and carefully considered \n     strategy that will help Iraq maintain sovereignty, stability, \n     and self-reliance, achievements that were made possible \n     largely through the extraordinary efforts and tremendous \n     sacrifices of United States servicemembers and civilian \n     personnel in Iraq;\n       (6) the President's plan for Afghanistan is clearly \n     intended to improve the overall security situation there and \n     enable the eventual drawdown and withdrawal of United States \n     forces, and the President's near-term strategy to surge \n     forces and provide improved security to the Afghan people by \n     locating United States military personnel among the \n     population, in conjunction with the growing Afghan National \n     Army and Afghan National Police, which the United States \n     supports and trains, will increase the security of the Afghan \n     population; and\n       (7) although gains in the global war on terror will not \n     come without a cost, the American people and the Iraqi and \n     Afghan people share a common enemy and a common goal to do \n     whatever is necessary to defeat terrorists and those who \n     support them, no matter the cost or duration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1656.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NON-STRATEGIC NUCLEAR \n                   FORCES OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture \n     of the United States, chaired by former Secretaries of \n     Defense William Perry and James Schlesinger, recently \n     concluded that there is significant asymmetry between the \n     tactical nuclear weapons arsenals of the Russian Federation \n     and the United States.\n       (2) The Commission also determined that ``[a]s part of its \n     strategy to assure its allies, the United States should not \n     abandon strategic equivalency with Russia. Overall \n     equivalence is important to many U.S. allies in Europe. The \n     United States should not cede to Russia a posture of \n     superiority in the name of deemphasizing nuclear weapons in \n     U.S. military strategy. There seems no near-term prospect of \n     such a result in the balance of operationally deployed \n     strategic nuclear weapons.''\n       (3) The Commission continued, ``But that balance does not \n     exist in non-strategic nuclear forces, where Russia enjoys a \n     sizeable numerical advantage. As noted above, it stores \n     thousands of these weapons in apparent support of possible \n     military operations west of the Urals. The United States \n     deploys a small fraction of that number in support of nuclear \n     sharing agreements in NATO. Precise numbers for the U.S. \n     deployments are classified but their total is only about five \n     percent of the total at the height of the Cold War. Strict \n     U.S.-Russian equivalence in NSNF numbers is unnecessary. But \n     the current imbalance is stark and worrisome to some U.S. \n     allies in Central Europe. If and as reductions continue in \n     the number of operationally deployed strategic nuclear \n     weapons, this imbalance will become more apparent and allies \n     less assured.''\n       (4) The Commission stated, ``Some U.S. allies located \n     closer to Russia, however, are fearful of Russia and its \n     tactical nuclear forces. The imbalance in non-strategic \n     nuclear weapons, which greatly favors Russia, is of rising \n     concern and an illustration of the new challenges of \n     strategic stability as reductions in strategic weapons \n     proceed.''\n       (5) The Commission also stated, ``The combination of new \n     warhead designs, the estimated production capability for new \n     nuclear warheads, and precision delivery systems such as the \n     Iskander short-range tactical ballistic missile (known as the \n     SS-26 in the West), open up new possibilities for Russian \n     efforts to threaten to use nuclear weapons to influence \n     regional conflicts.''\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The Senate strongly urges the \n     President--\n       (1) to make it a priority in all United States arms control \n     negotiations with Russia to gain a verifiable accounting of \n     the tactical nuclear weapons of Russia, including the types, \n     current deployments, and security from theft of the same;\n       (2) to ensure that reductions in the tactical nuclear \n     weapons of Russia are a top priority in any arms control \n     negotiation with the Russian Federation; and\n       (3) to assure United States allies that they are protected \n     from any use or threatened use of tactical nuclear weapons \n     from Russia.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1672.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF \n                   THE INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) President Barack Obama stated in his speech on April 4, \n     2009, in Prague, Czech Republic, on working toward a world \n     without nuclear weapons, ``as long as these weapons exist, we \n     will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter \n     any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies''.\n       (2) The Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture \n     of the United States\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\n     found, in the Commission's final report, that preserving the \n     triad of strategic nuclear delivery systems is essential to \n     ensuring the reliability and credibility of the nuclear \n     force, and that the nuclear triad becomes even more important \n     as the size of the nuclear force of the United States is \n     reduced.\n       (3) The stabilizing, reliable, and cost-effective Minuteman \n     III intercontinental ballistic missile is a critically \n     important component of the nuclear triad, essential for the \n     United States to deter its enemies, assure its allies, and \n     dissuade potential future adversaries.\n       (4) The current 450-missile force, with its inherent broad \n     dispersion, low warhead loading, and high readiness and \n     reliability, makes a successful disarming attack nearly \n     impossible and eliminates pressure to maintain a launch-on-\n     warning posture.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) as the United States and Russia negotiate further \n     reductions in strategic offensive arsenals, the United States \n     must be certain that the long-term vitality of the triad of \n     strategic nuclear delivery systems is not threatened;\n       (2) the land-based nuclear force is the most stabilizing \n     portion of the nuclear arsenal of the United States and it \n     becomes even more so as the total number of weapons in the \n     arsenal shrinks; and\n       (3) a robust intercontinental ballistic missile force is an \n     essential component of the nuclear triad and must be retained \n     to advance the Nation's nuclear strategy of deterrence, \n     assurance, and dissuasion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1683.
