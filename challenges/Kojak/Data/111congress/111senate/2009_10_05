Mr. President, President Reagan once said that the status \nquo is Latin for ``the mess we're in.'' ``A mess'' is unquestionably an \naccurate way to describe America's unhealthy health care system. The \ncost of staying healthy is rising too fast, much faster than families' \nincomes. Insurance companies are not cutting costs; instead, they are \ncutting benefits, often at the very time people need them the most. \nWhen costs go up as wages go down, when the sick are singled out and \nrobbed of their health care, something has to give. Unfortunately, the \n``give'' in this case is hard-working families,\n\n[[Page S10080]]\n\nmore and more of whom file for bankruptcy and foreclosure every day \nbecause they cannot pay their medical bills. The casualties are the \npatients who put off a needed doctor's visit or do not get a medical \nprocedure they need because it costs too much. The casualties are the \npeople who cannot afford an important prescription, who use an expired \nprescription, who skip a dose of medicine or even take some pills and \nsplit them. You can even buy now, in a drugstore, a little plastic \ndevice that has a little blade in it that can cut your pills in half. \nEspecially seniors are buying this now. They do this because they can't \nafford to stay healthy in the richest country in the world.\n  Every day, more and more families know what I am talking about. It is \nnot just happening to a handful or a hundred, it is not just \nthreatening thousands. The fact is, one in five Nevadans can't afford \nhealth insurance and those who do have it are at great risk of losing \nit. If we do not act today, 10 years from now health care costs will \nmore than double and the number of Nevadans who can't afford health \ninsurance will nearly double as well. It is the same in the States of \nVirginia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Utah, California, and New \nMexico. It does not matter where you are. That is a mess. It is not \nright. And it is what Democrats have been working so hard to turn \naround.\n  You have all heard a lot about our plan over the past months. I hope \nyou know we are fighting to protect what works about the system, fix \nwhat does not, and help the middle class get ahead. You know we are \nfighting to stabilize health insurance for those who have it and help \nsecure it for those who do not. We are fighting to keep the insurance \nindustry honest and protect Medicare. We are fighting to lower costs \nfor every family so every American can afford good, quality care that \ncan never be taken away. And we are doing it all without adding a dime \nto the deficit.\n  That plan sounds pretty good to me, but some Republicans do not seem \ntoo fond of that plan. We have heard much about what their opposition \nhas been in recent weeks and months. But what you have not heard a lot \nabout is what the Republicans do think is the best way to fix our \nbroken health care system.\n  Well, here are the basics. Under the Republican plan, insurance \ncompanies can deny you coverage when you need it the most, because they \nwant the status quo. That is the status quo. Under the Republican plan, \nthat is the status quo. Insurance companies can deny you coverage \nbecause you have high cholesterol, hay fever, or heart disease. They \ncan raise your rates because you are getting older, because your dad \nhad prostate cancer, or simply because you are a woman. That is the \nstatus quo. That is what they want. Under the Republican plan, if you \ndo have health insurance, your family has to pay more than $1,000 a \nyear extra to cover all of those who have no health insurance. If that \nplan sounds familiar, if it sounds like a mess, that is because it is \nexactly the same mess we are already in. As Ronald Reagan would say, \nthat plan already goes by another name--I repeat--the status quo, the \n``mess'' described by President Reagan.\n  Some might ask: Why would they be supporting the status quo? Why \nwould they refuse to fix such a central part of our economy when it is \nso clearly and so badly broken?\n  Paul Krugman has a theory. Krugman, of course, won the Nobel Prize \nfor economics last year. He teaches at Princeton, one of our finest \nuniversities, and writes a widely respected column in the New York \nTimes. In his column today, he blames what he called ``the politics of \nspite.'' He noticed that most Republicans who resist health insurance \nare fighting it for the sake of fighting it. He observed that while we \nare fighting for hard-working families, Republicans are busy fighting \nus. He pointed out that there is no Republican plan to help people, \nonly a plan to hurt the President. These politics are simply out of \ntouch. The majority of Americans know our recovering economy needs \nhealth insurance reform now more than ever. The majority of Americans \nsupport the idea that health insurance companies should be required to \ncover every family. And the majority of Americans support creating more \ncompetition in the marketplace to drive down the cost of health \ninsurance.\n  There are those who reflexively and recklessly stand in the way of \nwhat we all know needs to be done. Although their megaphone is very \nloud, they constitute a small minority. This is the minority--this is \nvery hard to comprehend--the same minority who happily pumped one fist \nwhen America lost its bid to host the Olympics. They were cheering--we \nsaw it on television--because we lost the Olympics. But they shake the \nother fist at those who slander us as unpatriotic. This is the same \nminority who disputes indisputable evidence about how our health care \nplan will help seniors or disputes undisputable evidence about our \nPresident's birth records. This is the same minority who relies on \ndistortions, distractions, and deception to change the subject away \nfrom health care rather than debate the facts in good faith. Paul \nKrugman was right to call it the ``politics of spite,'' and he was \nright to conclude that such blind malice has no role in the legislative \nprocess.\n\n  Just as the majority of Americans yearn for the day when they can \nafford to live a healthy life without fear of living just one accident, \none illness, or one pink slip away from losing everything, a majority \nof Americans also are hopeful about reform. They are optimistic. All of \nthe polls indicate there should be reform.\n  I had the good fortune of serving in the Senate with Bill Frist. Bill \nFrist, when he came to the Senate, was a famous transplant surgeon. I \ncan remember him telling me about, as a young surgeon, traveling to \nplaces in a small airplane to pick up a heart so he could take it and \ngive it to someone else to give them life. He did that himself, he \ncarried it himself, a very famous surgeon.\n  In the book I wrote, an autobiography, I talk about Bill Frist. Here \non the Senate floor, whenever in a private conversation the subject of \nhealth care came up, his eyes lit. He was so into medicine. That was \nwho he was. He was Dr. Bill Frist. He was a Republican. As I have \nindicated, he was a physician, and a good one. But here is what he said \nlast Friday, a couple of days ago: If he still served in this body, he \nwould vote for health insurance that will soon come to the floor. That \nis Bill Frist.\n  Former Senate Republican Leaders Bob Dole and Howard Baker, both \nfamous men, have similarly supported reform--not specific reform, but \nthey say reform should come to be. They didn't have the benefit of \nseeing this legislation as did Bill Frist.\n  All three--Frist, Dole, and Baker--have come out because they know it \nis necessary, it is overdue, and it is right. This is not a partisan \nissue. All three have recognized that the status quo is not an option. \nAll three have done so in the spirit of service, not a sense of spite. \nHow did they reach this conclusion when so many of the Republican \ncolleagues in this body and elsewhere have not?\n  I will quote Bill Frist directly, Dr. Frist. He said:\n\n       I would take heat for it. . . . That's what leadership is \n     all about.\n\n  I encourage all my Republican colleagues to consider the words of two \nmen on opposite sides of the political spectrum--Krugman, a real \nprogressive, and Frist, a real conservative--who disagree on much about \na lot of things. But both know that leadership, courage, and honesty \nwill improve the lives of the people we represent. I encourage them to \nheed the words of a hero of the Republican Party, Ronald Reagan, who \nknew that anytime one defends a broken status quo, it only makes a bad \nsituation worse and, in Reagan's words, ``a mess.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10080-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, all eyes are on the Senate now with respect \nto the health care debate, because the Finance Committee has \nessentially completed work on the legislation and sometime this week is \nexpected to vote on it, thus making it possible for that bill to come \nto the Senate floor. The question is, what do people think about the \nbill we debated and amended in the committee over a period of 2 weeks? \nGoing back over my notes about all of the amendments we proposed and \nthe discussion we had, a couple of things stuck out. First, Republicans \nhave always said we believed it was important to address some of the \nproblems that exist in our current system, problems with insurance and \nalso health care delivery, primarily to bring costs down for all \nAmericans and, in particular, for small businesses that provide \ninsurance to employees, that there were some people who simply couldn't \nafford to buy insurance and we needed to find a way to help them as \nwell.\n  Republicans offered scores of amendments. Virtually all of them were \nrejected. One or two were accepted. We had a lot of good ideas. I am \nsorry the Democratic majority turned down our ideas. We will offer some \nof those alternatives when the bill comes to the floor and perhaps hope \nfor a better reception. It isn't as if Republicans didn't have good \nideas on how to address the problems. Our ideas were rejected. Instead, \nwe end up with a bill, and I thought: What is the best way to describe \nthe bill? I decided maybe I could identify 10 problems with it as a way \nof illustrating what is of concern. These may not be the most important \n10 problems. There are certainly a lot of other issues, but here are 10 \nreasons I came up with this morning for the American people to think \nabout and for Senators to think about that would be problems and \nreasons for us to oppose the bill.\n  The first has to do with senior citizens who are on Medicare, because \nthe bill cuts $500 billion from Medicare. In July, President Obama \nspoke at the AARP tele-townhall event and said:\n\n       I think there is a misperception that's been out there that \n     somehow there is any discussion on Capitol Hill about \n     reducing Medicare benefits. Nobody is talking about reducing \n     Medicare benefits.\n\n  The problem is, this is not a misconception. We are not only talking \nabout reducing Medicare benefits. That is exactly what the Finance \nCommittee bill does. The Baucus bill will reduce Medicare benefits for \nmillions of seniors to pay for a new health care bureaucracy.\n  This isn't just my word. Here is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice estimating that the Baucus bill would cut Medicare by nearly \n$500 billion in the following ways: $210.9 billion in cuts to \nhospitals, nursing homes, home health care, and hospice; $123.5 billion \nin cuts to private Medicare plans known as Medicare Advantage. Here is \nwhat the CBO says about that. They estimate that the extra benefits \noffered by Medicare Advantage plans, such as preventative screenings, \nvision and dental care, will drop from $125 per month to only $42 per \nmonth under the Baucus bill, a direct reduction in benefits for \nseniors.\n  Misconception about reducing benefits? No. Real dollars, $123.5 \nbillion in cuts to Medicare Advantage plans which will, according to \nCBO, cut benefits for seniors.\n  There is $22.6 billion in savings supposedly from a Medicare \ncommission which Chairman Baucus has noted are executive branch cuts. \nThese will be direct cuts to Medicare. And there is $4.6 billion in \ncuts to imaging services, wheelchairs, and physician-owned hospitals. \nSome of these cuts will directly reduce benefits such as those benefits \noffered by Medicare Advantage plans I mentioned. Others will do so \nindirectly as, for example, when doctors are paid less or home health \ncare is cut. The bottom line is, it is disingenuous to say that \nCongress can cut this much spending, $500 billion from Medicare, and \nnot have any detrimental effect on seniors' care. Medicare savings \nshould be used to preserve and strengthen Medicare, not shifted to pay \nfor new entitlement programs.\n  Reason No. 2, rationing of care. I think at the end of the day, this \nis probably the most worrisome thing to me. And it is worrisome to a \nlot of senior and nonsenior citizens who can see their care being \nrationed under this legislation. The Baucus bill would create a new \nnonprofit corporation known as the Patient Centered Outcomes Research \nInstitute to conduct what is known as comparative effectiveness \nresearch. Billions have been spent in the private sector to identify \nthe best kind of treatment and care available, especially for cutting-\nedge technologies and treatments for patients' care. For the first \ntime, this bill takes government money to conduct the research, and the \nnet result of it will be to ration care.\n  The bill, for example, asserts that the Secretary of HHS can use this \ncomparative effectiveness research when making coverage determinations. \nCoverage determinations are what Medicare is going to cover, what they \nwill pay for; in other words, what kind of treatment one gets to have.\n  I am quoting now from the bill:\n\n       The secretary would be required to use an iterative and \n     transparent process when using research from the institute in \n     making coverage determinations.\n\n  That is what they intend to do.\n  You will hear people say: Oh, no, that is not our intention. Well, \nthese are the words of the bill. As a matter of fact, there is over $1 \nbillion that was passed in the stimulus bill that is going to be used \nby a new Federal agency called the Federal Coordinating Council, to use \ncomparative effectiveness research as the basis for rationed care. So \nyou have this nonprofit entity as well as a Federal entity, both of \nwhich will use this research for coverage determinations.\n  As I said, a lot of folks, particularly on the other side, say: Well, \nwe don't support the rationing of care. We are against it too. Yet \nevery single Republican amendment that was offered to make sure this \nresearch could not be used to ration care was defeated on party-line \nvotes in the Finance Committee. The Republicans supported the \namendments to ensure no rationing. The Democrats opposed all these \namendments.\n  There is another way the bill is very arbitrary and will result in \nthe rationing of care. It arbitrarily singles out 10 percent of the \nNation's physicians every single year and cuts their reimbursements \nunder Medicare by 5 percent. What they are doing is saying those \ndoctors who spend more than other doctors--the doctors in the top 10 \npercent of spending--are going to have their reimbursements cut at the \nend of the year because, presumably, that spending was unnecessary. \nWell, how do we know that? Why isn't it the top 5 percent? Why isn't it \nthe top 20 percent? It is a purely arbitrary number.\n  As I was discussing this on Saturday morning with a prominent \nphysician, he said: The problem is the physicians who will get their \nreimbursements cut are the real experts to whom all the other \nphysicians refer their toughest patients. I have seen that happen. I go \nto the doctor, and my physician says: I am not sure about this. I want \nyou to go see a specialist in this area, and he sends me to somebody \nelse. That doctor may prescribe something that costs a little more \nmoney, but he knows that is what I need. Well, he is going to get \nwhacked by 5 percent. Obviously, this will result in a race to the \nbottom, where doctors will be encouraged to underspend one another \nrather than ensure the appropriate care is delivered to their patients.\n  Even the Budget Committee chairman, who sits on the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Conrad, said the provision ``leaves me cold.'' Well, \nit leaves me cold too. But every Democrat on the Finance Committee \nvoted against my amendment to eliminate this provision.\n  There was a recent editorial in the Washington Times that illustrates \nthe problem with this. I quote now:\n\n       . . . if a doctor authorizes expensive care, no matter how \n     successfully, the government will punish him by scrimping on \n     what already is a low reimbursement rate for treating \n     Medicare patients. The incentive, therefore, is for the \n     doctor always to provide less\n\n[[Page S10082]]\n\n     care for his patients for fear of having his payments docked.\n\n  That is wrong. The editorial concludes this way:\n\n       And because no doctor will know who falls in the top 10 \n     percent until year's end, or what total average costs will \n     break the 10 percent threshold, the pressure will be intense \n     to withhold care, and withhold care again, and then withhold \n     it some more. Or at least to prescribe cheaper care, no \n     matter how much less effective, in order to avoid the \n     penalties.\n\n  Withholding care, denial of care, delay of care--it is rationing. So \nthe rationing of care is both direct through the use of the comparative \neffectiveness research or, in this case, indirect, forcing the doctors, \nin effect, to do the dirty work for Washington by withholding care.\n  Here is a third reason: waste, fraud, and abuse. The bill purports to \nattack waste, fraud, and abuse. But let me tell you about a little \nprovision in the bill, and you tell me whether you think this is \nsubject to abuse. Early Friday morning; that is to say, after midnight \nThursday night, the chairman rolled into the bill an amendment that \nwould ``streamline'' enrollment in Medicaid, the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, and the new premium tax credits program under the \nbill.\n  Specifically, this amendment would provide a single application form \nfor all three subsidy programs. The form can be filed online, in \nperson, by mail or telephone. You heard me right: by telephone. How \nwill a State Medicaid agency know if the person is truly eligible for \nthe program, if the person is a U.S. citizen or is even the person he \nor she purports to be? Poll after poll shows the American people \nbelieve fraud, waste, and abuse should be addressed prior to creating \nnew government programs. The Baucus bill exacerbates the fraud, waste, \nand abuse inherent in Federal public health programs.\n  A fourth reason: rising health insurance premiums. You all heard that \nunder this legislation, health care is going to cost less. Wrong. \nHealth care is going to cost more. Rather than reducing the cost of \npremiums, they are going to go up under the bill. Do not take my word \nfor it. Here is the Congressional Budget Office, again, nonpartisan:\n\n       Premiums in the new insurance exchanges would tend to be \n     higher than the average premiums in the current-law \n     individual market.\n\n  That is according to the Congressional Budget Office. Premiums will \nbe higher than the average of premiums under current law.\n  The bill provides that every insurance company has to offer at least \ntwo particular kinds of insurance and they cannot offer any more than \nfour. The lowest actuarial value they can offer is 65 percent. What \ndoes that mean? Individuals will have to buy richer health insurance \nplans with higher premiums than they would under the current market \nregardless of their financial or medical circumstances.\n  The average actuarial value of an individual insurance plan today, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, ranges ``from 40 percent \nto 80 percent, with an average value that is between 55 and 60 \npercent.'' The bill, remember, mandates that the very lowest is 65 \npercent, which means it is going to be more than, higher than the value \nthat currently exists for most and for the average. In my State, the \naverage actuarial value for an individual plan is 61 percent. The \naverage value for a high-deductible health plan is 48 percent.\n  The bottom line is, the Baucus bill not only mandates that you buy \ninsurance, but you have to buy insurance that is going to have a higher \npremium than the insurance you pay for today. Part of the reason \ninsurance will cost more is because the Baucus bill would require all \ninsurers to cover a minimum set of standardized benefits in addition to \nthe current State-mandated benefits.\n  The Council for Affordable Health Insurance estimates that current \nmandated benefits increase the cost of basic health coverage from a \nlittle less than 20 percent to perhaps 50 percent. So get ready \nAmerica, you are going to see your premiums go up under this \nlegislation, not down.\n  Here is a fifth reason to oppose the bill. Under this legislation, \nthere are penalties on your employer, which will be passed on to you in \nthe form of lower wages. Under the Baucus bill, employers with over 50 \nemployees, that do not offer health insurance to their workers would be \nrequired to pay a penalty for each employee who receives a tax credit \nto purchase coverage through the insurance exchange.\n  Where does the money come from to pay the penalty? Well, the CBO has \nwarned Congress about so-called free rider proposals. Here is what they \nsay:\n\n       Supporters of such surcharges often refer to them as ``free \n     rider'' penalties.\n\n  That is what is in the bill.\n\n       Although the surcharges would be imposed on the firms, \n     workers in those firms would ultimately bear the burden of \n     those fees, just as they would with pay-or-play requirements.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Employer surcharges tend to be more targeted. . . . Many of \n     those workers are more likely to have earnings at or near the \n     minimum wage, and the size of such surcharges--if based on \n     actual costs imposed on government programs--could be larger \n     per affected worker than the assessments being considered in \n     many play-or-pay requirements.\n\n  What that is saying is, when you put a fee on the employer, that fee \nis passed on to the employees in the form of lower wages or, in some \ncases, even fewer workers and that it is most likely to more \ndramatically affect those who have earnings at or near the minimum wage \nthan those at higher wage scales. So you are hurting the very lowest \npaid workers.\n  Senator Enzi offered an amendment in the committee that would have \nrequired the Secretary of Labor to certify that the bill would not \nresult in lower wages or in an increase in the unemployment rate before \nthe bill could go into effect. You would think that would be a good \nguarantee that the bill would not have the adverse consequences I \nindicated.\n  Well, an interesting thing happened in the committee. The amendment \nfirst passed 21 to 0. Everyone thought it was a good idea to guarantee \nthat the bill would not reduce people's wages or result in laid-off \nworkers. Yet early in the hours on Friday--in other words, after \nmidnight Thursday night--the Democrats in the committee changed Senator \nEnzi's amendment into a mere report to Congress. So after first voting \nin favor of the amendment to ensure that workers' wages would not be \nreduced, they then came back late and undid what they had passed \nearlier. Why would they do that, when the first amendment passed 21 to \n0? Because, of course, it is an impossible certification under the \nbill. The bill will reduce wages--CBO said so--and the Democrats in the \ncommittee realized, therefore, they could not stick with that \ncertification and have the bill be effective. So wages will be lost and \nsome jobs will be lost.\n  Well, here is a sixth reason to oppose the bill: If you like your \ncurrent insurance, you will not be able to keep it. You have heard the \nPresident promise this over and over: If you like your current \ncoverage, you will be able to keep it. No, you will not--not under this \nbill. This has been proven now time and time again. I think it is one \nof the reasons the President is so sensitive about this. In fact, in \nhis speech to the Congress, he changed his terminology a little bit. He \nsaid: If you like your insurance, we will not do anything to require \nyou to change it. He had to change his terminology because, of course, \nwhat he was saying before is absolutely false.\n  By saying the government will not require you to change your plan, \nthat is technically true. But it is lawyers' words. The problem is, the \ninsurance you have now you will not have anymore because it will not \nexist anymore. No one will require you to change it. It simply will not \nbe available to you. Why not? Well, there are several different \nreasons.\n  For seniors, the Baucus bill cuts billions of dollars from the \nMedicare Advantage Program. That will force those plans to cut benefits \nunder their plans or to drop coverage altogether.\n  For those who are privately insured, Senator Hatch offered an \namendment that would have required the Secretary of HHS to certify the \nbill would not cause more than 1 million Americans to lose their \ncurrent coverage. The amendment failed on a party-line vote. Let me \nrepeat that. The Hatch amendment said: Well, we have to at least \ncertify that no more than 1 million people will lose their coverage \nunder this bill. That cannot be certified because that is not what is \ngoing to happen. A lot more than 1 million people\n\n[[Page S10083]]\n\nare going to lose their coverage. So his amendment lost on a party-line \nvote.\n  It is true the Baucus bill does not require insurers to drop coverage \nfor people who like their current health insurance plans, but the \npractical effect of the bill will be to cause Americans to lose the \ncoverage they currently enjoy.\n  For the seniors, by the way, under the Medicare Advantage plan, I \nquoted the numbers earlier. Let me quote them again. CBO estimates the \nextra benefits offered by the Medicare Advantage plan--such as \npreventive screenings, vision, and dental care--will drop from $135 per \nmonth to only $42 per month under the Baucus bill. So you are going to \nlose over $90 worth of care, benefits, that you currently have. No, you \nare not going to be able to keep the insurance you have today, even if \nyou like it.\n  Here is a seventh reason: This may seem like a small thing to most \npeople, but the precedent is enormously dangerous in our country. We \nhave all seen what happens when the government takes over part of the \neconomy: insurance companies or the bank bailouts or the automobile \ncompanies. When the government takes these things over, they begin to \nmake the decisions; for example, setting the pay of the people who work \nin those companies. It started out just capping the high executives' \npay.\n  Under this bill, however, insurance companies' pay for all employees \nwould be subject to the Federal regulation. If you pay somebody a \ncertain amount of money, you will not be able to deduct it as a part of \nthe ordinary and business expense that you do today. So it is a way of \nindirectly capping pay. It would limit the tax deduction for health \ninsurance executives and other highly paid workers at $500,000. By the \nway, it would not limit the deduction of pharmaceutical companies or \nhospital industry executives and so on. But it is another example of \nwhat happens when Washington takes over another segment of the economy.\n  Robert Reich, by the way, who is the former Secretary of Labor under \nthe Clinton administration, wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal \nin which he pointed out that sometimes these relatively high--and \n$500,000 is, to me, a lot of money--but there are people who are paid a \nlot more than that in these high-paid industries because of what they \nare able to do for their particular company, and he warns about the \neffect of legislation such as this that would effectively cap pay of \nemployees.\n  Here is another thing--the eighth reason--taxing you through your \nhealth insurance plan. This is another one of the sneaky ways in which \nthe bill actually gets at you, but they put the tax first on the \ninsurance company. I told you the Congressional Budget Office said the \nwage earners would actually pay the penalty imposed on businesses. \nWell, here is an example of where the Baucus bill imposes a 40-percent \nexcise tax on any health insurance plan that is above $8,000 for a \nsingle person and $21,000 for family plans. Who ends up paying the \nincreased tax on the insurance company? Of course, you do. They pass it \non to you through higher premiums.\n  According to the nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee, which provided the \nFinance Committee with a distributional analysis of this provision, the \nbulk of this $200 billion tax increase falls on those President Obama \npromised to protect. Do you remember: ``Nobody under $200,000 is going \nto pay any new taxes under my bill''? Well, here is what happens in the \nfirst year this tax is in place. It raises taxes on 13.8 million tax \nunits; that is, either an individual or a family who files an income \ntax return; that is, it raises taxes by $13 billion on 13.8 million tax \nunits. Of those 13.8 million tax units--individual filers or families--\nonly 1.2 million will have incomes above $200,000. So about 12.6 \nmillion of these tax filers who are under $200,000 in income will pay \nthis tax. Not going to tax anybody under $200,000? Wrong. This means 91 \npercent of the affected taxpayers will be hit by the premium increase \nas a result of this tax.\n\n  By the way, the average tax increase for those earning under $200,000 \nis $900. This is every year, by the way. Within 6 years, the number of \ntax units hit by this tax would nearly triple to almost 40 million \nindividual or family filers, and the tax would collect over $52 billion \nin that year.\n  Here is a ninth reason for opposing the bill: taxing the chronically \nill. This is an amendment I offered because this is just wrong. As my \ncolleagues know, under the tax law today, if you are so unfortunate as \nto be hit by a huge medical bill in any given year, and it exceeds 7.5 \npercent of your gross adjusted income on your income tax form, then you \nget to take a deduction for any amount above 7.5 percent of your \nincome. The reason for that is because we don't want anyone in this \ncountry to have to suffer unnecessarily or out of proportion simply \nbecause of an accident, in effect. This is literally the lightning \nstrikes situation. Most people would not have medical bills exceeding \n7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income, but the few who do have \nbeen stricken enormously hard. They don't deserve it. In fact, the \nInternal Revenue Service actually treats this as an involuntary \nexpense.\n  Under the IRS Code, there are few things that happen to you by pure \nluck of the draw, as it were. Most of the IRS Code applies to you based \non decisions you made: You invested and lost money or you invested and \nmade money and you get taxed on it as a result of the decision you \nmade. You bought a house and you have a mortgage deduction, you know \nhow much that is, you are taxed on a decision you made.\n  This, you had nothing to do with it; you just got sick. So your \nexpenses are enormous compared to your income. We have always said in \nthat case: We don't want that to hurt you; we are going to make sure \nyou don't pay more than a certain amount in your taxes. Anything above \n7.5 percent you get to deduct.\n  Under the Baucus bill, that 7.5 percent goes up to 10 percent, so now \nyou are going to have to eat 10 percent of this catastrophic cost \nbefore you can even get to the point where you can have a tax \ndeduction. Yet, as I quote the Congressional Research Service, ``the \ndeduction can ease the financial burden imposed by costly medical \nexpenses.'' For the most part, the Federal Tax Code regards these \nexpenses as involuntary expenses that reduce a Federal taxpayer's \nability to pay taxes by absorbing a substantial part of income.\n  The Joint Tax Committee has estimated that increasing the threshold \nto 10 percent would increase taxes by $15 billion over 10 years. Who \nare these unfortunate taxpayers? Are they rich people? No. Twenty-one \npercent of them who claim this deduction earn under $40,000, or less \nthan 200 percent of poverty. So almost one-fourth of the people who \ntake advantage of this are literally--they are at 200 percent of \npoverty. They are making $40,000 a year. Those are exactly the kinds of \npeople you want to be able to take advantage of a tax provision like \nthis. They get killed when they have an expense that big, and 5.8 \nmillion taxpayers or 87 percent who claim this deduction earn under \n$100,000, and that is not wealthy by any means. Mom and dad are \nworking. Together they earn, let's say, $90,000. Well, 87 percent of \nthe people who claim this deduction are in that category. Those are \npeople we should be helping by not having them pay quite as much in \ntaxes, but under the bill we make it harder for them. We raise the \nthreshold from 7.5 to 10 percent.\n  I wanted to actually reduce it to 5 percent to help people with their \nhealth care costs. Isn't the whole point of this bill to reduce \npeople's health care expenditures? Isn't that the whole idea? No. We \nare not going to reduce them; we are not even going to leave them the \nsame. We are going to raise them.\n  That brings up the tenth and final reason: taxing middle-class \nfamilies. Under current law, employees can make tax-free contributions \nfor medically necessary goods and services to pay out-of-pocket \nexpenses. We would assume that to be the case. Although there is no \nlegal limitation, employers generally establish a $5,000 limit that \nthey provide to their workers.\n  Senator Baucus is proposing to limit the contributions to $2,500 a \nyear, and the Joint Tax Committee estimates that this limit would raise \n$15 billion over 10 years.\n  Now, why are we doing this? Is it good tax policy? No. We are doing \nit because we have to raise revenue. You see, the Democrats, who \nproposed this amendment, said at the very outset:\n\n[[Page S10084]]\n\nWe are going to make sure it is ``revenue neutral.'' What does revenue \nneutral mean? When you are proposing to spend $800 billion, $900 \nbillion, $1 trillion in order to make it revenue neutral, you have to \ncome up with $800 billion, $900 billion, or $1 trillion in new taxes or \nrevenue or savings in order to offset the cost of that. So they have to \nraise money by a variety of taxes--I have mentioned a couple of them--\nor by penalties in ways that help them to get to this $800 million, \n$900 million, or $1 trillion.\n  Well, here is another one of the taxes. We limit the contribution \nlimit to $2,500 a year. That way the Federal Government will bring in \n$15 billion more in revenue.\n  Who takes advantage of this? Well, the 35 million people who use \nthese flexible spending accounts spend 43 percent on hospital \nadmissions and physician visits, 26 percent to purchase prescription \nand over-the-counter drugs to manage chronic diseases, 21 percent for \ndental, and 10 percent for vision. These are medical expenses that help \nmake people healthier or prevent them from getting sicker. Isn't that \nwhat we want to be promoting, rather than hurting?\n  Americans with chronic conditions spend nearly $4,400 a year in out-\nof-pocket medical expenses for ailments such as diabetes and autism. \nWhy shouldn't we be helping them by allowing their employers to put \nmoney into these flexible spending accounts for them to offset against \ntheir medical expenses?\n  Well, maybe this is just for the rich. No. There again, wrong. The \nmedian income for a policyholder utilizing a flexible spending account \nis $55,000--hardly the rich. So, once again, we tax middle-class \nfamilies in order to raise money to pay for the expense of this \nlegislation.\n  These are just 10 reasons. I could keep going. There are dozens and \ndozens of reasons to oppose this legislation, but just start with these \n10:\n  No. 1, $500 billion in Medicare cuts that is going to result in less \ncare for America's seniors--benefit cuts.\n  No. 2, rationing of care, both directly and indirectly, through this \ncomparative effectiveness research and through other means that force \nthe physicians, in effect, to provide less care if they want to be \npaid. More fraud, waste, and abuse. We thought we were going to \nactually save money from waste, fraud, and abuse. No. We are going to \ndo things such as let people register by telephone when we are not \ngoing to be able to verify their eligibility for subsidies under this \nprogram.\n  Rising health insurance premiums: The Congressional Budget Office \nsays the increase in the insurance costs will be passed on to the \npremium holders, so our insurance premiums go up, not down.\n  Taxes on employers which, again, according to the people who know \nbest--nonpartisan--reduce employees' wages.\n  If you like your current coverage, you would not be able to keep it. \nThat is a reason to oppose this legislation. If you like your current \ncoverage, you ought to be able to get to keep it.\n  No. 7, unwarranted government intrusion. I just cited the example of \nthe capping of pay, but there are so many other situations in which \nthis tangled web of government regulations will virtually create \ngovernment-run health care in this country, with or without a \ngovernment-run insurance plan or the so-called public option.\n  No. 8, taxing you through your health insurance program. Here, again, \nthey impose a tax on the insurance company because insurance companies \nare bad. Well, insurance companies are bad until you want them to pay \nfor your health care. Then they are OK, I guess. In any event, the \ninsurance company has to pass it on to you, so your premiums go up. \nThat is what the experts say will happen.\n  Taxing the chronically ill: Why should we not allow people to deduct \nfrom their income taxes the expenses of these catastrophic events in \ntheir life that all of us--none of us want these things to happen to \nus, and we should at least be able to deduct part of these expenses in \nour income taxes.\n  Finally, taxing middle-class families through the inability to take \nadvantage of what their employers would otherwise provide by way of \nflexible spending accounts so they could actually have money to spend \non chronic diseases such as diabetes--just one that I mentioned.\n  The whole exercise is we are going to make health care costs go down, \nwe are going to reduce premiums, and we are going to recognize that \npeople have too hard a time coping with these issues in today's \nsociety. We only make it worse if we adopt the Baucus bill because it \nwill raise insurance premiums, it will lower wages, it will increase \ntaxes, and it will reduce the care people get. How is that for a deal? \nOnly something offered in Washington, DC, could be that bad a deal.\n  That is what is coming down the pike. In a couple of weeks, that bill \nis going to be--actually, it would not even be that bill; it will be a \nworse bill. I have described what many say is the best it is going to \nget, the bill that came out of the Finance Committee. It is only going \nto get worse from here because this bill is going to be combined--not \nby Republicans but by Democrats--behind closed doors with the bill that \ncame out of the HELP Committee which, if anything could be worse, is. \nSo somewhere in between this bill and that bill, that is what we are \ngoing to have on the Senate floor. It is a bad deal for the American \npeople.\n  One final point. I see my friend, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nAlexander, coming to the floor. He has been saying something over and \nover and over again that bears repeating. I will tell Senator \nAlexander, I was in church yesterday, and I don't know how many people \ntold me exactly this: Read the bill and find out how much it costs. If \nwe do that, and if we tell our constituents how much it costs and what \nis in the bill, I predict a lot of my colleagues are going to say: \nThanks but no thanks; my constituents really don't want this bill.\n  So in addition to all of the other things I have said, maybe I should \nhave started with the proposition: Read the bill and find out how much \nit costs. I suspect my friend from Tennessee might just mention that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nArizona for his thoughtful comments and for his late nights on the \nFinance Committee on the health care bill. He is exactly correct. I \ndon't know where in the United States you could go and somebody \nwouldn't say: You should read the bill, No. 1; and you should know what \nit costs, No. 2, before you start voting on it. That is one of the \nhandful of things in American life I don't think requires any \nexplanation. But if it requires any, the people in Arizona are going to \nbe asking Senator Kyl, just as they do me in Tennessee: What is this \nshifting of Medicaid costs to the States, and how much is it going to \ncost us? Our Governor in Tennessee says it will put the State budget in \nthe tank and damage our colleges and universities. We ought to read the \nbill and know what it costs.\n  What about these Medicare cuts? We will wait to read the bill and see \nhow much they are, but what we hear is they are a half trillion \ndollars, and not just in cuts on Medicare, but it is cutting Medicare \nfor seniors and spending it on a new program. As the Senator from \nKansas said the other day, it is like writing a check on an overdrawn \nbank account and buying a big new car with it, and then new taxes.\n  So I remember when in the HELP Committee we all were working on a \nbill, and it went right through with the Democratic majority, but when \nthe American people began to read it, there began to be some problems. \nSo I am very hopeful that we will do in the Senate as 99.8 percent of \nthe American people expect us to do: Read the bill; know what it costs. \nWhen we see the Medicaid mandates that require new State taxes and the \nMedicare cuts for seniors that will be spent on other programs and new \ntaxes, then that might change the picture.\n  Mr. President how much time do we have left on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is not equally divided. \nSenators are permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes. The time is not \nequally divided, so we are just in a period of morning business until 4 \no'clock.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you very much.\n\n[[Page S10085]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10085-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10085-S10088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             ENERGY REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to change the subject. I \nwish to talk a little bit on the perils of energy sprawl. Right behind \nthe health bill may come an energy or climate change bill. There has \nbeen a lot of discussion about that. I would like to talk about it in a \nnew and different way.\n  I just went over to an organization called Resources for the Future \nthat is run by former Congressman Phil Sharp, a group that has done a \nlot of good work in the conservation area, most recently in \ncoordinating the Outdoors Resource Review Group's recommendations that \nincluded permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  There were about 200 conservationists there. I wish to talk to my \ncolleagues a little bit about the message I shared with them. I began \nwith them in this way: As many Americans did last week, I spent a \nnumber of hours watching Ken Burns' film on our national parks. I am \nalso reading Douglas Brinkley's book about Theodore Roosevelt, called \n``The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for \nAmerica.'' I had a few minutes to visit Douglas Brinkley, who was in \nWashington, DC. Doing this reminded me that the men and women we honor \nmost in the conservation movement, and who founded many of our most \nimportant organizations, were not always so honored when they spoke up. \nMany who spent the last century protecting our landscapes, our air and \nour water and our habitats were regarded as trivial, eccentric or even \nwent unnoticed.\n  John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, was an obscure hermit when he \nbegan to preach nature like an apostle. To some, President Teddy \nRoosevelt must have seemed a little daffy when he declared he would \nprotect pelicans and warned a country, enamored with Manifest Destiny, \nthat we should keep nature unmarred. President Lyndon Johnson used to \nmake jokes about Lady Bird Johnson running around the White House with \nLaurance Rockefeller protecting flowers, as he would say. Today, we \nhonor those men and women for having had the wisdom and courage to \nrecognize that preserving our natural heritage is essential to the \nAmerican character. Italy may have its art, India may have its Taj \nMahal, but we have the Great American Outdoors.\n  That is why a recent paper by the Nature Conservancy, a scientific \npaper, titled ``Energy Sprawl or Energy Efficiency: Climate Policy \nImpacts on Natural Habitat for the United States of America,'' will one \nday, I believe, occupy a place among the pioneering actions we honor in \nthe conservation movement. The paper warns, in the next 20 years, new \nenergy production, especially biofuels and wind power, will consume a \nlandmass larger than the State of Nebraska. This so-called ``energy \nsprawl,'' as the authors termed it, will be the result of government \ncap and trade and renewable mandate proposals designed to deal with \nclimate change. The paper should serve as a ``Paul Revere ride'' for \nthe coming renewable energy sprawl. There are negative consequences \nfrom producing energy from the Sun, the wind, and the Earth, just as \nthere are positive effects. Unless we are as wise in our response to \nthis as the authors were in their analysis, our Nation runs the risk of \ndamaging the environment in the name of saving the environment.\n  The first insight of the Nature Conservancy paper is in describing \nthe sheer size of the sprawl. The second insight is in carefully \nestimating the widely varying amounts of land consumed by different \nkinds of energy production. Finally, the paper suggests four ways to \nreduce carbon emissions, while minimizing the side effects of energy \nsprawl on the landscape and wildlife habitat. The first recommendation \nis energy conservation. Second is generating electricity on already-\ndeveloped sites, such as when solar panels are put on rooftops or when \na chemical company uses byproducts from its production processes to \nmake heat and power. The third recommendation is to make carbon \nregulation flexible enough to allow for coal plants that recapture \ncarbon or nuclear power plants that produce no carbon or for \ninternational offsets. Fourth, the paper suggests careful site \nselection.\n  This makes me think of my own experience as Governor of Tennessee 25 \nyears ago. The Presiding Officer was a very successful Governor of our \nneighboring Commonwealth of Virginia. Twenty-five years ago, our State \nbanned new billboards and junkyards on a highway over which 2 million \nvisitors travel each year to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. \nThen, that decision attracted very little attention. Today, that \ndecision helps to preserve one of the most attractive gateways to any \nnational park. It is hard to imagine what that road would be like today \nif we hadn't made that decision 25 years ago. We know that if the \nbillboards had gone up then, they would be impossible to take down \ntoday. It would be the same with wind turbines in the foothills of the \nSmokies or along the Blue Ridge Parkway, with wind turbines, solar \nthermal plants, and other new forms of energy production--once they go \nup, it would be hard to take them down.\n  My purpose today, with Resources for the Future and with the \nconservation groups, was to challenge those organizations who have \ntraditionally protected our landscapes, air and water and wildlife \nhabitat to do the same for the threat of energy sprawl. I asked for \nthem to suggest to us in the Senate, Members of the House, and others \nin government what are the most appropriate sites for low-carbon or \ncarbon-free energy production. Second, I asked the conservationists to \ndo something that gives many of them a stomachache whenever it is \nmentioned--to rethink nuclear power. Because, as the Nature \nConservancy's paper details--while not endorsing nuclear--in several \nways nuclear power produces the largest amounts of carbon-free \nelectricity with the least impact.\n  I learned a long time ago it helps an audience to know where its \nspeaker is coming from so I reminded them that I grew up hiking and \ncamping in the great Smoky Mountains National Park, and I still live 2 \nmiles from the park boundary today. I reminded them that, as a Senator, \nI have fought and still fight for strict emission standards for sulfur, \nnitrogen, and mercury, because too many of us still breathe polluted \nair. I have introduced legislation to cap carbon from coal plants \nbecause I believe human production of carbon contributes to global \nwarming. I have helped to create 10,000 acres of conservation easements \nadjacent to the Smokies because it preserves the views and the wildlife \nneeds the space. I drive one of the first hybrid plug-in electric cars \nbecause I believe electrifying our cars and trucks is the quickest way \nto clean the air, keep fuel prices down, reduce foreign oil use, and \nhelp deal with climate change. I object to 50-story wind turbines along \nthe Appalachian Trail for the same reason I am the cosponsor of \nlegislation to end the coal mining practice called mountaintop removal, \nnot because I am opposed to coal plants or wind power in appropriate \nplaces but because I want to save our mountaintops.\n  Let me offer a few examples to give a clearer picture of what this \ncoming energy sprawl may look like. As the Nature Conservancy paper \nnotes, most new renewable electricity production will come from wind \npower, which provides about 1.5 percent of our country's electricity \ntoday. Hydroelectric dams produce about 7 percent, and some of them are \nbeing dismantled. Solar and all other forms of renewable electricity \nproduce about another 1 percent. President Bush first suggested that \nwind power could grow from 1.5 percent today to 20 percent by 2030, and \nPresident Obama has set out enthusiastically to get this done. In fact, \nthe combination of Presidential rhetoric, taxpayer subsidies and \nmandates have very nearly turned our national electricity policy into a \nnational windmill policy.\n  To produce 20 percent of America's electricity from wind turbines \nwould require erecting 186,000 1.5 megawatt wind turbines, covering an \narea the size of West Virginia. According to the American Wind Energy \nAssociation, 1 megawatt of wind requires 60 acres of land; in other \nwords, that is a 1.5-megawatt wind turbine every 90 acres. These are \nnot your grandmother's windmills. They are 50 stories high. If you are \na sports fan, they are three times as tall as the skyboxes at the \nUniversity of Tennessee football stadium. The turbines themselves are \nthe length of a football field. They are noisy, and you can see their \nflashing lights for up to 20 miles. In the Eastern United States,\n\n[[Page S10086]]\n\nsuch as in Tennessee and Virginia, where the wind blows less, turbines \nwork best along scenic ridge tops and coastlines.\n  The National Academy of Sciences says that up to 19,000 miles of new \nhigh-voltage transmission lines would be needed to carry electricity \nfrom 186,000 wind turbines in remote areas to and through population \ncenters.\n  So many wind turbines can create real threats to wildlife. The \nGovernor of Wyoming has expressed concern about protecting the sage \ngrouse's diminishing population in his State as a result of possible \nhabitat destruction from wind farms. The American Bird Conservancy \nestimates that each wind turbine in this country may kill as many as \nseven or eight birds each year. Multiply that by 186,000, and you can \npredict the annual death of close to 1.4 million birds each year. Then \nthere are the solar thermal plants, which use big mirrors to heat a \nfluid and which could spread over many square miles. Secretary of the \nInterior Ken Salazar recently announced plans to cover 1,000 square \nmiles of federally owned land in Nevada, Arizona, California, Colorado, \nNew Mexico, and Utah with such solar collectors to generate \nelectricity. Dianne Feinstein, the senior Senator from California, who \nhas spent most of her career trying to make the Mojave Desert a \nnational monument, strongly objected to a solar thermal plant in the \ndesert on Federal land just outside the Mojave National Preserve that \nwould have covered an area 3 miles by 3 miles. Plans for the plant were \nrecently canceled.\n  The only wind farm in the Southeastern United States is on the 3,300-\nfoot-tall Buffalo Mountain in eastern Tennessee, not far from my \nhometown. The wind there blows less than 20 percent of the time, making \nthe project a commercial failure. Because of the unavailability of wind \npower, renewable energy advocates suggest that we southeasterners use \nbiomass, a sort of controlled bonfire that burns wood products to make \nelectricity. Biomass has promise, to a point. Paper mills can burn wood \nbyproducts to make energy. Clearing forests of dead wood and then \nburning it not only produces energy but can help to avoid forest fires. \nAccording to the Conservancy's paper, biofuels and biomass burning of \nenergy crops for electricity take the most space per unit of energy \nproduced. For example, the Southern Company is building a new 100-\nmegawatt biomass plant in Georgia. Southern estimates it will keep 180 \ntrucks a day busy hauling about 1 million tons of wood a year to the \nplants. One hundred megawatts, the size of that plant, is less than \none-tenth the production of a nuclear plant, which will fit on 1 square \nmile. To produce the same amount of energy as one nuclear plant would \nrequire continuously foresting an area one-third larger than the \n550,000-acre great Smoky Mountain National Park. You can make your own \nestimate of the number of trucks it would take to haul that much wood.\n  That is the second important insight of the Nature Conservancy \nreport: a careful estimate of the widely different amounts of land each \nenergy-producing technique requires. The gold standard for land usage \nis nuclear power. You can get a million megawatt hours of electricity a \nyear--that is the standard unit the authors chose--per square mile, \nusing nuclear power. The second most compact form of energy is \ngeothermal energy. To generate the same amount of power, coal requires \n4 square miles, taking into account all the land required for mining, \nextraction, and waste disposal. Solar thermal takes 6. Natural gas \ntakes 7. Petroleum takes 17. Photovoltaic cells that turn sunlight into \nelectricity requires 14 square miles for the same unit of power. Wind \nis even more, taking 28 square miles to produce the same unit of \nelectricity. That doesn't include lands consumed by the up to 19,000 \nmiles of new transmission lines.\n  These differences in land use are pronounced, even though the Nature \nConservancy paper's analysis is conservative. The authors include \nupstream inputs and waste disposal as part of their estimate of an \nenergy producer's footprint. They add uranium mining and Yucca \nMountain's 220 square miles to the area our 104 nuclear reactors \nactually occupy. If one were to consider only each energy plant's \nfootprint, to produce 20 percent of U.S. electricity would take 100 \nnuclear reactors on 100 square miles; or, to visualize it a different \nway, 186,000 wind turbines on 25,000 square miles.\n  Visualize the difference this way. Thru hikers regularly travel the \n2,178 miles from Springer Mountain, GA, up through Tennessee and \nVirginia to Mount Katahdin, ME. A row of 50-story wind turbines along \nthe 2,178-mile Appalachian Trail would produce the same amount of \nelectricity produced by four nuclear reactors on 4 square miles.\n  Because of all these wide differences, policymakers have the \nopportunity to choose carefully among the various forms of producing \ncarbon-free electricity, as well as to think about where such energy \nproduction should go and should not go.\n  There are four ways that The Nature Conservancy suggests we approach \nthese decisions:\n  First, focus on energy conservation. That is hard to argue with, and \nthat is their preferred alternative to energy sprawl. It is hard to see \nhow anyone could disagree. To cite one example, my home State of \nTennessee leads the Nation in residential per-person electricity use. \nIf Tennesseans simply used electricity at the national average, the \namount of electricity we would save each year would equal two nuclear \nplants. Oak Ridge National Laboratory scientists have said that fuel \nefficiency standards have been the single most important step our \ncountry has taken to reduce carbon emissions.\n  The second recommendation for energy sprawl is, in scientific terms, \nend-use generation of electricity which already occurs on already-\ndeveloped sites. The example is cogeneration that occurs at a paper \nfactory, for example, that uses waste product to produce electricity \nand heat to run its facility. A more familiar and promising example is \nsolar power on rooftops. In other words, since rooftops already exist, \ncovering them with hundreds of square miles of solar panels would \ncreate no additional sprawl. There are still obstacles to the \nwidespread use of solar panels. In the Southeast, solar still costs \nfour to five times what the Tennessee Valley Authority pays on average \nfor other electricity. There is the obstacle of aesthetics. But \ncompanies are now producing solar film embedded with attractive roofing \nmaterials, although that costs more. And there is still the problem \nthat solar power is only available when the Sun shines. Like wind, it \ncannot be stored in large quantities. But unlike wind, which often \nblows at night when we have plenty of spare electricity, the Sun shines \nwhen most people are at their peak power use. As former Energy \nSecretary James Schlesinger wrote recently in the Washington Post, \nbecause of their intermittence, wind and solar systems have to be \nbacked up by other forms of electricity generation, which adds to their \ncost and land usage.\n  The third recommendation is to make carbon regulation flexible, \nallowing for carbon recapture at coal plants, for nuclear power, and \nfor international offsets. So far, the sponsors of climate and energy \nbills in the Congress have not heeded this advice, I am sorry to say. \nIn fact, both the Waxman-Markey bill in the House and the Bingaman \nEnergy bill in the Senate contain very narrowly defined renewable \nelectricity mandates. Instead of allowing States to choose their \nmethods of producing the required amount of carbon-free electricity, \nthe legislation tilts heavily toward requiring wind power. For example, \nthe legislation allows existing and new wind turbines within the \nrenewable mandate, but only new hydroelectric power. It does not count \nnuclear power, which is carbon free, or municipal solid waste or \nlandfill gas as renewable.\n  In the same way, 75 percent of the so-called renewable electricity \nsubsidies enacted since 1978 have gone to wind developers. A study by \nthe Energy Information Administration shows that wind gets a subsidy of \n31 times that of all other renewables combined. These policies have \ncreated a heavy bias toward the form of renewable electricity--wind \npower--that could consume our treasured mountaintops and be very \ndestructive to wildlife. A national policy that encourages wind power \nin the Southeast, such as Tennessee or Virginia, where the wind barely \nblows, makes about as much sense as mandating new hydroelectric dams in \nthe Western desert where there is no water.\n\n[[Page S10087]]\n\n  It is my opinion that if we are truly seeking to reduce our carbon \noutput, the policy that would create the least energy sprawl would be a \ncarbon-free electricity standard allowing for the maximum flexibility \nfor those renewable electricity techniques that consume less land and \nrequire fewer transmission lines.\n  Finally, to deal with energy sprawl, The Nature Conservancy suggests \npaying attention to site selection. This is where the conservationists \ncan be a big help to the Senators. Those who have spent their time \nprotecting treasured landscapes and protecting wildlife could help us \nask the right questions and know the right answers. For example, should \nenergy projects be placed in national parks or national forests? If so, \nwhich forests and which energy projects? Should there be generous \ntaxpayer subsidies for renewable electricity projects within 20 miles \nof the Grand Tetons or along the Appalachian Trail? What about the \nlarge amounts of water needed for solar thermal plants or for nuclear \nplants? Should turbines be concentrated in shallow waters 20 miles or \nmore offshore where they cannot be seen from the coast? And should \ntransmission lines run under water? Couldn't wind turbines be located \nin the center of Lake Michigan where the wind blows more strongly \ninstead of along its shoreline where people can see them? Should there \nbe renewable energy zones, such as the solar zones Secretary Salazar is \nplanning where most new projects could be placed and where the most \nappropriate locations for those zones and those transmission lines \ncould be picked?\n  In a recent op-ed in the New York Times, the Massachusetts secretary \nof energy and environmental affairs asked this question: Wouldn't it \nmake a lot more sense to place wind turbines offshore in the Atlantic \nand run transmission lines underwater than to build new transmissions \nlines to carry wind power from the Great Plains to Boston? Should the \nsubsidies for cellulosic ethanol be larger than those for corn ethanol? \nOr should there be no subsidies at all? And should there be a special \neffort to encourage conservation easements on private lands that \nprotect treasured viewscapes and habitats?\n  These are the questions that the American people and the conservation \ngroups that have traditionally protected our landscapes and our \nhabitats could help us answer properly.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, on August 13, ExxonMobil \npleaded guilty in Federal court to killing 85 birds that had come into \ncontact with crude oil or other pollutants in uncovered tanks of \nwastewater facilities on its properties. The birds were protected by \nthe Migratory Bird Treaty Act which dates back to 1918. The company \npaid $600,000 in fines and fees for killing those 85 birds.\n  Should the migratory bird law be enforced against developers of other \nenergy projects--for example, renewable electricity and transmission \nlines? One wind farm near Oakland, CA, estimates that its turbines kill \n80 golden eagles a year. The American Bird Conservancy estimates the \n25,000 wind turbines in the United States kill somewhere between 75,000 \nand 275,000 birds a year. ``Somebody is getting a get-out-of-jail card \nfree,'' Michael Fry of the Bird Conservancy told the Journal. And what \nwould be the fine for the almost 1.4 million birds that 186,000 \nturbines might kill? For those who think birds may not be as important \nas some other subjects, read Douglas Brinkley's book about Teddy \nRoosevelt. Almost all of his wilderness activities started with his \ninterest in birds. According to Mr. Brinkley, the largest spectator \nsport in America, even ahead of NASCAR, is bird watching.\n  These statistics raise the question of whether there ought to be some \nkind of parity among all energy companies in the application of laws \nand policies. For example, oil and gas companies receive taxpayer \nsubsidies, but they bid to lease and drill on Federal land and waters \nand then they pay a royalty for the privilege. Should taxpayer-\nsubsidized developers of renewable electricity projects also be \nrequired to pay a royalty for the privilege of producing electricity on \nFederal lands and waters? And if so, could this be a source of \npermanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund or other \nconservation projects on the theory that if the law allows an \nenvironmental burden, it ought to require an environmental benefit?\n  Based on estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the \nCongressional Budget Office, taxpayers will pay wind developers a total \nof $29 billion in Federal subsidies over the next 10 years to increase \nwind power production from 1.5 to 4 percent of our total electricity.\n\n  There are an estimated 500,000 abandoned mines in our Nation--47,000 \nin California alone. To date, Congress has allocated a total of about \n$4 billion for their cleanup, and the end of the cleanup is nowhere in \nsight. Would it not be wise before the energy sprawl occurs to require \nbonds on Federal lands for the removal of energy equipment that is \nabandoned or not used anymore? Wind turbines wear out in 20 or 25 \nyears. Solar thermal farms can cover hundreds of acres. Policy \nsubsidies and prices can change.\n  In Germany, for example, a prominent maker of solar equipment \nsuggested cutting the government subsidy for solar equipment because it \nis permanently raising the prices of German-made products, and Germans \nare buying cheaper panels made in China. In other words, the Germans \nare subsidizing Chinese manufacturing.\n  So if the large U.S. subsidies for wind power were to disappear, as \nwas promised when they were created, and this led to the abandoning of \nsome renewable projects, it might be a good idea if someone were \nrequired to take away any abandoned equipment.\n  Which brought me to my last point: asking conservationists, \nespecially in this country, to rethink nuclear power.\n  In our country, fears about proliferation and waste and disposal have \nstymied the ``atoms for peace'' dream for large amounts of low-cost, \nclean, reliable energy from nuclear power. Twelve States even have \nmoratoria against building new nuclear plants. Still, the 104 U.S. \nreactors built between 1970 and 1990 produce 19 percent of America's \nelectricity and, as I have said, 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity.\n  I believe that what Americans should fear most about nuclear power is \nthis: The rest of the world will use it to create low-cost, carbon-free \nelectricity while we who invented it will not. That would send our jobs \noverseas looking for cheap energy, and it would deprive us of the \ntechnology most likely to produce large amounts of carbon-free \nelectricity to deal with climate change and to do it in a way least \nlikely to harm the landscape and wildlife habitat.\n  Look at what the rest of the world is doing. Of the top five \ngreenhouse gas emitters, who together produce 55 percent of all the \ncarbon in the world, only the United States has no new nuclear plants \nunder construction. China, the world's largest carbon emitter, recently \nupped its goal for new nuclear reactors to 132. Russia, the No. 3 \nemitter, plans two new reactors every year until 2030. Of the next two \nemitters, India has six reactors under construction and 10 more \nplanned. Japan already has 55 reactors and gets 35 percent of its \nelectricity from nuclear. It has two under construction and plans for \n10 more by 2018.\n  According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, there are 53 \nreactors worldwide under construction in 11 countries, mostly in Asia \nand not one in the United States. South Korea gets nearly 40 percent of \nits electricity from nuclear and plans another eight reactors by 2015. \nTaiwan gets 18 percent of its power from nuclear and is building two \nnew reactors.\n  In the West, France--we never like to give France credit for outdoing \nus in anything--but France gets 80 percent of its electricity from \nnuclear and, as a result, has among the lowest electricity rates and \ncarbon emissions in Western Europe, behind Sweden and Switzerland, both \nof which are half nuclear. Great Britain has hired the French electric \ncompany EDF to help build reactors. Italy has announced it will go back \nto nuclear.\n  Where does that leave the United States? We still know how to run \nreactors better than anyone else, we just don't build them anymore. Our \nfleet of plants is up and running 90 percent of the time. No one does \nthat well except us. We have 17 applications for new reactors pending \nbefore the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but we have not\n\n[[Page S10088]]\n\nstarted construction on any new nuclear plant in 30 years in the United \nStates.\n  The 104 we currently have in operation will begin to grow too old to \noperate in 20 years. That is why I believe the United States should \nbuild 100 new nuclear plants in 20 years. All 40 Republican Senators \nsupport that goal, and a number of Democratic Senators also are strong \nsupporters of nuclear power.\n  Building 100 plants in 20 years would bring our nuclear-produced \nelectricity to more than 40 percent of our total generation and it \nwould all be carbon free. Add another 10 percent for hydroelectric \ndams--that is carbon free; 7 or 8 percent for wind and solar, now about \n2.5 percent--that is carbon free; 25 percent for natural gas--that is \nlow carbon; and you begin to get a very clean and low-cost electricity \npolicy.\n  According to the National Academy of Sciences, construction costs for \n100 nuclear plants are about the same as they would be for 186,000 wind \nturbines. New reactors could be located mostly on sites with existing \nreactors. There would be little need for new transmission lines. \nTaxpayer subsidies for nuclear would be one-tenth what taxpayers would \npay wind developers over 10 years. And for so-called green jobs, \nbuilding 100 nuclear plants would provide 4 times as many construction \njobs as building 186,000 wind turbines. And, of course, nuclear is a \nbase load source of power operating 90 percent of the time--the kind of \nreliable power a country like the United States, which uses 25 percent \nof the energy in the world, must have. Wind and solar are useful \nsupplements, but they are only available, on average, about one-third \nof the time, and they can't be stored in large amounts.\n  What about the lingering fears of nuclear? Well, the Obama \nadministration Energy Secretary, Dr. Steven Chu, the Nobel Prize-\nwinning physicist, says nuclear plants are safe and he wouldn't mind \nliving near one. That view is echoed by thousands of U.S. Navy \npersonnel who have lived literally on top of nuclear reactors in \nsubmarines and Navy ships for more than 50 years without incident. The \nNuclear Regulatory Commission agrees, and its painstaking supervision \nand application process is intended to do everything humanly possible \nto keep our commercial fleet of reactors safe.\n  On the issue of waste, Dr. Chu says there is a two-step solution. \nStep 1 is, store the spent nuclear fuel on site for 40 to 60 years. The \nNuclear Regulatory Commission agrees this can be done safely, maybe for \n100 years. Step 2 is research and development, to find the best way to \nrecycle fuel so that its mass is reduced by 97 percent, pure plutonium \nis never created, and the waste is only radioactive for 300 years \ninstead of 1 million years. That kind of recycling would take care of \nboth the waste and the third fear of nuclear power--the threat that \nother countries might somehow use plutonium to build a bomb.\n  One could argue that because the United States failed to lead in \ndeveloping the safe use of nuclear technology for the last 30 years, we \nmay have made it easier for North Korea and Pakistan to steal or buy \nnuclear secrets from rogue countries.\n  I concluded with this prediction: Taking into account these energy \nsprawl concerns, I believe the best way to reach the necessary carbon \nreduction goals for climate change, with the least damage to our \nenvironment and to our economy, will prove to be, No. 1, building 100 \nnew nuclear plants in 20 years; No. 2, electrifying half the cars and \ntrucks in 20 years--we probably have enough unused electricity to plug \nthese vehicles in at night without building one new power plant--and \nNo. 3, putting solar panels on rooftops. To make this happen, the \ngovernment should launch mini-Manhattan Projects, like the one we had \nin World War II, for recycling used nuclear fuel, for better batteries, \nfor electric vehicles, to make solar panels cost competitive, and, in \naddition, to recapture carbon from coal plants. This plan I have just \ndescribed should produce the largest amount of electricity with the \nsmallest amount of carbon at the lowest possible cost, thereby avoiding \nthe pain and suffering that comes when high-cost energy pushes jobs \noverseas and makes it hard for low-income Americans to afford their \nheating and cooling bills.\n  My fellow Tennessean Al Gore won a Nobel Prize for arguing that \nglobal warming is the inconvenient problem. For those who believe he is \nright--and if you are also concerned about energy sprawl--then I would \nsuggest nuclear power is the inconvenient solution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, last Friday the New York Times had an \narticle which caught my eye, and the headline was the following: \n``October New York Philharmonic Trip to Cuba is Off.'' I want to talk \nfor a moment about this. I was extraordinarily disappointed to read \nthis because this is an issue of the freedom to travel by the American \npeople, specifically, the freedom to travel to Cuba.\n  This country has had an embargo against the country of Cuba for a \nlong while. Cuba is a Communist country. Fidel Castro has poked his \nfinger in the eye of America for a long time, so we have had an embargo \nfor a long time. Part of the way to injure the Castro regime, \npresumably, as a part of this embargo is to prevent the American people \nfrom traveling to Cuba. The American people can travel to Communist \nChina, to Communist Vietnam, to North Korea, but the American people \nare considered taking a criminal act if they travel to Cuba. There are \nsome exceptions; the U.S. Treasury Department gives licenses to travel \nfor certain kinds of educational and cultural things, and for trade.\n  So the New York Philharmonic orchestra was going to Cuba, but had to \ncancel the trip. Daniel Wakin wrote about it in the New York Times last \nFriday October 1, 2009. The reason I wanted to mention this is because \nit is almost unbelievable what we are still doing with respect to our \ntravel policy with Cuba.\n  Senator Enzi and I have a piece of legislation that removes all \ntravel restrictions with respect to travel to Cuba. We have over 30 \nSenators who are cosponsors of that legislation, but while we are \nwaiting to pass our legislation, we are going through this nonsense of \nhaving the Federal Government and the Treasury Department tell us who \ncan and who cannot travel, restricting the liberty and the freedom of \nthe American people. It is outrageous, in my judgment.\n  Trips like the one the New York Philharmonic planned to Havana are \nnot unusual. These kinds of trips happen all of the time. In 1959, at \nthe height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, the New York \nPhilharmonic played in Moscow. It is a reasonably good thing, in my \njudgment, to be able to extend our culture and the hand of friendship \nthrough music.\n  One of the reasons I was especially interested in this is that the \nNew York Philharmonic visited North Korea last year, and I asked \nconductor Loren Maazel and Zarin Mehta, President of the Philharmonic's \nboard, to come and speak to our caucus. They described to us their \nperformances in North Korea. They said the applause went on and on, \neven after they left the stage. What a great way to exchange with \nanother country, to extend cultural enlightenment and to share with \nother countries. Again, the New York Philharmonic orchestra played in \nNorth Korea last year, but cannot play in Cuba without a special \nlicense.\n  The New York Philharmonic is going to Communist Vietnam this month.\n\n[[Page S10089]]\n\nYes, it is a Communist country. So, too, is North Korea, as is China, \nas is Russia. But the New York Philharmonic orchestra has no difficulty \nbeing able to play music in those countries because there are no travel \nrestrictions with respect to those countries.\n  Let me describe, if I might, the absurdity of all of this. The Office \nof Foreign Assets Control is a little agency in the Treasury Department \nthat is in charge of granting licenses that, under certain conditions, \nwill allow you to travel to Cuba. The license they decided to allow the \nNew York Philharmonic to go to Cuba and play their music did not \ninclude allowing the benefactors of the Philharmonic to travel with \nthem and the Philharmonic decided that was unacceptable. Frankly, I \nunderstand why it is unacceptable for them. That doesn't make any sense \nto me.\n  The OFAC regulations says\n\n       Unless otherwise authorized, any person subject to U.S. \n     jurisdiction who engages in any travel-related transaction in \n     Cuba violates the regulations.\n\n  That is unbelievable to me. That has been around, I think, for 40 \nyears, 50 years.\n  Let me give examples of some people who have traveled to Cuba who our \nFederal Government has chased and harassed. By the way, this little \nagency called OFAC, somewhere in the bowels of the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, is supposed to be \ntracking terrorist money, protecting us from terrorists. Instead they \nhave been busy chasing people who go to Cuba. In the previous \nadministration, up to a quarter of their time was spent trying to track \nAmericans who were under suspicion of taking a vacation in Cuba. It is \npretty absurd, it seems to me.\n  This is Joan Slote. She was a senior citizen and bicyclist who was \nfined $7,630. Do you know why? Because she joined a Canadian bicycling \ngroup that took a bicycle tour of Cuba and, as a result of that, her \ngovernment--under the previous administration--tracked her down, \nthreatened to attach her Social Security checks, and fined her $7,630 \nfor riding a bicycle in Cuba.\n  Here is a picture of a woman I have met named Joni Scott. Joni \nScott's transgression? She is a very religious woman, a devout \nChristian. She went to Cuba to hand out free Bibles on the streets of \nCuba and her government tried to track her down and fine her $10,000 \nfor handing out free Bibles on the streets of Cuba because she violated \nthe travel ban. The travel ban, that means restricting the liberty of \nthe American people. We do not ban travel to other countries. We do not \ndo it for communist China, for communist Russia, communist Vietnam--\njust for Cuba.\n  This is SGT Carlos Lazo. A number of years ago, Carlos Lazo went and \nfought in the country of Iraq, wearing America's uniform. He is a \nCuban-American. He was in Iraq as a fighting soldier for this country. \nHe won the Bronze Star for gallantry. He had two children in Cuba, one \nof whom was sick, and his government that he fought for and won the \nBronze Star for, told him he was not able to travel to Cuba to see his \nown sick child. Hat shows how unbelievably wrong this policy is.\n  Let me describe what the policy is about traveling to other \ncountries. The rules say:\n\n       All transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from \n     Iran . . . are permitted.\n\n  If you want to go to Iran, no problem; that is not an issue. You are \nwelcome to go to Iran.\n  If you want to see Kim Jong-il in North Korea, it is not a problem. \nThe rules say:\n\n       U.S. passports are valid for travel in North Korea and \n     individuals do not need U.S. Government permission to travel \n     there.\n\n  Here are the 10 Presidents we have had since we decided to punish the \nAmerican people with a travel ban to Cuba--10 Presidents. You talk \nabout failure--it is one thing just to fail; it is another thing to \ninsist that failure is a good thing for 50 years. This Government of \nCuba has lasted through 10 Presidents. What we have decided to do is, \nover all these years, to ban travel to Cuba by the American people.\n  You can go to Cuba in certain capacities. You can go in certain \neducational capacities, or cultural capacities, provided you get a \nlicense. I have been to Cuba. I have been to Havana. I have visited \nwith government officials, I visited with all the dissidents in Cuba. \nMany of my colleagues here in Congress have undoubtedly traveled to \nCuba. But we have a licensing requirement with respect to travel to \nCuba.\n  We also had this trade embargo for all of these years. I was one who, \nsome years ago, lifted that embargo slightly to be able to sell food \nand medicine into Cuba. I think it is fundamentally immoral to use food \nas a weapon. We had an embargo against selling food to Cuba. The \nEuropeans were selling into Cuba, the Canadians were selling into Cuba; \nthe American farmers were told you can't sell food into Cuba. As a \nresult of my amendment, the amendment I offered with then Senator \nAshcroft, that amendment opened just a bit the sale of food into Cuba \nand allowed medicine to go into Cuba as well, but that is the only \nthing that has happened in all of these years.\n  Senator Enzi and I have offered a bipartisan piece of legislation \nthat would allow travel, allow the American people the freedom to \ntravel in Cuba.\n  My colleagues in this Chamber talk a lot about freedom. What about \nthe freedom of the American people to travel? Why is it we have decided \nto punish the Cuban regime by restricting Americans' freedoms?\n  I come back to the basic proposition. That is, one of the great music \ngroups in the world, the New York Philharmonic, which has played in \nNorth Korea, in Russia, and is about to play in Vietnam, is told: Here \nare the circumstances and conditions in which you can play in Cuba. By \nthe way, they are onerous. The New York Philharmonic found those \ncircumstances and conditions unacceptable and I understand why.\n  I am writing to the Office of Assets Control to see if we could not \nget them to think straight a bit. It makes no sense at all to decide \nthat this kind of exchange is unworthy. Does anybody really think that \nhaving the New York Philharmonic play beautiful music in the city of \nHavana, in the country of Cuba, is in any way going to threaten \nanybody? Wouldn't it perhaps do at least what it did for those who were \nable to experience that wonderful music in North Korea? I saw the \nphotographs, I saw the video. I believe ``60 Minutes'' did a piece on \nit, that showed how unbelievably they were responded to by the North \nKorean people who heard them, who listened to the New York \nPhilharmonic. Wouldn't that be the same with respect to Cuba?\n  Why on Earth should our government be interpreting this travel \nrestriction in the way that is designed to try to restrict rather than \nexpand these opportunities? I have seen how OFAC, over these years, \ntries to find ways to tighten, find ways to create opportunity to \nrestrict travel. That makes no sense to me at all.\n  When I read this, this weekend, I thought what on Earth could they be \nthinking of? Where is the deep reservoir of common sense that you \nshould expect from people who are confronted with this issue? When \nconfronted with the issue of granting a license to the New York \nPhilharmonic Orchestra to represent our country in doing concerts in \nHavana, why should OFAC be trying to find ways to make that too \nrestrictive for the Philharmonic and its benefactors to travel to Cuba \nand do what they had intended to do?\n  This kind of opportunity to connect with other countries has a long \nhistory. I showed a picture of the New York Philharmonic, conducted by \nLeonard Bernstein, performing in the Great Hall in the Moscow \nConservatory. Let me show that again. It raises the question about \ncommon sense. If we are able, in 1959, with all of the tensions with \nMoscow and the Soviet Union at that point, and we sent our New York \nPhilharmonic Orchestra in an exchange and Leonard Bernstein conducted, \nand they, too, were greeted with long, sustained applause because \npeople were so appreciative of them being in Moscow; if that has been \nthe case--and it has been in every circumstance and last year \nespecially it was with respect to the appearance in North Korea--if \nthat is the case, why on Earth would our Government do anything other \nthan encourage the New York Philharmonic to do the concert in Havana, \ninstead of discourage it, instead of finding ways to tighten\n\n[[Page S10090]]\n\nthis down so the New York Philharmonic and their benefactors had \ndecided they simply couldn't go under those conditions?\n  Common sense ought to apply on this issue of the liberty and the \nfreedom of the American people to travel. There ought not be travel \nrestrictions to Cuba at all. They ought to be gone and we ought to pass \nthe Dorgan-Enzi bill that strikes the travel restrictions with respect \nto Cuba. We have not yet found a way to get it to the floor. When \nwe do, I guarantee we will have sufficient votes on the floor of the \nSenate to offer the American people the freedom they should have had in \nthe last 50 or 60 years, and that is freedom to travel. In this case \nthat freedom has been taken from them and it is outrageous.\n\n  I mentioned Joan Slote. When I became involved in this issue of what \nthis embargo costs our country, I was furious to find an elderly woman \nriding a bicycle in Cuba and then fined $7,300 by her government.\n  By the way, when she came back, her son had brain cancer so she \nwasn't home, she was attending to her son who had brain cancer down in \nCalifornia, and she didn't get the mailing to her house and then they \nthreatened to take her Social Security away. Why? Because she was \nsuspected of vacationing in Cuba, riding a bicycle with a Canadian \nbicycle group.\n  All of this I think is nuts and I hope at some point the New York \nPhilharmonic will be given the license, with their benefactors, to go \ndown and do the concert in Havana, Cuba; do the concert there. In the \nmeantime, I hope the Office of Foreign Asset Control will take a look \nat this and make a new decision. They have the right to make a better \ndecision. In my judgment they didn't make the right decision here. I \nhope they overturn that decision. I have written them a letter today \nasking them to do that. Let's use a little common sense here.\n  Following that, I hope Senator Enzi and I will get our legislation on \nthe floor of the Senate and remove the travel restrictions that now \nimpede the freedom of the American people to travel to Cuba.\n  The country of Cuba has been a thorn in our side for a long time; I \nunderstand that. But attempting to punish the leaders of Cuba by \npunishing the American people makes no sense at all. That is exactly \nwhat has happened since the early 1960s. My hope is that some day, \ndespite the news last Friday that the New York Philharmonic has \ncanceled this trip--my hope is some day very soon we will have a policy \nthat doesn't have anybody canceling trips because they didn't get their \nlicense to travel. My hope is anybody can travel anywhere, representing \nthe best of this country.\n  The New York Philharmonic is a wonderful cultural ambassador--to the \nSoviet Union, and North Korea, and Vietnam, all communist countries--\nand it can also be with Cuba. I hope that will happen soon.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the 2010 Defense \nappropriations bill and the three amendments that will be called up \ntomorrow on C-17s, for-profit earmark competition, and a particularly \negregious earmark on hypersonic wind tunnel development.\n  Tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of the 2010 Department \nof Defense Appropriations Act. This must-pass bill provides $626 \nbillion for the day-to-day operations of our military, including the \ncritical resources that support our commanders as they lead operations \nin Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  The bill also contains billions of dollars in wasteful spending, \nincluding $2.7 billion in Member-requested earmarks and billions of \ndollars in unrequested weapons systems, which is where you will find \n$2.5 billion for the C-17 cargo aircraft. In order to stuff these \nprograms into the bill that the Pentagon did not request and does not \nwant, and to enable Members to continue in their porkbarreling ways, \nthe appropriators cut over $3 billion in the military service operation \nand maintenance account.\n  This account is the lifeblood of our military forces. The account \nprovides the military with funds to carry out day-to-day activities, \nsuch as the recruitment and fielding of a trained and ready force, all \nmilitary training, exercises, food, weapons, spare parts, equipment \nrepair, ship overhauls, transportation services, civilian personnel \nmanagement and pay, and childcare and family centers.\n  At a time when stress on our force and their families is significant, \nwe are cutting funds from this account to put into this bill unwanted \nC-17s and Members' pork projects. There were plenty of lobbyists around \nfor the C-17s last week. They were here in abundance. There are others \nwho are seeking these porkbarrel projects.\n  Unfortunately, there are no lobbyists for the men and women serving \nin the military. There are no lobbyists to provide them with the much-\nneeded funds in order to conduct the training and the operation and the \nmaintenance and the repair of the equipment and their pay and all of \nthe things that are so vital to maintaining our great military of \ntoday.\n  There are no lobbyists for them. So let's cut $3 billion out of their \ntraining, out of their exercises, out of their weapons and spare parts \nand equipment repairs, ship overhauls, civilian personnel management \nand pay, childcare and family centers. Cut all of that out and put in \n$2.5 billion for a C-17 that the military neither needs nor wants.\n  Just last month, the President spoke in Phoenix, AZ, to the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars. In that speech, the President's words were quite \ncompelling about waste and porkbarrel spending in Defense bills. In \nthat speech the President promised an end ``to special interests and \ntheir exotic projects'' and reaffirmed that he was leading the charge \nto kill off programs such as the F-22, the second engine for the Joint \nStrike Fighter, and the outrageously expensive Presidential helicopter.\n  The President went on to say:\n\n       If a project does not support our troops, we will not fund \n     it. If a system does not perform well, we will terminate it. \n     And if Congress sends me a bill loaded with that kind of \n     waste, I will veto it.\n\n  Well, we will now see if the President is willing to follow through \non that bold declaration. On April 6, 2009, Secretary Gates personally \nissued his highly touted statement on the 2010 defense budget. In that \nstatement, he recommended, among other things, ending production of the \nF-22, terminating the Presidential helicopter, and completing \nproduction of the C-17 cargo aircraft. Secretary Gates said with the \n205 C-17s already in the force and currently on order, the Department's \nanalysis was that the military had enough C-17s.\n  While we may have won a small victory against the defense industrial \ncomplex in July, when the Senate voted 58 to 40 to kill the F-22, it \nappears the administration has thrown in the towel on reining in \nspending on the C-17. In May, the House appropriators added eight C-17s \ninto the 2009 supplemental appropriations bill at a cost of $2.2 \nbillion. The Pentagon did not even blink. In July, the House \nappropriators again added three more C-17s to the 2010 Defense \nappropriations bill, and with the White House apparently having given \nup on any kind of fight with Congress on the C-17, and believing they \nhad a green light, the Senate appropriators upped the number of C-17s \nto 10 aircraft, $2.5 billion.\n  Beneath the President's Phoenix rhetoric and with $2.5 billion in \nunrequested C-17s, $2.7 billion in member earmarks and a significant \ncut in operation and maintenance funding, one would have expected the \nPresident and Secretary Gates to be outraged. However, we have heard \nbarely a word of opposition from them. Although the Statement of \nAdministration Policy raised opposition to the additional C-17s and the \ncuts to operation and maintenance funding, it appears the President is \nnot getting out his veto pen to\n\n[[Page S10091]]\n\ntake a stand behind his own strong rhetoric on earmarks and government \nwaste.\n  I know these words will fall on deaf ears, but it is certainly not \nresponsible for Congress to continue to load up appropriations bills--\nand, yes, authorization bills--with wasteful and unnecessary spending. \nAmericans all over the country are hurting. People are losing jobs, \ntheir savings and their homes. Yet we continue the disgraceful \nearmarking process, elevating parochialism and patronage politics over \nthe true needs and welfare of our men and women in uniform and the \ntaxpayers.\n  If Senators think that all sounds too familiar, they are right; it is \nbusiness as usual. When push comes to shove, nobody seems to really \nmind. The appropriators know what they need to do to keep the President \nfrom threatening to veto a defense spending bill. They know that $2.5 \nbillion in unrequested C-17s, $2.7 billion in Member-requested \nearmarks, and cuts of over $3 billion to the lifeblood account of our \nmilitary services won't cause the President to pause a moment before \nsigning such a bill into law. The idea of vetoing a defense \nappropriations bill that funds the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is \nunimaginable, and that is exactly the protection sought by Members when \nthey subscribe to unrequested, costly weapons systems and earmarks.\n  Servicemembers who defend our Nation around the globe are making \ngreat sacrifices. Their families back home are making sacrifices. \nBecause we ask these heroes to forfeit so much, we in Congress should \nalso be ready to make sacrifices. Sometimes that means doing what is \nbest for the Nation instead of doing what is best for one's campaign. \nOur Nation's security and the welfare of our servicemembers are higher \npriorities than the favor of special interests or the opportunity to \ntout the bacon we are bringing home.\n  Despite what I think is going to happen, I believe that if the \nPresident wants to send a message that we are serious about cutting out \nwasteful and unnecessary and corrupting spending in Congress, he should \nveto this bill, and we could send it back to him in a New York minute \nwithout the pork it is so full of.\n  I wish to discuss the three amendments.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on my amendment to strike the addition \nof 10 unrequested C-17 aircraft. As I discussed before, the \nadministration strongly objects to the addition of the $2.5 billion in \nfunding for those 10 unrequested C-17s. That brings up a very \ninteresting question: Why would the administration threaten to veto the \nbill if it included the F-22s, yet strongly object to the $2.5 billion \nfor the 10 unrequested C-17s? It is very interesting. Given how much \nour airlift capacity currently exceeds operational requirements, I see \nno reason we should buy more aircraft. It is not just an additional \n$2.5 billion for these 10 C-17s, it is an additional $100 million a \nyear to maintain and operate them.\n  One of the great, untold stories of earmarking is that money that is \nused to fund special interests' projects would otherwise have been used \nto address the stated needs of our military services. The service \nchiefs who are in the best position to advise Congress of their \npriorities are routinely shortchanged so that Senators can fund their \npet projects. Each earmark requires departmental administration, and \neach draws manpower and resources away from critical issues facing a \nnation at war. I have heard that the impact of these many small \nearmarks is akin to death by 1,000 cuts. By my preliminary count, there \nare almost 700 unrequested earmarks in this bill, over 400 of which are \nnot authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act. This \nrepresents more than $1.3 billion in funding for unrequested, \nunauthorized Member interest items, $1.3 billion that would have gone \nto service priorities. Some have merit. None are military priorities. A \nfew are actually detrimental to the Defense Department. I am referring \nto earmarks that endure year after year, siphon funding from legitimate \nprograms, and provide no discernable benefit to servicemembers.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate will cast scrutiny on one such project when we \nvote on my amendment to strike $9.5 million for the MARIAH hypersonic \nwind tunnel research program in Montana. It has never been requested in \nthe President's budget. It has never been authorized. Yet it has been \nappropriated every year since 1998. To date, total Defense \nappropriations for MARIAH account for $68.5 million. The total would be \n$74 million if we include unrequested earmarks through NASA; $83.5 \nmillion if this year's earmark for MARIAH remains in the bill.\n  Here we are, Congress has appropriated millions for an unrequested, \nunauthorized program that is objectionable enough, but the MARIAH \nprogram and the contractor that supports it are case studies in the \nfundamental problems with the congressional appropriations process.\n  Let me shed a little light on that. MARIAH is a research program \nintended to develop technologies that would be required to build a \nnational high-speed wind tunnel. Congress originally funded the project \nthrough NASA earmarks during the 1990s. NASA responded that they had no \ninterest in the program. From 1998 to 2003, MARIAH was an Air Force \nprogram. The Air Force, the leader in hypersonic testing and \ntechnology, begged off the program in 2004. So the appropriators moved \nit to the Army. The Army has no official requirement for this \ncapability and published a report to Congress in 2005 stating their \ndisinterest in the program. Here is an excerpt:\n\n       The U.S. Army believes it is premature to include the \n     MARIAH wind tunnel concept within their budget as a program \n     of record due to the lack of information and technical data \n     to show that the concept is feasible. Further, the U.S. Army \n     has yet to establish an operational requirement to justify \n     the need for such expenditures in the Future Years Defense \n     Program. Therefore, the U.S. Army does not plan to fund the \n     MARIAH wind tunnel effort . . .\n\n  Priorities change over time. I asked the Army to detail their current \ninvestment in MARIAH and explain how the Army might use this research \nto develop new capabilities. I received a response yesterday. Here is \nwhat the Army said:\n\n       There are no current operational requirements for a \n     hypersonic missile program within the Army. No Army missions \n     currently require hypersonic flight technologies. The Army \n     does not plan to budget for hypersonic wind tunnel \n     development in the [current or future years] since the Army \n     does not have an operational requirement for a hypersonic \n     missile.\n\n  Finally, when asked whether the MARIAH program provides value-added \ncapabilities, the Army's answer was ``no.''\n  So the Army's official response and explanation sounds like their \n2005 response. Unfortunately, Congress hasn't been listening. We have \npoured more than $70 million into it with no sign of stopping and with \nno discernable return on investment. Let me repeat that: no end date, \nno return on investment.\n  One group has made out well in the endeavor. Of course, I am \nreferring to lobbyists, including Gage LLC, whose CEO, coincidentally, \nhad been a senior staffer to an appropriator from Montana.\n  The other big winner is the contractor, a company called MSE \nTechnology Applications located, astonishingly, in Butte, MT. MSE is \npart of a former Department of Energy facility created in the 1970s to \nconduct energy research. In 1996, MSE had an agreement with DOD to \nprivatize over the course of 5 years, and DOD provided funding to \nassist the privatization effort. Simultaneously, MSE executives began a \npattern of hiring lobbyists, participating in fundraisers for elected \nMembers of Congress, and taking millions of dollars in earmarks. So \nmuch for privatization. In fact, MSE itself has claimed it was entirely \ndependent on Federal earmarks following the so-called privatization \neffort.\n  More than a decade later, not much has changed. The Montana Standard, \nthe local newspaper, reports that 75 percent of MSE's current business \ncomes from Federal earmarks. According to their CEO:\n\n       Earmarks can have a negative connotation, but what they \n     mean is we have contracts.\n\n  So this is a company that would not exist without government \nearmarks. What did MSE pay for these earmarks? Over $2 million in fees \nto Washington lobbyists and tens of thousands of dollars in campaign \ncontributions. We have the filings. MSE has perfected the\n\n[[Page S10092]]\n\nprocess of using lobbyists to secure Federal funding.\n  Here is the most outrageous part. In 2000, MSE executives pled guilty \nto making illegal campaign contributions to Federal candidates. Let me \nexplain. According to a report provided to Congress by the Department \nof Justice:\n\n       MSE, Inc., an engineering corporation headquartered in \n     Butte, Montana, pled guilty on April 27, 2000, to making \n     contributions to federal candidates through conduits and \n     making corporate contributions to federal candidates in \n     violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act. The \n     corporation agreed to pay a criminal fine of $97,500 and a \n     civil penalty to the Federal Election Commission of an \n     additional $19,500. In addition, the corporation's two \n     principal officers agreed, as part of the corporation's \n     probation, to perform community service by lecturing business \n     groups throughout Montana on the prohibitions of the [Federal \n     Election Campaign Act], and to implement a corporate \n     compliance agreement aimed at ensuring that the company did \n     not violate the [Federal Election Campaign Act] in the \n     future. The corporation was sentenced on April 27, 2000, in \n     accordance with the plea agreement.\n\n  This company has a criminal record. Yet it still receives \ncongressionally approved earmarks, apparently on the basis of \nconnections between it, its lobbyists, and the offices of Members for \nwhom those lobbyists used to work.\n  MSE and its MARIAH project are a black hole for Federal funding. MSE \nexecutives have benefited financially on the backs of the taxpayers for \nmany years, and the Department of Defense has needlessly wasted over \n$70 million on MARIAH research that no one wants. Taxpayers' dollars \nput toward MARIAH were met with resistance from each Federal agency \ncompelled to fund it by previous earmarks. These earmarks have produced \nno discernible return.\n  In light of this sordid story--$70 million wasted over 11 years and \nthe prospect of continuing funding for a program no one wants--I ask my \ncolleagues to support my amendment to strike the $9.5 million MARIAH \nearmark from the fiscal year 2010 Defense appropriations bill.\n  Finally, I have spoken for many years about the earmarking process \nand the corruption it breeds. I am deeply concerned over the damage it \nhas done to our country and this institution by its continued abuse. We \nhave made some progress in the past couple years but not nearly enough. \nLegislation we passed in 2007 provided for greater disclosure. While \nthat was a good step forward, the bottom line is that we simply need \nmore disclosure of earmarks. We need to reduce them, with the final \ngoal of eliminating them entirely. The corruption which stems from the \npractice of earmarking has resulted in former Members of both the House \nand Senate either under investigation, under indictment, or in prison. \nLet's be clear. It wasn't inadequate disclosure requirements which led \nDuke Cunningham to violate his oath of office and take $2.5 million in \nbribes in exchange for doling out $70 to $80 million of the taxpayers \nfunds to a defense contractor. It was his ability to freely earmark \ntaxpayer funds without question.\n\n  Tomorrow, Senators will have an opportunity to vote on an amendment I \nhave offered that requires earmarks intended for for-profit entities \nincluded in the Defense appropriations bill be competitively bid. I \nrepeat: requires earmarks intended for for-profit entities included in \nthe Defense appropriations bill be competitively bid. That does not \nseem like it should be too tough. Just competitively bid these \nearmarks.\n  By requiring full and open competition, Congress can make the process \nof public funding more transparent and bring to bear the benefits of \ncompetition. The results will be lower costs to the government, \ninnovation among contractors and suppliers, and better outcomes for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I am not the first person to think this is a good idea. The President \nand the Appropriations Committee in the House of Representatives are \nboth on record endorsing it. Unfortunately, to date, and despite our \ngood intentions, Congress has not been able to make it happen.\n  President Obama has promised to fight ``the special interests, \ncontractors and entrenched lobbyists'' that have bloated past \nappropriations and distorted military priorities. In March of this \nyear, he called the awarding of earmarks for private companies ``the \nsingle most corrupting element of this practice'' and said funding for \nsuch projects should be evaluated with a higher level of scrutiny and \nsubject to the same competitive bidding process as Federal contracts. I \nagree, but I would have gone further by calling for the elimination of \nearmarks altogether.\n  I was pleased to see our House counterparts expressed interest in \ncompeting earmarks intended for private industry. But the Senate \nAppropriations Committee balked at the suggestion that funding for \nspecial interest programs be subject to competition, and the result of \nrecent Senate-House negotiations is that earmarks in the fiscal year \n2010 appropriations bills will not have to be competitively bid.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. We must not allow this \nbody to go back to the old ways of doing business.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10092-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10092-S10093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of a swift extension of \nthe unemployment insurance benefits to help jobless people throughout \nthis country.\n  Last week, we learned that the economy had shed 263,000 jobs in \nSeptember and the unemployment rate increased to 9.8 percent. I grant \nthis is a remarkable change since the first of the year when 700,000 \njobs or more were being lost. Still, that is very small comfort to \nthose people who are losing their jobs and others who are losing their \nbenefits if we fail to act swiftly and extend unemployment benefits for \nadditional weeks.\n  This is the particular case in my State of Rhode Island. We are \nlooking at a 12.8 percent unemployment rate. There are thousands who \nhave already exhausted their unemployment benefits, and there are \nanother 4,500 who are estimated will lose their benefits before the end \nof the year. This is an extraordinary number of people who are out of \nwork, and they are finding incredible difficulty in securing jobs.\n  I ask that my colleagues come together in support of an extension of \nthe unemployment insurance benefits. The House overwhelmingly passed \nthis legislation on a bipartisan basis. I have introduced legislation \nhere, along with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n  This is not a partisan issue. The job losses in this country are \nacross the Nation. They are affecting working families and people who \nhave spent their whole lives working hard, and now they face a huge \ncrisis--without a job--and they are facing uncertainty in the future, \nhealth care issues, tuition for college, and those things families \nstruggle with every day.\n  In addition, unemployment insurance is one of those features of \nsupport that actually increases demand, accelerates the economy. The \neffect of unemployment insurance for each dollar is more than a dollar \nof economic activity generated. At this time, we are trying to jump-\nstart the economy and move it forward and give it momentum so it \ndoesn't falter and fall back. Unemployment insurance provides not only \nindividual assistance, but it also assists the economy.\n  We are in the most severe economic downswing since the Great \nDepression. We have to go ahead and help people who need it and based \non their work. That is one of the other values of unemployment \ninsurance. These people are our colleagues and friends and neighbors \nwho have worked and now they are without work. They desperately want to \nwork.

Law enforcement agencies \n     may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons \n     are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not \n     all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms \n     traced are used in crime.\n       (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for \n     purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of \n     firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected \n     do not constitute a random sample and should not be \n     considered representative of the larger universe of all \n     firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe. \n     Firearms are normally traced to the first retail seller, and \n     sources reported for firearms traced do not necessarily \n     represent the sources or methods by which firearms in general \n     are acquired for use in crime.\n       Sec. 517.

The results shall \n     be made available in redacted form to exclude--\n       (1) any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5, \n     United States Code; and\n       (2) sensitive personal information for any individual, the \n     public access to which could be used to commit identity theft \n     or for other inappropriate or unlawful purposes.\n       (c) A grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by \n     this Act may not be used for the purpose of defraying the \n     costs of a banquet or conference that is not directly and \n     programmatically related to the purpose for which the grant \n     or contract was awarded, such as a banquet or conference held \n     in connection with planning, training, assessment, review, or \n     other routine purposes related to a project funded by the \n     grant or contract.\n       (d) Any person awarded a grant or contract funded by \n     amounts appropriated by this Act shall submit a statement to \n     the Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General, the \n     Administrator, Director, or President, as appropriate, \n     certifying that no funds derived from the grant or contract \n     will be made available through a subcontract or in any other \n     manner to another person who has a financial interest in the \n     person awarded the grant or contract.\n       (e) The provisions of the preceding subsections of this \n     section shall take effect 30 days after the date on which the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Government \n     Ethics, determines that a uniform set of rules and \n     requirements, substantially similar to the requirements in \n     such subsections, consistently apply under the executive \n     branch ethics program to all Federal departments, agencies, \n     and entities.\n       Sec. 518.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under this Act may be used to issue patents on \n     claims directed to or encompassing a human organism.\n       Sec. 519.  None of the funds made available in this Act \n     shall be used in any way whatsoever to support or justify the \n     use of torture by any official or contract employee of the \n     United States Government.\n       Sec. 520.

The \n     President shall terminate the requirements of a license when \n     reasons for the temporary requirements have ceased.\n       Sec. 521.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States \n     receiving appropriated funds under this Act or any other Act \n     shall obligate or expend in any way such funds to pay \n     administrative expenses or the compensation of any officer or \n     employee of the United States to deny any application \n     submitted pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2778(b)(1)(B) and qualified \n     pursuant to 27 CFR section 478.112 or .113, for a permit to \n     import United States origin ``curios or relics'' firearms, \n     parts, or ammunition.\n       Sec. 522.

Mr. President, I am pleased to present, with Chairwoman \nMikulski, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \nAppropriation bill for fiscal year 2010.\n  First, I thank Senator Mikulski and her staff for their continued \nfriendship and the hard work they have put into this bill.\n  This is truly the most diverse appropriations bill we have, literally \naffecting all the expanses of our planet and into the outer recesses of \nthe universe.\n  It covers State and local law enforcement and counterterrorism \nefforts, oceanic and weather research, trade, standards research, and \nit keeps our Nation competitive through investment in science and space \nexploration.\n  This bill funds the Department of Justice and Commerce, as well as \nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration or NASA, the National \nScience Foundation or NSF; and a number of independent agencies, \nincluding the U.S. Trade Representative, the Legal Services \nCorporation, and International Trade Commission, to name a few.\n  Nothing is more important than the safety of the American people. The \ncommittee's recommendation this evening for the Department of Justice \nis $27.4 billion, which is $311 million over the request.\n  Senator Mikulski and I have worked to ensure that Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement agencies receive the funding needed to protect \nour citizens and our communities.\n  The Department of Commerce is funded in this bill at $14 billion, \n$254 million over the requested level. This department contains some of \nour Nation's most important business development, economic, science and \nresearch agencies, including the Economic Development Administration, \nwhich we know as the EDA, the National Institutes of Science and \nTechnology or NIST, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, which we call NOAA.\n  Senator Mikulski and I have attempted to expand the foundation for \nour Nation's economic future, as well as providing researchers with the \ntools to assess our weather, oceans, and environment.\n  Of the amount provided to the Department of Commerce in the bill \nbefore us, $7.3 billion is for the 2010 census and $4.8 billion for \nNOAA, an increase of $299 million over the request. These additional \nfunds are directed toward research, observation, education, and \nconservation programs.\n  For NASA, this bill provides $18.7 billion to move forward with the \nAgency's current exploration vision, while fully funding the ongoing \nactivities of the space shuttle and the International Space Station.\n  We are at a challenging point in time for the funding of NASA, \nparticularly human spaceflight. As you well know, Mr. President, the \nspace shuttle is successfully finishing the required deliveries to the \nspace station in its few remaining flights. The International Space \nStation has a permanent crew of six, which will allow our astronauts to \nconduct science instead of just station upkeep.\n  We are also on the verge of having a test flight of the rockets being \ndeveloped by NASA to once again take humans beyond low Earth orbit. As \nNASA moves toward retiring the shuttle and leaving the Nation without \nour own human launch vehicle, I believe we must continue to develop our \nown capabilities, not only for missions to the space station but for \nfuture expeditions as well.\n  While I commend the Augustine Commission for their hard work, I find \nmany of the aspects proposed in their summary report to be \nunsatisfactory and perhaps disappointing.\n  I am baffled by NASA's path forward on the Constellation Program. \nThis program is built on a foundation of proven technologies using \nexisting capabilities and infrastructure. The Ares I team will soon \nlaunch the first test flight, and the groundwork for the Ares V heavy \nlift vehicle is well underway. And yet, instead of simply providing \nConstellation with funds to move forward, it is delaying the current \nmission while seeking to have a do-over on plans that have been \nauthorized by both a Republican and Democratic Congress.\n  NASA and this administration should never forget that the support of \nCongress will still be necessary to authorize and provide funds as we \nmove forward.\n  Given the challenges and high cost of access to space, I agree that \nit is beneficial for NASA to look at all viable options that could be \nprovided by U.S. industries to support operations on the International \nSpace Station and future exploration. However, we must do so, I \nbelieve, in a realistic way. NASA must support the program that has the \ngreatest likelihood of success.\n  The benefits that our society has gained from the human spaceflight \nprogram are immeasurable. Almost every facet of our lives that we know \ntoday has been touched by discoveries with human spaceflight.\n  Beyond the direct tangible benefits, there is also the intangible \nbenefit that comes with knowing that America is\n\n[[Page S10105]]\n\nleading the world in discovering and exploring new frontiers.\n  I will not support any future NASA budget request that does not have \na robust human exploration program. It must be a program that inspires, \nyet is also a program grounded in what is possible and not wishful \nthinking.\n  If we no longer prioritize space exploration, we can be certain that \nothers on this planet will. A number of the findings by the Augustine \nCommission would guarantee that other nations, such as Russia, China, \nand India, will be waving to us as they fly by the space station on \ntheir way to the Moon and other planets if we are not careful. We \ncannot cede our leadership in space, and we must have a viable human \nspace exploration program.\n  As we are losing global market shares in most industries, we are \nstill the world leader in human spaceflight. I will not support a NASA \nthat squanders that lead, and I hope the Senate will not. Simply put, \nif that were to happen, I would not support a visionless NASA, and I do \nnot believe the Congress would.\n  In conclusion, I thank again Senator Mikulski, the chairwoman of this \ncommittee, for her leadership on this bill. We have worked together on \nmany issues throughout our years, both serving together in the House \nand the Senate, and this bill reflects our strong relationship. I ask \nmy colleagues--as she will--to support this bill and to urge its swift \npassage this week.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 2847, the Departments of Commerce \nand Justice, and Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 2010.\n  The bill, as reported with an amendment by the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations, provides $64.9 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2010, which will result in new outlays of \n$44.2 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken \ninto account, nonemergency discretionary outlays for the bill will \ntotal $71.2 billion.\n  The bill includes $126 million in budget authority designated as \nbeing for overseas deployments and other activities for national \nsecurity programs at the Department of Justice. Pursuant to section \n401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the 2010 budget resolution, an adjustment \nto the 2010 discretionary spending limits and the Appropriations \nCommittee's 302(a) allocation has been made for this amount in budget \nauthority and for the outlays flowing therefrom.\n  The Senate-reported bill matches its Section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and for outlays.\n  The bill is not subject to any budget points of order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nH.R. 2847, DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE AND JUSTICE, AND SCIENCE, AND RELATED\n                    AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-reported bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     General\n                                          Defense    purpose     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................      4,589     60,337     64,926\n    Outlays............................      4,690     66,515     71,205\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........     64,926\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........     71,205\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................      4,603     59,810     64,413\n    Outlays............................      4,701     65,960     70,661\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................      4,608     60,004     64,612\n    Outlays............................      4,705     66,477     71,182\n \n                    SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................          0          0          0\n    Outlays............................          0          0          0\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................        -14        527        513\n    Outlays............................        -11        555        544\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................        -19        333        314\n    Outlays............................        -15         38        23\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Table does not include 2010 outlays stemming from emergency budget\n  authority provided in the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L.\n  111-32).\nThe Senate bill includes $126 M in budget authority designated as being\n  for overseas deployments and other activities at the Department of\n  Justice.\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10105-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          HONORING NEAL BOORTZ\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \nconstituent from my home State of Georgia who is familiar to many of my \ncolleagues, and that is radio talk show host Neal Boortz.\n  Next month, in November, after 40 years of airing his unique and \noften colorful opinions, skewering lawmakers and pending best-selling \nbooks, Neal Boortz will be inducted into the National Radio Hall of \nFame.\n  Neal has been an Atlanta institution since his first foray into talk \nradio in 1969 on WRNG Radio. Since 1993, he has been holding forth on \nthe airways of WSB-AM 750, a member of the Cox Broadcasting Group. His \nratings show that he strikes a chord with listeners. For 47 straight \nratings periods, his show has finished in first place.\n  He has also struck a chord with Americans across the country, \ncounting among the audience for his nationally syndicated show \nlisteners from Maine to California.\n  Neal is a confirmed libertarian, dishing out his brand of, as he \ncalls it, ``the painful truth'' to Republicans and Democrats alike. And \nI should know; he frequently dishes it out to me, too.\n  But Neal is more than a radio talker. In his life, he has been a \nmilitary brat, whose dad was a marine pilot, an attorney, a department \nstore clerk, an insurance salesman, a carpet buyer, a postal worker, a \ngubernatorial speechwriter, as well as a motel bookkeeper.\n  These experiences form more than an eclectic background. It is the \nfoundation that gives Neal the ability to connect with a wide variety \nof listeners from all walks of life, and to voice what is on their \nminds. As Neal puts it: ``Somebody's got to say it.''\n  His Hall of Fame honor is the latest in a string of national \nsuccesses, including writing the best-selling books, ``The Fair Tax--\nThe Truth'' and ``Somebody's Gotta Say It,'' both of which are New York \nTimes bestsellers.\n  I am pleased to have joined Neal over the years in his fair-tax \nefforts.\n  When he is not holding forth on the issues of the day or speaking to \ngroups, Neal can be found in the skies or on a golf course. He is an \navid pilot and, I might add, a very safe pilot, having had some \nexperiences with Neal. Neal has been a very good friend of mine for \nmany years.\n  Like most of us, he married way over his head. His lovely wife Donna \nis his rock.\n  Neal's selection to the National Radio Hall of Fame is overdue, and I \nam very happy that this honor has now come to him. With his induction \ninto the National Radio Hall of Fame, Neal joins luminaries such as Bob \nHope, Paul Harvey, and Dick Clark. This honor is well deserved.\n  Congratulations, Neal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley.)

Mr. President, I recently heard from the friends and \nfamily of a young boy in Illinois named Jasper Duinstra who was \ndiagnosed earlier this year with late infantile neuronal ceroid \nlipofuscinosis, often referred to as Batten disease.\n  Batten disease is a rare and devastating childhood disease, affecting \nbetween 2 and 4 of every 100,000 live births in the United States. Due \nto an enzyme deficiency, waste accumulates in the child's brain, \ncausing cells to become dysfunctional and eventually die. This results \nin seizures, mental impairment and progressive loss of sight and motor \nskills. Sadly, there are no known treatments to halt or reverse the \nsymptoms of Batten disease and the disease is fatal.\n  The physical, emotional, and financial toll of this disease is \ndevastating. But Jaspers family and friends have rallied around him to \ncreate a sense of hope and have motivated many people in their \ncommunity to team together in pursuit of a cure for this disease. There \nis a sense of urgency behind the need to increase funding for Batten \nand\n\n[[Page S10106]]\n\nother rare childhood disorders. The urgency grows everyday when mothers \nand fathers watch their childrens health rapidly deteriorate.\n  Jasper Duinstras friends and family have formed a nonprofit \norganization called Jasper Against Batten, and children from 20 \nelementary schools have mobilized one of the largest kids helping kids \ninitiatives on behalf of this group. The money these students are \nraising will go toward research for a treatment and maybe one day, a \ncure.\n  Jasper Duinstra is just one of the thousands of children who need our \nsupport in the fight against Batten disease and other fatal orphan \ndiseases. In addition to private efforts to raise money through groups \nlike Jasper Against Batten, the National Institutes of Health is \nfunding research in Batten disease and other rare diseases.\n  While the number of Americans affected by any particular rare disease \nmay be very small, over 6,000 rare diseases have been identified. Taken \ntogether, these diseases affect about 25 million Americans. The burden \nof these diseases is great, not only because of the number of people \naffected but because too often there are few or no treatments available \nfor people suffering from them.\n  The Orphan Drug Act provides some incentives for drug companies to \ndevelop drugs for rare diseases. This has been a successful effort, and \nmore than 200 drugs and biological products for rare diseases have been \nbrought to the U.S. market. However, despite the success in finding \ntreatments for some rare diseases, others such as Batten disease have \nseen relatively little progress over the last several decades. Today, \nthere are promising experimental treatments, but they need to find \ntheir way more quickly to these children who are rapidly deteriorating.\n  In addition to searching for new and more readily available \ntreatments, some scientists are also searching for ways to use existing \ndrugs to treat rare diseases that have few options for treatment. A \nChicago-based research foundation called Partnership for Cures has \nteamed with Jasper Against Batten and is now doing just that. In \npartnership with the National Institutes of Health, they are currently \nscreening thousands of drugs that have already been approved by the \nFood and Drug Administration to see whether there are beneficial side \neffects that could slow down the progression of rare orphan diseases, \nstarting with Batten.\n  I know Jasper's family is heartbroken, and I commend his family, \nfriends, and the Chicago community for responding to tragedy with \naction. With biomedical researchers, clinicians, and community \npartners, Jasper's family is leading the fight to find a cure for \nBatten disease and for quicker access to treatments for children with \nmany fatal orphan diseases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10106-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INSIDE THE GUN SHOW\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Violence Prevention Research Program at \nthe University of California, Davis, released an important report \nearlier this month detailing many of the potential dangers at gun \nshows. The report, ``Inside Gun Shows: What Goes on When Everybody \nThinks Nobody's Watching,'' was composed from an analysis of existing \nresearch as well as direct observation and photographic evidence. \nDuring a 3-year period, data was collected from 78 gun shows in 19 \nStates. The report provides a clear illustration of a largely \nunregulated gun market that is ``an important source of guns used in \ncriminal violence.''\n  Under the Federal Brady Act, before an individual can purchase a \nhandgun from a licensed dealer, they must pass a background check to \ninsure they are not legally prohibited from purchasing or possessing a \nfirearm. In 2008, 9.9 million background checks were conducted for \nfirearm purchases, 147,000 of which were rejected. The majority of \nthese denials were the consequence of a prior conviction or indictment. \nHowever, when an individual purchases a handgun from a private citizen, \nwho is not a licensed gun dealer, there are no requirements to ensure \nthat the purchaser is not in a prohibited category. Because private \nparty transactions account for approximately 40 percent of all gun \nsales, current Federal background check requirements have limited \naffect over the overall rates of gun-related violent crime.\n  Based on promoter listing, the report estimates that there were \nnearly 2,800 gun shows in the United States during 2007. Generally open \nto the public, they can vary in size from fewer than 100 display tables \nto a few thousand. Accounting for approximately one-third of sales at \nthese shows, unlicensed vendors often seek to exploit their unregulated \nstatus. At one show, a vender advertised with a sign that read ``No \nbackground checks required; we only need to know where you live and how \nold you are.''\n  The report details that while a wide range of guns can be found at \nmost gun shows, assault weapons, particularly civilian versions AR and \nAK rifles, are much more prominent than one might generally see at a \nlicensed gun store. Semiautomatic pistols that accept the same high-\ncapacity magazines and fire the same ammunition as AR and AK rifles are \nalso heavily present. Even .50 caliber rifles, notorious for their \nextraordinary destructive capabilities, are available from some private \nparties.\n  According to the report, there were more than 360,000 violent crimes \ninvolving guns, including an estimated 11,512 homicides, committed in \nthe United States in 2007 alone. While America accounts for less than 5 \npercent of the world's population, we account for somewhere between 35 \nto 50 percent of all firearms in civilian hands. Gun shows present an \nideal opportunity for gun traffickers to make unregulated purchases. I \nurge my colleagues to take up and pass sensible gun legislation that \nwill help prevent such acts and help protect the safety of our \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10106-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10106-S10107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I held a hearing last week of the \nSubcommittee on African Affairs to explore U.S. policy options toward \nZimbabwe's transition. The hearing confirmed that far too little \nprogress has been made in implementing the Global Political Agreement \nsigned last year and that abuses continue at an alarming rate. The \ntransition remains incomplete and far from irreversible. Yet at the \nsame time, the hearing made clear to me the great potential that this \ntransition holds and the great opportunity for the United States and \nthose who care about Zimbabwe to help advance real reform and recovery. \nWe need to seize this opportunity and look for ways that we can \nproactively engage and help strengthen the hands of reformers in \nZimbabwe's transitional government.\n  Just over a year ago, Zimbabwe was in the throes of intense violence \ncarried out by Robert Mugabe and his allies against the opposition \nMDC's members, supporters, and families. This was a deliberate campaign \nto hold on to power and subvert the will of the people expressed in the \nMarch 29 elections. Once considered a liberator of his people, Mugabe \nhad become one of the most despotic and brutal leaders of the day. And \nunder his watch, the Zimbabwean economy had gone from one of Africa's \nmost prosperous to one of Africa's most desperate. By the end of last \nyear, millions of Zimbabweans were at risk of starvation and official \nestimates put inflation at 231 million percent.\n  The situation today in Zimbabwe looks quite different, at least on \nthe surface. Last September, with South Africa's mediation, the parties \nsigned the Global Political Agreement and committed to form a \ntransitional government. Then, after 5 months of delays, MDC leader \nMorgan Tsvangirai was sworn in as Prime Minister and the MDC assumed \ncontrol of several key ministries. A year before, this would have been \ninconceivable for most Zimbabweans. Yet, it happened and has brought \nforth a sense of possibility that has not been there in years. That \noptimism has been furthered by the success of the new Minister of \nFinance from MDC, Tendai Biti, in stopping the economic decline and \ntaking initial steps to promote economic growth.\n  These changes are quite significant, though there is still a long way \nto go toward restoring the rule of law. Mugabe continues to refuse to \nimplement important aspects of the Global Political Agreement, for \nexample the appointment of new provincial governors and the replacement \nof the Reserve Bank Governor and Attorney\n\n[[Page S10107]]\n\nGeneral. He and his allies are doing everything they can to maintain \ntheir historic patronage system and power structures. Moreover, \nsecurity forces are largely still operating as instruments of Mugabe's \nZANU-PF party, condoning land takeovers and harassing MDC and civil \nsociety activists. According to Human Rights Watch, the police and army \ncontinue to use brutal force to control access to the diamond fields of \nMarange district in eastern Zimbabwe.\n  Until we see an end to these abuses and real, irreversible progress \non implementation of the Global Political Agreement, I see no reason \nfor the United States to repeal sanctions. All of us at the hearing I \nchaired seemed to be in agreement on that. The European Union has taken \nthe same position after a high-level delegation visited Harare last \nmonth. Together, we need to keep the spotlight and the pressure on \nthose who are obstructing implementation of the Global Political \nAgreement and continuing to perpetrate abuses. And if nothing changes, \nwe should look for ways to ramp up that pressure.\n  However, keeping the pressure on Mugabe and hardliners is not a \nsufficient strategy in and of itself to move Zimbabwe's transition \nforward. We also need to take steps--both symbolic and substantive--to \nengage with and empower reformers within the transitional government. I \nam glad that the United States is already providing support to the \nOffice of the Prime Minister, and we should look at ways we can provide \ntechnical assistance to other ministries that demonstrate a commitment \nto reform, especially the Ministry of Finance. In addition, shifting \nour humanitarian assistance in Zimbabwe to lay the groundwork for \nsocial and economic recovery can help advance the political transition. \nWe should also consider working with like-minded donors to develop a \nplan and dedicated resources for Zimbabwe's economic recovery that \ncould be leveraged for genuine democratic reform.\n  Mr. President, the reality is that the United States is already doing \nand spending a lot in Zimbabwe, but we need to better target our \ndiplomacy and our resources toward advancing this transition. Over the \nlast few years, our diplomats have been on the frontlines of speaking \nout against repression and pushing for democratic change in Zimbabwe. \nWith the formation of the transitional government, the playing field \nhas changed. But that does not mean we should retreat to the sidelines \nand stop trying to proactively advance our goals. We need to keep \nworking with all Zimbabweans who are committed to a peaceful, \ndemocratic future to push this transition forward. In the coming \nmonths, I look forward to working with the administration to do just \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10107-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ICBM FORCE\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 20th Air Force as \nthe U.S. Air Force celebrates the 50th anniversary of the first \nnuclear-tipped inter-continental ballistic missile on alert. I join my \ncolleague Senator Kent Conrad from North Dakota as cochair of the \nSenate ICBM Coalition to pay special tribute to a force that succeeds \ndaily in its mission of providing safety and security for our great \nNation.\n  My first contact with F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming as an \nICMB base was when I was in Boy Scouts. Our rocket troop visited an \nAtlas missile site near Cheyenne and we learned about the deterrent \neffect of this high technology. Even then, we knew this force was \nmagnificent.\n  From the first ICBM placed on alert in 1959 at Vandenberg Air Force \nBase in California, our Nation's force has grown and adapted the \ndelivery systems leading to today's force with three Missile Wings. \nToday's ICBM force has missile fields in Wyoming, North Dakota, \nMontana, Colorado, and Nebraska. The force partners with Hill Air Force \nBase in Utah and its command structure will soon transfer to Air Force \nGlobal Strike Command in Louisiana. We have a force whose direct \ndomestic impact spans across seven States.\n  America's dispersed and alert Minuteman III ICBM force is a critical \nelement of the nuclear triad and represents our country's most \nresponsive, stabilizing, and cost-effective strategic force. The \nstrategic nuclear forces that deterred Soviet aggression and kept the \nlimited conflicts of the Cold War era from escalating continue to play \na critical role in deterring aggression and dissuading new near-peer \ncompetitors.\n  The element that has unchanged in the last 50 years is the dedication \nof the men and women of the Air Force to safeguard and carry out this \nmission. This force of weapons and personnel has been deployed every \nhour of every day for the last 50 years. The hours on alert, being on \npatrol and maintaining and upgrading the missile systems are abundant.\n  The 20th Air Force is home to the most powerful force in our entire \nmilitary. The mission of safeguarding the Nation's ICBM force has been \nentrusted to the best military in existence. The mission has been \nsuccessful and will continue to be.\n  I know all Members of the Senate will join me in thanking the current \nand former members of the Air Force who have served in the missile \nfields over the last 50 years. I also thank my colleague, Senator \nConrad, for his work on behalf of on the coalition and recognizing this \nhistoric anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10107-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10107-S10108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DIANE WOLK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many of us have been touched by a family \nmember or friend who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. In fact, more \nthan 5.3 million people in the United States are living with \nAlzheimer's, which translates into a new case every 70 seconds. As our \nNation ages, more and more cases will develop each year and an \nestimated million new cases will be diagnosed annually by 2050. I am \nproud be a cosponsor of S. 1492, the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of \n2009 which helps fund Alzheimer's disease research, gives assistance to \ncaregivers, and increases public education about prevention of \nAlzheimer's.\n  It is not just the elderly who are diagnosed with Alzheimer's. My \ngood friend Diane Wolk of Castleton, VT, in her early fifties was \ndiagnosed about a year and a half ago with early onset Alzheimer's. \nInstead of hiding her diagnosis or giving up hope, Diane now travels \nthe State and the country sharing her experience with others. Through \npromoting education and early intervention, Diane helps patients and \ntheir family members recognize their symptoms and seek diagnosis and \ntreatment. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nstory from the Burlington Free Press about Diane's courage and \nperseverance in the face of an overwhelming diagnosis.\n  Marcelle and I are so proud of her, and of the inspiration she gives \nto Alzheimer's patients in Vermont and nationwide. She is a true hero.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Burlington FreePress.com]\n\n                        Lessons From Alzheimer's\n\n                           (By Sally Pollak)\n\n       Diane Wolk spent her adult life as an educator, a teacher \n     or principal in Vermont public schools. One day this summer, \n     Wolk said she had another lesson she'd like to share with \n     people--perhaps her most important.\n       Wolk's teaching moment came in a lounge at Fletcher Allen \n     Health Care. She was in Burlington with her husband, Dave \n     Wolk, to undergo an experimental treatment for Alzheimer's \n     disease, a degenerative brain disorder Wolk was diagnosed \n     with two years ago.\n       Diane Wolk wanted to tell people that in the face of \n     confusing symptoms and diagnosis with a ``scary'' illness, it \n     is both possible and important to approach the situation in \n     an honest, upbeat and life-affirming way.\n       ``You have to take the fear out of the diagnosis,'' Wolk, \n     58, said. ``It's not a death sentence. You can curl up and \n     die or you can do something. I'm always the teacher, and if I \n     can help someone else, I will.''\n       Wolk is hopeful that talking about her experience with \n     Alzheimer's, which she developed at an unusually early age, \n     might help others recognize symptoms, seek medical care, find \n     courage and summon an upbeat attitude.\n       ``I have a very easy life,'' she said in the hospital. ``I \n     have a wonderful husband. This is a little setback, but \n     things are good. Very few people get out of this life \n     unscathed. I try to stay active and upbeat. People deal with \n     all kinds of difficult situations, and this one--it's really \n     just bad luck.''\n       Wolk is married to Dave Wolk, 56, the president of \n     Castleton State College and\n\n[[Page S10108]]\n\n     former Vermont Commissioner of Education. They've been \n     married 18 years, a second marriage for both. They have four \n     children in their 20s, two sons and two daughters.\n       Diane Wolk, has a Ph.D. in educational leadership from the \n     University of Vermont, and a long and varied career in \n     Vermont education. She's taught students from elementary \n     school to graduate school, directed the student-teacher \n     program at Castleton State, and served as chairwoman of the \n     state Board of Education.\n       Wolk retired in 2006 from her job as principal of Northeast \n     Elementary School in Rutland City, bringing to a finish a \n     Vermont career that started in 1972. That year, she was hired \n     to teach first grade at Barstow Memorial School in \n     Chittenden, where she taught for 18 years.\n       Her last two years as principal in Rutland, Wolk found it \n     increasingly difficult to run the school, she said.\n       ``I was off my game,'' Wolk said. ``I was getting confused, \n     and I thought it was the stress of being principal. I was \n     forgetting things and repeating myself. I wasn't myself.''\n       Leaving her profession meant saying goodbye to a vital part \n     of her life, but it was an important step in her care, her \n     husband said.\n       ``She loved the kids and the teachers and the families. She \n     missed that part,'' Dave Wolk said. ``In terms of her well-\n     being, it was helpful to her. She recognized that \n     intuitively.''\n\n\n                        ``Tough thing to learn''\n\n       The problems Diane Wolk perceived at work--memory loss, \n     confusion, repeating herself, frustration--had been \n     noticeable to her family and close friends since early 2004, \n     her husband said. The family was concerned enough about the \n     symptoms that Diane Wolk went to her doctor to check it out.\n       She was ultimately diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in \n     2007 at the University of Vermont's Memory Center, where she \n     saw its founder, neurologist William Pendlebury.\n       ``It was a tough thing to learn,'' Wolk said. ``I think I'm \n     still absorbing it.''\n       She has come to understand that the best approach for her \n     is: ``OK, it's a new day. Let's see what we can do.''\n       This means Wolk--who considers herself a high-energy \n     person--is adjusting to a slower pace. She's learned to take \n     naps when she's tired. She tries not to ``bug'' her husband \n     too much. She says she sometimes feels like she's in a haze.\n       ``You get angry at yourself because there are these moment \n     where you know what you want to do and you can't,'' Wolk \n     said. ``And it just gets very frustrating and scary.''\n       ``I've always felt that I've been in tune with my body,'' \n     Wolk said. ``If I need to sleep, I sleep. If I need to be in \n     sunshine, I'll be in sunshine.''\n       David Wolk keeps track of her medicine, her meals, her \n     schedule and other aspects of family life. Their children are \n     a great support and visit home often, the Wolks said.\n       ``We've downsized our lives,'' Diane Wolk said. ``We pick \n     and choose when we want to stay in or go out. I have a great \n     group of friends, and socializing when you have Alzheimer's \n     is very, very important.''\n       Dave Wolk says he tries to minimize the stress in Diane's \n     life, not an easy endeavor for a college president and \n     primary caregiver of an Alzheimer's patient.\n       ``She's my No. 1 priority, and president of the college is \n     my No. 2 priority,'' he said.\n       His responsibilities include bringing Diane from their home \n     on the Castleton campus to Fletcher Allen Health Care every \n     six weeks for medical treatment.\n       She is enrolled in a clinical drug trial at UVM with \n     intravenous infusions every 13 weeks, brain scans and memory \n     tests.\n       The care provided by Pendlebury extends beyond his leading \n     the clinical study, the Wolks said. He is ``wise and \n     gentle,'' Dave Wolk said.\n       ``He's very calm, very wise and very uplifting,'' Diane \n     Wolk said. ``He doesn't let you get down. He gives you the \n     information you need and says here is what you can do with \n     it. He's salt of the earth.''\n       One conversation with Pendlebury was particularly important \n     and especially hard to confront, they said. Pendlebury \n     advised the Wolks to complete advance directive documents, to \n     put in writing their wishes about medical care and treatment \n     options while they are capable of making such decisions.\n       ``Nobody wants to realize their own death. Everybody thinks \n     you've got plenty of time,'' Diane Wolk said. ``But we had \n     those choices to make. Now everybody knows exactly what our \n     wishes are, and it ended up being very comforting.''\n\n\n                         ``Cherish the moment''\n\n       The Wolks make an effort to find comfort where they can. \n     This means hanging out with family and friends, taking a July \n     trip to Citi Field to see Paul McCartney, Diane Wolk's other \n     big crush, and practicing a certain acceptance of each day, \n     each moment.\n       ``I've been trying to embrace something akin to a Buddhist \n     philosophy,'' Dave Wolk said. ``I try not lament the past and \n     I try not to worry about the future. I'm trying to embrace \n     the moment, cherish the moment.''\n       Yet he is fully aware that Alzheimer's is, in his words, a \n     ``nasty, progressive disease that's full of doom and gloom.''\n       As he cares for his wife, and makes arrangements and \n     schedules to help ease her way through the day, Dave Wolk \n     remains in awe of her sunny nature.\n       ``If you approach Alzheimer's the way Diane Wolk approaches \n     it--in a very upbeat, positive manner--I believe it can \n     extend life. And extend the quality of life,'' he said.\n       Diane Wolk has suffered a decline in her short-term memory \n     over the past couple of months. She is confused about the day \n     and date, and sometimes can't remember what happened \n     yesterday or what's planned for tomorrow.\n       For Diane Wolk, the ``mystery of the brain'' makes \n     Alzheimer's a particularly frightening disease, she said. \n     When people are scared of something, they shy away from it. \n     They don't want to talk about it, she said.\n       ``If somebody is struggling with this disease and not \n     knowing where to go or what to do, there's a lot of help out \n     there,'' Wolk said in July at the hospital.\n       Dave Wolk remembers the first time he and Diane went to \n     Fletcher Allen for her IV treatment. She receives the \n     intravenous in the oncology unit, where patients go for \n     chemotherapy.\n       The Wolks were there for seven hours, and they watched \n     cancer patients come and go.\n       ``Diane kept saying how fortunate we are,'' Dave Wolk said. \n     ``She is such an amazing, inspirational person. I know of no \n     greater profile in courage.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10108-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 75th anniversary of the East Bay Regional Park District, \nEBRPD.\n  On November 4, 1934, during the height of the Great Depression, the \nresidents of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties voted to form the EBRPD \nby a stunning 71 percent. Voters approved this park project in order to \nprovide recreational opportunities and employment during the Great \nDepression. This year, we celebrate its 75th anniversary and marvel at \nthe visionary efforts that have made EBRPD the largest regional park \ndistrict in the Nation.\n  On June 4, 1936, EBRPD acquired its first parcel of land--2,162 acres \nsold to the district by the East Bay Municipal Utility District. This \nacreage came to host EBRPD's first three parks--Upper Wildcat Canyon, \nnow known as Tilden, Temescal, and Roundtop, now known as Sibley. \nToday, EBRPD manages 65 parks on over 98,000 acres, with 1,100 miles of \ntrails throughout Alameda and Contra Costa Counties.\n  The individual parks that comprise EBRPD vary greatly in size, \nfeature, and character. There are parks on the hillsides above the \ncities of Berkeley and Oakland, waterfront parks along the San \nFrancisco Bay, and a park that includes a turn-of-the-century farm in \nFremont. While all parks in the district allow visitors the opportunity \nto enjoy open spaces, some parks also have visitor attractions \nincluding access to swimming, boating, and camping. Located within the \nurban metropolises of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, EBRPD remains \na cherished source of wilderness and recreation for local residents. \nThrough wars and unrest, unprecedented population growth, and both \nchallenging and positive economic times, EBPRD's mission of preserving \nland for wildlife habitat, outdoor recreation, and nature education has \nstood the test of time.\n  For 75 years, the East Bay Regional Park District has offered a \nrecreational escape for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts and a glimpse of \nthe region's rich history. Its parks also offer a powerful reminder of \nthe beauty of nature and the importance of conservation efforts. I \ncommend the EBRPD staff and volunteers for maintaining the natural \nbeauty and historical significance of this impressive park district. \nWith their continued stewardship, future generations will have the \nopportunity to enjoy our State's unique history and natural environment \nfor many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10108-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10108-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10108-S10109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S10109]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10109-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 3:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1707.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe possession or use of cell phones and similar wireless devices by \nFederal prisoners; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nCell Phone Contraband Act of 2009. This bill would close a loophole \nthat currently exists in Federal law by prohibiting the possession of \ncell phones and other wireless devices by prisoners in Federal \nfacilities.\n  Currently, cell phones found in prisons are not specifically defined \nas contraband material. As a result, guards and inmates found smuggling \nor in possession of a cell phone in a Federal prison are rarely \npunished.\n  This bill would close this loophole by defining cell phones as \ncontraband material under Federal law. As a result, any person \nsmuggling or in possession of a cell phone could potentially serve up \nto a year in prison.\n  A cell phone should never be in the hands of a prisoner. The presence \nof these cell phones poses a grave safety concern for staff, inmates, \nand the public. We know that inmates use these phones to conduct \ncriminal business outside of prison walls, including directing gang \nhits, controlling drug trafficking operations and even conducting \ncredit card fraud. Corrections departments across the country are \nreporting a sharp increase in the number of cell phones being smuggled \ninto prison facilities.\n  In May, California Inspector General David Shaw released a report on \ninmate cell phone use in California state prisons. The report found \nthat cell phone seizures have increased tenfold in two years--from 261 \nin 2006 to 2,811 in 2008. According to the California Department of \nCorrections and Rehabilitation, cell phone and electronic communication \ndevice possession, ``is one of the most significant problems facing the \nDepartment today.''\n  So far this year, authorities have discovered over 4,000 cell phones \namong inmates in California prisons. There are presumably thousands \nmore that were not discovered. Smugglers receive hundreds of dollars \nfor each cell phone and more money if the cell phone contains a camera.\n  Staff members who smuggle cell phones for inmates often receive more \nin compensation for the contraband phones than they do from their \npaychecks. The California Inspector General's report on inmate cell \nphone use found that inmates pay $500 to $1,000 per cell phone and \nnoted that one corrupt correctional officer received approximately \n$150,000 in 1 year to smuggle cell phones to inmates.\n  The cell phone problem is not limited to California. Maryland, \nKansas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas \nare just some of the states that have reported serious incidents \ncoordinated by an inmate with a cell phone.\n  In Maryland, an inmate used a cell phone from jail to order the \nassassination of a witness testifying against him.\n  In Tennessee, a corrections officer was killed as a result of an \ninmate using a cell phone to plan an escape.\n  Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Dora Schriro told \nmy office, and I agree that cell phones in prison are ``a more serious \nthreat than drugs or other contraband.''\n  The problem in our Nation's Federal prisons is no better. In 2008, \nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons confiscated 1,519 phones from Federal \nprison camps and 255 cell phones from secure Federal institutions. I \nexpect that these numbers will continue to increase unless we take \nproactive steps to stop the problem.\n  In July, I became a cosponsor of the Safe Prisons Communications Act \nof 2009, authored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. This bill would \nenable state and Federal prisons to petition the Federal Communications \nCommission and request to operate a wireless jamming device to block \ninmates from using cell phones to conduct criminal business from inside \nprison walls. Before granting permission, the FCC would have to first \ndetermine whether the jammer would interfere with emergency or public \nsafety communications outside of the prison walls.\n  If enacted, the bill will provide another necessary tool in the \neffort to ensure that the growing problem of cell phones in prison does \nnot turn into an epidemic. It is my hope that this will serve as a \nstrong deterrent to those who would profit from smuggling cell phones \nand other wireless devices into our Federal prisons.\n  Our Federal prisons house some of the most dangerous criminals in our \nNation. Cell phones allow prisoners to traffic drugs and carry out \nmurders from within our prisons and that is unacceptable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1749\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 44\n\n       Whereas the War of 1812, often referred to as ``America's \n     Second War of Independence'', was a significant effort for \n     the United States in securing territorial boundaries and \n     limiting violence on the frontier, clarifying the border \n     between the United States and Canada, ensuring safety for \n     American mariners from attack in passage to Europe and other \n     shores around the world, and securing a lasting and \n     definitive independence from Great Britain;\n       Whereas the continental United States was invaded and \n     partly occupied, and public buildings in the Nation's capital \n     were burned, by a foreign power;\n       Whereas the major areas of military operations took place \n     along the Canadian-American border in the North, the Atlantic \n     Seaboard in the East, and the Gulf Coast in the South;\n       Whereas the infant United States Navy won small but \n     important victories with ships like the USS Constitution, or \n     ``Old Ironsides'', against the dominant world naval power of \n     the time, and American squadrons on Lake Erie and Lake \n     Champlain defeated British squadrons;\n       Whereas the War of 1812 was a proving ground for future \n     leaders of the United States, including Andrew Jackson, \n     William Henry Harrison, James Monroe, Winfield Scott, Zachary \n     Taylor, John Quincy Adams, Jacob Brown, and others;\n       Whereas the War of 1812 produced heroes and heroines that \n     entered into American legend, such as Dolley Madison, Jean \n     Lafitte, Davy Crockett, and others, including many whose \n     names have been lost to history or are buried in War \n     Department records;\n       Whereas Native American resistance to encroachment on their \n     lands was ennobled and personified by The Great Shawnee Chief \n     Tecumseh and others;\n       Whereas desperate battles and circumstances produced a \n     number of inspirational and patriotic sayings, including \n     ``Don't give up the ship'', ``Remember the Raisin'', and ``We \n     have met the enemy and they are ours'';\n       Whereas the bombardment of Fort McHenry inspired Francis \n     Scott Key to pen the words of what was to become the National \n     Anthem;\n       Whereas the War of 1812 left the people of the United \n     States with a new respect and reverence for their national \n     flag;\n       Whereas the iconic figure Uncle Sam made his first \n     appearance in the War of 1812;\n       Whereas on December 24, 1814, the peace treaty to end the \n     War of 1812 was officially signed in Ghent, Belgium;\n       Whereas the Treaty of Ghent declared the release of all \n     prisoners of war and returned land seized by both sides;\n       Whereas the Treaty of Ghent also formally restored \n     diplomatic relations between the United States and Great \n     Britain, resulting in a lasting peace that has endured to \n     this day;\n       Whereas the War of 1812 was significant in the formation of \n     Canada and the Canadian identity;\n       Whereas 2012 marks the bicentennial of the War of 1812; and\n       Whereas the War of 1812 was an important benchmark, not \n     only in forging the identity of this Nation, but also in the \n     emergence of the United States as a great power: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Postal Service should issue a postage \n     stamp commemorating the War of 1812; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by our colleagues \nSenators Voinovich, Landrieu, Kaufman, Brown, Stabenow, Snowe, and \nLeahy to introduce this concurrent resolution urging the United States \nPostal Service to issue a stamp commemorating the War of 1812. The War \nof 1812 was a pivotal war in our Nation's history. Often referred to as \n``America's Second War of Independence,'' it secured our lasting \nindependence from Great Britain, set our border with Canada, limited \nviolence on the frontier and ensured the safety of American mariners \naround the world.\n  My home State of Michigan witnessed many battles during the War, \nincluding one fought near current day Monroe, Michigan, at the River \nRaisin. The Battle of the River Raisin, also known as the River Raisin \nMassacre, proved to be one of the bloodiest battles of the war. \n``Remember the Raisin'' became a rallying cry for American soldiers.\n  Many such battles were fought throughout our young Nation; future \nleaders and presidents proved their mettle on the battlefield or at sea \nincluding Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, James Monroe, \nWinfield Scott, Zachary Taylor, John Quincy Adams, and others. \nLegendary\n\n[[Page S10114]]\n\nheroes whose names are still remembered today emerged from this \ntumultuous time in our history such as Dolley Madison, Jean Lafitte, \nand Davey Crockett.\n  It was during the bombardment of Fort McHenry in 1814 that Francis \nScott Key was inspired to pen the words to what became our national \nanthem, ``The Star Spangled Banner.'' It was also during the war that \npatriotic figure ``Uncle Sam'' made his first appearance. The \ninspiration for this figure was New York State businessman Samuel \nWilson. Mr. Wilson provided beef in barrels to the army which were \nlabeled U.S. for the U.S. These barrels were commonly said to come from \nUncle Sam, a reference which still today refers to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Considering the significance that the War of 1812 had on our young \nNation, it is fitting that the U.S. Postal Service issue a stamp \ncommemorating the bicentennial of this pivotal time in our history.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Levin for \nsubmitting this important resolution to commemorate the significance of \nthe War of 1812. ``America's Second War of Independence''--as it is \nsometimes called--was a critical turning point in forming the Nation we \nknow today. Battles took place throughout the country to define our \nborders and secure our independence. One of those engagements took \nplace in Lewes, DE.\n  Lewes sits at the mouth of the Delaware River--a critical gateway to \nPhiladelphia, Wilmington, and Trenton. In March of 1813, under the \ncommand of Commodore John Beresford, the British Royal Navy established \na blockade of the Delaware Bay and River. Beresford demanded that Lewes \nprovide his squadron with meat, vegetables, and other supplies. He \nwarned that, ``If you refuse to comply with this request, I shall be \nunder the necessity of destroying your town.''\n  The residents of Lewes stood their ground. America was at war, and \nLewes officials refused to help the British--even though the blockade \nwas significantly impairing trade in the region and driving up the cost \nof goods.\n  Lewes prepared for attack. The Delawareans knew they did not have the \nammunition to match the British ships, but they readied for battle as \nbest as they could. Led by the intrepid Colonel Samuel Davis, local \nmilitias were called in to build a basic fort and small watchtower to \nprotect the town. They blew out the lamps in the Cape Henlopen \nlighthouse and moved the buoys that marked the shoals in the bay, \nhoping to disorient enemy vessels during an assault.\n  On April 6, the British launched their attack. They fired hundreds of \ncannon balls at Lewes, yet they were unable to do heavy damage to the \ntown. This was partially because the creative tactics of the Delawarean \nmilitia disoriented the British, and none of their larger ships were \nable to get close to shore. The people of Lewes also retrieved many of \nthe cannons that landed in soft soil and fired them back at the \nBritish.\n  The engagement at Lewes also holds historical significance for the \nfirst-ever use of the Congreve rocket. The red glare of these rockets, \nwhen used during a similar attack on Fort McHenry in Baltimore, would \ninspire Francis Scott Key to write the ``Star Spangled Banner.''\n  After 22 hours of bombarding Lewes, Beresford's ships retreated on \nApril 7. Although short of supplies and trained soldiers, the people of \nLewes were able to repel and cause damage to the British vessels. There \nwas no loss of life in Lewes and a local poet summarized the attack \nwith the simple phrase: ``The commodore and his men, wounded a pig and \nkilled a hen.''\n  The defenders of Lewes were brave and resourceful, and while this \nsmall battle in Lewes may not have changed the course of the war, it \ndemonstrated to the British--and to the world--that Americans were \nunited and strong in defense of their country.\n  The War of 1812 was a significant turning point in our natural \ndevelopment. It solidified our independence and marked the emergence of \nour Nation as a great power. I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Levin's \nresolution to issue a stamp commemorating the War of 1812.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/05/senate-section/article/S10114-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2624.
