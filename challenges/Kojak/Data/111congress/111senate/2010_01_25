Mr. President, I wish to say a few words in favor of \nthe Conrad-Gregg amendment which will shortly be before us and in \nopposition to the Baucus amendment.\n  I have worked for some time to try to produce legislation that would \ncreate a commission which could be like a BRAC commission and deal with \nwhat I consider to be the most formidable problem facing this \ngovernment.\n  Every Wednesday during the summer and spring, I have a constituent \nbreakfast. One of the things I do at that breakfast is show what debt \nand deficit really means. One of the best ways--you learn this when you \ndo a budget, and I learned it when I was mayor of San Francisco and for \n9 years put together a budget--is to look at what is actually spent, \ntotal numbers. That gives you the real clue. It is called outlays, \nFederal outlays.\n  What have Federal outlays been? In 2009, 50 percent of everything the \nFederal Government paid out went to entitlements. What are \nentitlements? Medicare, Social Security, veterans' benefits--things \nthat cannot be controlled--if you are entitled to them, you get them. \nLook at interest on the debt, which is 5 percent. If you look at \ndiscretionary defense, it is 18 percent. And if you look at everything \nelse the Federal Government does that everybody talks about--education, \nagriculture, justice, the 22 agencies in Homeland Security--it is just \n16 percent of what is spent. If you add together the 50 percent and the \n5 percent of interest, we see 55 percent of everything the Federal \nGovernment spends this year cannot be controlled. We have to spend it. \nAll the rest that is discretionary is rather small in comparison. If we \nproject that out 10 years--and I must say that new numbers are coming \nout tomorrow, so this is the latest number I have--entitlements go up \nto 56 percent and interest on the debt to 14 percent; that is, 70 \npercent of everything that will be spent in the year 2019 if things are \nprojected forward cannot be controlled. Discretionary defense is 16 \npercent, and nondiscretionary--again, everything else--is 14 percent. \nIf you wanted to balance out, you could eliminate everything in \ndiscretionary spending and you could not solve the problem.\n  That is what is happening. Entitlements are expanding to an \ninordinate amount of what the Federal Government pays out every year. \nIt does not matter whether something is in the budget or not in the \nbudget; if you have to pay for it and spend it, it contributes to the \ndeficit and that translates into debt. It is a very major problem.\n  That is why I rise today in support of the amendment offered by \nSenators Conrad and Gregg to establish a bipartisan commission to \ntackle this issue and look at these programs--namely, Social Security \nand Medicare--and make some recommendations as to how they can be \nchanged, amended, melded to essentially be able to maintain themselves \nover time. We know both these programs are the third rail of American \npolitics. Past Congresses and past Presidents have failed to take the \nsteps necessary to ensure their long-term viability. Social Security \nwill start running out of money in 2037, and Medicare will start to run \nout of money before the end of this decade. In 7 years, in 2017, \nMedicare will begin to run out of money.\n  This is an opportunity to take a concept which has worked before--\nnamely, the Greenspan Commission, which in 1983 added years to Social \nSecurity solvency--and have a 1-year commission, which is the Conrad-\nGregg commission, to deal with this debt. It would be an opportunity to \nget our Nation's finances back on track. If we could have done it, we \nwould have done it. If we could have done it, why didn't we? Why year \nafter year do we refuse to face the issues? The Greenspan \nrecommendations, including a change to the trust fund revenue \nstructure, actually won bipartisan support. Those recommendations were \nadopted, and they were credited with saving Social Security at the \ntime.\n\n  More recently, the base realignment and closure process, known as \nBRAC, and the Homeland Security commission following 9/11 made \nrecommendations. Many of those recommendations were accepted. The BRAC \nCommission had a process which all of us sort of derided and did not \nlike, but it got the job done. They presented recommendations to the \nCongress; the Congress could vote them down. That decided the question. \nThat is what the Conrad-Gregg amendment would do.\n  We all see the gravity of what is happening. As we vote to increase \nthe debt limit for the ninth time in 8 years, we are not able to do \nanything about the biggest consumers of debt--entitlements--because \nthey are such valuable programs to people and no one wants them \ntouched.\n  This commission would be bipartisan. It would be composed of 18 \nmembers--10 Democrats, 8 Republicans; specifically, 16 Members of \nCongress split evenly between each party and 2 administration \nofficials. Their charge would be to come to grips with this situation \nand make a series of recommendations on an expedited procedure that \nwould come to the Congress, and we would either vote it up or vote it \ndown. Everything would be on the table. The scope of the commission is \nbroad enough to include all possibilities for improving our budgetary \noutlook. The commission would issue this report before the end of the \nyear. Mr. President, 14 of the 18 Members must approve the report \nbefore it could be presented to us, and Congress would be required to \nvote on the report, as I said, with expedited consideration before the \nend of this year. So for the first time, in a matter of months, we \nwould have before us some recommendations. How do we tweak Social \nSecurity to enable it to go past its doomsday? How do we handle \nMedicare to see that it is viable throughout the next three, four, five \ndecades? It does not circumvent congressional procedures, nor does it \nexclude elected officials from shaping the final report.\n  The Social Security trust fund runs out of money in 2037. If we do \nnot do anything, it is going to happen sooner. Today, 50 million people \ndepend on Social Security. By 2050, 82 million people--another 32 \nmillion people--will receive Social Security.\n  Most people do not realize that one-half of American workers today \nhave no retirement or pension benefit from their company. I did not \nknow this. One-half of all retiring workers have no retirement or \npension benefit from their company. Social Security is what they will \nhave. With the problems in the workplace today, with the increase in \nbankruptcies, we can be sure that Social Security is only going to \nbecome more important as the decades go on.\n  In 2007, Social Security alone kept 35 percent of older Americans out \nof poverty. That is how important it is. Thirty-five percent of our \nseniors would be living in poverty if it were not for Social Security. \nAnd for almost two-thirds of people, Social Security makes up more than \nhalf their income. So Social Security is really the breadbasket, it is \nthe opportunity for many seniors and pensioners and retirees to \ncontinue to live and stay out of poverty.\n  Medicare is in even worse shape. By 2017, the hospital insurance \ntrust fund will be depleted. In last year's Trustees report, insolvency \nwas projected in 2019. Medicare is unsustainable over time.\n\n  That is something that none of us wants to admit, none of us wants to \nface. The record is clear: None of us has faced it. None of us has done \nanything about it, and yet the time is ratcheted sooner and sooner.\n  So once the hospital trust fund is exhausted, it will be necessary to \nreduce the amount of benefits payable. What does that mean? That means \nafter 2017, only 81 percent of benefits will actually be paid. Think of \nthat. Is it all right to let that happen? Is it all right to do \nnothing? Is it all right to say: OK, we know that come 2017 only 81 \npercent of the benefit an individual should get will be paid, and it is \nbecause we are not willing to do anything about it? That is what we are \nsaying if we vote no on the Conrad-Gregg resolution.\n  Medicare Part B and Part D prescription drug coverage will \nincreasingly\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\noutpace beneficiary income over time. So funds won't be there to pay \nfor prescription drug benefits. That is the simple result. Without \nfinding an adequate way to fund these obligations, those funds will \nhave to be borrowed or will be nonexistent, and this further adds to \nthe debt we see coming down the pike. All of it adds together to the \nfinancial insolvency of both Social Security and Medicare.\n  That is why a commission is needed--because we haven't done what we \nshould have done. We haven't made the tweaks, the changes, the \nadjustments. We haven't looked at means testing. These programs were \nfounded on the belief that no matter how wealthy you are, you should \nget these benefits. My own view is that should change. They should be \nlooked at more as insurance programs. If you don't need them, if you \nare a millionaire, why should you have these benefits? If you need \nthem, if you are part of the half of America that has no pension or \nretirement benefit, if you earn under, let's say, $250,000 a year as a \nretiree, maybe you should still get them. But if you earn more than \n$250,000, with this picture facing us, maybe you should pay your own \nway.\n  These are some of the decisions that have got to be made, and we \ncan't keep putting them off because they are unpleasant, because the \nmore we put them off, the bigger the troubles get. That has been the \ncase in the 17 years I have been here. I have watched this, and it \nkeeps going up and up and up. So the problem is apparent, but it has \nbeen ignored. It has been shoveled under the rug. It has never been \naddressed, and that is why we need a commission.\n  I cosponsored a bill two Congresses ago with Senator Domenici and I \ncosponsored a bill this Congress with Senator Cornyn to create a Social \nSecurity-Medicare commission. Mine was not composed of Members of \nCongress, but there was opposition. People felt, well, if this body is \ngoing to have the ability to make a recommendation that may result in \nhaving to put more money into the system, either by increasing the \npayroll tax or any other way, then it ought to be the Members of the \nCongress or the Senate who make that recommendation. Senator Conrad and \nSenator Gregg took that as a kind of mandate and said: All right, we \nwill do that, and here is what we propose.\n  I am very glad the Senator from Florida is on the floor. We have \nworked as part of this group together, come to several meetings. I \nguess it would be fair to say there are about 16 or 17 of us who have \nworked together with Senator Conrad on the Democratic side on this, and \nwe do so because we recognize doing nothing doesn't save Medicare and \ndoing nothing doesn't save Social Security. But doing something may, so \nthat is why we need a commission. This will never get done if we follow \nregular order in the Congress. For 17 years, I have watched that \nregular order year in and year out, and nothing has happened. I \nremember Fritz Hollings standing right there on the floor talking about \nkeeping money from going out of the trust funds. As you know, now it is \nan accounting judgment. Everything goes into one fund, but there is \njust an accounting judgment. He advocated separating it out so it \ncouldn't be used to balance the budget. Right now the trust funds are \nused to balance the budget. They are not set aside for a special fund \nto see that Social Security remains secure. It is the good faith and \ncredit of the government that does that. Well, I say that isn't enough. \nWe have to face the consequences, bite the bullet. We have to find a \nway to see that our national credit card is fiscally responsible.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I know my time is up, but I want to indicate my very \nsincere support and my thanks to both Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg \nfor their work, for their leadership, and for their strong advocacy. \nThey have friends. We will support them. And I very much hope this body \nwill as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am speaking today in favor of \nthe Conrad-Gregg amendment, of which I am a cosponsor also.\n  While the Senator from California is here, I want to go back 27 years \nago to one of the times in which government came together and worked \nbest on a crisis. It was 1983. I had come to Congress a few years \nbefore, and we were suddenly at the point at which Social Security was \ngoing to run out of money within 6 months. Obviously, something had to \nbe done. The good news was there were two wily old Irishmen who were \nleading the government. One was in the White House--his name was \nReagan--and the other one was the Speaker of the House--and his name \nwas O'Neill. Those two were great examples. They could fight like cats \nand dogs during the day, but when they walked out the door, they were \npersonal friends. They had a personal relationship. When it came time \nto cutting a deal to get the performance of the government, they could \ndo it.\n  Realizing that Social Security was about to be in financial cardiac \narrest, they said: We are going to do this. They appointed a blue \nribbon panel, much like what we are talking about here in this Conrad-\nGregg amendment. The difference between then and now is that we had \nleaders of both parties who were committed to making it work. I am not \nsure what we are going to see out here on the landscape today, unless \nthe American people rise up and say: A pox on both your Houses. You \nguys better get together.\n  That is what we are trying to do with this bipartisan amendment. The \ngood news is that because of the deliberations of that panel and \nbecause those two Irishmen, President Reagan and Speaker O'Neill, said: \nWe are going to take this off the table at the next election as a club, \na bludgeon, to hit our opponents over the head with, that blue ribbon \npanel came forth, was presented to the Congress, passed overwhelmingly \nin the Congress, and it made Social Security solvent from 1983 well \ninto this century.\n  That is the kind of example we need here, of our coming together in a \nbipartisan way, with commonsense solutions. That is what I rise to talk \nabout today. I thank the Senator from California for being not only \nerudite but eloquent in her presentation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, there is a reason for this, and \nit is our Nation's budget is on a path toward crisis. We have to do \nsomething extraordinary, just as we did back in 1983. Over the last \ndecade, we have spent billions to wage two wars, but we still proceeded \nwith a tax cut for the wealthy and a prescription drug benefit that \ngave too much to the pharmaceutical industry as well as the health \ninsurance industry, and what happened was the debt doubled.\n  The Obama administration had to stem the bleeding, putting a \ntourniquet on the pending nationwide economic collapse, so it pumped \nmoney into the economy. That was primarily for infrastructure spending, \nteachers' salaries, targeted tax relief for small business, and \ntargeted tax relief for the middle class.\n  That same economic collapse did what one expects recessions, near \ndepressions to do: It lowered the tax receipts, and thus put us in an \neven tighter spot. So now we have to face the realities of this fiscal \nsituation. Due to the economic downturn, tax revenue, as a share of the \neconomy, is at its lowest point in 50 years. It is less than 15 percent \nof GDP, whereas spending is now above. It is at 26 percent of GDP. You \nknow when you take in less revenues but you spend more, that \ndifference, which we call the annual deficit, means you are headed for \ntrouble. The analysts are telling us that by 2019, the debt could be \n114 percent of the GDP.\n  We saw in the charts of the Senator from California how the interest \nrate in 2019 would balloon up to three-fourths of $1 trillion. The \nrising trend continues at an alarming rate even after 2019. Former Fed \nChairman Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       The challenge to contain this threat is more urgent than at \n     any time in our history. Our Nation has never before had to \n     confront so formidable a fiscal crisis as is now visible just \n     over the horizon.\n\n  This is not to mention this also affects our national security. Guess \nwho is the biggest holder of our foreign debt. It is China. What \nhappens if they suddenly want us to pay off all of those bonds they \nhold? Do you think China is\n\n[[Page S170]]\n\nan adversary? Well, if you don't, do you think they are an economic \nadversary? Do you think they would like to be a military adversary? Do \nyou realize what they are doing in space in order to become a world \npower?\n  I came to Congress a long time ago, and I have been talking about \nbalanced budgets, but now this problem is so massive it can't be \nsolved, as the Senator from California said, by regular order. We are \ngoing to have to take a good look at the whole picture. We need some \ncommonsense folks who will work together, who will respect each other--\ndid you hear what I said, respect each other--and who will recommend \nthe tough decisions that must be made in order to get this Nation's \nfiscal policy back on track.\n  I realize on the one side you have folks saying: Does that cut Social \nSecurity? Does that cut Medicare? Then on the other side you have folks \nwho say: Does that mean you worry about raising taxes? Those are \nlegitimate concerns. Every one of us, every family member in America \nhas to deal with these kinds of questions in their own family's budget. \nWhen we spend more than we bring in, we have to make choices. We have \nto make adjustments. It is the responsible thing to do.\n  It will not be easy. It will not be easy politically, especially with \npeople holding that club of the next election over their heads saying: \nI am going to beat you into the ground and beat you politically to \ndeath if you make these tough choices. But in the end I trust, because \nof the understanding of the American people of their government and \ntheir understanding of their own family budgets, they will trust a \nbipartisan group of lawmakers accountable to the American people who \nwill have examined the budget, hashed out their differences, and agreed \nto a plan that will make us solvent again.\n  Without drastic measures we risk saddling our children with debt that \ncan never be repaid and credit that cannot be restored. We have the \nopportunity right now to try to fix it. I urge our colleagues to \nsupport this amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I look forward to the President's State \nof the Union Address on Wednesday, as I know most Americans do. There \nis a lot of talk about how the President might reconnect with the \nAmerican people. The President himself said a couple of days ago, after \nMassachusetts elected a Republican Senator, that perhaps he had not \nbeen talking to the American people directly about core values. If I \nmay do this in a respectful way, I would like to make a suggestion \nabout what the President might say on Wednesday evening.\n  To reconnect with the American people, I suggest in his State of the \nUnion Address the President talk first about creating jobs; second, \nabout reining in the national debt; and make terrorism his third \nsubject. Then it would not hurt my feelings one bit if he stopped his \nspeech right there and focused his unswerving attention on jobs, debt \nand terrorism until he has them all headed in a better direction. After \nall, in my view, the President struggled in his first year not only \nbecause his agenda veered too far to the left but because he took too \nmany big bites out of too many apples and tried to swallow them all at \nonce.\n  Years ago, I learned that a Governor who throws himself into a single \nissue with everything he has for as along as it takes can usually wear \nout everybody else. I think that is true for Presidents, too. In 1952, \nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower said, ``I shall go to Korea.'' Then he \nfocused on that one problem, ended the conflict, and Americans thanked \nhim for it.\n  I hope President Obama would focus with Eisenhower-like intensity on \njobs. In the 1980s, I found the best way to do that was not to try to \nturn my State, Tennessee, upside-down all at once. We were then the \nthird poorest State in the Union. My goal was raising family incomes. I \ndidn't try to turn it upside-down all at once, but I went step by \nstep--sometimes learning as I went--amending banking laws, defending \nright-to-work, keeping debt and taxes low, recruiting Japanese industry \nand then the auto industry, building four-lane highways so the auto \nsuppliers could get to the auto plants, and finally a 10-step ``Better \nSchools'' plan which included centers and chairs of excellence for \nhigher education.\n  In my view, a step-by-step job strategy for the country should \ninclude tax cuts, less regulation, certainty so people can make their \nplans, free trade, a balanced labor climate, good educational \nopportunities, and clean but cheap energy. Unfortunately, the President \nhas too often proposed higher taxes, more regulation, uncertainty, \nprotectionism, expensive labor policy, higher college tuitions (as \nMedicare costs are passed on to States), a national energy tax, and new \ncosts for the businesses that we count on to create jobs.\n  As for debt, Democrats in Congress are trying this week to raise the \nnational debt limit by $1.9 trillion, an amount that is more than the \ntotal Federal budget in 1999. To be sure, President Obama inherited \nsome of this, but he has run up a $1.5 trillion debt in just one year \nand it took President Bush 8 years to accumulate a $2 trillion debt. \nThe solution for a boat sinking because it has a hole in it is not to \nput more holes in it.\n  Finally, the President deserves credit for his decisions on Iraq and \nAfghanistan but bringing terrorists from Guantanamo to Illinois, trying \nthe 9/11 mastermind in New York City, and failing to interrogate the \nChristmas Eve ``underwear bomber'' in Detroit shows dangerous confusion \nabout how to deal with terrorists.\n  When I became Governor, Ned McWherter, then the Democratic house \nspeaker, said, ``I want to help because if the Governor succeeds the \nState succeeds.'' In the same way, I want President Obama to succeed. \nThe best way for him to do that, I respectfully suggest, is to declare \nan end to the era of the 2,700-page bills and to work with both \npolitical parties, step by step, on jobs, debt, and terrorism to help \nWashington re-earn the trust of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S170-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S170-S173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONRAD-GREGG AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, tomorrow we are going to vote on the \nquestion of whether we establish a bipartisan debt commission, a \ncommission empowered to come up with a plan, a plan if 14 of the 18 \nMembers would agree, would come to the Senate for a vote.\n  This story ran recently in Newsweek. This was actually the cover of \nNewsweek:\n\n       How Great Powers Fall; Steep Debt, Slow Growth, and High \n     Spending Kill Empires--And America Could Be Next.\n\n  Inside, the story reported:\n\n       This is how empires decline. It begins with a debt \n     explosion. It ends with an inexorable reduction in the \n     resources available for the Army, Navy and Air Force. . . . \n     If the United States doesn't come up soon with a credible \n     plan to restore the federal budget to balance over the next \n     five to 10 years, the danger is very real that a debt crisis \n     could lead to a major weakening of American power.\n\n  It is not hard to see how that could happen. Since 2000, the debt has \nexploded. In the previous administration the debt doubled. It has \nincreased again with the economic downturn, and we are now on a course \nto have a gross debt that will be 114 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct of the United States.\n  That is the short term. We can handle a debt of 114 percent of the \ngross domestic product. We have done it before. We did it after World \nWar II. Japan has a debt right now of 189 percent of their gross \ndomestic product.\n  The real challenge confronting America is that, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, we are on course to have a debt that will \nreach 400 percent of our gross domestic product over the next 50 years. \nNobody believes that is a sustainable situation--not the head of the \nCongressional Budget Office, not the head of the Office of Management \nand Budget, not the former head of the General Accounting Office, not \nthe head of the Federal Reserve, not the Secretary of Treasury--all of \nthem have said a debt of that magnitude poses a systemic threat to the \neconomic security of the United States.\n\n[[Page S171]]\n\n  The National Journal, in a recent article, on November 7, 2009, \nreported this:\n\n       Simply put, even alarmists may be underestimating the size \n     of the (debt) problem, how quickly it will become unbearable, \n     and how poorly prepared our political system is to deal with \n     it.\n\n  That is not just the view of the National Journal or the view of \nNewsweek magazine in their cover story piece. This is the considered \njudgment of some of the budget experts in the country from both the \nRepublican and Democratic side of the aisle.\n  Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve Chairman, said:\n\n       The recommendation of Senators Conrad and Gregg for a \n     bipartisan fiscal task force is an excellent idea. . . . I \n     hope that you succeed.\n\n  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was the key economic adviser to Senator \nMcCain in the last election said:\n\n       I am a reluctant convert. I have always felt that this is \n     Congress' job, and, quite frankly, it ought to just do it. \n     And that attitude has earned me no friends and has gotten us \n     no action. So I've come around to the point where I'm in \n     favor of something that is a special legislative procedure to \n     get this legislation in front of Congress and passed.\n\n  Mr. Geithner, the current Secretary of Treasury, said this before the \nSenate Budget Committee on February 11 of last year:\n\n       . . . [I]t is going to require a different approach if \n     we're going to solve the [long-term fiscal imbalance]. . . . \n     It's going to require a fundamental change in approach, \n     because I don't see realistically how we're going to get \n     there through the existing mechanisms.\n\n  Mr. Walker, the former head of the General Accounting Office, said:\n\n       I think the regular order is dysfunctional as it relates to \n     these types of issues. And it's, quite frankly, \n     understandable, because you're talking about putting together \n     a package that crosses many different jurisdictions. . . . \n     And the idea that that would end up emerging from the regular \n     order I think is just totally unrealistic.\n\n  Leon Panetta, former chairman of the House Budget Committee, former \nChief of Staff of President Clinton, said:\n\n       It'll never happen. The committees of jurisdiction will \n     never take on the kind of challenges that are involved in \n     this kind of effort. . . . If you just leave them under their \n     own jurisdictions, that will never happen.\n\n  Senator Gregg, the ranking Republican on the committee, and I came to \nthe same conclusion. Two years ago we started an effort to come up with \na process that could assure a vote on a series of recommendations to \nmeet the debt threat. All task force members are directly accountable \nto the American people. They are all elected Members of the Congress \nor, in the case of the Secretary of the Treasury, the representative of \nthe administration. There are 18 Members: 10 Democrats--2 from the \nadministration--and 8 Republicans. They are all currently serving \nMembers of Congress selected by Democratic and Republican leaders and \nthe Treasury Secretary and one other administration official who, I \nassume, would be the head of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  The bipartisan fiscal task force has broad coverage. Everything is on \nthe table--spending and revenues. I hear some on the left saying \nspending should not be considered and some on the right saying revenues \nshould not be considered. Both have to be considered. I do not know \nwhat could be more clear.\n  The green line shows revenues as a share of GDP since 1950. That is \nover the last 60 years. Revenue, the last 2 years, is the lowest it has \nbeen in 60 years. Let me repeat that: Revenue as a share of the gross \ndomestic product is the lowest it has been in 60 years--a precipitous \ndecline in revenue.\n  Look at expenditures. Expenditures are the highest they have been as \na share of the gross domestic product in 60 years.\n  Whoever says: ``Well, you did not include revenue'' or ``you did not \ninclude spending,'' well, guess what, if you did not deal with spending \nand did not deal with revenue, you did not deal with the problem. Let's \nget serious. Let's get honest with the American people.\n  The current status of Social Security and Medicare trust funds are as \nfollows: Social Security will be permanently cash negative in 2016. It \nis already cash negative today. Let me repeat that. Social Security is \ncash negative today. It will be permanently cash negative in 2016. That \nis 6 years away. It will be completely insolvent in 2037.\n  Medicare went cash negative in 2008. It will be insolvent, according \nto the trustees, in 8 years. Anybody who says we do not have to do \nanything, we can just keep on doing what we are doing, has their head \nin the sand. Social Security and Medicare are both cash negative today. \nThey are both headed for insolvency. Those who say we do not have to do \nanything, they are guaranteeing a disaster. Some say: Well, the health \ncare reform bill shows we can do this through the regular order. No, \nthat is not what it showed. It shows the opposite. It shows we will not \ndo this through the regular order because here is the long-term debt \ntrajectory we are on. While the bill that passed the Senate will help a \nlittle bit, it is only a little bit. It does not fundamentally change \nthe trajectory we are on. That is the reality. That is the fact.\n  A bipartisan fiscal task force promises an expedited process, with \nrecommendations to be submitted after the 2010 election, with fast-\ntrack consideration in the Senate and the House, no amendments, with a \nfinal vote before the 111th Congress adjourns and a requirement, before \nyou ever get to that point, of a supermajority necessary of the 18 \nmembers to even report a plan.\n  It would require 14 of the 18 members to even report a plan. If the \nplan is reported, then it takes 60 votes in the Senate, it takes 60 \npercent of the House of Representatives, and the President reserves and \npreserves his ability to veto. So anybody who says this is somehow \nunconstitutional, it is fully constitutional. Anybody who says we are \nfarming out the responsibility to come up with a plan, that is what we \nalways do. We always have committees come up with plans that then come \nto a vote of the Congress.\n  If you look at fiscal crises, such as the one we are in today and the \none that is rapidly approaching that will be far more serious than the \none we are in today, we have always had a special process, whether it \nwas Andrews Air Force Base in the 1990s or whether it was the Greenspan \nCommission in the 1980s. We have repeatedly, when we faced a fiscal \ncrisis, resorted to a special procedure.\n  The Bipartisan Fiscal Task Force, as I have indicated, requires a \nbipartisan outcome: 14 of the 18 task force members must agree to the \nrecommendations. The final passage requires supermajorities in both the \nSenate and the House.\n  This weekend, the President endorsed this, the plan we will vote on \ntomorrow. This weekend, the President released this statement.\n\n       The serious fiscal situation that our country faces \n     reflects not only the severe economic downturn we inherited, \n     but also years of failing to pay for new policies, including \n     a new entitlement program and large tax cuts that most \n     benefited the well-off and well-connected. The result was \n     that the surpluses projected at the beginning of the last \n     administration were transformed into trillions of dollars in \n     deficits that threaten future job creation and economic \n     growth.\n       These deficits did not happen overnight and they won't be \n     solved overnight. We not only need to change how we pay for \n     policies, but we also need to change how Washington works. \n     The only way to solve our long-term fiscal challenge is to \n     solve it together, Democrats and Republicans.\n       That's why I [the President] strongly support legislation \n     currently under consideration to create a bipartisan, fiscal \n     commission to come up with a set of solutions to tackle our \n     nation's fiscal challenges, and call on Senators from both \n     parties to vote for the creation of a statutory, bipartisan \n     fiscal commission.\n       With tough choices made together, a commitment to pay for \n     what we spend, and responsible stewardship of our economy, we \n     will be able to lay the foundation for sustainable job \n     creation and economic growth while restoring fiscal \n     sustainability to our nation.\n\n  The President got it right. He is also representing the views of the \nAmerican people. When asked: Would you favor or oppose creating a \nbipartisan commission as a way of reviewing and addressing our Federal \nbudget problems, 70 percent of the American people said they would. \nTwenty-five percent were in opposition. Five percent were not certain.\n  This is a poll taken by Peter D. Hart Research, a well-known \npollster, a well-regarded pollster, taken November 16 to November 18 of \n2009. There is no doubt in my mind that if this poll were taken today, \nthese numbers would be even stronger with respect to the need for a \nbipartisan fiscal commission.\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\n  Let me close, in the time remaining to me, to thank my colleague, \nSenator Gregg, the ranking Republican on the committee. We have a group \nof cosponsors for this bill, about 30 in number, about equally divided \nbetween Republicans and Democrats.\n  Senator Gregg and I have not always agreed on every fiscal issue, and \nwe have debated those issues sometimes in a way that is animated, full \nof energy. But this is one place we are in absolute agreement. I have \nserved here now 23 years. I am absolutely persuaded that if we do not \nadopt a special procedure such as the one we have proposed, the chances \nof facing up to this debt threat in a timely way is remote.\n  This is our chance. Tomorrow will be a defining vote. Are we going to \ntake on this question of the looming debt, the threat it imposes to the \neconomic security of the country? Let me be quick to say, that does not \nmean I believe we should raise taxes or cut spending in the midst of an \neconomic downturn. That would be unwise. But it would also be unwise, \nonce recovery has presented itself and is firmly rooted, for us to fail \nto face up to the greatest economic threat this country faces, a \nrunaway debt, one increasingly financed from abroad.\n  Last year, a substantial portion of our new debt was financed by \nforeign entities: China, Japan, the oil-exporting nations. They have \ntold us, publicly and privately, we are on an unsustainable course and \nthey will not long continue to extend trillions of dollars of credit to \nus, absent our taking action. The warning is clear. The time is now. I \nurge my colleagues to support our effort tomorrow.\n  I wish to, again, thank my colleague, Senator Gregg, the ranking \nRepublican on the committee, for his leadership in this matter. He has \nspent 2 years on this effort. We could not have a better partner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, let me congratulate the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. First, he was a ``voice in the wilderness,'' as we say in \nNew Hampshire. That is the motto of one of our colleges. Then he moved \nfrom being in the wilderness to being on the side of the wilderness, \nand people were starting to listen. Now he has become the clarion call.\n  The simple fact is, his statement, which summarized it all, presents \nthe problem as it is. The debt is the threat. He, in his statement he \njust made, outlined the implications of the debt. You cannot deny it. \nIt is there. It is coming. It exists. It is being added to. The numbers \nsimply cannot be ignored any longer. We are, as a nation, on a path \nwhere, if we continue to spend and run deficits as we have and as are \nprojected, our Nation will not be able to maintain its standard of \nliving. We will not be able to finance our debt. The value of our \ncurrency will come under acute threat.\n  The burden of taxes to pay for the cost of government will overwhelm \nthe ability of people to live productive lifestyles. Inevitably--and \nthis is not hyperbole, unfortunately--inevitably, we as a nation will \ngo into insolvency of some form. Either we will have to inflate our \neconomy radically or we will have to bear a burden that simply stifles \nthe capacity of our children to have a high quality of life because of \nthe cost of the government and the cost of the debt.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has cited the figures. We go to a \npublic debt that is 100 percent of gross national product within the \nnext budget window cycle. We crossed the 60-percent threshold, which is \nthe tipping point, where, similar to a dog, we have trouble catching \nour tail because we have so much debt on the books, potentially, this \nyear but certainly by next year.\n  These numbers are staggering. They are hard to understand--trillions \nand trillions of dollars in debt. As the Senator from North Dakota has \nalso pointed out, the debt is owned not by Americans but by foreign \nnations. Today, China owns almost $1 trillion of our debt. Oil-\nexporting nations own, as a group, almost $1 trillion of our debt. We \nare shipping overseas the dollars which we should be reinvesting in the \nUnited States to create a more productive and vibrant economy and a \nbetter lifestyle for our Nation.\n  By the year 2017 or 2018, the interest on the debt alone will exceed \nevery other account in the Federal Government. It will be approximately \n$900 billion a year, almost $1 trillion a year, more than what we spend \non national defense, massively more than what we spend on education, on \nbuilding roads, on doing the things a government is supposed to do.\n  Where does that interest go? It does not stay in the United States to \nbenefit America and make us a stronger nation. It is going to go to \ncountries such as China--not that I have anything against China--\ncountries that have bought our debt.\n  So we are on an intolerable path, a path of unsustainability, a path \nwhich leads us down the road to a nation which is less prosperous and \nhas a lower standard of living than what we received from our parents. \nThat is simply not acceptable. So how do we address this? Well, for \nyears we have said: Let's do it by regular order. Let's come up with \nideas and run them through the committee process, run them up the \npolitical flagpole, let the community of interest that wants to speak \nout on issues speak out on it. Then we will evolve solutions that work \non these very difficult problems.\n  Most of the issue, by the way, is driven by the cost of the \nentitlement programs and, for years, nothing has happened. Nothing has \nhappened. There is a reason for that. Our political system is \ninherently prejudiced against doing substantive activity on issues as \nbig as entitlement reform. We have a system where, whenever anybody \nputs a policy on the table, a substantive, thoughtful policy or even a \npolicy that is not thoughtful, as a presentation of the way you should \naddress the cost and the burden of our government, it is immediately \nattacked either from the left or from the right.\n  They almost never even make it to the starting line. We have instance \nafter instance of seeing this. So Senator Conrad and I decided you \ncannot do this by putting policy on the table. There are too many \ninterest groups in this town that make their living off poisoning the \nwill either from the right or the left because that is how they \ngenerate their income. They send out these letters to their constituent \ngroups. If it is a Social Security group, they send it out in a Social \nSecurity-type envelope and say: if you do not send this money soon, \ntomorrow, somebody is going to ruin Social Security for you or, if they \nare a tax group, they send out the same type of letter that looks \nsimilar to an IRS form letter: If you do not send this money tomorrow, \nyour taxes are going to go up radically.\n  So as a very practical matter, nothing ever gets past the starting \nline around here. Regular order does not, has not, and will not work on \nthose issues.\n  We decided, rather than using that process, which we know leads \nnowhere, let's set up a process that does lead somewhere. We came up \nwith what is basically, to thumbnail it, a procedure which is totally \nand absolutely bipartisan and fair, where neither side may game the \nother, which leads to a policy position, which then leads to a vote on \nthat policy. That is the task force we have. The key components are \nthat it is totally and absolutely bipartisan. Neither side can game the \nother. It takes 14 of 18 people to report out the proposals. They don't \nhave to be proposals for everything, but the proposals that are agreed \nto have to have a supermajority; that is, 78 percent of the people on \nthis task force have to vote for it. Since the membership of this task \nforce is appointed by the leadership of the two parties, a majority of \nthe party membership of both parties on this task force has to vote for \nthe final proposal.\n  One presumes that whoever goes on this task force, if chosen by the \nleaders of their party in the Senate, whether Senator Reid or Senator \nMcConnell, or leaders of the party in the House, Ms. Pelosi or Mr. \nBoehner, is going to reflect fairly aggressively the viewpoints and the \nphilosophies of the different parts. It will be a bipartisan report or \nit won't be a report at all. Then it comes to the Congress, and it has \nto be voted up or down on a supermajority vote. Once again, it \nbasically moots the ability to game it. One side can't game the other. \nThe proposal must be bipartisan and fair.\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\n  Why did we choose that path? Because the American people have shown \nvery definitively that they will not accept proposals in these very big \nareas, especially Social Security and Medicare, that are not reached on \na bipartisan agreement. They want fairness. They want to make sure \nnobody is gaming anybody around here. That is why we have these \nsupermajorities. Then, it is on fast track, so the proposal has to be \nvoted up or down and it cannot be amended. Why is that? Because, as we \nall know around here, amendments are for hiding in the corners. \nAmendments are offered not for the purposes of accomplishing anything \nbut for the purposes of giving political cover. In fact, we are going \nto see a couple of amendments just like that on this issue, one from \nour side and one from the other side, so that people will have \npolitical cover if they vote against this task force approach.\n  The simple fact is, if you really want to do something here, you have \nto have an up-or-down vote on a fast track, and everything has to be on \nthe table, all entitlement and tax reform issues. Why is that? Because \nthis has to be bipartisan. It is that simple. I would be happy to have \na commission that focused only on spending reductions or adjustments to \nMedicaid and Medicare and Social Security programs, but there isn't \nanybody on that side of the aisle who will agree to that. They would be \nhappy to have a proposal that addresses tax reform, such as has been \nproposed on occasion by the Senator from North Dakota, which is to try \nto collect the $300 billion of taxes owed and not paid every year. \nNobody on this side is going to accept that. Everything has to be on \nthe table. The key to protecting both sides' interests in this \nexercise, so that Social Security isn't treated inappropriately and so \nthe tax increases aren't done inappropriately, if there are tax \nincreases, is to make sure that the product has to be bipartisan and it \nhas to be reported on supermajorities, which this does. That issue is \naddressed.\n  We are here again. I don't know that we will get the 60 votes needed \nto pass this. It has obviously been attacked from the right and from \nthe left, which usually means you are on a pretty good course. \nRegrettably, the President put out his Executive order proposal which I \nthink undermined it, but then he has come to support it. But it may be \na little late to the dinner here. On our side of the aisle, some of our \nmajor interest groups have come out against it.\n  I know this much: We are getting to the point where we don't have too \nmany alternatives around here. If we don't do something like this \nfairly soon, I genuinely believe that somewhere between 5 to 10 years \nfrom now, probably between 7 and 10 years, we as a nation will find it \nvery hard to sell our debt. Countries will look at us and say: You \ncannot sustain your situation. You have run up a debt that you cannot \npay back, and I am not going to lend you money or, if they do, it will \nbe at a very high price. At that point, the options for us will be very \nfew. They will all be horrific options for our children because they \nwill all lead to a lower standard of living for us as a nation. They \nwill all make our country less competitive in the world economically, \ncompetition which is very aggressive and totally global now.\n  We can wait. We can punt this thing one more time, as we have done \nyear-in and year-out. We can say there is not a problem out there or if \nthere is a problem, if you don't address it the way we want to on our \nside or the way you want to on your side, then we won't vote for it. In \nthe end, we will not have been responsible as people who have been \ngiven the mantle of government. We will not be fulfilling our \nresponsibility to govern. Instead, the postwar baby-boom generation \nwill be the first generation in history to pass on to our children a \ncountry with less prosperity than we received from our parents. That \nwill not be a very good testament to our responsibility as people in \ncharge of governance.\n  This is a chance. This is the closest we have ever gotten to this \nopportunity. I don't believe we will get this close again at any time \nin the future. We can either take it or we can allow it to pass. I have \noften said that Congresses are good at handling the next election but \nthey are terrible at handling the next generation. Unfortunately, for \nyears this issue used to be over the horizon. It is not any longer. It \nis not only on the horizon, it is closing fast. The red flags are \neverywhere. We have even seen Moody's, the rating agency, put the \nUnited States in a special category with England, not on a watch list, \nbut they have given us a new definition compared to the rest of the \nindustrialized countries. There is no question but the clock is ticking \nand the hour is late. If we don't proceed to action that leads to \nactual activity, that leads to actual policy, in my opinion we will not \nbe fulfilling our responsibility as people who are elected to govern \nand to pass on to the next generation a stronger America rather than a \nweaker one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is time for the people of the U.S. \nCongress to be sure we are listening to what our constituents, the \nAmerican people, are telling us. If it was unclear before, the \nMassachusetts Senate race should put to rest any doubts about what is \nreally frustrating Americans. Americans have had it with the soaring \nlevel of spending and debt. They know that enormous spending and \nskyrocketing deficits take a bite out of the economy, dragging down our \ngross domestic product, our standard of living, and making investors \nand job creators very nervous. They are concerned about the \nunfathomable amounts of money now being spent.\n  For the first year of the Obama administration, the numbers are eye-\npopping. Consider, one, a wasteful $1.2 trillion stimulus that was a \nfailure, according to the administration's own yardstick; two, a $410 \nbillion omnibus Federal spending bill that increased nondefense \nspending by 10 percent; three, a $2.5 trillion government takeover of \nhealth care that this Senate passed on Christmas Eve. Hopefully, this \nwill never actually become law. We have had two huge increases in the \ndebt ceiling, with a third being debated now, and a massive budget that \ndoubles the deficit in 5 years and triples it in 10. It is not \nnecessary. It is not inevitable. We can and should prevent it. \nRemember, we have to borrow most of this money. Americans are very \nconcerned about the amount of money we are borrowing from other nations \nsuch as China to help finance the exploding debt.\n  The administration and its defenders are still blaming President Bush \nfor out-of-control deficits and debt, even though the other party has \nbeen in control of the Congress now for 3 years and the President has \nbeen out of office for over a year. Here are some important facts. \nPresident Bush's deficits ran an average of 3.2 percent of GDP, while \nPresident Obama's spending plans call for deficits that will average \n4.2 percent of GDP over the next decade--in other words, an entire \npercentage point higher. From the day President Obama took office until \nthe last day of fiscal year 2010, debt held by the public will grow by \n$2.3 trillion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. You \ncan't blame that on President Bush. President Bush added less than \nthat--about $3 trillion--to the debt during the entire 8 years he was \nin office. So in just 20 months, President Obama will add as much debt \nas President Bush ran up in 8 years.\n  This administration needs to take responsibility for its actions, \nstart listening to what Americans are saying, and stop talking about \nthe mess they inherited. Americans want Congress and the administration \nto stop their grand spending plans and focus on what is really needed \nfor an economic recovery.\n  December saw another 85,000 jobs lost. Unemployment has not gone \ndown; it is holding steady at about 10 percent. In my State, it is over \n11 percent.\n  Mort Zuckerman wrote Friday in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The problem in the job market going forward is not so much \n     layoffs in the private sector, which are abating, but a lack \n     of hiring.\n\n  That brings me to concerns over tax policy. Americans look ahead and \nthey see new taxes on the horizon. Unless Congress takes action this \nyear, taxes are set to go up by $2 trillion over the next decade, \nstarting in 2011. The child\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\ntax credit would be cut in half. Marginal tax rates will go up. \nDividends and capital gains taxes will increase. It is no wonder that \nbusinesses are timid about hiring and investing and consumers are more \ncautious than ever about their own spending. Even if economists say we \nare technically out of the recession, dollars have not begun to flow \nbecause people and businesses are uncertain about what their burden \nwill be in the coming years. They are very nervous that it will be \nhigher.\n  We can eliminate some of that uncertainty and instill some much \nneeded confidence in the economy by extending current tax law. Again, \nunless Congress acts, taxes will increase automatically. If the \nPresident is looking for a job stimulator, I suggest this is where to \nstart. If he were to announce on Wednesday night that he is calling on \nCongress to keep taxes right where they are--in fact, if we can cut \nthem in some areas, that would be even better--I think he would see \nbusinesses react immediately and positively to the news. But instead of \nincreasing taxes, we need, as Zuckerman says, to draw up credible plans \nto bring down bloated deficits without triggering another downturn.\n  Let's keep something in mind about the American people: They know you \ncan't spend what you don't have. The message this Congress and the \nadministration have been sending to Americans is that even though they \nare bound by limits, Washington is not. As I said, it is time to start \nlistening to our constituents and then act on their instructions. Stop \nspending, keep taxes where they are, reduce them where we can, and stop \nrunning up deficits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S174-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONRAD-GREGG AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Dr. Laurence Peter, the educator who came \nup with the Peter Principle, once said:\n\n       Democracy is a process by which the people are free to \n     choose the [person] who will get the blame.\n\n  In a democracy, that is the people's right. In a democracy, the \npeople elect us to represent them. And in a democracy, the people elect \nus to be accountable.\n  But the chairman and ranking Republican member of the Budget \nCommittee have come up with a process to shift the blame. They have \ncome up with a process for Congress to punt our accountability away. \nThey have come up with a process to outsource Congress's central fiscal \nresponsibilities to a new budget commission.\n  I can see that a commission may be attractive to some. It is the easy \nway out. Senators can blame everything on the commission. Senators can \nsay: The commission made me do it.\n  But we should not shirk our responsibility. Rather, we should do the \njob our constituents sent us here to do. We already have a process for \ndoing so. It is called the budget process.\n  The chairman and ranking Republican member of the Budget Committee \nhave proposed a new budget process. No one has shown greater zeal in \ntaking on the budget deficit than the chairman and ranking Republican \nmember of the Budget Committee. I commend them for their good \nintentions. But we should reject their new process--not their \nintentions but their new process.\n  Senators Conrad and Gregg have said: Everything needs to be on the \ntable, including spending and revenues. But why stop there? If Congress \nis going to outsource its central fiscal responsibilities, why stop \nthere? Why not cede to this commission all of our responsibilities? Why \ndon't we outsource all of this year's work and then adjourn for the \nyear?\n  Come to think of it, if we do cede all of our powers to this \ncommission, what is to stop them from inserting anything and everything \nthey choose into the commission's one, nonamendable, omnibus vehicle? \nThey can insert anything they want--anything.\n  That is the catch with this commission. If we were to cede all of our \nresponsibilities to this commission, and we were to tie our hands so we \ncould not amend its recommendations, then we would risk setting in \nmotion some truly terrible policy.\n  Under the proposed fast-track procedures, we would not be able to \namend the proposal. But what if we did not like the committee's \nrecommendations? We would not be able to replace the commission's \nrecommendations with our own.\n  It is clear from the statements of Senators Conrad and Gregg that \nthey have painted a big red target on Social Security and Medicare. \nThat is what this commission is all about. It is a threat to Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  That is why the first amendment this Senator offered is to protect \nSocial Security. Senators Conrad and Gregg have proposed a system that \nwill not allow Senators to offer amendments to protect Social Security \nlater, after the commission has come up with its recommendations. That \nis why we have to vote to protect Social Security now, while we still \ncan offer amendments.\n  We already have a process to address the budget. It is called the \ncongressional budget process. Anytime we wanted to, we could use the \nbudget process to address the budget deficit. Since the creation of the \nbudget process, it has been the process that Congress has usually used \nto address fiscal challenges.\n  The chairman and ranking Republican member of the Budget Committee \nshould skip the commission. They should go straight to their \nrecommendation. They should bring it up in their committee. That is \nexactly why Congress created the Budget Committee, the budget \nresolution, and the reconciliation bill in the first place. That was \nthe purpose.\n  We do not need a commission to do our work. We do not need a new \nprocess to shift the blame. Rather, to address our fiscal challenges, \nlet us get to work on it now. Let us do the job the people sent us here \nto do. Let us reject this commission.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorums with respect to each cloture motion be waived.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today is the Senate's fourth day of \nconsideration of the joint resolution to increase the debt limit. I \nremind my colleagues this is the legislation that allows the government \nto honor its commitments to pay its bills.\n  Four amendments remain pending: The substitute amendment raising the \namount of the debt limit; this Senator's amendment to protect Social \nSecurity; the Conrad-Gregg amendment to create a fast-track process to \nconsider the budget commission's recommendations; and the majority \nleader's amendment reinstituting the statutory pay-as-you-go budget \nlaw. Up to seven other amendments remain in order to the joint \nresolution.\n  The Senator from Alaska has the right to offer an amendment on the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding. We expect she \nwill seek to address this matter through a freestanding resolution of \ndisapproval rather than an amendment.\n  The remaining six amendments in order are a Coburn amendment \nproposing a package of rescissions; a Sessions amendment creating caps \non appropriated spending; an amendment by the Republican leader's \ndesignee relevant to any on the list; an amendment by the majority \nleader relevant to any on the list; and two amendments by this Senator \nregarding the budget commission.\n  Under the previous order, every amendment to this joint resolution \nwill be subject to a 60-vote threshold. The Senate will not, however, \nconduct any rollcall votes on the debt limit today. We are hopeful \nSenators with amendments on the list will offer some of those \namendments today.\n  Under the previous order, at 5:30 this afternoon, the Senate will \nreturn to the nomination of Rosanna Peterson to be district judge for \nthe Eastern District of Washington. At 6 o'clock this evening the \nSenate will conduct a rollcall vote on the confirmation of the Peterson \nnomination.\n  Under the previous order, at 11:30 tomorrow morning, the Senate will \nproceed to a vote in relation to the following two amendments to the \ndebt limit: First, this Senator's amendment to protect Social Security; \nand second, the Conrad-Gregg amendment to create a fast-track process \nto consider a budget commission's recommendations.\n  So the Senate is open for business this afternoon for Senators to \noffer their amendments. We will work toward developing an agreement for \nthe offering of all amendments by a time certain, perhaps as soon as \ntomorrow, and we hope to conclude action on this measure as soon as \npossible thereafter.\n  I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Bernanke Nomination\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this weekend there was some discussion and \nwriting in the papers and elsewhere in journals about the nomination of \nMr. Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, for another \nterm as chair on that Board. The Washington Post had an editorial \nentitled ``Scapegoat at the Fed.'' I don't normally come to the floor \nof the Senate to respond to the Washington Post editorials, but I do \nwish to respond to a portion of this editorial, and then in a broader \nway describe why I think this is an important moment for the Senate.\n  ``Scapegoat at the Fed.'' The editorial begins:\n\n       There are many ways to interpret the election results in \n     Massachusetts last week . . . But one thing Massachusetts did \n     not represent was a mandate to make a national scapegoat out \n     of Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Board chairman.\n       Yet two Democratic Senators seeking reelection in November \n     . . . plus another planning to retire . . . appear to read it \n     that way. They took the occasion of last week's political \n     upheaval to announce their opposition to another four-year \n     term for Mr. Bernanke, whose current one expires January 31. \n     These senators' attempt to burnish their populist credentials \n     by making Mr. Bernanke the fall guy for all the sins, real \n     and perceived, of Wall Street fuels the right-left anti-Fed \n     chorus in Congress that has already produced troubling \n     attempts to subject the Fed to intrusive and \n     counterproductive audits of its monetary policy.\n\n  Well, that is a partial recitation of the editorial.\n  I can just condense the editorial by saying the editorial board at \nthe Washington Post, as is always the case, has taken the position that \nif anybody wants to know anything about what the Federal Reserve Board \nis doing, it is none of their business. It is none of Congress's \nbusiness; it is none of the American people's business. Stay out of it. \nKeep your nose out of the Federal Reserve Board. That is kind of the \nposition of the Washington Post.\n  It is not since the Massachusetts election, however, that I have \nexpressed reservations about the Federal Reserve Board. In fact, on six \noccasions I have given speeches on the floor of the Senate just since \nDecember 10, 2008. That day, plus on five additional occasions, I came \nto the floor to talk about the issues that persuaded me to say, as I \ndid last week, that I don't even believe we should vote on Mr. \nBernanke's nomination until he has decided to provide the Senate and \nthe American people with information that he is now withholding. Let me \ndescribe what that is.\n  This is a Bloomberg report. It says:\n\n       The U.S. has lent, spent, or guaranteed $11.6 trillion to \n     bolster banks and to fight the longest recession in 70 years.\n\n  I have not come to the floor of the Senate critical of the Fed's \npolicies by which they have lent, spent, or guaranteed $11.6 trillion; \nalthough it is fair to say the $11.6 trillion is not theirs. That \nrepresents the risks of the American people. That is the full faith and \ncredit of this great country of ours.\n  The Federal Reserve Board has taken a number of actions to try to \naddress this economic crisis. However, I would\n\n[[Page S176]]\n\nsuggest this economic crisis was caused, at least in significant part, \nby the malfeasance of the Federal Reserve Board and its previous \nChairman, and, in some respects, this Chairman, who were content to \ntake a long slumber, a very long nap, while the predatory lending was \ngoing on, the housing bubble was growing, and a massive amount of bad \nsecurities were finding their way--along with the payment of a lot of \ngenerous bonuses and fees--into the financial background of a lot of \nfinancial institutions in this country.\n  It says:\n\n       The Federal last year began extending credit directly to \n     companies that aren't banks for the first time since it was \n     created in 1913 . . . it has refused to divulge the details \n     about the companies participating in the 10 lending programs.\n\n  For the first time in the history of this country, during this \nresponse to the economic crisis, the Federal Reserve Board did this, \nwhich previously has only lent money directly to FDIC-insured \ncommercial banks. That is the only group of interests that can come to \nthe Fed and get direct money from them. For the first time in history, \nthe Fed said, during this crisis, we will open that window to allow \ninvestment banks to come and get money directly from us.\n  So I began coming to the floor of the Senate, and I didn't come \ncriticizing the Fed at that point because I don't know if what they did \nwas necessary, but they did it. I wasn't critical. We were in the \nmiddle of a crisis. Then I began coming to the floor and saying: All \nright. Now that we have some amount of stability, let's at least make \ncertain the Federal Reserve Board tells the American people who got the \nmoney, who ended up with the money, and what were the terms of its \nbeing made available to these investment banks.\n  Well, a Federal court, as a result of a FOIA request and a lawsuit \nsaid this, and it was reported in Bloomberg:\n\n       The Federal Reserve must, for the first time, identify the \n     companies in its emergency lending programs after losing a \n     Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.\n       The judge said the central bank improperly withheld agency \n     records. He said you have to disclose who got the money.\n\n  The Federal Reserve Board said we are going to appeal the judge's \nruling. We don't intend to comply with that. We are going to appeal it \nand get a stay. The Federal Reserve is refusing to identify the \nrecipients of almost $2 trillion in emergency loans from the American \ntaxpayers or the troubled assets the central bank is accepting as \ncollateral.\n  The Federal court says you have to do it, and they appealed the court \nruling and got a stay and they are saying we don't intend to do it. In \nthe meantime, I and Senator Grassley authored a letter with eight of \nour colleagues to the Federal Reserve Board last July and said: We want \nyou to disclose to the Congress and the American people who got the \nmoney and how much and what the terms were.\n  We got a letter back from the Federal Reserve Board, dated September \n16. It has a lot of paragraphs in it, but you can summarize it this \nway: No.\n  It is interesting to me that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard has said: We believe one of the hallmarks of what we are doing is \ntransparency. I don't understand, if transparency means you are going \nto disclose things and give people the opportunity to understand what \nhappened, why is there no transparency? Even after a Federal court said \nyou improperly withheld records, even after Members of the Senate said \nmake this information available, even after the American people said we \ndeserve to know who got our money, the Federal Reserve Board said: We \ndon't intend to tell you a thing.\n  There are a couple trillion dollars out there that the Fed has made \navailable. It was a risk to the American taxpayer, and $2 trillion is \nnot a small amount; it is a very large amount. The Fed said: That is \nour business, not yours. That is the business of the Federal Reserve \nBoard. We, in effect, have a right to operate in secret and we intend \nto continue to do that.\n  My problem with Mr. Bernanke--as I have said last week, I don't think \nhis nomination should be voted on in the Senate until and unless he \ndiscloses to us and the American people the details about this $2 \ntrillion and who got it. What were the terms? We now see some of the \ninvestment banks reporting the largest profits in their history, and \nthey are preparing now to provide bonuses, we are told, of $120 billion \nto $140 billion. These are firms, by the way, that would no longer \nexist were it not for the Federal Government. These are firms perched \non the edge of a financial cliff, ready to go under, except for the \nguarantee of the Federal Government in all kinds of ways. Of course, \nthey are the first to get well. No, it is not a company back on Main \nStreet, not a company back in my hometown. The first to get well in \nthis new economy are the investment banks.\n  Did they get well because they were able to get a couple trillion \ndollars from the Federal Reserve Board, probably at zero interest \nrate--I don't know--and invest back into Treasury securities and get \npaid interest on it? Were they arbitraging money? I don't know. I think \nwe ought to know. We have a right to know.\n  Mr. President, the issue, from my standpoint especially, is, we have \na right to know, and the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has a \nresponsibility to tell us and the American people. I noticed last \nweekend, when these writers, including editorial writers and others, \nwere having an apoplectic seizure over this issue: Oh, My God, somebody \nmight vote against Bernanke. Then they say: You know what. More than \nthat being what they call Fed bashing--it is not--it is also the case \nthat this Congress is thinking of tightening the rules on financial \nregulations to prevent those who were doing what they did to create \nthis crisis from ever doing it again. Shame on them. That is \nantibusiness.\n  Isn't it interesting how this has morphed into a situation where, if \nwe want to close the gate and create rules that prevent the kind of \nnonsense that happened from ever happening again, which drove this \ncountry into the ditch, somehow that is antibusiness. I don't think so. \nI think what is antibusiness is this notion of Alan Greenspan--and I \nwill put up his quote--came to Congress after the fact, after the \ncollapse, and he said:\n\n       I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of \n     organizations, specifically banks and others, were best \n     capable of protecting their own shareholders and their own \n     equity in the firms.\n\n  His point was, we don't need to regulate or oversee anything. Self-\nregulation will work best. They will be fine. Leave them alone and they \nwill come home. What an unbelievable, tragic mistake by the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board.\n\n       I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests . . . \n     were best capable--\n\n  It is a suggestion that somehow capitalism works and you don't need \nany regulatory oversight at all because the free market is best left to \nits own devices. The free market is the best allocator of goods and \nservices I know of by far, and I support the free market. I also \nunderstand that, such as in any other area of competition, you need a \nreferee, somebody with a striped shirt who blows the whistle when there \nis a foul. There are plenty of fouls in the free market system. That is \nwhy you need a referee. You need regulation. That is not a 4-letter \nword. It is called regulation. You need effective regulation to make \nsure the free market system works the way it was supposed to work.\n  There are a lot of interests in this free market system that want to \nclog the arteries of the free market and cause some sort of substantial \nproblem in the free market, as long as it exists in their self-\ninterests to do so. There are plenty of interests wanting to do it. \nThat is why effective regulation is important. I am not talking about \noverregulation or underregulation; I am talking about effective \nregulation that is anticipated and which, for about 8 years, took a \nvacation by the hiring of regulators who actually boasted they were \ngoing to be willfully blind and say: You all do what you want to do in \nthis system because we will not look.\n  I brought, again--and I know it is repeating--some of the things \nnobody looked at. The biggest mortgage company in the country that \nhelped set up the subprime scandal that fed itself into the balance \nsheets of banks--commercial banks and investment banks--and caused a \nmassive collapse and about $15 trillion of lost value to the American \npeople. We all have seen Countrywide's advertisements:\n\n\n[[Page S177]]\n\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us. . . .\n\n  That is unbelievable. You may think: How on Earth can that be a \nbusiness model? They were advertising to say: Are you a bad credit \nrisk? We want to do business with you. If you have missed payments or \nbeen bankrupt, come see us.\n  This is Zoom Credit. Here is their advertisement. We saw these on \ntelevision and heard them on the radio and saw them in newspapers. We \nthought: How did this work? They said this:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or a credit card. \n     Even if your credit's in the tank. Zoom Credit's like money \n     in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and \n     debt consolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--\n     who cares?\n\n  Can you imagine that? This is an advertisement from a mortgage \ncompany saying if you have been bankrupt or have slow or no credit, who \ncares.\n  Finally, this is Millennia Mortgage:\n\n       12 months, no mortgage payment. That's right. We will give \n     you the money to make your first 12 payments if you call \n     within the next 2 days. We pay it for you. Our loan program \n     may reduce your current monthly payments by 50 percent and \n     allow you no payments for the first 12 months.\n\n  We saw all these things as they were creating the rot at the bottom \nof this system from which the house of cards collapsed. By the way, all \nthis put mortgages out there in the country and the result was those \nmortgages were wrapped into securities and those securities were then \nsold from mortgage companies to hedge funds and investment banks, \nselling the risk north so they didn't have the risk anymore. There is \nno underwriting at the bottom because you don't have to underwrite if \nyou sell the risk ahead.\n  Then we saw the spectacle of very large commercial banks with their \nfinancial belly loaded with this rot--CDOs, credit default swaps, you \nname it. There were securities rated AAA that were worthless. Then we \nall stood around scratching our heads wondering: How did this happen? \nIt was unbelievable, unprecedented greed. A lot of people at the top \nmade massive amounts of money. The guy who ran Countrywide got away \nwith about $200 million, I believe. That is now under investigation. A \nlot of them got away with a lot of money. Then this country and the \nAmerican people got stuck with about a $15 trillion bill and an economy \nthat has been limping ever since.\n  One asks the questions: Is it Fed bashing? Is it antibusiness? Is it \nFed bashing to say the Fed owes the American people information about \nwho got the $2 trillion and what the terms were? Is it antibusiness for \nthose of us who are trying to put together rules and regulations that \nsay this cannot happen again, we will not allow that?\n  I wish to close with one additional quote. This one is from me. It \nwas almost 10\\1/2\\ years ago on the floor of the Senate when we passed \nlegislation at the request of all those big financial institutions, the \ninvestment banks, you name it. They wanted to strip away protections \nthat were put into place after the Great Depression, saying it was old-\nfashioned; let's compete with the Japanese and Asians and others in \ncommercial finance--one-stop financial service centers, create big \nholding companies and put it together, commercial and investment and \nsecurities, all in one big tub and put up firewalls and we guarantee \nyou will never be hurt and we will be able to better compete.\n  On the floor of the Senate I said this:\n\n       This bill will, in my judgment, raise the likelihood of \n     future massive taxpayer bailouts. It will fuel the \n     consolidation and mergers in the banking and financial \n     services industry at the expense of customers and others.\n\n  It certainly did that. For those of us who decide: You know what, \nlet's begin to put some of these pieces back together, let's begin to \nprovide some protection for this country's economy, let's get rid of \nthis orgy of speculation, that unbelievable greed, this bubble of \nincompetence of people who were supposed to be regulating but didn't--\nyes, that includes the Federal Reserve Board. Let's do this right and \nput it back together. That is not antibusiness; that is probusiness. \nThe businesspeople in this country who go to work in the morning and \nput a key in the door and open are going to work all day, risking \neverything they have. They want an economy that is working, not in \ncollapse but one that is providing opportunity. That certainly cannot \nhappen, and it doesn't happen, when you allow this kind of unbelievable \nspeculation and the rancid behavior and the things that happened at the \nbottom with the predatory lending and exotic things such as CDOs and \ncredit default swaps, so complicated that those on both ends of them, \nin many cases, didn't understand them. Will Rogers once described, a \nlong time ago, people who bought things they will never get from people \nwho never had them and both smiled because both made money.\n  That is the sort of thing that was going on in this country, and that \ndoes not work. The real economic health and the real wealth of this \ncountry is what we produce, not trading paper and especially not \ntrading paper as a matter of speculation to try to build the bubbles we \nsaw in the last decade or so.\n  We have a lot to do to fix what is wrong. I say to those who wrote \nthe Washington Post editorial, the smallest amount of effort could have \navoided that mistake in terms of the six speeches I have given on the \nfloor of the Senate on this subject. This is not a revelation since the \nMassachusetts election. I have been coming to the Senate floor for a \nlong time to talk about these problems.\n  Let me finally say, I think as we move from here to the issue of \nfinancial reform, aside from the Bernanke nomination, the question is: \nAre we going to do that right? Are we going to allow the kind of \npressures that have built on the outside to influence what we do?\n  We should certainly know by now that if you are too big to fail in \nthe financial industry, then you are too big and we ought to do \nsomething about it. We ought to know by now that putting together \ncommercial banks that are insured by the taxpayers with investment \nbanks is a recipe for disaster, and there is a way to separate them. \nThat ought to be our business as we turn to financial reform in the \nyears ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, let me say to my good friend \nSenator Dorgan, first of all, we all know he has served his State for \n40 years. Many of us will be talking about that service and applauding \nhim. It has been a real pleasure to have him chairman of the Senate \nIndian Affairs Committee while I have served on that committee. There \nwill be many more things I will say about him and his fine public \nservice. I thank him because I think what he has said about the Fed and \ntransparency is something that needs to be said. I look forward to \ndebating that with him. I thank Senator Dorgan.\n  (The remarks of Mr. UDALL of New Mexico pertaining to the submission \nof S. Res. 396 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of \nConcurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3302\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senators Conrad and Gregg to create a bipartisan budget \ncommission to address our Nation's long-term fiscal crisis.\n  The Conrad-Gregg amendment would create an 18-member bipartisan \ncommission which would be charged with developing a specific plan to \ncorrect our government's long-term fiscal imbalance. All options would \nbe on the table. The commission's legislative recommendations would \nrequire expedited consideration by the Congress, a supermajority vote \nin both Chambers, and Presidential approval.\n  While I would prefer that Members of Congress have the ability to \noffer revenue-neutral amendments to the commission's legislative \nrecommendations, it is imperative that we move forward on this \nproposal. For this reason, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nlegislation.\n  I would note that I have not always thought the creation of an \nindependent commission was the right approach. I was hopeful that \nCongress could tackle\n\n[[Page S178]]\n\nthe issue of the looming fiscal catastrophe confronting us. But I have \nconcluded that the only way we are going to achieve urgent action on \nthe very serious fiscal problems we face is through the creation of \nthis independent commission.\n  The fact is, America's out-of-control debt is a grave threat to our \nfuture prosperity. Just last month, the Senate voted to increase the \ndebt limit to an astonishing $12.4 trillion, and yet here we are again \ntoday considering another increase in the debt limit--this time by $1.9 \ntrillion, to $14.3 trillion. Last year, this body approved the \nPresident's budget which will double our debt in 5 years and triple it \nin 10 years. In other words, we are facing an explosion in the Federal \ndebt.\n  As bad as that sounds, our Nation's debt problem is actually far \nworse. America has nearly $60 trillion in unfunded liabilities for \nprograms such as Social Security and Medicare. These unfunded \nliabilities amount to $184,000 per person living in our country, or \n$483,000 per household. By contrast, median household income is just \nover $50,000.\n  As David Walker, the former Comptroller General and now president of \nthe Peterson Foundation, put it in recent testimony before our Senate \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee:\n\n       It doesn't take an economist or a mathematician to realize \n     that this is unsustainable.\n\n  We are talking about debt levels that are unsustainable and threaten \nthe very future economy of our country. Our problem, in a nutshell, is \nthat government has promised more than our citizens can afford to pay.\n  One columnist described this as the collision between the high and \nrising demand for government services and the capacity of the economy \nto produce the tax revenues to meet those demands. Historically, \nAmericans have paid about 18 percent of gross domestic product in \nFederal taxes. But with the explosion in entitlement spending tied to \nthe retirement of the baby boom generation, plus interest on the \nnational debt, Americans would need to pay taxes equal to 34 percent of \nGDP to keep pace with spending 25 years from now. That is right, the \ntax burden would have to soar to 34 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct.\n  I am looking at the young pages who are on the floor right now. It is \ntheir future we are talking about. They are the ones who are going to \nbe faced with this enormous debt.\n  Even if it were possible to raise taxes in order to finance this rate \nof spending, that remedy would do tremendous damage to our economy. It \nwould crush job creation, devastate our already battered small \nbusinesses and dash the aspirations and can-do spirit of our people. \nThus, our decisionmaking must begin by reconsidering spending that, \nalthough popular, simply cannot be justified during this fiscal crisis. \nIt is wishful thinking to hope we can simply grow our way out of this \nproblem. Economic growth helps, there is no doubt about that, but it is \nitself endangered by this enormous debt.\n  Becoming more efficient and productive helps reduce our long-term \nfinancial challenges, but economic growth alone will not rescue us from \nthe predicament we face. If we fail to stop this approaching tsunami of \nred ink, then the futures of our children and our grandchildren will be \nswamped by our negligence. The American dream as we know it, where each \nsucceeding generation can achieve a higher standard of living and \nquality of life than the previous generation, will be over. It will not \nbe easy, even with this commission, but we must confront the conflict \nbetween what we want and what we can afford. It is time to reassess our \npriorities, to make the hard decisions and to set a new fiscally \nresponsible course for our country.\n  The budget reform commission proposed by Senator Gregg and Senator \nConrad would begin to move us forward as a nation in facing these \nserious financial challenges. I know it is not easy for many of my \ncolleagues to give away some authority to this commission. I remind \nthem that the commission's recommendations would still come back to us \nand could not become law without our voting for them and without the \nPresident deciding to sign the recommendations into law. But I have \nconcluded that the only way to jump-start the process, to do what needs \nto be done, to right the fiscal boat, to help us face these challenges, \nto help us move forward as a nation, is to enact the Conrad-Gregg \namendment. I urge all my colleagues to support their effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I notice other speakers who wish to speak \nare on the floor now. I will make a very short statement here and defer \nto those Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent the pending amendments be temporarily set \naside so I can call up one of my amendments under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3306 To Amendment No. 3299\n\n (Purpose: To establish a bipartisan task force for responsible fiscal \naction, to assure the long-term fiscal stability and economic security \n of the Federal Government of the United States, and to expand future \n                prosperity and growth for all Americans)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Pursuant to the previous order, I send an amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3306 to amendment No. 3299.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will briefly explain my amendment. This \namendment would achieve all of the same objectives of the Conrad-Gregg \namendment but with one exception, and this is an important exception. \nIn the amendment I just offered, there are no fast-track procedures for \nconsideration of the commission's recommendation. Thus, for Senators \nwho want to have a commission consider our fiscal situation and report \nback to us, this is your alternative. But this alternative would \nprotect the rules of the Senate and the prerogatives of the Senators. I \nurge my colleagues to support this alternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                   Renomination Of Chairman Bernanke\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes about \nthe upcoming confirmation vote on Chairman Bernanke of the Federal \nReserve Board. I should begin by stating very clearly that there is no \nway to overestimate the severity of the economic downturn that began in \nthis country in 2007. To date, our Nation has lost 7.2 million jobs. In \nmy home State of New Mexico, unemployment is now 7.8 percent. That is \nmore than twice the rate it was 2 years ago. But even at that it is \nconsiderably lower than the unemployment rate in many States--in fact, \nin a majority of States. American households have lost $12.6 trillion \nin wealth; more than 5 million American families have seen their homes \nforeclosed, many have lost their businesses, and many have lost their \nfarms. In short, there are millions of families across our country who \nare and have been experiencing severe economic pain and dislocation. \nWhile indicators suggest the recession has officially ended, our \neconomy is hardly out of the woods.\n  In the face of such pain, it is tempting to grasp for ways to \ndemonstrate disapproval of the economic downturn or to put distance \nbetween ourselves as elected officials and the policies involved with \nthe economic downturn. It is tempting, particularly in this political \nclimate, to want to seize on a particular individual to take the brunt \nof the criticism.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues not to use Federal Reserve \nChairman Ben Bernanke's renomination for any such exercise. I rise to \noffer my strong support for his reconfirmation. With the benefit of \nhindsight, it now seems the Fed might have done more to prevent the \neconomic downturn. Some have pointed to financial institution bailouts \nand have argued that the Fed should not have provided financial support \nor guarantees to vulnerable financial institutions. Some have argued \nthat the Fed's support should have\n\n[[Page S179]]\n\nbeen structured differently. Historians, with 20/20 hindsight, will be \nable to argue those issues for years to come. But hindsight also tells \nus that without the bold and aggressive actions Chairman Bernanke in \nfact took, the outcome of this economic downturn could have been \nconsiderably worse. I can imagine no Fed Chairman since the Great \nDepression who has faced such a Herculean task. If ever there were \npraise for averting a disaster, then in my view Chairman Bernanke \ndeserves that praise. He deserves praise for working effectively with \nother domestic and foreign agencies to ensure the continuity of our \nglobal banking system, for taking significant steps to boost banks' \naccess to funding, and for establishing targeted lending programs to \nrestart the flow of credit in critical markets.\n  It is because of this skillfulness and aptitude that Chairman \nBernanke demonstrated he has had the strong support of President Obama \nfor reconfirmation to his position. President Obama said the Chairman's \n``bold, persistent experimentation, has brought our economy back from \nthe brink.''\n  Similarly, in nominating Chairman Bernanke to his first term, \nPresident George W. Bush said he was choosing Chairman Bernanke for his \n``reputation for intellectual rigor and integrity'' and the ``deep \nrespect he enjoyed in the global financial community.''\n\n  It would be shortsighted for this Congress to second-guess the \njudgment of our current and our former Presidents in this regard. \nPresident Obama's call for the reappointment of Chairman Bernanke is \nechoed by some of our Nation's most distinguished economic thinkers. \nFormer Chairmen Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker have both said it would \nbe irresponsible not to extend Chairman Bernanke's term. Douglas Holtz-\nEakin, who was Senator McCain's chief economic adviser in the 2008 \nelection campaign, says ``it would be a disaster not to confirm'' \nBernanke.\n  Warren Buffett has said if he could vote for Mr. Bernanke's \nconfirmation he would--twice. As Mr. Buffett explained:\n\n       We talked about [the economic downturn] being an economic \n     Pearl Harbor, and he did what should have been done in \n     response to that Pearl Harbor.\n\n  These respected economic thinkers know that emerging from our \nNation's deepest and most protracted economic downturn since the Great \nDepression will require continuity of policy. Financial conditions \nmight now suggest that our economy is in fact turning around, but a \ncomplete turnaround will require that families and businesses, \ninvestors and financial markets see consistent policy actions. Central \nto that consistency and that continuity is leadership at the helm of \nthe Federal Reserve Board. If we were to change chairmen now, we would \nadd considerable uncertainty to our already fragile business and \nfinancial markets and almost certainly trigger a sell-off of the dollar \nand a sell-off of equities. This could have the unfortunate effect of \nprolonging the economic downturn we are now experiencing.\n  Finally, while I rise to support Chairman Bernanke's reconfirmation, \nI also renew my call for policymakers in all positions, ourselves \nincluded, to make job creation the centerpiece of any economic recovery \nagenda. We in the Congress must also press forward with the urgent task \nof reforming our financial regulatory infrastructure, the cracks and \nholes of which have been exposed by this recession.\n  Our Nation faces considerable and urgent challenges. In my view, that \nis why it is essential that Ben Bernanke be confirmed for another term \nas Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3302\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Conrad-Gregg amendment. I believe the issues this amendment \nis designed to address--our national debt and deficits as far as the \neye can see--are two of the most important issues Congress and our \nNation face. Our failure to address these issues will damage our \neconomy, our Nation's security, peace in the world, and the kind of \nfuture we leave to our children and grandchildren.\n  The greatness of the issue has resulted in the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee, Senators Conrad and Gregg, \ncoming together and introducing the Bipartisan Task Force for \nResponsible Fiscal Action Act, which is supported by 29 Senators--14 \nDemocrats and 15 Republicans. I am pleased to say I am one of those 15 \nRepublicans.\n  I think those who followed the recent operations of the Senate will \nappreciate that in this Balkanized Senate, where nothing seems to get \ndone on a bipartisan basis, this commission has significant bipartisan \nsupport. The Conrad-Gregg proposal would create a statutorily based \ncommission of 18 members, 16 of them Members of Congress, who would \nstudy the long-term fiscal imbalance of the Federal Government and \nsubmit recommendations as a legislative proposal that would receive \nexpedited consideration by Congress resulting in an up-or-down vote. \nThe commission would consider all options on both sides of the ledger \nand would require the approval of 14 of its 18 members, ensuring a \nbipartisan product.\n  I want to emphasize to my Republican colleagues who may be skeptical \nof this bipartisan commission, half of the congressionally appointed \nmembers will be appointed by the Senate minority leader and the House \nminority leader, which guarantees that the Conrad-Gregg commission will \nprotect the concerns of my colleagues.\n  For example, large tax increases are unlikely, given the makeup and \nprocedures of the commission. And, finally, three-fifths of the Senate \nand three-fifths of the House must vote for passage of the \nrecommendations, ensuring strong bipartisan support from both Chambers.\n  The bipartisanship is the key to success because this is not a \nDemocratic or Republican problem. It affects everyone. I believe this \nspecial process is the most practical and effective method to deal with \nthe looming debt crisis that endangers the economic future of all of \nus.\n  A commission to address our Nation's fiscal issues has been \nrecommended by outside budget experts from across the political \nspectrum. These experts have declared that the regular process is \nincapable of dealing with long-term fiscal issues. Just ask me. This is \nmy 12th year in the Senate. The regular process does not work.\n  In February 2009, groups including Brookings, the Urban Institute, \nthe Peter G. Peterson Foundation, the Concord Coalition, AEI, \nProgressive Policy Institute, and the Heritage Foundation issued a \nstatement calling for the establishment of a commission to address our \nfiscal issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Recently, on PBS's nightly business program, Maya \nMacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal \nBudget, who has been working on this problem for a dozen years, made a \nstrong statement in support of a commission. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed her full statement in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks, and I would highlight that in her statement Ms. MacGuineas \nnotes her early opposition to such a commission, but she has changed \nher mind based on the urgency of our Nation's fiscal situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. David Walker, President and CEO of the Peter G. \nPeterson Foundation, former Comptroller General of the United States, \nhas long advocated a special process to get our Nation's fiscal house \nin order. Mr. Walker has testified:\n\n       Clearly escalating Federal deficits and debt levels, \n     combined with our growing dependency on foreign lenders and \n     the deepening Federal financial hole, represents challenges \n     that must be addressed. A commission could make \n     recommendations in connection with needed statutory budget \n     control, social insurance program reforms, tax reform, \n     additional health care reforms, and other appropriate areas.\n       Importantly--\n\n  This is the most important thing--\n\n     everything must be on the table with the commission to be \n     credible and to have a real chance of success.\n\n\n[[Page S180]]\n\n\n  Recently, Mr. Walker released a book entitled ``Comeback America: \nTurning the Country Around and Restoring Fiscal Responsibility.'' In \nhis book, Mr. Walker explains the nature of the crisis and why we must \nact now. Rather than describe all of the frightening statistics myself, \nand many people have heard those statistics, I would recommend this \nbook to my colleagues if they have any doubts about the seriousness of \nthis fiscal crisis facing our Nation.\n  Of course, throughout the debate on their amendment, Senators--and I \nheard them earlier today--Conrad and Gregg have described the dire \nfiscal future our Nation faces without action. We just heard another \npresentation from my distinguished colleague from the State of Maine. I \nhave, in my prior floor speeches on this topic, which probably are \ndozens, described the significance of this fiscal crisis our Nation \nfaces. For any of my colleagues or members of the public, you can \naccess these speeches on my Web site.\n  I would note that the American people agree. This is important. The \nAmerican people agree with Senators Conrad and Gregg. In fact, the \nlatest bipartisan public opinion poll commissioned by the Peter G. \nPeterson Foundation this past November indicates that 80 percent--80 \npercent--of American voters are concerned about escalating debt and \ndeficits.\n  Voter concern about debt and deficits exceeded concern about health \ncare access and affordability by 24 percent--by 24 percent--and 70 \npercent of Americans believe the regular order in Washington is broken. \nThey think the regular order is broken, and it is time for a fiscal \nreform commission to become a reality.\n  I was pleased last year that the distinguished minority leader, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, spoke eloquently about the merits of the \nbipartisan Conrad-Gregg Commission. In a July statement on the Senate \nfloor, Senator McConnell said:\n\n       This means that in order to face our problem head on, we \n     will have to address the problem of entitlement spending. And \n     the only serious option on the table is the Conrad-Gregg \n     proposal which would provide a clear pathway for fixing these \n     long-term challenges by forcing us to get debt and spending \n     under control.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I have had a number of good conversations about this \n     proposal with the President. Based on those conversations, I \n     am hopeful it will be given serious attention. For the safety \n     and security of our Nation, the Conrad-Gregg proposal \n     deserves broad bipartisan support.\n\n  That was the minority leader of the Senate. Senator Reid has been \nsilent on his support, but based on conversations I have had with him, \nI believe he also appreciates the dire financial situation our Nation \nfaces. Still I want to say that I have been disappointed there has not \nbeen more of a recent effort by leaders of both parties embracing the \nConrad-Gregg Commission, which is one of the most bipartisan pieces of \nlegislation we have seen in the Senate during this Congress--in fact, I \nbelieve the most bipartisan legislation that has come before this \nsession of Congress.\n  My question to Senators Reid and McConnell is, If you are not in \nfavor of the Conrad-Gregg Commission, what bipartisan proposal are you \nfor? In other words, if you do not like the commission, then what \nbipartisan proposal are you for?\n  I was also disappointed that the President initially threw in the \ntowel on the Conrad-Gregg Commission on the grounds that he understood \nthe votes to pass this proposal were not there. Instead the President \nproposed issuing an Executive order establishing a debt commission. An \nExecutive order commission, I believe, will be looked upon by many on \nmy side of the aisle as nothing more than an exercise in political \nmessaging. But I say to my colleagues on this side of the aisle: If you \nare not for the Conrad-Gregg proposal, what are you for? What are you \nfor?\n  Thus, I am grateful that this Saturday the President has changed his \nposition and stated:\n\n       The only way to solve our long-term fiscal challenge is to \n     solve it together, Democrats and Republicans. That's why I \n     strongly support legislation under consideration to create a \n     bipartisan fiscal commission to come up with a set of \n     solutions to tackle our nation's fiscal challenges, and call \n     on Senators from both parties to vote for the creation of a \n     statutory, bipartisan fiscal commission.\n\n  The President of the United States made it clear. He wants this \nbipartisan statutory commission to pass the Senate. The beauty of \ncreating the commission through legislation is it would force Congress \nto deal with the Nation's looming fiscal catastrophe, rewarding the \nwork of the commission's members by ensuring that if their proposal \ngets 14 out of 18 votes, the bill will not be placed on a shelf to \ngather dust.\n  I can tell you, as I watched this Senate during the last 11 years, if \nsomeone would ask me to sit on a commission and spend the time I would \nhave to spend to deal with the problems that would be confronting the \ncommission, I would want a guarantee. I would want a guarantee that if \nthe majority, 14 out of 18 members were for it, it would get expedited \nprocedure; that I would get a vote, up or down, on that labor of work \nin which I had participated.\n  I think the President understands if we are going to respond to the \nfiscal crisis facing our Nation, it has to be bipartisan. I am \nprayerful he will use his political capital with Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell to secure the 60 votes needed for this landmark \nlegislation and then urge our House colleagues to do the same.\n  Some of my colleagues have other proposals. Many of them are worthy \nof consideration. However, none of these proposals is bipartisan. In \nthe end, such proposals might result in great messaging. Boy, we do a \nlot of messaging around here. For some it would provide a way to cover \ntheir behinds or, more tactfully, to provide a fig leaf to cover their \nunwillingness to support something that is bipartisan and ultimately \ngood for the country. Moreover, of course, these folks would save \nthemselves from heartburn, heartburn that they might suffer when \nspecial interests complain, and perhaps give ammunition to someone who \nmight be running against them in a Republican or Democratic primary for \nthe Senate.\n  Since the possible passage of this commission has become a reality, \nit is interesting how this starts to work. Special interest groups on \nboth sides of the aisle have assailed it as terrible. The taxpayer \norganizations on the right warn that the commission will increase \ntaxes. The liberal groups on the left warn it will result in cuts to \nSocial Security, Medicare, and other government programs.\n  You know something. If the left and the right are so unhappy with \nthis, this has to be good legislation. Others, frankly, want to use the \ndebt limit issue to embarrass our friends on the other side of the \naisle because of the large increases we have approved, particularly as \na result of the recession and the collapse of our financial markets. \nOther members continue to blame President Bush and earlier Congresses.\n  The truth is, none of us, Republicans or Democrats, has clean hands. \nSince 2002 there have been nine votes, nine votes to increase the debt \nlimit. They have occurred both under Democrats and Republicans when \nthey controlled Congress. In that time, our debt has gone from $6.4 \ntrillion to roughly $12.4 trillion. All of us, all of us have done it.\n  The American people know the chickens have come home to roost, and we \nbetter understand that. That is what I hear when I go back to Ohio. If \none thing came out of Massachusetts, the people are tired of the--to \nput it in the vernacular--BS coming out of Congress. Congress's numbers \ncontinue to be among the worst they have ever been because the folks \nback home think we are more interested in protecting our political hide \nand who is going to control the next Congress than working in a \nbipartisan way to solve our Nation's problems.\n  They know when their elected representatives are scrapping, their \ninterests are scraps falling off the table. They also know, as I know, \nthat even when we work together, it is often difficult to get things \ndone because many of us have sincere differences of opinion. I learned \nboth of those lessons as mayor of the city of Cleveland and Governor of \nOhio.\n  The eyes of the American people are focused on what we are doing. The \nAmerican people will be watching to see if we got the wake-up call from \nMassachusetts. They are telling us they are mad as hell with business \nas usual and they are not going to take it anymore. The American people \nwant us\n\n[[Page S181]]\n\nto work together. They do. They want us to work together. They do not \nwant messaging and back-room deals that favor one group or another.\n  Americans always hear from politicians about how they will work for \nbipartisan solutions to America's problems that will strengthen our \nfuture. How many times have they heard that on the floor of this \nSenate? Well, here is the opportunity for Members of the Senate, the \nHouse, and President Obama to show when they make such statements they \nare serious.\n  I came here in 1999, and one of the major reasons I came here was to \ndeal with paying down our Nation's debt and balance budgets. I can \nremember back in 2000, I was the only Republican that voted against the \nRepublican legislation to reduce taxes because I said that money should \nbe used to pay down debt.\n  I am leaving the Senate at the end of this year, as is the Presiding \nOfficer. I have three children and seven grandchildren. The wife of my \nyoungest son Peter is expecting their first child. I have always \nbelieved it is my responsibility to try to leave this world and \nparticularly our Nation in better shape than how I found it. It was \nsomething that was ingrained in my first-generation parents: George, \nyou have a responsibility to leave this country a better place than \nthat which you found. I am running out of time to do something. So is \nthe country. On too many occasions, Congress has been unwilling to \nexperience short-term pain to achieve long-term gain. We have been \nunwilling do without or pay for things that many folks have wanted us \nto do.\n  Our Nation has put the financial costs of the two wars on the credit \ncard, even while the soldiers and their families continue to bear the \nhuman cost of these wars. To me, this lack of effective action is \nabsolutely immoral. It is absolutely immoral. I recently talked with my \noldest son George, the father of four beautiful girls, who genuinely \nfeels there will be no Social Security for him, that Medicare may not \nbe there either. He understands the global competition facing his \ngeneration and his daughters' generation is greater than at any other \ntime in our Nation's history, that global competition is greater than \nat any other time in this Nation's history. The burden we have created \nbecause of our fiscal irresponsibility brings into question whether his \nchildren will enjoy the same opportunity for a standard of living that \nwe have had.\n  I said in the beginning of my speech, I believe the issues this \namendment is designed to address, our national debt and deficits as far \nas the eye can see, are two of the most important issues Congress and \nour Nation face. Our failure to address these issues will damage our \neconomy, our Nation's security, peace in the world, and the kind of \nfuture we leave to our children and grandchildren.\n  The future of our Nation is in our hands. The future of our Nation is \nin the hands of these 100 Senators. I pray the Holy Spirit will come \ndown and inspire us to make the right decision. My two mottos have been \nover the years: ``Together we can do it'' and, Ohio's motto, ``With God \nall things are possible.'' Working together on a bipartisan basis and \nwith God's help, I am positive we can solve our problems, meet our \nchallenges, and take advantage of the opportunities before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Statement on the Fiscal Responsibility Summit\n\n                                                February 19, 2009.\n       President Obama's intention to convene a fiscal \n     responsibility summit is a very welcome development. It \n     offers a valuable opportunity to focus public attention on \n     our nation's unsustainable budget outlook and to highlight \n     various approaches to meaningful action.\n       As a group of budget analysts and former senior budget \n     officials, we view this summit as the first step to \n     addressing the enormous long-term fiscal problem facing the \n     United States. Without decisive action this problem will lead \n     to serious harm to our economy and a huge financial burden on \n     our children and grandchildren.\n       Tackling these problems will require a degree of sacrifice \n     impossible under the existing policy process, which \n     discourages bipartisan compromise and encourages \n     procrastination and obstructionism. Unless those procedures \n     are modified, and the American people are engaged in the \n     process, future legislative attempts to address the looming \n     fiscal crisis will almost certainly fail.\n       In our view, the American people are ready to confront the \n     challenge. For the last three years several of us have \n     traveled around the country as a group, discussing these \n     issues with thousands of Americans in dozens of cities, in a \n     bipartisan effort known as the Fiscal Wake-Up Tour. We have \n     found that when Americans are given the facts and options in \n     a neutral and bipartisan way, they want action and are \n     willing to make difficult trade-offs.\n       We therefore urge the President to lead a major public \n     engagement effort--beyond a one-day summit--to inform \n     Americans of the scale and nature of the long-term fiscal \n     crisis, explain the consequences of inaction and discuss the \n     options for solving the problem. This should be bipartisan, \n     and involve a serious conversation with Americans to help \n     guide action in Washington. As a group with some experience \n     in this domain, we stand ready to assist if needed.\n       We also believe that for this policy commitment to produce \n     tangible results, the President and others who share the goal \n     of fiscal responsibility must address the fact that the \n     regular political process has been incapable of dealing with \n     long-term fiscal issues. We see no alternative but to create \n     an independent and truly bipartisan commission or other \n     mechanism capable of bringing about decisive action that has \n     broad public support. We therefore urge the President to \n     support such a commission. For this commission or some other \n     mechanism to break through the legislative logjam it will \n     need four key elements:\n       It must be truly bipartisan and develop solutions that \n     command wide support.\n       It must have a broad mandate to address all aspects of the \n     fiscal problem while fostering strong economic growth.\n       There must be no preconditions to the deliberations. All \n     options must be on the table for discussion. Nobody should be \n     required to agree in advance to any option.\n       Recommendations must go before Congress for an up-or-down \n     vote with few if any amendments. Such a game-changing process \n     is not without precedents; controversial military base \n     closings or the ratification of international trade \n     agreements, for example, have long been governed by special \n     rules along these lines, not by business as usual.\n       We are deeply worried about the long-term fiscal imbalance \n     and the dangers it carries for the economy and for our \n     children and grandchildren. We know the President is \n     concerned as well, as are many Members of Congress in both \n     political parties. We are ready to help in building public \n     understanding of the problem and the options, and in crafting \n     an approach that will enable the legislative process to deal \n     with the problem.\n       This statement is offered by members of the Brookings-\n     Heritage Fiscal Seminar.

She's Maya MacGuineas, \n     president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n       MAYA MACGUINEAS, PRES., COMMITTEE FOR A RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL \n     BUDGET: For years there has been a push to create a budget \n     commission and even though many of my fellow fiscal worry \n     warts liked the idea, I just didn't. I couldn't avoid the \n     nagging feeling that coming up with a workable plan to fund \n     our national priorities is supposed to be the core work of \n     Congress and that Congress should just do its job. Well \n     enough time has gone by without that job getting done and the \n     recent deterioration in the country's fiscal health has \n     caused me to change my tune and so I say bring on the \n     commission. We no longer have the luxury of time. For every \n     year we wait, we dig the deficit hole billions of dollars \n     deeper. Recently a heated fight over creating a commission \n     has broken out with those who oppose it on the left arguing \n     it is a secret, well-funded plot to cut entitlements and \n     those on the right arguing it is a devious strategy to raise \n     taxes. Well, yeah, we are going to have to do both. Creating \n     a commission won't make those policy choices much easier, but \n     at least it will lend an important layer of political cover. \n     I will say that the need to create a commission is a poor \n     reflection on politicians more generally. So as a reluctant \n     budget commission supporter and an avid congressional reform \n     supporter, I'd suggest that once a budget commission comes up \n     with a plan, Congress turn the mirror on itself and ask what \n     it is doing there if it can't perform\n\n[[Page S182]]\n\n     its most basic job. Perhaps the next commission policymakers \n     create should be one to reform Congress. I'm Maya MacGuineas.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes to speak on the \njudicial nomination coming before us at 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray are printed in today's Record under \n``Executive Session.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Unfunded Mandates\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a serious \nproblem with the way Washington has done business for years. The \nproblem is passing unfunded Federal mandates on to the States that \nthrow State budgets into disarray. Everyone in Congress has to decide \nhow to best look out for their State. A little over a month ago, I \ndecided to look out for all their States and mine too. But the efforts \nI made to protect my State and all other States should not be the \nissue. The issue should be, why wasn't everyone taking steps to protect \ntheir States and why weren't the critics reacting to the real issue \nrather than coining names to describe this effort to protect State \nbudgets from the effects of yet another unfunded Federal mandate?\n  The reason is, all along they wanted to derail health reform. \nMisrepresenting this issue would help that goal. So it was too easy, \ntoo convenient to come up with a catchy name and to impugn motives. It \nwas too easy, too convenient to ignore the problem facing Nebraska and \nevery other State--another mandate without money.\n  Unfunded Federal mandates are not just bad for Nebraska; they are bad \nfor all States, from sea to shining sea. They are a fiscal injustice \nthat I fought for two decades during my tenure as a Senator and through \ntwo terms as Governor. They are a burden on the States that I will keep \nfighting to eliminate as long as they continue.\n  Unfunded Federal mandates are pretty simple, but they appear in many \nunexpected and unwanted ways. They are orders that arrive from \nWashington on State Capitol doorsteps with too little or no money to \ncarry them out. Unfunded Federal mandates force States all across the \ncountry into no-win choices: cut spending on State priorities or raise \nrevenue with tax hikes. They are a fiscal injustice States have no \noption to avoid. Unfunded Federal mandates are both bad Federal policy \nand bad fiscal policy.\n  As a Senator, I have said I will put Nebraska first, Nebraska always \nbut not Nebraska only. That remains the case with questions about how \nthe Senate health care bill dealt with an underfunded mandate for \nexpanding Medicaid. First, my goal has always been to draw attention to \nand fix, with one approach or another, any unfunded Federal mandate \nthat would be passed on to every State through the Senate's health care \nbill. The bill sought to expand Medicaid to provide health insurance to \nmillions of Americans who do not have it today. The Federal Government \nwould pay 100 percent of the cost for the first 3 years through 2016. \nIn 2017 and thereafter, States would have to pick up a portion of the \ncost. In other words, they would pay for a new unfunded Federal \nmandate.\n  I sought an opt-in or opt-out for all States to ease the Federal \nunfunded mandate. But because there was no Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis for that approach, a provision was placed into the bill for \nNebraska. It is not something I sought. It is something I accepted to \nlaunch the larger battle against the unfunded mandate affecting all \nStates. I have taken criticism over this issue. If I have received it \nbecause I drew attention to unfunded Federal mandates, fine. But the \nlarger question is: How do we in Congress eliminate this practice of \npassing these mandates on to the States? Rather than criticize me, \nothers should join in fighting the war to stop all these burdens on the \nStates. It is an effort I welcome the Governors to join in, too, for \nthey have a direct interest in the success of this battle.\n  The Nebraska provision was a victory in the battle against unfunded \nmandates necessary to win the war. What otherwise had gone completely \nunaddressed is now part of the debate, not only in the Nation's Capital \nbut in State capitals across America.\n  We only have to look back a few years to see what trouble unfunded \nmandates cause for States. When Congress passed the No Child Left \nBehind Act, it was hailed as a landmark that would improve education \nnationwide. It established new standards to measure educational \nachievement in our schools and required States to develop assessments \nin basic skills to be given to all students in certain grades. States \nhad to make sure that happened for their schools to receive Federal \naid. But the law provided far too little money to meet its \nrequirements. This was a fact acknowledged by its chief sponsor, the \nlate Senator Kennedy.\n  He said:\n\n       The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally \n     in place, but the funds are not.\n\n  Was that ever a true statement. States have paid and paid and are \nstill paying for that whopper of an unfunded mandate. In fact, No Child \nLeft Behind, which I opposed largely because of its being an unfunded \nFederal mandate, has cost my State of Nebraska at least $382.7 million. \nNationwide, it has cost all States a total of $70.9 billion from 2002 \nthrough 2008, according to U.S. Department of Education data. Those \ncosts have kept piling up ever since, and that is not right.\n\n  I fought another unfunded Federal mandate in the 2003 major tax cut \nbill. At the time, cutting Federal taxes would also have forced cuts in \nState taxes. That, in turn, would have blown holes in State budgets. So \nI teamed up on a bipartisan basis with my colleagues, Senator Collins \nfrom Maine and Senator Rockefeller from West Virginia, to help the \nStates. We won a provision that provided $20 billion in Federal funding \nto the States to make up for the lost money they needed to pay their \nongoing Medicaid costs.\n  Today, here we are again hearing from financially strapped States \nacross the country asking for additional Federal money to pay for other \nprevious unfunded Medicaid mandates. I do not blame them for asking. \nThe government tells them they have to pay a share of certain social \nservices and medical expenses, and in tough economic times such as \nthese they just do not have the money. Unfortunately, neither does \nWashington. Then, while States are currently seeking aid from Congress, \nwe are busy creating this new unfunded mandate set to hit States \nbeginning in 2017. When would that one be addressed? In 2018, 2019, \nsometime later? Talk about the left hand not knowing what the right \nhand is doing.\n  I have been asking: Why not deal with that now in this health care \nreform legislation and change the paradigm from unfunded mandates and \ndo it in a different way? Just last week, we learned how big this \nunfunded mandate would be. The Congressional Budget Office estimated \nthat covering the Medicaid expansion costs for all States would cost \nthe Federal Government $35 billion. That means Congress was about to \npass a $35 billion unfunded Federal mandate on to the States--until I \ngot wind of it. Let me say that again. Congress was about to send a $35 \nbillion bill to the States, until I blew the whistle.\n  We need to stop this madness of passing these fiscal timebombs on to \nthe States. I would hope my colleagues, on a bipartisan and a bicameral \nbasis, would work with me to make sure Congress stops passing unfunded \nmandates of any kind on to the States and that the Governors would join \nin also. They certainly do not like Washington telling them how to \nspend State money.\n  I hope people put aside the spin, the partisan talking points, and \nmisrepresentation they have heard on this issue, including the media. I \nhope people stop citing the inaccurate interpretation of it as an \nexcuse to avoid working for health care reform that provides coverage \nto millions of Americans who today do not have insurance and lower \ncosts to all other Americans who pay ever-rising costs for health care. \nI hope we can also stop the practice of Washington burdening the\n\n[[Page S183]]\n\nStates with unfunded Federal mandates which are truly bad for every \nsingle State--not just mine but every State--from sea to shining sea.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Rosanna Malouf Peterson, of \nWashington, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District \nof Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 6 \no'clock shall be equally divided between the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are about to vote on the nomination \nof Rosanna Malouf Peterson to the District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Washington.\n  I am pleased to be able to support the nomination, as I have most of \nthe nominations President Obama has submitted. I think we are moving in \na rather expeditious way in the process to confirm Federal judges. Less \nthan a week ago, we confirmed Judge Beverly Martin to serve on the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Frankly, we failed to confirm her \nbefore Christmas because the Democratic leadership, for some reason, \nwould not bring her nomination up. I cleared it on our side on several \ndifferent occasions and made sure there were no objections. At any \nrate, she was confirmed and she is now on that bench.\n  Before the recess, we confirmed two judges, seven U.S. attorneys, and \nfive U.S. marshals.\n  We are moving faster than we have previously--at least in comparison \nto President Bush's tenure. This chart shows the average number of days \nto confirm President Bush's circuit court nominations. We waited an \naverage of 350 days for confirmation. President Obama's nominees are \nbeing confirmed about 4\\1/2\\ months faster, which is a good bit faster. \nIn addition, the Judiciary Committee has held hearings for every single \ncircuit court nominee.\n  This chart shows that during President Bush's tenure, it was 350 \ndays, and for President Obama, it is a little over 200 days. For \nPresident Clinton, it was under 250. The others in the past were \nquicker. But these are lifetime appointments. We have had some more \nintense scrutiny of nominees, which I think is appropriate. But most of \nthe nominees are coming through well and should move on to confirmation \nat a reasonable pace.\n  I will note that if a judge who is about to obtain a lifetime \nappointment fails to convince Members of the Senate that they are \ncommitted to faithfully following the law, being a neutral umpire, not \nfavoring one side in the ``ball game'' over the other--if they are not \ncommitted to that, then they should not be confirmed. Or if they have \nother weaknesses, such as lack of skill, or a demonstrated bias, or a \nlack of background and ability, then I think they should be examined \nclosely and not confirmed.\n  On the district court nominees, you can see that President Obama's \ndistrict court nominees are being confirmed, on average, a little over \n100 days after being nominated. Whereas, President Bush's were at 180. \nUnder President Clinton, it was about 130. So President Obama is doing \nwell there as well--pretty close to President Bush 1--for nominations \nmoving forward.\n  I am pleased with this nominee. I think she has the skills and gifts \nnecessary to be a good Federal judge. I hope so. She has the support of \nher Senators. She has been moved through committee, and I believe she \nwill be confirmed when we vote. I urge my colleagues to support her \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the nomination \nof Rosanna M. Peterson to fill a judicial vacancy in the Eastern \nDistrict of Washington. While I am pleased that we will consider, and I \nam confident the Senate will confirm, this nominee, I remain \ndisappointed by the Republican delays and obstruction.\n  This is only the 14th Federal circuit or district court nominee \nconsidered since President Obama was inaugurated over 1 year ago. By \nthis date during President Bush's second year in office, the Senate had \nconfirmed more than double that number, having confirmed 30 of his \njudicial nominees to lifetime appointments on the Federal courts.\n  Last Friday the majority leader tried to secure an agreement to take \nup the next judicial nominee on the Senate Executive Calendar, but \nRepublican objection continued to stall consideration of Judge Joseph \nGreenaway's nomination to the Third Circuit. That is a shame. He is a \ngood judge. His nomination was reported unanimously by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee almost 4 months ago, on October 1 last year. \nSenator Sessions praised him at his confirmation hearing. I do not know \nwhy he is being stalled, and no one has explained. His is one of the \nmany outstanding judicial nominations reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that remain stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar. They \nshould have been confirmed last year, and would have been, but for \nRepublican objection. When considered they will be confirmed, but not \nbefore being needlessly delayed for months.\n  I saw last week's statement by the Judiciary Committee's ranking \nRepublican member, when the Senate finally considered the long-delayed \nnomination of Beverly Martin to the Eleventh Circuit. He was \nmisinformed about that nomination, as he was about the history of other \nnominations. In fact, I expedited consideration of Judge Martin's \nnomination. The Senate Democratic leadership sought an agreement for \nprompt consideration of Judge Martin's nomination but was rebuffed by \nRepublicans who were in no hurry to consider it. Indeed, we have been \nseeking time agreements for the consideration of both Judge Martin and \nJudge Greenaway for weeks and months. Republicans finally agreed at the \nend of last year to consider Judge Martin's nomination after the \nrecess. I had pressed for Judge Martin and the many other judicial \nnominees who had been reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to be considered and confirmed before Christmas last year. \nRepublicans would not agree. I asked repeatedly that we act on all the \njudicial nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar in December. The \nreason the Senate did not was not because any Democratic Senator \nobjected. It is solely because Republicans would not agree.\n  The efforts of the Democratic leadership to seek a time agreement for \nprompt consideration of Judge Martin's nomination were rebuffed by \nRepublicans, just as they are now refusing to consider the nomination \nof Judge Greenaway.\n  The Republicans unsuccessfully filibustered the nomination of Judge \nDavid Hamilton last November, having delayed its consideration for \nmonths. Republicans insisted on hours of debate for the nomination of \nJudge Andre Davis, who was confirmed with more than 70 votes. They \ninsisted on debate on the nomination of Judge Gerard Lynch, who was \nconfirmed with more than 90 votes. As the Senate Democratic leadership \nwas forced to work through a number of nominations denied consent for \nprompt consideration, the last Federal circuit court nominations \nconsidered before Judge Martin was Judge Hamilton in November. It is \ntrue that Judge Davis and Judge Hamilton were considered and confirmed \nby the Senate before Judge Martin, but they were also considered three \nmonths earlier by the Senate Judiciary Committee than Judge Martin. \nThey had\n\n[[Page S184]]\n\nbeen on the Senate Executive Calendar since before she was even \nnominated. I do not fault the Senate Democratic leadership for \nfollowing that order of consideration.\n  What the ranking Republican member of Judiciary does not acknowledge, \nand perhaps is unaware of, is that it was his own Republican leadership \nthat slowed consideration of Judge Martin. Even the ranking Republican \nmember has no excuse for the delay after November 19, when both Judge \nDavis and Judge Hamilton had been confirmed. For the last 2 months, \nJudge Martin's nomination was stalled because Republicans would not \nagree to consider it before January 20.\n  Judge Martin's nomination offers a troubling example, as well, of the \nconsequences of the Republican strategy of obstruction and delay. Even \nthough Judge Martin was a well-respected district court judge with the \nstrong support of both of her home State Republican Senators, Senator \nChambliss and Senator Isakson, and the highest possible rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, \nit took over 4 months to reach agreement with the Republican leadership \nfor the Senate to consider her nomination.\n  Regrettably, the nomination of Judge Greenaway of New Jersey to the \nThird Circuit is another example of these tactics. The Judiciary \nCommittee favorably reported his nomination by unanimous consent last \nOctober 1, and he is now the longest pending judicial nomination on the \nSenate Executive Calendar. The Democratic leadership sought to build on \nour belated progress last week when we were allowed finally to consider \nand confirm Judge Martin. We asked for agreement to consider the \nnomination of Judge Greenaway. As the majority leader indicated last \nFriday: ``[The Democratic] majority was in a position to agree to a \nvote on the nomination of Joseph Greenaway to be a U.S. circuit judge \nfor the Third Circuit. However, I was advised the Republicans would not \nagree to such request.'' See Congressional Record, S166, January 22, \n2010, daily ed. Again, Senate Republicans have withheld consent and \nhave objected to consideration of a nominee. Instead, they would \nconsent only to consideration of a district court nominee, Professor \nPeterson. While it is appropriate that the Senate considers Professor \nPeterson's nomination today, we should also be able, in regular order, \nto consider other nominations without months of delay.\n  None of the eight remaining judicial nominations currently pending on \nthe Senate Executive Calendar should be controversial. Many, like \nProfessor Peterson and Judge Greenaway, were reported by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee without a single dissenting vote. We have wasted \nweeks and months having to seek time agreements in order to consider \nnominations that were reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously and who are then confirmed unanimously by the Senate once \nthey were finally allowed to be considered.\n  These obstructionist tactics from Republicans last year led to the \nlowest number of judicial confirmations in more than 50 years. Only 12 \nof President Obama's judicial nominations to Federal circuit and \ndistrict courts were confirmed all last year. The 12 Federal circuit \nand district court nominees confirmed last year was less than half of \nwhat we achieved during President Bush's first tumultuous year. In the \nsecond half of 2001, the Democratic majority in the Senate proceeded to \nconfirm 28 judges. In the 17 months that I chaired the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee during President Bush's first term, the Senate confirmed 100 \nof his judicial nominees.\n  The Judiciary Committee's ranking Republican member was also mistaken \nlast week when he stated that Democrats sent 40 of President Bush's \njudicial nominations back to the White House in August 2001. It was the \nobjections of the Republican minority, in fact objection by the \nRepublican leader, Senator Lott, that resulted in the Senate returning \nover 40 of President Bush's nominations before the August recess to the \nWhite House.\n  Just before the Senate recessed in early August 2001, the Senate's \nDemocratic leadership requested all pending judicial nominations be \nretained through the August recess. That is right; the Democrats in the \nSenate were asking that the judicial nominations not be returned but be \nallowed to continue in place. I know; I was the Chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee at the time. In fact, the only two nominations the \nDemocratic leadership sought to return to the President were two \ncontroversial executive nominees: Mary Sheila Gall, nominated to be \nChairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and Otto J. Reich \nto be an Assistant Secretary of State. The Commerce Committee had voted \nnot to report the Gall nomination. The Reich nomination had become \nhighly controversial and the Assistant Majority Leader sought to give \nthe President an opportunity to reconsider the nomination. The proposal \nby the Democratic leadership would have continued in place every other \nnomination including every judicial nomination notwithstanding the \nSenate rule that nominations should be returned to the President when \nthe Senate recesses for a period of more than 30 days.\n  At that time it was the Republican leader, Senator Lott, who objected \nto the Democratic consent request and insisted on returning all \nnominations, including all judicial nominations, to President Bush in \nearly August. See Congressional Record Vol. 147, No. 112, S8888 (Aug. \n3, 2001). That Republican objection resulted in a strict application of \nthe Senate rules which required needless paperwork and occasioned more \nunnecessary delay in early September 2001.\n  I remember it well. In fact, in order to continue making progress on \njudicial nominations despite the action by the Senate Republican \nleader, I convened two unprecedented confirmation hearings during the \nAugust recess in 2001 for President Bush's nominees whose nominations \nwere not technically pending before the Senate. They had been returned \nto the White House in accordance with Senator Lott's objection and were \nnot renominated until the Senate reconvened in September. As Chairman, \nI convened those hearings as yet another indication of my commitment to \nfilling vacancies on the Federal courts. We had already at that time \nbeen delayed for a month in reorganizing the Senate, as well as by \nPresident Bush's decision to turn away from a 50-year-old precedent to \ndelay the American Bar Association's evaluation of a judicial nominee's \nqualifications until the nomination is made public. Even with the \nsubsequent September 11 attacks, and the anthrax attacks in the Senate, \nwe continued our work and ultimately confirmed 28 judicial nominees \nthat year, including 10 confirmations in December 2001. By contrast, in \nDecember 2009, Senate Republicans would only allow consideration of \nthree judicial nominations, returned two to the White House and carried \nover eight, including Judge Martin's, without final action.\n  There are currently more than 100 vacancies on the Federal courts \naround the country. Professor Peterson will fill one of those vacancies \nbut we must do better. The American people deserve better. The cost \nwill be felt by ordinary Americans seeking justice in our overburdened \nFederal courts.\n  I am pleased that today we will confirm Professor Peterson. When \nconfirmed, Professor Peterson will be the first woman to serve on the \nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. She earned \nher B.A. and her M.A. from the University of North Dakota and her J.D., \nwith distinction, from the University of North Dakota School of Law, \nwhere she served as editor-in-chief of the law review and was chosen by \nher professors as the ``Outstanding Graduate.''\n  After graduation, Professor Peterson clerked for U.S. District Court \nJudge Fred Van Sickle, whom she would now replace on the district \ncourt. Over the course of her 18-year legal career, Professor Peterson \nhas been a law professor and a lawyer with a diverse private practice. \nProfessor Peterson has the strong support of both home state Senators, \nSenator Murray and Senator Cantwell.\n  I congratulate Professor Peterson and her family on her confirmation \ntoday.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of \nProfessor Rosanna Malour Peterson. She is a distinguished law professor \nand attorney.\n\n[[Page S185]]\n\nShe is a woman who enjoys broad bipartisan support, and she deserves a \nseat on the Federal bench.\n  I was very pleased to introduce Professor Peterson before the \nJudiciary Committee last November and meet her and her family. I \nthought it was telling of the type of nominee she is that so many of \nher current and former students were there to support her confirmation. \nTonight I am honored to recommend that the Senate confirm Professor \nPeterson as a district court judge for the Eastern District of my home \nState.\n  Professor Peterson has strong bipartisan support with good reason. \nShe has devoted her career to serving the interests of justice and to \ninstilling those values in a future generation of leaders.\n  Professor Peterson is a graduate of the University of North Dakota, \nwhere she earned her bachelor's, master's and law degrees. After law \nschool, she started her legal career in the chambers of Judge Fred Van \nSickle in Spokane. This is the very same seat she has now been \nnominated to fill.\n  During her distinguished career, Professor Peterson has worked as an \nattorney in Spokane area law firms, for corporate and individual \nclients. She has worked in private practice, often representing \nteachers, and she has worked as a court-appointed representative for \ncriminal defendants in State and Federal court. Since 1999, Professor \nPeterson has been a law professor at the Gonzaga Law School in Spokane, \nwhere she is assistant professor of law and director of the law \nschool's externship program. At the same time, Professor Peterson has \nmaintained her private practice, where she has continued to work with \nFederal defendants on a pro bono or reduced-fee basis.\n  Professor Peterson has also played a leadership role in the \nWashington legal community, including serving as president of the \nFederal Bar Association of the Eastern District of Washington, \npresident of the Washington Women Lawyers Bar Association, and on the \njudicial selection committee that helped recommend a magistrate judge \nin 2003. In recognition of her service in 2006, she was awarded the \nSmithmoore P. Myers Professionalism Award, the Spokane County Bar \nAssociation's highest honor.\n  Professor Peterson's accomplishments stand for themselves, but I have \nalso received numerous letters and e-mails testifying to her toughness, \nher work ethic, her understanding of the law, and her advocacy on \nbehalf of her clients. I have also received many letters from her \nformer students and the people she has mentored, taught, and befriended \nover the years, letters that all say she has made a difference in the \nlives of so many in my State.\n  She clearly meets the standards of fairness, of evenhandedness, and \nadherence to the law that we expect of our Federal judges.\n  Outside of her many professional credentials, I have been impressed \nby her professionalism and decency. I know I speak on behalf of a large \nnumber in the Washington State legal community in supporting the \nnomination of Rosanna Peterson to be the next district judge for the \nEastern District of Washington.\n  I do think it is also important to note, for all my colleagues, that \nProfessor Peterson's nomination was the product of a bipartisan \nselection committee that we use in my State of Washington to get to \nwhere we are with this confirmation vote. The commission was formed and \ndid much of its work on Professor Peterson under the previous \nadministration. It has proven that it works, even as we have moved from \none administration to the next. I am proud to have created that \nselection commission and believe it is something that has served our \nState and our Federal judiciary well.\n  Therefore, it is my pleasure to recommend my colleagues confirm a \ngreat lawyer, a teacher, and a mentor who I believe will make an \nexceptional Federal judge. I urge my colleagues, this evening, to vote \nfor the confirmation of Professor Rosanna Peterson as the next district \njudge for the Eastern District of Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues, \nSenator Leahy and Senator Murray, to express support for the \nconfirmation of Professor Rosanna Peterson.\n  Professor Peterson has been nominated to be a U.S. District Judge for \nthe Eastern District of Washington. I have no doubt that she will be an \nexcellent Federal judge.\n  It is important to ensure that all branches of our government, \nincluding the judiciary, reflect diversity. If confirmed, Professor \nPeterson would be the first woman to serve on the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Washington.\n  Rosanna Peterson is currently an Assistant Professor of Law at \nGonzaga University. She teaches Evidence, Federal Jurisdiction, and \nTrial Advocacy. She also runs the law school's externship program. \nPreviously, she worked as an attorney in private practice at a number \nof Spokane law firms. She also clerked for U.S. District Court Judge \nFred Van Sickle, whom she will now replace.\n  Professor Peterson has long been recognized by her peers for her \nintellect, dedication to the law, and commitment to equal justice.\n  She has been an active member of Washington State's legal community, \nhaving served as President of the Federal Bar Association for Eastern \nWashington, President of Washington Women Lawyers State Bar Association \nand President of the Spokane County Washington Women Lawyers Bar \nAssociation.\n  I urge the Senate to confirm Professor Peterson this afternoon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we go out of \nexecutive session and that I be allowed to speak for up to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Honoring Senator Arlen Specter on His 10,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in just a few minutes, as soon as I finish \nmy remarks, we will move to vote on a judge. This will be the 10,000th \nvote of Arlen Specter. I congratulate our distinguished colleague, \nSenator Specter, as he is about to cast his 10,000th vote as a Senator. \nHe is only the 30th Senator to reach this number of five digits.\n  I have known Senator Specter for more than a quarter of a century. I \nhave read his book. The book on his life is a remarkably impressive \ntravel through his political career. He was a crime fighter as a \ndistrict attorney. As far as lawyers go, the Specter genes are pretty \ngood. The largest judgment in the history of the State of Nevada was a \njudgment his son received. His son is a prominent trial lawyer. Nevada \nknows the Specter name from more than Arlen.\n  Arlen has always been a man of honor and integrity and a tremendous \npublic servant. The State of Pennsylvania, of course, is home to some \nof our Nation's most significant political history--the Declaration of \nIndependence and the Constitution were drafted in Senator Specter's \nhometown of Philadelphia. No one has served that State longer than \nSenator Specter.\n  I congratulate my friend Arlen Specter on making this historic \nmilestone. It will make Pennsylvania proud. No one with whom I have \nserved in the Senate has a better legal mind than Arlen Specter. We \nalways look to him when there is a complex legal issue to give one of \nhis renown statements.\n  I am sorry to hold up everybody, but I wanted this night not to go \nforward without saying something about our friend, Arlen Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Rosanna Malouf Peterson, of Washington, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Washington?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr.\n\n[[Page S186]]\n\nInouye), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), and the Senator \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak of my colleague, \nSenator Arlen Specter, who tonight cast his 10,000th vote as a Member \nof the Senate. We watched history tonight. Sometimes we have a chance \nto witness history. Of course, we look forward to his many more votes, \nbut we also look behind us at some of his own personal political \nhistory as well his service here in the Senate.\n  I will offer a few remarks tonight about his service. I can say, \nafter knowing him for many years, and especially after serving with him \nfor now more than 3 years, if you go down that list of votes--all those \nrollcall votes over many years, serving the people of Pennsylvania--he \nhas had one priority with those votes: Those votes were cast on behalf \nof the people of Pennsylvania.\n  He has always been an independent voice for the people of our State. \nHe has fought a lot of battles for the people of Pennsylvania. I know \nthe people of our Commonwealth are proud of his service.\n  His public service began after he became a lawyer. He went to the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, and then to Yale Law School, and then \neventually he joined the District Attorney's Office in Philadelphia. He \nrose through that office and became the District Attorney of \nPhiladelphia. He was elected twice to that office and served 8 years.\n  He was elected to the Senate in 1980 and was reelected four times \nafter that. He was reelected in 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2004. So he has \nperformed those years of service as a Senator. Of course, it is more \nthan about years and about votes. It certainly is about the substance \nof those votes, fighting those battles, such as on behalf of the \nveterans of Pennsylvania.\n  We have had a million or more veterans, for many years, in our State. \nThose who fought our wars, those who worked in our factories, those who \nwent on to build Pennsylvania gave their first measure of devotion to \nthe country fighting on battlefields. He has always fought for them. He \nchaired the Veterans' Affairs Committee here in the Senate. He \ncontinues those battles on behalf of the veterans of Pennsylvania.\n  On health care, we could talk for a long time about the battles he \nhas fought over and over again; not only the battles he fought in the \nlast year or two as the issue was being debated in the Senate, but \nespecially the battles he fought over many years, battles on behalf of \nchildren and women, battles for health care for the vulnerable, those \nwho were poor and may not have a strong advocate other than their \nSenators or Members of Congress. So he has fought battles on health \ncare.\n  You could isolate a lot of different issues under that general \nheading, but one that comes to mind for me is the National Institutes \nof Health. No one I know of in the Senate has fought more battles for \nthe National Institutes of Health and all of the research that comes \nfrom the great work done there, and all the cures, all the ways people \nare saved because of that research at NIH.\n  He has fought battles on job creation, not only to preserve and \nprotect and create more jobs at a time of recession--such as the \nhorrific recession we have been living through and our workers and \nfamilies have been suffering through--but battles over many years, \nbattles to protect the rights of workers to organize and collectively \nbargain, battles to make sure jobs are kept in Pennsylvania instead of \ngoing overseas or somewhere else. He has fought those battles to \nprotect our workers and our jobs.\n  He has fought battles on national defense, making sure we are doing \neverything possible to keep the people of our Commonwealth and our \ncountry safe from foreign enemies, safe from terrorists, and safe from \nthose who seek to do us harm. Over many years, Arlen Specter has cast \nthose votes as well, keeping us safe and keeping us strong.\n  His independence is something that is critically important to any \nState, but especially a State such as Pennsylvania. We have a State of \nover 12 million people. We have a lot of different regions in our \nState, a lot of different constituencies, and a lot of different \nchallenges all across the State.\n  What the people of Pennsylvania expect their Senators to do is to try \ntheir best to fight their battles, to try to remain an independent \nvoice for them, not for some special interests in Washington. Arlen \nSpecter has done that for years, being that strong, consistent, \nindependent voice for the people of our State.\n  He has had a strong sense of justice from the time he was a young \nlawyer, through his service as a prosecutor making sure our streets \nwere safe in Philadelphia, and through what he has done here in the \nSenate, fighting battles for justice every day in his service in the \nSenate.\n  Finally, in a very broad sense, but a very important sense, not only \nwhen times are tough, as they are now economically, but even when times \nseem good, even when the budgets are better and people do not seem to \nbe as concerned about what the Federal Government can do to help them \nthrough a difficult period--even in those times of prosperity, he has \nalways fought for our workers and our families.\n  It is very easy for me to stand here, as someone who has watched him \nover the years in his service in this Senate--and I know as someone who \nhas served with him for more than 3 years--it is very easy for me to \nsay, without any effort at all, that those 10,000 votes he has cast \nhave been votes on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, and I believe \nfor the best interests of the people of the United States of America.\n  I commend Arlen on that tremendous vote total. I commend him also for \nhis public service, his enduring public service for the people of \nPennsylvania. I also commend his wife Joan and his family who I know \nhave supported him for many years to make sure he could help us serve \nthe people of Pennsylvania.\n  Congratulations, Arlen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague \nSenator Casey for those very generous remarks. He and I have worked \ntogether for the past 3 years plus, but beyond that we have worked \nduring his tenure as a statewide officeholder, as Auditor General and \nTreasurer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  I have not only worked with Robert Casey, Jr., but I have worked with \nRobert Casey, Sr., his distinguished father who was Governor of the \nState.\n  While we were waiting for the train to arrive--this is an unusual \nevening in the Senate because the Acela was late, and it had a number \nof Senators coming from New York and points north. The train was about \nan hour late, so the vote was kept open for their arrival, and we had a \nchance to reminisce about some of our experiences in the past, such as \nwhen I first met his father, who was a young State senator and a \ncandidate for Governor, when I was District Attorney of Philadelphia, \nand reminiscing about the controversial report his father, as Auditor \nGeneral, made in 1970 on welfare problems, and it was very \ncontroversial. Although we were of different parties at that time, I \nbacked up Auditor General Casey because I was the DA and I knew he was \nright. When his father was Governor, I was a frequent recipient of \ncalls on the need for some assistance for Pennsylvania, and the answer \nwas always yes.\n  I am delighted to be his colleague in the Senate, and I thank him for \nthose remarks.\n  While waiting for the past hour, I have been reflecting on the 10,000 \nvotes I have cast. I said to Senator Casey, it gave me a unique time \nwhere I had nothing else to do except to wait for some Senators to \narrive on the late train to vote, and I made some notes about those \nreflections.\n  Senator Menendez arrived on the train and has some comments to make, \nand I told him I would yield to him. When he has finished his \nstatement, in the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I \nintend to reflect on those 10,000 votes. So I say to people who think \nC-SPAN is about to go off, if you are interested, wait.\n  I again thank Senator Casey and defer to my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, let me first of all thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania for yielding before he \nreflects on the history of his 10,000 votes. I am sure there are many \nof great consequence he cast that he is going to reflect upon.\n  I want to echo my colleague from Pennsylvania as well, Senator \nCasey's comments about Senator Specter. I will only focus on two points \nof the many he mentioned. One is the National Institutes of Health. The \nreality is, Arlen Specter's advocacy and passion--partly from his own \npersonal experience when he has had to overcome some of his own \npersonal health challenges--has given him a real understanding of what \nthe National Institutes of Health is all about and what it means. His \nadvocacy and work there has made a huge difference in the lives of \nliterally millions of people across this country based on the research \nthat is done there that ultimately can save a life or can enhance a \nlife. That is a legacy that any one of us in the United States would \nwant to give.\n  Secondly, the other thing I respect about Senator Specter is that \nwhen he has had to cross the aisle in order to make sure he has stood \non behalf of the people of Pennsylvania and in the Nation's best \ninterests, he has done that. Nowadays, that is a lot more difficult to \nfind. Senator Specter has a history of crossing the aisle when it is \nnecessary on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania to stand by their \nside. That did not impede him from moving to whomever he could with \nwhomever he could in this body and with administrations, both present \nand past, in order to achieve those goals. I salute him in that \nrespect.\n  I appreciate Senator Specter letting me have a few minutes on an \nincredibly important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S187-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S187-S188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NOMINATION OF JUDGE JOSEPH A. GREENAWAY, JR.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination to \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit of a \ndistinguished jurist from New Jersey, Judge Joseph A. Greenaway, Jr., \nwhich seems to be blocked by some people in this Chamber yet unknown. I \nknow it is not from my side of the aisle because I have checked. So it \nis on the Republican side of the aisle. Yet Judge Greenaway fully \nembodies the respect for justice and the rule of law that we demand of \nall of our judges. He has strong bipartisan support, and his nomination \ncould easily have been taken care of this evening but for a few \nRepublicans blocking the vote.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: End the \nobstructionism. Do what is right. Let us have a vote on this eminently \nqualified, noncontroversial nominee. It is clear the obstruction of \nthis nomination is not about this nominee. He is eminently qualified. I \nwill talk about that in a moment. And it is not about what is right for \nthis Nation. It certainly is not about acting in the best interests of \na badly overburdened Federal judicial system. In fact, oddly enough, it \nis not about ideology. It is not even about Judge Greenaway or the \nother seven nominees whom our friends are delaying. It is about the \npolitics of having this President and this Congress fail, the politics \nof no, the politics of obstruction, of stopping any progress on any \nissue and almost every nominee. Our friends on the other side came to \nthe floor in the last administration, the administration of President \nBush, on countless occasions to argue for an up-or-down vote. I heard \nthat many times: ``Give us an up-or-down vote,'' demanding that a \nsimple majority of the President's nominees is all that is needed--a \nsimple majority of this Chamber. That is a position diametrically \nopposed to their position today. In fact, they went so far at that time \nto proclaim that filibusters of the President's nominations were \nunconstitutional, and they threatened what became known then as the \nnuclear option--to undo the right of Senators to filibuster a nominee. \nWell, which is it? What do my friends on the other side believe is \nright or is the question: What do they believe will work? Where is the \ncall for an up-or-down vote now from our Republican colleagues? Where \nis the argument on the unconstitutionality of filibusters now? You \ncan't have it both ways.\n\n  We can agree to disagree on some nominees on principle, and we have \nover the years. But the numbers this year belie any notion that the \nobstruction of Judge Greenaway and all the pending nominees is purely a \nmatter of principle. In this past year, our Republican colleagues have \nobstructed virtually all the President's nominees, confirming only 12 \nFederal circuit and district court nominees, the lowest number in a \nhalf century. Let me repeat that: the lowest number in a half century. \nContrast that to the 100 judicial nominees confirmed in the 17 months \nChairman Leahy chaired the Judiciary Committee during the Bush \nadministration.\n  As Chairman Leahy has pointed out on this floor, in December of 2001, \nthe first year of George W. Bush's administration, Senate Democrats \nconfirmed 10 of President Bush's nominees in December alone, leaving \nonly 4 nominations on the calendar--in the first year. All four of \nthose nominees were confirmed soon after the Senate returned the \nfollowing year, in 2002. In stark contrast, this past December, our \nRepublican colleagues left 10 judicial nominees without Senate action \nand insisted on returning 2 of them to the President for renomination.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reconsider, to end this obstructionism, \nand allow this body to exercise its constitutional authority of advice \nand consent and confirm the nomination of Joseph A. Greenaway to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He is eminently qualified \nand deserves consideration.\n  Let me close on that. At the age of 40, Justice Greenaway was \nappointed by then-President Clinton to the Federal bench, where he \nserved for over a dozen years with distinction. By the way, he got put \nthrough by unanimous consent. It wasn't even--it was by unanimous \nconsent of the Chamber when he was put on the Federal bench. He went \nthrough unanimously, out of the Judiciary Committee, for this position \non the appellate division--unanimously out of the committee.\n\n[[Page S188]]\n\n  Joe Greenaway earned a Bachelor of Arts from Columbia University, \nwhere he was honored in 1997 with the Columbia University Medal of \nExcellence and with the John Jay Award in 2003. He was an Earl Warren \nLegal Scholar at Harvard University. He clerked for the late Honorable \nVincent L. Broderick in the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. He became an assistant U.S. attorney in Newark \nand later received a promotion to become chief of the Narcotics Bureau. \nIn the private sector, he was an associate with the firm of Kramer, \nLevin, Nessen, Kamin, and Frankel and served at Johnson & Johnson as \nin-house counsel. He has an incredible background. He is chair emeritus \nof the Columbia College Black Alumni Council and has been an adjunct \nprofessor at Rutgers Law School.\n  Currently, he is an adjunct professor at the Cordozo School of Law \nand at Columbia College, where he teaches courses on trial practice and \na seminar on the Supreme Court.\n  But this is merely Judge Greenaway's impressive resume in one way--a \ndistinguished resume to say the least--but it does not do justice to \nthe man. There is an inscription over the 10th Street entrance to the \nDepartment of Justice a few blocks from here. It reads: ``Justice in \nthe life and conduct of the State is possible only as it first resides \nin the hearts and souls of men.''\n  The two qualities of justice do indeed reside in the heart and soul \nof Joe Greenaway, and he deserves a vote.\n  He grew up in Harlem in the northeast Bronx. He is accomplished and \nsuccessful, but he has always given much back. He has been instrumental \nin mentoring students and graduates, often taking them under his wing \nas law clerks or fellows. He once said:\n\n       I tell my students to work hard and work smart. Our \n     profession requires a drive to search for perfection; without \n     that goal mediocrity becomes the norm.\n\n  He has always strived for excellence. He has always taught young \nlawyers to do the same.\n  So Judge Joseph Greenaway respects the law. For all that Judge \nGreenaway stands for--for justice served; for honor and decency; for \nthe qualities and qualifications that have brought him to this place in \nhis career; for his years of service and his judicial temperament; for \nhis respect for the Constitution and precedent; for the fact that \njustice does, indeed, reside in the heart and soul of this man; for the \nfact that, in fact, he was unanimously passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee and previously, to become a district court judge, had the \nunanimous consent of this body--somehow, despite all that history and \nall that qualification, there are colleagues on the Republican side of \nthe aisle holding up this nominee.\n  I urge my colleagues to end the obstructionism and to give us a vote \nup or down. I know when we get that vote, Judge Joseph A. Greenaway \nwill be confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I \nwill continue to come to the floor to dramatize this challenge. We \ncannot have a set of circumstances under which the judiciary labors, \nespecially with eminently qualified, bipartisan candidates, because \nthere are those who want to see this President or this Congress fail. \nIt is about the Nation not failing. It is about our judicial system not \nfailing. It is not about the politics of obstructionism.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I commented a few moments ago, I \nthanked Senator Casey for the comments he made about my 10,000th vote \nand said that I would be speaking at the conclusion. But I yielded to \nthe Senator from New Jersey because my speech will be somewhat longer, \nand Senator Lautenberg has now come to the floor. I don't want to keep \nhim for a lengthy speech, so I would be glad to yield--if I may inquire \nas to how long the Senator from New Jersey will take.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would say about 10 minutes. Ten \nminutes would be more than adequate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey. I had called \nsome family, to be very personal about it--my wife, sister, aunt--and I \ndon't want them to think I am not going to speak, but for 10 minutes I \nwill yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania, and I congratulate him for having cast 10,000 votes. We \nall know Senator Specter so well, and we know that 10,000 votes cast by \nhim represents 10,000 thoughtful decisions. He is a lawyer of \ndistinction. He came to the Senate and was accorded respect for his \nviews. We have often listened to debates where Senator Specter \nparticipated and his views were always respected by others and carried \nmuch weight. He and I have gotten along over the years very well. I was \npleased to see him have the courage to switch parties because of his \nbeliefs in how this body ought to function, and we congratulate him for \nthat as well. The only disagreement we have is whether the Philadelphia \nfootball team, the Eagles, is more loved by people in the southern part \nof our State, New Jersey, or whether their loyalty is better \nappreciated by those from Pennsylvania. It depends, with me, on what \ntheir record is. I am sorry, excuse me.\n\n  But it is a pleasure to serve with Senator Specter. I am somewhat \nbehind him for the number of votes cast, but it is easy and \nparticularly when I am asked: Well, what was the vote 8,003 that you \ncast? I say: Well, I will have to check the Record. Thousands of votes \nare a lot of votes. They require a lot of decisionmaking. Once again, I \ncongratulate Senator Specter for his good decisionmaking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S188-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S188-S189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GREENAWAY NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, tonight I wish to highlight what my \ncolleague, Senator Menendez, talked about in getting on with the \nbusiness of the Senate and defining what takes place in this body, this \nplace of the people, where some say we shouldn't move quickly--we \nshouldn't move, period--on decisions that matter because, politically, \nour colleagues on the other side are determined to do whatever they can \nto bring down this administration's ability to function, including the \nmajority's ability to function.\n  I rise to talk about a target that our Republican friends have in \ntheir sight and that is Judge Joseph A. Greenaway, Jr., of New Jersey. \nHe exemplifies the dreams so many have about what can be accomplished \nin life. He is the son of a nurse and a carpenter. He rose from humble \nbeginnings to attend Columbia University and Harvard Law School.\n  Joseph Greenaway is a well-qualified judge. He served on our district \ncourt for over a decade with distinction. His credentials and \nqualifications are beyond reproach, and there is no opposition to his \nnomination to the Third Circuit Court. Yet the Republicans blocked a \nvote--not cast a vote but blocked a vote--on his confirmation tonight. \nIt is unconscionable. Let the Senate make its decision. Those on the \nother side who don't want to vote for him, let them say so. Let them \nsay it with a vote. But, no, they insist on tying things up, which has \nbeen the manner of things here for some time now, since President Obama \nhas taken office. This man and our country deserve better than what we \nare seeing.\n  Some of us in this Chamber came to Congress to move the country \nforward because we are so grateful to this Nation of ours that we want \nto make sure--and I speak for myself, but I am sure I speak for \nothers--that we are so grateful for the opportunities that befell us \nand our families. I speak from personal experience. I come from parents \nwho were brought here as immigrants when they were infants and had the \nopportunity to do well in business for a number of years after coming \nand being here for 25 years.\n  I want to do this job because I wish to help people. I know what it \nis like to be deprived of resources. It is painful. I saw it through my \nentire childhood. My father died when he was 43, without any insurance, \nwithout any help from the government to help my mother carry on while I \nwas in the Army.\n  Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have a different agenda. \nThey are focused on bringing this Chamber to a standstill. They are \nfocused on delay and stopping progress on nearly every issue. The \nfilibuster used to be reserved for only the most controversial issues \nand was meant to allow enough time for debate. Now it is being abused, \nhijacked by Republicans who are more interested in political and \nprocedural games than in legislating.\n\n[[Page S189]]\n\nWe have seen it in the health care bill, when one of our colleagues on \nthe other side said that if they can defeat the health care bill \nPresident Obama produced with the Congress, they will have presented \nthe Waterloo to President Obama's career.\n  It is terrible to have that kind of an attitude. Serve the people. \nForget about stopping things. Talk about them and come out here on the \nfloor and say why don't you want to help people. That is what we are \ntalking about. Today we see an example in the simplest form.\n  Republicans have used the filibuster over 100 times since the start \nof this Congress. They have used it to block health care reform, \nfunding for our troops, and even help for our veterans. They are using \nit to block well-qualified judges from serving on the Federal bench.\n  Republican obstructionism last year led to the lowest number of \njudicial confirmations in more than 50 years. Republicans sit on their \nhands and block the Senate from considering qualified nominees for \nmonths on end.\n  Last week, we finally had a vote on the confirmation of Beverly \nMartin to serve on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. She was \nunanimously supported in the Judiciary Committee and then forced to \nwait over 4 months on the Senate calendar for no good reason, except to \nchalk up another victory over progress. What was the final vote on her \nconfirmation? It was 97 to 0. They would not let us vote, but there was \na willingness to have everyone in the Chamber vote for her. No \nopposition, not a single dissenter.\n  Once again, we are witnessing a judge being caught in the crosshairs \nof the party of no.\n  Judge Greenaway was nominated to serve on the Third Circuit and voted \nunanimously out of the Judiciary Committee. Yet his nomination has \nlanguished for nearly 4 months. This is unreasonable. Judge Greenaway \nis an exceptional public servant and will be an excellent addition to \nthe bench. Judge Greenaway started in public service as an assistant \nU.S. attorney in Newark in 1985. He distinguished himself prosecuting \nbank fraud and white-collar crime cases before being picked to head the \nnarcotics division in the U.S. Attorney's office.\n  Since 1996, he has served on the U.S. District Court in Newark. In \nhis tenure, he has demonstrated his firm commitment to the values we \nwant to see in our judges--fairness, equity, and justice. These are the \nsame values that will make him a success on the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Judge Greenaway has spent his career protecting New Jerseyans and \ntheir rights. That is why the American Bar Association--his peers--\nrated him ``unanimously well qualified'' for this position. That is why \nit is so incomprehensible to understand why they insist on not \npermitting us a vote. Let us vote. Maybe he won't be accepted by the \nSenate. Let us vote, by gosh. We ought to confirm him without further \ndelay.\n  The Third Circuit Court has a vacancy that needs to be filled. This \nis a noncontroversial, well-qualified judge waiting and anxious to \nserve.\n  I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, stop your \nobstructionism and let this vote move forward.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I had said earlier, I intended to make \nsome comments following the speech by Senator Casey on my 10,000th \nvote. I have since deferred to Senators Menendez and Lautenberg. I \nintend to get to that speech.\n  I will make some unanimous consent requests before I speak instead of \nafter so that the clerks can go about their business and go home.\n  As I mentioned, I have told family members that I was going to \nspeak--my wife, my sister, and aunt. So it is coming. First, I will do \nsome other business of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S189-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Pamela Gavin, \nwho will retire from Office of the Secretary of the Senate on February \n1, 2010, after more than 24 years of service as the Superintendent of \nPublic Records. During that time, she and her staff have shepherded and \nsafeguarded the filing of thousands of Senate public documents, \nincluding financial disclosure reports, Federal Election Commission \ncampaign reports and lobby disclosure documents.\n  Ms. Gavin has seen numerous milestones in Senate history, including \npassage of the Lobby Disclosure Act of 1995 and the Honest Leadership \nand Open Government Act of 2007. She successfully led her team in \nimplementing new laws and providing guidance to those endeavoring to \nfollow the law. She has been a dependable, thoughtful public servant \nthroughout her career, known by her colleagues for her cheerful nature \nand clever insight. A mentor to many Senate staffers, Ms. Gavin is a \ntremendous resource to the entire Senate community.\n  During these 24 years of service, Ms. Gavin has met unusual \nchallenges and upheld her responsibilities even under the most trying \ncircumstances. During the anthrax attacks of 2001, in which Senate \nstaff were forced to vacate the Hart building for several months, she \nkept the Office of Public Records in business every day, using a small \ncorner of the Senate Library to maintain her responsibilities to the \nSenate community and to the public.\n  I am pleased to offer congratulations on such an outstanding and \naccomplished career. We are all grateful for Pam Gavin's years of \ndedicated public service. While I know that her friends and colleagues \nwill miss her greatly, I join my colleagues today in wishing her the \nvery best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S189-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S189-S190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S.

Mr. President, the world has been overwhelmed by the \nimmeasurable scale of human suffering and devastation in Haiti. My \nthoughts and prayers are with the people of Haiti, the courageous \nhumanitarian and peacekeeping workers, the countless victims, and their \nfamilies in the wake of this horrific tragedy.\n  The U.S. Government has responded with determination and resolve to \nhelp the people of Haiti. I am especially pleased with the rapid \ndeployment of U.S. military, civilian, and medical personnel to Haiti, \nthe pledge of $100 million in aid, and the work of the search and \nrescue teams. I am grateful for the role of U.S. Southern Command in \nleading the military efforts, and the vast coordinating \nresponsibilities taken on by the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment in conjunction with the Department of State. I was \nespecially heartened earlier this week by the images of a U.S. rescue \nteam surrounded by Haitians chanting ``U.S.A.!''\n  While these and other courageous efforts of countless Americans are \nhighly publicized, many Americans may not be aware of the role of U.S. \ninternational broadcasting, under the leadership of the Broadcasting \nBoard of Governors, in assisting the people of Haiti. Shortly after the \nearthquake, Voice of America began Creole broadcasts on multiple \nfrequencies in Haiti from Commando Solo, a C-130 aircraft operated by \nthe 193rd Special Operations Wing. Since then, VOA Creole service has \nbroadcast news and information on the relief efforts, utilizing \nreporters on the scene in Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas, 24 \nhours a day.\n  The VOA Creole broadcasts include public service announcements with \ninformation and statements from U.S. Government agencies, including \nUSAID and the Department of Defense, aimed at helping Haitians find \nimmediate shelter, medical assistance, and aid. There are hourly public \nsafety and relief supply updates, as well as a call-in line to \nbroadcast messages from families and friends of the injured and \nmissing. Ronald Cesar is running this program, with a small but very \ndedicated staff, and I thank all of them for their commitment to the \ndisaster relief.\n  Online, VOA has updated Twitter and Facebook feeds around the clock \nwith the latest news and information about Haiti. All this coverage is \nmaking a difference. If you searched ``Haiti'' on Google News the \nweekend after the earthquake, the first hit was of a VOA news story, \nthanks to the presence of numerous VOA stringers reporting around the \nclock from Haiti.\n  This response by VOA in Haiti is not new. It is indicative of the \ncritical role of U.S. international broadcasting has played in similar \nsituations throughout history. In 2008, when Kenya erupted into \nviolence, VOA provided one of the sole sources of credible news and \ninformation worldwide. When the 2004 tsunami devastated Indonesia, \nThailand, and countries across the Indian Ocean, VOA helped millions \nstay up to date with the international relief effort, providing news \nand valuable information on where to find assistance. The same was true \nin the 1990s in Somalia, the Balkans, and Rwanda, where VOA broadcasts \nplayed a critical role reuniting families torn apart by war and strife.\n  The free flow of information is essential to managing any crisis \nsituation, and U.S. international broadcasting has historically played, \nand continues to play, a critical role in disaster relief. It is in \nthis regard that I wish to recognize the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors, and VOA in particular, as well as all U.S. civilian, \nmilitary, and volunteer response teams for their invaluable service in \nHaiti. Their efforts demonstrate the best of America's generous spirit, \nand their compassion and dedication is making a difference to the \nmillions of people in Haiti affected by this terrible tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S190-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S190-S191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JO ANNE GOODNIGHT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize Jo Anne Goodnight, an \nextraordinary member of my staff who will shortly be leaving the Hill \nto return to her position as division of special programs director and \nSBIR/STTR program manager at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. \nJo Anne has brought tremendous enthusiasm, insight, and expertise to \nher position as a detailee for the Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship, and I am sad to see her leave.\n  Jo Anne joined my committee staff in June 2009 to help me shepherd \nthe reauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, \nand Small Business Technology Transfer, or STTR, programs through the \nSenate. These critical initiatives help move innovative ideas from mind \nto marketplace, and there is probably no one who understands the \ndetails of these programs better than Jo Anne. A recognized expert in \nher field, she began her present position at NIH in 1999, where she \nmanages and coordinates the SBIR and STTR programs for the Department \nof Health and Human Services' public health agencies, such as NIH, the \nFood and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention. In her capacity as program manager, Jo Anne has \nappeared as a witness before many congressional committees, which is \nwhy I had the utmost confidence that she would hit the ground running \nupon her arrival at the committee--and she did!\n  From her first moment here, Jo Anne established a reputation as a \nhardworking, intelligent, and dedicated staff member. She dedicated \ncountless hours preparing me to work towards a consensus to reauthorize \nthe SBIR and STTR programs with my colleagues, and she was a vocal \nleader at staff-driven meetings. She had no shortage of ideas on how \nbest to advance our interests, and was open and honest about the best \napproach to take in forging a compromise. While our work is not \ncomplete regarding a long-term reauthorization of these initiatives, Jo \nAnne has laid a tremendous foundation for our future negotiations.\n  As time went on, Jo Anne demonstrated a strong capacity for \ndeveloping new ideas, and she began aiding me with other issue areas, \nsuch as innovation and technology. Her assistance was essential in \nhelping to move a critical bill I introduced with Senator Mark Pryor on \nscience parks through the Commerce Committee. Additionally, Jo Anne \nhelped me add language to the bill encouraging the development of \nscience and research parks on bases closed by the Base Realignment and \nClosure process. I am hopeful that this language, if passed by the full \nSenate, will help communities like Brunswick, ME, redevelop quickly.\n  Jo Anne has had a remarkable career in and out of government. In \naddition to her most recent service at NIH, she worked for several \nyears at the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, as its SBIR/STTR \nprogram coordinator and the special assistant to the director of the \ndivision of cancer biology. She also has extensive research experience \nat the NIH, the FDA, the University of\n\n[[Page S191]]\n\nSouthern California, and, as an undergraduate cooperative education \nstudent from Virginia Tech, at the Department of Agriculture's Animal \nParasitology Institute in Maryland.\n  Throughout her lengthy career, Jo Anne has been the recipient of \nnumerous awards, including three NIH Director's Awards and five more \nNIH Merit Awards for dedication, initiative, and exemplary \ncontributions to various projects. Jo Anne has also won the 1996 \nOutstanding Performance Award from the NCI's division of cancer \nbiology, and the 2007 Federal Executive Institute's Certificate of \nAchievement.\n  What is most striking about Jo Anne--aside from her remarkable \nintelligence and passion for her work--is her easygoing and humorous \nnature. A true joke teller, Jo Anne loves to laugh and make others \nlaugh with her. She is a kind and generous person who is constantly \nwilling to help her coworkers in any way possible. Jo Anne always has a \nsmile on her face, and her upbeat personality makes her a pleasure to \nwork with.\n  Additionally, Jo Anne and her husband Will have a home in Lamoine, a \nsmall coastal town near Maine's beautiful Acadia National Park. They \nfind themselves driving to Maine at least once a month, and Jo Anne \nhopes to relocate there in the coming years. It is wonderful talking \nwith her about all of the great and unique places to visit in the area, \nand I am thrilled that she has fallen so deeply in love with my home \nState.\n  Jo Anne also enjoys spending time with her colleagues off the Hill. \nIn October, she organized an office chili cook-off, where members of my \nstaff brought pots of their homemade chili to Jo Anne's home. There, \nthey enjoyed a wonderful afternoon dedicated to getting to know one \nanother better while consuming numerous varieties of chili. Jo Anne was \na gracious hostess, and everyone greatly enjoyed the experience.\n  I am honored to have had someone as talented and passionate as Jo \nAnne Goodnight on my staff. Jo Anne brings a visible sense of \ndedication and professionalism to the job every day, and her \ncommendable work ethic and incredible creativity are sources of pride. \nI wish Jo Anne and her family the best of luck as she transitions back \nto the NIH, and look forward to seeing her in Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S191-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              2010 CENSUS\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I commemorate the launch of the 2010 \nDecennial Census in Noorvik, AK, and thank the U.S. Census bureau for \nthe honor of kicking off this decade's census. Our State is honored to \nonce again have this privilege. I am proud our country is acknowledging \nthe contributions of all its citizens by beginning this historic count \nin a small, rural village in Alaska.\n  Noorvik is a rural community in the Northwest Arctic Borough of \nAlaska with a population of 642 residents. Because there are no roads \nlinking the community to the rest of the State, it is only accessible \nby plane or shallow-draft vessel. The majority of the population \nconsists of Inupiaq Eskimo residents primarily working as miners, \nconstruction workers, teachers, and public administrators. Noorvik may \nbe a small town, but its residents contribute a great deal to Alaska's \ninfrastructure and industry. Therefore, it is important the decennial \ncount begin in this small yet significant community. The Census will \nalso provide several thousand jobs for Alaskans, who will be travelling \nto remote areas to collect accurate data from our most remote regions.\n  The U.S. Census is a valuable and time-honored tradition. Its roots \ncan be traced back to article 1, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, \nwhere the founders of our democracy stated, ``The actual Enumeration \nshall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the \nCongress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten \nYears.'' When our Nation was founded, the Census was a way to determine \nthe number of each State's delegation in the House of Representatives. \nSince then, the Census has become more than a mechanism for allotting \ncongressional seats, but also provides policymakers with the data they \nneed to better serve Americans.\n  I thank the U.S. Census Bureau for launching the 2010 Decennial \nCensus in Noorvik, AK. This is a great opportunity to reach out to \nrural Alaska and honor our State's rich cultural heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S191-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                IDAHO WHEAT COMMISSION 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to recognize \nthe Idaho Wheat Commission, which celebrated its 50th anniversary \nrecently. The Idaho Wheat Commission was founded in 1959 and has been a \nleader in the wheat industry, working on behalf of Idaho's wheat \ngrowers and providing them with an invaluable service. Wheat is one of \nIdaho's top five commodities; it is grown in nearly every county; and \nIdaho is ranked 10th in national production of wheat. The Idaho Wheat \nCommission engages in research, market development, consumer education \nand much more on behalf of Idaho wheat growers.\n  The Idaho Wheat Commission funds research and provides science-based \ninformation to Idaho wheat growers concerning topics such as improved \nwheat variety, pest management and best practices. Research and \ninformation on these and many other topics help Idaho Wheat growers \nremain competitive and profitable. The Idaho Wheat Commission also aids \ngrowers by playing an important role in the development of markets at \nhome and overseas, which helps Idaho growers find new and emerging \nmarkets for their wheat. More than 50 percent of Idaho's wheat crop is \nexported to over 90 other countries around the world.\n  The Idaho Wheat Commission, along with the University of Idaho \nExtension, the Idaho Grain Producer Association and the Idaho Barley \ncommission, sponsors Cereal Schools in many different Idaho counties. \nThese schools educate and update growers on various issues, such as \nresults from new studies and trials or current legislative issues. They \nalso conduct Wheat Quality Workshops twice a year where growers get a \nhands-on education on the importance of growing quality wheat.\n  Because of their many excellent educational and informational \nprograms, the Idaho Wheat Commission has had, and will continue to \nhave, a positive influence on the Idaho wheat industry. The Idaho Wheat \nCommission has been working for Idaho's wheat growers for 50 years, \nhelping to fund research and education and to develop new markets for \ngrowers. In their first 50 years, they have succeeded at this and much \nmore. Congratulations to the Idaho Wheat Commission for 50 years of \nsupporting the growers of one of Idaho's most important crops. I look \nforward to its next 50.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S191-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GEORGE FRAZIER\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a man who I \nam proud to call a fellow Arkansan. Hope native George Frazier, 91, \nembodies Arkansas and the values we hold so close to our hearts: \ncommunity, family, and faith. Earlier this month, George was honored by \nhis fellow Kiwanis Club members in Hope for 62 years of service in the \norganization.\n  Known by some as ``Mr. Hope, Arkansas,'' George and his wife Effie \nhave touched countless members of the Hope community, including former \nPresident Bill Clinton, who telephoned George on his 75th birthday to \nthank him for the positive impact he had on his life. George is such an \nintegral part of his community that the local newspaper, The Hope Star, \nrecently penned a series of articles in his honor.\n  I salute George Frazier and all residents of Hope for their strong \nsense of Arkansas values and community pride. Renowned for its annual \nwatermelon festival, Hope is often said to be ``a slice of the good \nlife.'' I couldn't agree more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S191-4", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S191-S192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO MAJOR STEVEN HALL AND CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER RICKY BULLINGER\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I honor two brave Arkansas \nGuardsmen who risked their lives to rescue a citizen in need. Maumelle \nresident Major Steven Hall, a native of Rector, and Chief Warrant \nOfficer Ricky Bullinger of North Crossett recently received the\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\nSoldier's Medal, the highest award for heroism not involving combat, \nfor risking their lives to rescue a woman who was being electrocuted \nunderneath a hotel dock on Lake Hamilton in Arkansas.\n  On August 23, 2008, Hall and Bullinger had spent the day at a \ntraining workshop, later joining their families to boat on Lake \nHamilton. Before long, they heard cries for help from two families \nnearby on the water and immediately went to their aid.\n  Both Hall and Bullinger jumped into the water, quickly finding it to \nbe full of electricity from a nearby streetlight. The pair spent 15 \nminutes diving for a woman trapped in the water. Eventually, their \nefforts were successful as they pulled her from the lake. Not everyone \nwas saved, however. A 14-year-old girl lost her life that day.\n  I salute these two brave servicemen. My father and both grandfathers \nserved our Nation in uniform and taught me from an early age about the \nsacrifices our troops and their families make to keep our Nation free. \nAll of our service men and women from the Greatest Generation to \nVietnam war veterans to the new generation of servicemembers in the \nMiddle East and across the globe have sacrificed greatly on behalf of \nour country and local communities.\n  It is the responsibility of our Nation to provide the tools necessary \nto care for our country's servicemembers and honor the commitment our \nNation has made to them. During these tough economic times, it is even \nmore important that we don't shortchange our veterans. It is the least \nwe can do for those whom we owe so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S192-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING BOONE AND NEWTON COUNTIES\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I recognize Boone and \nNewton Counties, in my home State of Arkansas, for their efforts to \ncreate communities where children and their families have access to \nhealthy, affordable foods and safe places to play and exercise. These \ncounties, through the North Arkansas Partnership for Health Education, \nNAPHE, recently received a $360,000 grant from the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation's ``Healthy Kids: Healthy Communities'' program.\n  The funding will help local officials and organizations create \npolicies that encourage active lifestyles for children and healthier \neating habits for all residents in Boone and Newton Counties. The \nproject will create a walking path to connect the south side of Lake \nHarrison to the schools and grocery stores to the north and will \ndevelop a system to deliver healthy foods to underserved neighborhoods \nand more remote parts of the counties.\n  According to Rick Hinterthuer, NAPHE executive director, ``our \ncommunity model is extremely efficient and effective. If we can do it \nin Harrison, it can be done in other places. We reach our community \nbest through the Home Town Health Coalitions of Boone and Newton \nCounties.''\n  I have had the pleasure of visiting the Boone County Hometown Health \nImprovement Coalition. The program is a model for the rest of the \ncountry and illustrates how a community can leverage its resources to \naddress community health issues through local, State, regional and \nnational partnerships.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry, I have fought to include funding to provide meals to needy \nchildren during summer months, to secure grants for States to modernize \ntheir school lunch delivery systems, to improve health outcomes for \ninfants participating in the WIC Program, and to promote the health of \nyoung children in early childhood settings.\n  I salute the good work going on in Harrison and North Arkansas to \nhelp keep our youngest citizens healthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S192-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES WILSON\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \ntoday to recognize an armchair explorer who never left the Northeast \nbut brought the world to the United States. In 1809-1810 in the town of \nBradford, VT, Mr. James Wilson fashioned the first terrestrial and \ncelestial globes made in the United States. In doing so Mr. Wilson gave \nto all Americans an invaluable tool that would be used for centuries to \ncome.\n  A self-taught and passionate cartographer, James Wilson started the \nfirst geographic globe factory in Bradford. He achieved such great \nsuccess that soon after he and his sons opened a second factory in \nAlbany, NY. Wilson Globes set the standard by which all other globes \nwere measured, achieving such perfection that in 1827 he argued to \nCongress there was no longer a need to import them from abroad.\n  The accomplishments of James Wilson and his sons are treasured in the \npicturesque town of Bradford. So much so that the Bradford Historical \nSociety commissioned the Williamstown Art Conservator to repair the \nhistorical society's Wilson globe--one of the few remaining in the \nworld. Funds for this project were received from across the Nation. \nUnderstandably, the town takes great pride in this small piece of \nhistory that they can call their own. Although Mr. Wilson only ever saw \na few hundred miles of this great country, he was responsible for \nbringing the world to most Americans. We applaud James Wilson for the \nlegacy he left us.

Res. 396\n\n       Whereas article I, section 5 of the United States \n     Constitution provides that ``Each House may determine the \n     Rules of its Proceedings'';\n       Whereas it is a longstanding common law principle, upheld \n     in Supreme Court decisions, that one legislature cannot bind \n     subsequent legislatures;\n       Whereas rule V of the Standing Rules of the Senate states \n     that ``the Rules of the Senate shall continue from one \n     Congress to the next unless they are changed as provided in \n     these rules'';\n       Whereas rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate \n     requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds of Senators \n     present and voting to limit debate on a measure or motion to \n     amend the Senate Rules; and\n       Whereas rule V and rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, taken together, can effectively deny the Senate the \n     opportunity to exercise its constitutional right to determine \n     the Rules of its Proceedings under article I, section 5, thus \n     allowing one Congress to bind its successors; Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That upon the expiration of the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate at the Sine Die Adjournment of the 111th Congress, \n     the Senate shall proceed in accordance with article I, \n     section 5 of the Constitution to determine the Rules of its \n     Proceedings by a simple majority vote.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, it is with great humility and \nrespect for the institution of the Senate, reverence for the many great \nmen and women who have served here, and affection for my colleagues \nthat I rise today to discuss what I believe is an issue of great \nimportance.\n  Reflecting on my first year as a Member of this body, I have come to \nbelieve that we are failing to represent the best interests of the \nAmerican people. We as elected representatives have a duty to our \nconstituents. But partisan rancor and the Senate's own incapacitating \nrules often prevent us from fulfilling that duty.\n  While I am convinced that our inability to function is our own fault, \nwe have the authority within the Constitution to act. Article I, \nsection 5, of our Constitution states in clear language that ``Each \nHouse may determine the rules of its proceedings. . . .''\n  Yet at the beginning of the 111th Congress, we implicitly acquiesced \nto the rules adopted decades and sometimes more than a century ago, \nrules that most Members of this Senate have never voted to adopt.\n  Today these rules put in place generations ago make effective \nlegislating nearly impossible. Specifically, under rule XXII, it is not \npossible to limit debate, end a filibuster, invoke cloture without 60 \nvotes. Such cloture votes used to occur perhaps seven or eight times \nduring a congressional session. But in the 110th Congress alone, there \nwere 112 cloture votes, and most of these were occasioned simply by the \nthreat of a filibuster.\n  The American people spoke loudly in the 2008 election. They clearly \ndesired a President and a Congress that would set a new direction. It \nwas not necessarily an endorsement of one ideology over another but \ninstead a call for us to put partisanship aside and to take care of the \ncountry's business.\n  Although this Chamber was able to pass historic health care \nlegislation last year, we are far from finished. More than anything, \nwhat the health care debate has demonstrated is how difficult the rules \nhave made our legislative process. And it is not just health care. \nOther important pieces of legislation still languish, Federal judicial \nvacancies remain unfilled, and many of the President's appointees to \nkey positions are still not confirmed. The American people deserve \nbetter.\n  I applaud Leader Reid for what he has been able to accomplish, given \nthe way this Chamber's rules have been used to impede progress. Senate \nrules are designed to allow for substantive debate and to protect the \nviews of the minority, as our Founders intended. But they have been \nused instead to prevent the Senate from beginning to even debate \ncritical legislation.\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\n  Protecting the views of the minority makes sense, but not at the \nexpense of the will of the majority. Indeed, as the rules are being \nused today, a single Senator can hold a bill hostage until his or her \ndemands are met. This is not the spirit of compromise and collegiality \nour Founders envisioned for this body.\n  Even worse, the rules as they exist today make any effort to change \nthem a daunting process. Under the current Standing Rules of the \nSenate, rule V states:\n\n       The Rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to \n     the next unless they are changed as provided in these rules.\n\n  As adopted in 1975, rule XXII requires two-thirds of Senators present \nand voting to agree to end debate on a change to the Senate rules, in \nmost cases 67 votes. Taken together, these two rules effectively deny \nthe Senate the opportunity to exercise its constitutional right to \ndetermine the rules of its proceedings and serve to bind this body to \nrules adopted by its predecessors.\n  Many of my colleagues will argue that the Senate is not designed to \nbe efficient, that the use of filibusters and delay tactics was what \nthe Founders intended. They will quote George Washington's comment to \nThomas Jefferson that the Framers created the Senate to cool House \nlegislation, just as a saucer was used to cool hot tea. While I \nunderstand their argument, I do not believe that the Framers envisioned \nthe Senate as the graveyard for good ideas. We can have lengthy debate \nabout the merits of legislation, but there should come a time when we \nactually vote on the bill. We can discuss the qualifications of a \njudicial nominee, but each nominee deserves an up-or-down vote. To \nquote one of this body's most esteemed Members, Senator Henry Cabot \nLodge:\n\n       To vote without debating is perilous, but to debate and \n     never vote is imbecile.\n\n  This is a bipartisan issue. I express my opinions today as a member \nof the majority. But they will not change if I become a member of the \nminority party.\n  We are all too aware of the power of rule XXII, the filibuster rule, \nadopted in 1975. Yet except for the distinguished Senators Byrd, \nInouye, and Leahy, none of us--Republicans or Democrats alike--has ever \nvoted to adopt this rule.\n  Opponents of rules reform argue that the Senate is a continuing body \nand, therefore, the rules must remain in effect from one Congress to \nthe next. I disagree with this assertion. Even if the Senate is deemed \nto have continued because two-thirds of its Members remain in office, \nthere is no reason that the rules must remain in effect.\n  Many things change with a new Congress. It is given a new number. All \nof the pending bills and nominations from the previous Congress are \ndead, and each party may choose its leadership. If the party in the \nmajority changes, the new Senate becomes substantially different from \nthe last.\n  Senators of both parties have argued that the rules may change with a \nnew Congress, as my esteemed colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, stated \nin a National Review article in 2005:\n\n       The Senate has been called a ``continuing body.'' Yet \n     language reflecting this observation was included in Senate \n     rules only in 1959. The more important, and much older, sense \n     in which the Senate is a continuing body is its ongoing \n     constitutional authority to determine its rules. Rulings by \n     vice presidents of both parties, sitting as the President of \n     the Senate, confirm that each Senate may make that decision \n     for itself, either implicitly by acquiescence or explicitly \n     by amendment. Both conservative and liberal legal scholars, \n     including those who see no constitutional problems with the \n     current filibuster campaign, agree that a simple majority can \n     change Senate rules at the beginning of a new Congress.\n\n  I agree with Senator Hatch. And I agree with our good friend Senator \nTed Kennedy who said:\n\n       The notion that a filibuster can be used to defeat an \n     attempt to change the filibuster rule cannot withstand \n     analysis. It would impose an unconstitutional prior restraint \n     on the parliamentary procedure in the Senate. It would turn \n     rule XXII into a Catch-XXII.\n\n  The early history of this body suggests that the use of unlimited \ndebate as a tool of obstruction was not an issue.\n  The original Senate rules adopted under article I, section 5, of the \nConstitution included a provision allowing a Senator to make a motion \n``for the previous question.'' If passed, the motion allowed a simple \nmajority of Senators to halt debate on a pending issue. This simple \nrule for limiting debate was inadvertently dropped in 1806--perhaps for \nlack of need--and the Senate entered a period with no means to limit \ndebate. It was not until the 1830s that the Senate saw the first \nfilibusters, as Members recognized that the lack of any rule to limit \ndebate could be used to effectively block legislation opposed by even a \nminority of the minority. It was not, however, until 1917 that the \nSenate adopted a formal cloture rule.\n  Woodrow Wilson's armed ships bill had just been filibustered by 11 \nSenators. The President was furious, demanding a change in Senate \nprocedural rules. In response, Montana Senator Thomas Walsh, citing \narticle I, section 5, of the Constitution introduced the constitutional \noption.\n  Walsh argued that a newly convened Senate was not bound by the rules \nof the previous Senate and could adopt its own rules, including a rule \nto limit debate. He reasoned that every new Senate had the right to \nadopt rules, saying that ``it is preposterous to assume that [the \nSenate] may deny future majorities the right to change'' the rules. In \nresponse to Walsh's proposal, the Senate reached a compromise and \namended rule XXII. The compromise permitted cloture on any pending \nmeasure at the will of two-thirds of all Senators present and voting.\n  Back then, the toxic partisanship we face today had not yet poisoned \nthe system, but the manipulative use of the filibuster had already \ntaken hold. It was used to block some of the most important legislation \nof that time--anti-lynching bills in 1922, 1935, and 1938, and anti-\nrace discrimination bills were blocked almost a dozen times starting in \n1946.\n  By the 1950s, a bipartisan group of Senators had had enough. On \nbehalf of himself and 18 other Senators, New Mexico's Clinton Anderson, \nmy predecessor, attempted to limit debate and control the use of a \nfilibuster by adopting the 1917 strategy of Thomas Walsh. Just as \nSenator Walsh did almost four decades earlier, Senator Anderson argued \nthat each new Congress brings with it a new Senate entitled to consider \nand adopt its own rules. On January 3, 1953, Anderson moved that the \nSenate immediately consider the adoption of rules for the Senate of the \n83rd Congress.\n  Anderson's motion was tabled, but he introduced it again at the \nbeginning of the 85th Congress. In the course of that debate, Senator \nHubert Humphrey presented a parliamentary inquiry to Vice President \nNixon, who was presiding over the Senate. Nixon understood the inquiry \nto address the basic question, ``Do the rules of the Senate continue \nfrom one Congress to another?'' Noting that there had never been a \ndirect ruling on this question from the Chair, Nixon stated that:\n\n       While the rules of the Senate have been continued from one \n     Congress to another, the right of a current majority of the \n     Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own \n     rules, stemming as it does from the constitution itself, \n     cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a \n     majority of a previous Congress. Any provision of Senate \n     rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed \n     or practical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in \n     a new Congress the right to adopt the rules under which it \n     desires to proceed is, in the opinion of the Chair, \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  Nixon's opinion was consistent with the longstanding common law \nprinciple, upheld in Supreme Court decisions, that one legislature \ncannot bind subsequent legislatures.\n  Nixon went on to explain that under the Constitution, a new Senate \nhad three options to deal with the rules at the beginning of a new \nCongress: No. 1, proceed under the rules of the previous Congress and \n``thereby indicate by acquiescence that those rules continue in \neffect''; No. 2, vote down a motion to adopt new rules and thereby \n``indicate approval of the previous rules''; and No. 3, ``vote \naffirmatively to proceed with the adoption of new rules.''\n  Despite Nixon's opinion from the chair, Anderson's motion was tabled. \nIn 1959, Anderson raised the constitutional option again at the start \nof the 86th Congress, with the support of some 30 other Senators. This \ntime, he raised the ire of then-Majority Leader Johnson, who realized \nthat a majority of Senators might join Anderson's cause. To prevent \nAnderson's motion from receiving a vote, Johnson came forward\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\nwith his own compromise--changing rule XXII to reduce the required vote \nfor cloture to ``two-thirds of Senators present and voting.'' And to \nappease a small group of Senators, Johnson also included new language \nthat stated that the rules continued from one Congress to the next \nunless they were changed under the rules. It was a move that would \neffectively bind all future Senates.\n  Throughout his career, Clinton Anderson relied on the constitutional \noption as the basis to ease or at least reconsider the cloture \nrequirements laid out in rule XXII. As he said in 1959:\n  My motion does not prejudge the nature of the rules which the Senate \nin its wisdom may adopt, but it does declare in effect that the Senate \nof the 85th Congress is responsible for and must bear the \nresponsibility for the rules under which the Senate will operate. That \nresponsibility cannot be shifted back upon the Senate of past \nCongresses.\n  In 1975, 2 years after Anderson left office, the Senate adopted the \nrule we operate under today: It takes the vote of ``three-fifths of all \nSenators duly chosen and sworn'' to cut off debate or the threat of \nunlimited debate.\n  As the junior Senator from New Mexico, I have the honor of serving in \nSenator Clinton Anderson's former seat, and I have the desire to take \nup his commitment to the Senate and his dedication to the principle \nthat in each new Congress, the Senate should exercise its \nconstitutional power to determine its own rules. Let me be very clear. \nI am not arguing for or against any specific changes to the rules, but \nI do believe each Senate has the right, according to the Constitution, \nto determine all of its rules by a simple majority vote.\n  As my distinguished colleague Senator Byrd, the longest serving \nMember in the history of Congress, once said:\n\n       The Constitution in article 1, section 5, says that each \n     House shall determine the rules of its proceedings. Now we \n     are at the beginning of Congress. This Congress is not \n     obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past.\n\n  It is time for reform. There are many great traditions in this body \nthat should be kept and respected, but stubbornly clinging to \nineffective and unproductive procedures should not be one of them. \nThere is another way.\n  The resolution I am introducing today is simple. It would enable the \n112th Congress to carry out its responsibility to determine the rules \nof its proceedings in accordance with the Constitution. This is not to \nsay that between now and the beginning of the 112th Congress we cannot \nuse our political will to find a way to avoid the gridlock of 2009. It \nis to say that at the beginning of the 112th Congress, the Senate can \nexercise its constitutional right to adopt its rules of procedure by a \nsimple majority vote. The Senate may choose to adopt new rules or it \nmay choose to continue with some or all of the rules of the previous \nCongress. The point is, it is our choice. It is our responsibility.\n  As Clinton Anderson said:\n\n       It is a responsibility that cannot be shifted back upon the \n     Senate of past Congresses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S200-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3306.

Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 2949, which \nwas introduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2949) to amend section 1113 of the Social \n     Security Act to provide authority for increased fiscal year \n     2010 payments for temporary assistance to United States \n     citizens returned from foreign countries, to provide \n     necessary funding to avoid shortfalls in the Medicare cost-\n     sharing program for low-income qualifying individuals, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join in today with my colleagues \nSenators Bill Nelson, Bob Menendez, George LeMieux, and Chuck Grassley \nin support of the Emergency Aid to American Survivors of the Haiti \nEarthquake Act. This bill will provide much-needed resources to the \nUnited States Repatriation Program, which is currently assisting U.S. \ncitizens who are returning home from Haiti.\n  The United States Repatriation Program was established by title XI, \nsection 1113 of the Social Security Act to provide temporary assistance \nto U.S. citizens and their dependents who have been identified by the \nDepartment of State as having returned, or been brought from a foreign \ncountry to the U.S. because of destitution, illness, war, threat of \nwar, or a similar crisis.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services works with State and \nlocal governments to administer the Repatriation Program and provide \nvital services such as immediate medical care, temporary lodging and \ntravel, and food assistance to returning Americans in need. The Federal \nGovernment reimburses States for the full cost of providing these \nservices and individuals who receive aid are expected to repay it \nexcept in the case of extreme hardship.\n  The Repatriation Program is currently being used by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to provide assistance to citizens returning \nfrom Haiti as a result of last week's devastating earthquake.\n  But, funding for this important program is capped at $1 million per \nyear, which will not cover the cost states have already incurred to \nprovide support for the more than 14,000 Americans who have already \nreturned from Haiti. And the State Department expects between 600 and \n2,000 more Americans will continue to return from Haiti each day in the \ncoming months. They too will need the vital services this program \nprovides.\n  As a result, we have been asked by the Department of Health and Human \nServices to increase the cap for this fiscal year so that the program \ncan continue to provide these vital services to Americans returning \nhome from Haiti.\n  This bill will answer the Department's call for help by raising the \ncap for fiscal year 2010 to $25 million.\n  In the past Congress has passed similar measures to aid Americans \nreturning home from abroad during times of crisis. In 2006, for \nexample, Congress raised the $1 million annual limit to accommodate \nAmericans returning home from the devastation in Lebanon. During the \ngulf war, the annual limit was waived entirely. These measures proved \nto be simple and successful solutions to help bring Americans home \nsafely and give them the support they need to get back on their feet.\n  This bill is modeled closely off those measures and we have worked \nwith the Department of Health and Human Services and other government \nagencies in creating this bill.\n  Additionally, this legislation will provide additional funding for \nthe Qualified Individual Program, which pays the Medicare Part B \npremium costs for low-income seniors here at home.\n  Like the Repatriation Program, the Qualified Individual Program is \nalso subject to annual spending caps. Without additional funding for \n2010, this program will see shortfalls in approximately two dozen \nStates.\n  This legislation will provide $65 million in additional funding for \nthe Qualified Individual Program to ensure all States are able to \nprovide this critical assistance to seniors this year.\n  The entire cost of this legislation, $60 million, is fully paid for \nthrough the Medicaid improvement fund.\n  This legislation is a reasonable and fiscally responsible solution \nthat will allow these programs to meet their obligations to Americans \nin need. We urge the Senate to pass this bill and send it to the House \nfor immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\n  We should not allow these important resources to be denied or \nneedlessly delayed.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Res. 373) was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3307) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       In the sixteenth whereas clause of the preamble, strike \n     ``haven'' and insert ``have''.\n\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, as amended, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 373\n\n       Whereas dating, domestic, and sexual violence affect women \n     regardless of their age, and teens and young women are \n     especially vulnerable;\n       Whereas, approximately 1 in 3 adolescent girls in the \n     United States is a victim of physical, emotional, or verbal \n     abuse from a dating partner, a figure that far exceeds \n     victimization rates for other types of violence affecting \n     youth;\n       Whereas nationwide, 1 in 10 high school students (9.9 \n     percent) has been hit, slapped, or physically hurt on purpose \n     by a boyfriend or girlfriend;\n       Whereas more than 1 in 4 teenagers have been in a \n     relationship where a partner is verbally abusive;\n       Whereas 20 percent of teen girls exposed to physical dating \n     violence did not attend school because the teen girls felt \n     unsafe either at school, or on the way to or from school, on \n     1 or more occasions in a 30-day period;\n       Whereas violent relationships in adolescence can have \n     serious ramifications for victims by putting the victims at \n     higher risk for substance abuse, eating disorders, risky \n     sexual behavior, suicide, and adult revictimization;\n       Whereas being physically and sexually abused leaves teen \n     girls up to 6 times more likely to become pregnant and more \n     than 2 times as likely to report a sexually transmitted \n     disease;\n       Whereas nearly 3 in 4 children ages 11 to 14 (referred to \n     in this preamble as ``tweens''), say that dating \n     relationships usually begin at age 14 or younger and about 72 \n     percent of eighth and ninth graders report ``dating'';\n       Whereas 1 in 5 tweens say their friends are victims of \n     dating violence and nearly \\1/2\\ of tweens who are in \n     relationships know friends who are verbally abused;\n       Whereas more than 3 times as many tweens (20 percent) as \n     parents of tweens (6 percent) admit that parents know little \n     or nothing about the dating relationships of tweens;\n       Whereas teen dating abuse most often takes place in the \n     home of 1 of the partners;\n       Whereas a majority of parents surveyed believe they have \n     had a conversation with their teen about what it means to be \n     in a healthy relationship, but the majority of teens surveyed \n     said that they have not had a conversation about dating abuse \n     with a parent in the past year;\n       Whereas digital abuse and ``sexting'' is becoming a new \n     frontier for teen dating abuse;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 teens in a relationship say they have been \n     called names, harassed, or put down by their partner through \n     cellphones and texting;\n       Whereas 3 in 10 young people have sent or received nude \n     pictures of other young people on their cell or online, and \n     61 percent who have ``sexted'' report being pressured to do \n     so at least once;\n       Whereas targets of digital abuse are almost 3 times as \n     likely to contemplate suicide as those who have not \n     encountered such abuse (8 percent vs. 3 percent), and targets \n     of digital abuse are nearly 3 times more likely to have \n     considered dropping out of school;\n       Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners \n     has been shown to be greater in cases where the pattern of \n     violence has been established in adolescence;\n       Whereas primary prevention programs are a key part of \n     addressing teen dating violence and many successful community \n     examples include education, community outreach, and social \n     marketing campaigns that also understand the cultural \n     appropriateness of programs;\n       Whereas skilled assessment and intervention programs are \n     also necessary for youth victims and abusers; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Teen Dating Violence \n     Awareness and Prevention Month will benefit schools, \n     communities, and families regardless of socioeconomic status, \n     race, or sex: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of February 2010, as ``National \n     Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month'';\n       (2) supports communities to empower teens to develop \n     healthier relationships; and\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States, including \n     youth and parents, schools, law enforcement, State and local \n     officials, and interested groups to observe National Teen \n     Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month with \n     appropriate programs and activities that promote awareness \n     and prevention of the crime of teen dating violence in their \n     communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S203-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S203-S204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE COLORADO NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Res. 395\n\n       Whereas, on January 23, 1860, the history of the Colorado \n     National Guard began when the first General Assembly of the \n     Jefferson Territory authorized the formation of 2 independent \n     militia companies, the Jefferson Rangers and the Denver \n     Guards, both of which were disbanded after the Colorado \n     Volunteers were established as the official Colorado \n     Territorial Militia;\n       Whereas after Colorado became a State in 1876, the Colorado \n     State Militia was activated on dozens of occasions to protect \n     public rights, safety, and property;\n       Whereas during World War I, nearly all units of the \n     Colorado National Guard were called into service, serving as \n     replacements on the front lines as well as carrying out \n     crucial artillery support roles in most of the major \n     campaigns near the end of the war;\n       Whereas during World War II, Colorado National Guard units \n     served in both the European and Pacific theaters, providing \n     crucial indirect fire support throughout the Pacific, \n     significantly contributing to the invasion of Italy and \n     southern France, and partaking in the liberation of the \n     Dachau concentration camp in April 1945;\n       Whereas a year prior to the establishment of the United \n     States Air Force in September 1947, the 120th Tactical \n     Reconnaissance Squadron (Fighter) was federally recognized \n     and redesignated as the 120th Fighter Squadron (Single-\n     Engine), thus becoming the first federally recognized unit of \n     the Air National Guard;\n       Whereas the Colorado National Guard was called into Federal \n     service in 1950 during the Korean War and in 1961 during the \n     Berlin Crisis;\n       Whereas in 1968, the 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the \n     Colorado Air National Guard became one of the first Air \n     National Guard units to be mobilized and the first of 4 \n     fighter units to be deployed for combat operations in the \n     Vietnam War;\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S204, January 25, 2010, the Record reads: Whereas in \n1968, in response to the USS Pueblo incident, the 120th Tactical \nFighter Squadron of the Colorado Air National . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Whereas in 1968, \nthe 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the Colorado Air National \nGuard became one of the first Air National . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n       Whereas in 1990 and 1991, the Colorado National Guard was \n     called into Federal service to support Operation Desert \n     Shield/Storm in the Persian Gulf and enforce the United \n     Nations-mandated no-fly zone over Iraq during Operations \n     Northern and Southern Watch;\n       Whereas the Colorado National Guard was called into Federal \n     service in 1994 to help provide stability in Haiti and in \n     1999 as part of Operation Joint Forge in the Balkans;\n       Whereas in recent years, the Colorado National Guard has \n     supported various anti-drug and search-and-rescue missions \n     and assisted the citizens of Colorado during numerous natural \n     disasters and State emergencies;\n       Whereas hours after the attack on the World Trade Center \n     and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, the Colorado National \n     Guard was activated to bolster airport security at 14 major \n     airports across the State and the Pueblo Chemical Depot, with \n     Colorado Guardsmen, as part of Operation Noble Eagle, \n     launching the first defensive aircraft over the city of \n     Denver within minutes of the terrorist attacks and initiating \n     the Air Sovereignty Alert mission, which continues today with \n     airmen and aircraft on alert 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, \n     to protect our Nation from aerial threats;\n       Whereas since September 11, 2001, more than 6,500 Colorado \n     National Guard members have served in Iraq and Afghanistan in \n     support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, \n     with more than 550 Colorado National Guard members currently \n     deployed in support of both missions and another 160 members \n     preparing for mobilization;\n       Whereas the 3rd Battalion of the 157th Field Artillery \n     Regiment, which traces its lineage back to the Civil War, is \n     currently deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and \n     is the largest Colorado Army National Guard unit to deploy \n     since World War II;\n       Whereas in 1985, the Colorado National Guard established \n     the High-Altitude Army Aviation Training Site (HAATS) to \n     instruct rotary wing aviators on how to better operate in \n     hostile, high-altitude, and power-limited environments;\n       Whereas HAATS is the only United States military school \n     teaching such specialized techniques and has provided \n     critical training to helicopter aviators in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan;\n       Whereas in 1993, the Colorado National Guard was among the \n     first to form a partnership under the auspices of the State \n     Partnership Program with the Republic of Slovenia, and in \n     2002, formed a second partnership with the Hashemite Kingdom \n     of Jordan;\n       Whereas the more than 3,700 citizen soldiers of the \n     Colorado Army National Guard are based in 20 communities \n     across Colorado, and the more than 1,500 citizen airmen of \n     the Colorado Air National Guard are based at Buckley Air \n     Force Base in Aurora, Colorado, as well as in Greeley and \n     Colorado Springs, Colorado;\n       Whereas the citizen soldiers and airmen of the Colorado \n     National Guard have served with courage and selflessness and \n     have earned the respect and gratitude of Coloradans and all \n     Americans; and\n       Whereas the Colorado National Guard continues to build on \n     its heritage as a ready, reliable, and relevant community-\n     based force that is always ready and always there, whether to \n     protect our homeland against attacks, to support civil \n     authorities, or to defend freedom overseas: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 150th anniversary of the founding of the \n     Colorado National Guard and its exemplary service to the \n     State of Colorado and the Nation;\n       (2) thanks the members of the Colorado National Guard and \n     their families for their service and their sacrifice on \n     behalf of the State of Colorado and the Nation;\n       (3) pledges its continued support in providing the Colorado \n     National Guard with the resources necessary to ensure its \n     readiness to perform State and Federal missions;\n       (4) expresses condolences to the families of those members \n     of the Colorado National Guard who made the ultimate \n     sacrifice and gave their lives while serving in the Colorado \n     National Guard; and\n       (5) honors the dedication of the members of the Colorado \n     National Guard who play a central role in protecting the \n     United States and the freedoms and liberties of its citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

Mr. President, I come to the point where no other \nSenator is seeking recognition, and we are through expediting the work \nof the clerks, so I am going to make a statement reflecting on my \n10,000th vote.\n  The circumstances are somewhat unusual. I cast the vote and expected \nto\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\ndepart the Chamber, but I found my distinguished colleague, Senator \nCasey, prepared to make some comments about my 10,000th vote. He could \nnot make those comments for about an hour because the train was late \nand some Senators hadn't arrived and the vote was kept open. So a very \nunusual situation for me personally. I had nothing to do but to sit and \nthink, and I was reflecting upon the 10,000 votes. That is what I am \ngoing to talk about now.\n  I would not expect the Senator from Illinois to stay to listen to \nthis because it might delay his arrival at the gym, which is very early \ntomorrow morning. I will be there at about 6:30 a.m. I don't know how \nlong he will have been there, but for quite awhile. I thank Senator \nDurbin once again for his kind remarks.\n  The occasion of reflecting on 10,000 votes in the Senate is something \nI have been thinking about for the past hour plus, as we awaited \nSenators to arrive to a vote, and then having yielded to two other \nSenators. I thought about why I got into public life, why I decided to \nrun for office, and that is hard to say. But I believe it was at the \ninspiration of my parents.\n  My story is a common one: immigrant parents, father served in World \nWar I, was wounded in action in the Argonne Forest, carried shrapnel in \nhis legs until the day he died, and was one of the veterans who was \npromised a $500 bonus. The government reneged on the promise--did not \npay the veterans a bonus--as the government reneges on so many promises \nto the veterans. So there was a famous march on Washington during the \nHoover administration when I was a child.\n  President Hoover called out the Army, and they fired on veterans and \nkilled veterans--one of the blackest days in American history. I think \nthat event, as a young child, was emblazoned in my mind. I saw the deep \nanguish of my father, and mother too. This was during the Depression.\n  My father had always had a very deep concern about government because \nhe lived under the tyranny of the czar. The czar wanted to send him to \nSiberia when he was 18 years old, in 1911, when he emigrated to the \nUnited States. I think that experience motivated me to want to go into \npublic life.\n  I had always had a very deep concern about civil liberties, as a \nmember of a minority group myself, to be able to deal with that issue \nin a governmental capacity. The 10,000 votes have come and gone in a \nhurry, and I was reflecting on the Reagan years. I was elected in 1980, \nthe same day President Reagan was elected. There are many highlights of \nthe tenure during his 8 years, but I think especially about September \n17, 1987. That is an easy date to remember because it marked the 200th \nanniversary of the signing of the Constitution of the United States.\n  To commemorate the 200th anniversary there was a ceremony in \nPhiladelphia, and President Reagan went to Philadelphia to participate \nin the ceremony. He invited me to go with him. He invited Senator Heinz \nas well, but Senator Heinz had other commitments that day and did not \ngo.\n  It was a fascinating experience to travel alone with the President, \nto talk to him on Air Force One and in the Presidential limousine. When \nwe arrived at Independence Hall, they had a great wheel, and the wheel \nstarted with George Washington, the first President, and then John \nAdams, and all the way around until it came to Ronald Reagan right next \nto George Washington. He and I talked about the drama he experienced on \nthe wheel right next to President Washington.\n  On that particular week, we had the confirmation hearings of Judge \nBork for the Supreme Court of the United States. On September 17, when \nI traveled to Philadelphia with the President, it was a Thursday, and I \nmissed my opportunity to question Judge Bork. I got that opportunity on \nSaturday morning. There were only a few people there, and I had an \nopportunity to question Judge Bork for an hour and a half and \nultimately played a key role in the rejection of the nomination of \nJudge Bork, who believed in original intent and had a very different \nview of the Constitution. He did not believe in due process of law. \nThat was not part of the Constitution. And he disagreed with the \nincorporation of the 10 amendments to the due process clause to apply \nto the States. That was a momentous Supreme Court hearing.\n  During the years of President George H.W. Bush, there were many \nmatters of note. One that stands out was the affirmation proceeding as \nto Justice Souter. When Justice Souter was up for confirmation, I \nparticipated in that as a member of the Judiciary Committee, as I had \nparticipated in the confirmation hearing of Judge Bork. The pro-choice \ngroups were apprehensive about Judge Souter becoming Justice Souter. I \nexamined his record very carefully and thought that he would read the \nprecedents of Roe v. Wade in a favorable light and supported his \nconfirmation. Then he became a stalwart for a woman's right to choose \nand a stalwart for constitutional principles involving civil rights and \nindividual freedom.\n  During the years with President Clinton, I chaired the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, and at \nthat time had an opportunity to take the lead in increasing education \nfunding very substantially. Pell grants were raised very materially. \nThey had been at $2,400, and the committee then moved them up, and now \nthey are in excess of $5,000.\n  I also took the lead in helping the working men and women through \nfunding for the Department of Labor and for the National Labor \nRelations Board and for mine safety, OSHA, and MENSHA.\n  Then on the funding for health, as has already been noted, I took the \nlead with the concurrence of Senator Harkin, who was then minority \nranking member, to increase funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth from $12 billion to $30 billion. During the decade I chaired the \ncommittee, that enormously increased the availability of grants. Some \nyears as much as $3.5 billion was added to the funding of the National \nInstitutes of Health. Then when the stimulus package came up, I offered \nthe amendment and led the battle to add an additional $10 billion. NIH \nhad slipped back because of across-the-board cuts and failure to have \ncost-of-living adjustments, but the $10 billion in the stimulus package \nhas provided 15,000 grants and has stimulated the interest in a whole \ngeneration of sciences.\n  Senator Menendez commented a few moments ago--in talking about my \n10,000 votes--how those research grants have led to enormous savings \nand in the prolonging of lives and saving of lives on many strains of \ncancer and with enormous strides being made in research into heart \ndisease and autism and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.\n  During the administration of George W. Bush, again there were many \nmomentous events. To mention one, because time is running, I led the \nfight for embryonic stem cell research, the Specter-Harkin bill, to use \nFederal funds to use stem cells, which had enormous potential for \ncuring the maladies of the world--a veritable fountain of youth--by \ninjecting stem cells into diseased cells.\n  President Bush vetoed the Specter-Harkin bill. He vetoed it twice. \nBut now with President Obama there has been an Executive order, and \nSenator Harkin and I are continuing to push for legislation because \nlegislation has more permanency than an Executive order. An Executive \norder can be changed by the next President.\n  Then the administration of President Obama. I got to know Senator \nBarack Obama. He had his office down the corridor from me on the \nseventh floor of the Hart Senate Office building. When he came forward \nwith his proposal for a stimulus and I took a look at what was \nhappening in the economy, I was concerned that we would slip back into \na 1929 depression if we did not pass the stimulus bill. I voted for the \nstimulus bill on this floor and commented about the political peril. It \nhas had a profound effect on my political life, which I will not \ndiscuss here. But had the stimulus package not been passed I think we \nwould not have been in the great recession which we are in, but we \nwould have been in another Great Depression. My own State, \nPennsylvania, has received $16 billion. Without that funding from the \nstimulus package there would not be unemployment compensation paid \ntoday; there wouldn't be Medicaid paid today. It has the potential for \n143,000 new jobs. It is only halfway through the cycle of 2 years. It \npassed in mid-February, not even a year old, and we see the financial \nproblems of California. Where\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\nwould California be without the stimulus? Where would any of the States \nbe without the stimulus?\n  The stimulus package and other proposed Federal expenditures have \ncaused quite a public reaction so that there is great concern in \nAmerica today with what is going on in Washington. People are very \nconcerned, as am I, about the deficit and about the national debt. We \nare going to be called upon to raise the national debt again.\n  When I was elected in the Senate, the national debt was $1 trillion. \nDuring the tenure of President Reagan, those 8 years, it increased to \n$3 trillion. President Reagan was the great economizer on his fiscal \npolicies, but we have no choice when it comes to raising debt because \nif we do not raise the national debt we will be in default. The debt is \nbeing used to pay for many obligations, including the support of our \ntroops in Afghanistan, which I will comment about in a few moments.\n  In the spring of this year--April, May, June, July--there was \ntremendous worry about what the Federal Government was talking about \nspending: $1 trillion on health care reform; $1 trillion on cap and \ntrade, on climate control. There was great public opposition that arose \nto what was happening in Washington. It was promoted by the gridlock \nwhich is present in this Chamber, spoken about by Senator Menendez and \nSenator Lautenberg a few moments ago; by the filibusters which are \nbeing carried on by Republicans.\n  A few years ago filibusters were being carried on by Democrats and \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees were the subject of filibusters. The \nbusiness about filibusters and about gridlock is a problem on both \nparties. It is a matter for bipartisan blame. It is my hope we will \nfind more Senators--Senator Menendez commented on my willingness to \nreach across the aisle. I did that on the other side of the aisle and I \ndo that on this side of the aisle. When I came to the Senate in 1980 \nthere were many moderate Republican Senators who reached across the \naisle. We had Senator Hatfield from Oregon--we were just discussing \nthat the distinguished Presiding Officer brought me greetings from \nSenator Hatfield, the Senator from Oregon--and Senator Packwood, also a \nmoderate from Oregon; Senator Danforth from Missouri; Senator Weicker \nfrom Connecticut; Senator Chafee from Rhode Island; Senator Stafford \nfrom Vermont; Senator Warner from Virginia; Senator Heinz from \nPennsylvania; Senator Mathias from Maryland. I could go on and on. \nToday the moderates on the other side of the aisle, with my departure, \ncan fit in a telephone booth. It is not good for the Senate and it is \nnot good for the country.\n  When I undertook the town meetings this year--I made it a practice, \nin my tenure in the Senate, 30 years, to visit almost every county \nalmost every year. At the first county I went to in August, the first \nday I had an opportunity to travel when the Senate was not in session--\nusually when I got to Lebanon County there were 85 or 100 people. On \nthis occasion there were 1,200 people. They had live television \ntransmission units from MSNBC and FOX and CNN. There was enormous anger \nabout what was happening in America with the spending, what was \nhappening with the deficit, what was happening with the national debt.\n  Those are problems which we yet have to face. I get the question in \nmy candidacy for reelection. I am seeking a sixth term. I want to \nfollow Senator Biden, the most recent six-term Senator.\n  People say: Why run now? Why, after serving for 30 years, being the \nlongest serving Pennsylvania Senator? People notice I have a big \nbirthday coming up. I was born on February 12, the same day as \nLincoln's birthday. I was born 121 years after Abraham Lincoln was \nborn. That is as close as I will come to talking about age.\n  I believe with Satchel Paige, the great baseball pitcher, who was \nageless. Satchel Paige made many famous statements. One of his most \nfamous statements was: If you didn't know your age, how old would you \nthink you were? I choose 37. I choose 37 because nobody would believe \n17. That was a happy year in my life. I think there is a psychological \nterm called ``arrested development.'' That may have occurred to me at \n17.\n  But why run now? Because there are so many things to be done. There \nare so many important problems. The experience and seniority and the \nknowledge I think can be put to good use for the 12 million \nconstituents I have.\n  There is a great facet on term limits--it is called losing at the \npolls. The people can say yes or no to a candidacy for reelection, but \nI am full of vim, vigor, and vitality, and there are a lot of things I \nwant to do. My four granddaughters are very much on my mind, as will \ntheir children and their grandchildren be.\n  We have health care reform which is still pending in the Congress of \nthe United States. It has been a very difficult matter which has \nconsumed this body and the House of Representatives for months. The \nHouse can pass it more quickly than can the Senate. We worked on it for \nthe better part of 6 months and we passed it here. It is well \ndocumented that it took 60 votes because there was not a single \nRepublican who would support cloture. There had to be 60 Democrats who \nwould agree. That led to a lot of concessions being made to get the 60 \nvotes.\n  Some Senators insisted on special consideration for their States. I \nthink that was wrong. Why did I vote for the package? Because the good \nvastly outweighed the bad.\n  I was asked, in Pennsylvania, why didn't I get some special \nconsideration for Pennsylvania? I didn't because I thought it was the \nwrong thing to do. I was on a radio program last week, a critical radio \nprogram, for what is going on in Washington. But I got a compliment for \nnot asking for special consideration.\n  We have a new Senator-elect in Massachusetts and we ought not to do \nanything in the interim until he is seated. Then there will be 59, so \nnot enough to shut off a filibuster by the Republicans. So the question \nis: Where do we go from here?\n  President Obama has talked about a number of alternatives. A week ago \nlast Wednesday, after the Massachusetts election, he was talking about \na pared-down bill. I doubt that could pass the Senate. It would be \nunfortunate if all the work that has been done on the historic health \ncare reform were to be nullified. The health care bill ran into great \nproblems because of misrepresentations. There are no death panels in \nthe health care bill. In my town meetings people were talking about \ndeath panels. I told them authoritatively and accurately, there were no \ndeath panels.\n  There was a worry about a government takeover of health care. That \nwas not the bill. There was a government option. I was for a robust \ngovernment option, leaving the private sector in place but taking steps \nto give a choice to people who wanted to buy insurance. But to get \ninsurance reform to eliminate preexisting conditions as a way for \ninsurance companies to maneuver and decline to pay claims, or the \ncancellation of insurance when somebody got sick, or not covering \nchildren--so many of the insurance lies.\n  I think it would be unfortunate if all we did were nullified. One way \nto approach it would be for the House to pass the Senate bill--that \nwould be my recommendation--and then to have immediate corrective \nlegislation on a number of the points which went too far--on the \nspecial favors for certain States. I believe there would be support on \nthe other side of the aisle and we could correct the abusive practices \nif the House were to adopt the Senate bill.\n  But I respect the House. I read what the Speaker had to say about the \ndisinclination to adopt the Senate bill. It has been a long time in \ncoming to get reform. Legislation which is enacted is subject to \nmodification. It has to move in steps. We could only get to the 1965 \nVoting Right Act because we had the 1957 legislation and the 1964 \nlegislation. There are opportunities for changes and the abusive facets \nand the wrongful provisions in the Senate bill, if taken by the House, \ncould be corrected. I think there would be support on both sides of the \naisle for that.\n  There are a great many items on my agenda. One of the concerns I have \nis the issue of imports, illustratively from China, where they are \nsubsidized and take unfair advantage of the trade laws. I have appeared \nmany times before the International Trade Commission--something I had \ndone in private\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\npractice as a lawyer on appellate arguments in court. I won a big case \npreserving a lot of jobs several months ago on the tire industry, \nstopping China from sending tires into the United States which were \nsubsidized.\n  I won a big case in the ITC, that I was the lead advocate on, on the \nsteel industry, to stop China from selling steel in the United States.\n  I have been working on a project to deepen the Port of Philadelphia \nfrom 40 to 45 feet. Senator Heinz and I got authorizing legislation in \n1983. It took until 1992 to get the Corps of Engineers to say it was \neconomically sustainable. Then I worked on the Appropriations \nCommittee, with my seniority, to get more than $77 million \nappropriated. It has been contested by the State of Delaware on \nenvironmental concerns which have been answered totally by \nenvironmental impact studies. Recently, we were successful in getting \nthe Secretary of the Army to invoke the supremacy clause.\n  But there is still more work to be done on that. I am working hard \nfor the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, working on \nmanufacturing of vaccines. We have been short of vaccines and we cannot \nrely upon foreign sources. That is a multimillion dollar project \nworking and has the promise of thousands of jobs for that area.\n  I am working on northeast Pennsylvania to get a train from Scranton \nto Hoboken, ``Wall Street West''; working for the farmers on milk dairy \nprices; with General Electric to keep the GE plant open and jobs there; \nworking, in my position on the Environment and Public Works Committee, \non climate control; working on immigration reform.\n  As chairman, I managed the bill through the Senate in the 2006. I am \nworking on the issue of campaign finance reform. The Supreme Court, \nlast week, came down with a decision to allow corporations to engage in \npolitical advertising to elect or defeat candidates which will, as \nJustice Stevens in dissent pointed out, open the door for widespread \ncorruption and am considering the issue of a Constitutional amendment \nwhich would reverse that decision and allow Congress and States to set \nlimits on campaign finance. I have been working for a decade to try to \nget the Supreme Court televised for transparency. They make all the \ncutting-edge decisions.\n  I have been very active on foreign policy. There are many things I am \nworking on at the present time. Within the last month, I made a trip to \nAfghanistan and Syria and India. My study of the situation in \nAfghanistan leads me to oppose the President's plan to send 30,000 \nadditional troops. I think we have to do whatever it takes to fight al-\nQaida because they are out to annihilate us. But why fight them in \nAfghanistan when they can just as easily organize in Yemen or Somalia \nor elsewhere?\n  On the efforts to get help from the Pakistanis, not being very \nsuccessful. In India, our Congressional delegation met with Prime \nMinister Singh. I put the question to him, would he be willing to have \na limitation with Pakistan on the number of troops on the border, which \nwould liberate Pakistani troops to help us fight al-Qaida in Pakistan.\n  Prime Minister Singh said he would, if the terrorists would be \nstopped from coming into India, as they blew up the hotel in Mumbai \nmore than a year ago. So there are many things to be done. Our \nCongressional delegation visited Syria. I have visited the Mideast, \nalmost every area, during my tenure in the Senate. I am very much \nconcerned about the security of Israel.\n  In the visits I have had with Syria, I have gotten to know Bashar al-\nAssad, the Prime Minister of Syria, and his father, Hafiz al-Assad, \nbecause I believe Syria is the key to the peace process there.\n  Syria wants a return of the Golan. Only Israel can decide whether \nIsrael wants to give back the Golan. But it is a different era today \nthan it was in 1967, when the Golan was so important strategically. \nToday, rockets obviate the defensive posture of the Golan Heights. But \nonly Israel can decide that for itself. But if Israel could get \nconcessions for Syria to stop destabilizing Lebanon or stop supporting \nHamas, that is an issue which ought to be considered.\n  Well, the hour is growing late. We are keeping staff here. But I \nthought this occasion, on the 10,000th vote, as I said, I sat here for \nabout 1 hour waiting for the vote to end before Senator Casey could \nmake his comments, gave me a few moments to reflect on why I was \ninterested in running for public office originally, what those 10,000 \nvotes meant to me with a very brief statement as to some of those votes \nduring the administrations of President Reagan, the first President \nBush, President Clinton, the second President Bush, President Obama, \nand what I would like to see done in the future.\n  There is much to be done on so many lines. I have said to Senator \nCasey, who has been here only 3 years, I would like to be here to speak \nto him on his 10,000th vote. I do not entertain that seriously. But the \nissues I have talked about are ones that are very important to me and I \nthink to the future of my State and I think to the future of my Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/25/senate-section/article/S207-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JANUARY 26, 2010\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.
