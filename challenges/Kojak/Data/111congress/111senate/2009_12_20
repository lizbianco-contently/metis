Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 1:30 p.m. shall be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for \ndesignating that I should control half the time between now and 1:30.\n  I would like to, first, thank all the people who are here, the staff \nand the pages. This has been a tough session for many but tougher for \nmany of them than some Members of the Senate because many times they \nhave had to wait until the very last Senator of either political party \nhas finished for the day before they go home. I was reflecting on that \nyesterday afternoon in the midst of one of the toughest, historic \nsnowstorms in Washington, DC; that hundreds of staff people were \nwaiting at their post, doing their jobs on a Saturday, in the middle of \na snowstorm, when virtually every business around Washington was \nclosing down. I wish to thank them and the pages on both sides of the \naisle for their patience and commitment to this great country and this \ngreat institution.\n  Why are we here on Sunday? Why were we here on Saturday? Why are we \ngoing to take a vote at 1 in the morning on Monday? Good questions, and \nI am not sure there are satisfying answers. But there are answers. We \nare here because we are trying to finish health care reform. It has \nbeen a project that has been underway for almost a year now, since the \nPresident challenged us to do something, and a lot of effort has been \nexpended on both sides of the aisle. But I will say I can speak for our \nside of the aisle.\n  Senator Max Baucus came to me more than a year ago and sat down in my \noffice to talk about health care reform. He was preparing for this \nbattle as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and knew he would \nplay a central role, gathering the opinions of members of his committee \nand Members of the Senate.\n  Efforts were underway with Senator Kennedy from his remote location \nin Massachusetts, recuperating from surgery and from cancer therapy, \ntrying to keep his committee on track toward health care reform. He \nturned over that mantle to Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, who \ndid an admirable job with the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee.\n  They prepared for and had hearings. They entertained hundreds of \namendments. In fact, I believe there were over 160 amendments that were \nproposed by the Republicans, and many of them were adopted in the HELP \nCommittee.\n\n  Senator Coburn of Oklahoma filed 212 amendments during the HELP \nCommittee markup. He offered 38 amendments to the bill. Nineteen of his \namendments--half of them--were agreed to. Of those that were offered, \n15 were not agreed to--all by rollcall vote. So 13 amendments offered \nby the Senator from Oklahoma were included in the bill that is before \nus today.\n  He has questioned whether the current procedure gives him an \nopportunity to offer amendments. The fact is, we are now on our 21st \nday of considering health care reform. Exactly 4 amendments have been \noffered by the Republican side of the aisle, 4 substantive amendments \nto change provisions in this bill of 2,000 pages--in 21 days, 4 \namendments. They offered six motions to stop the debate, send the bill \nback to committee. They were generic motions. They did not ask for \nspecific changes. They just take on an issue in the bill and say: Send \nit back to the committee and tell them to solve this problem and then \nbring it back to the floor at a later time. Well, that is kind of a \nprocedural and, if I might say, political statement more than a \nsubstantive statement about a provision in the bill.\n  So exactly four amendments have been offered by the Republican side \nof the aisle that deal with substance. Some of their efforts have been \nin protection of the health insurance industry, particularly a program \ncalled Medicare Advantage, which was created by private health \ninsurance companies to prove to government they could provide Medicare \nmore cheaply.\n  Some did but most did not, and now we are paying up to $17 billion a \nyear subsidizing private health insurance companies that told us at the \nstart: We will save you money. It turns out they are costing us money--\na lot of money--and many of us think it is wasteful. We would rather \nhave that money spent on basic Medicare, making certain there is \nsolvency in Medicare and a good, strong future.\n  So when you look at the state of the situation, we are now on a \ncloture motion to bring a close to the debate on health care reform, \nafter almost 3\n\n[[Page S13559]]\n\nweeks and four Republican amendments--only four were offered. There \nnever was a Republican substitute, no Republican proposal for health \ncare reform. We have been told this might exist. We have never seen it. \nOf the four amendments they offered, not one was this substitute that \nwas going to deal with the health care system. It is a promise that has \nnot been kept. They kept saying: It is coming. Pretty soon we are just \ngoing to put this thing right in the Record. Well, it never happened. \nIn 3 weeks, it never happened.\n  It is hard work to prepare a substitute. The reason this took so long \nand has dragged on for so long is we had to take every page of this and \nturn it over to the Congressional Budget Office. They sit there with \ntheir economists, pore over it and say: Well, is it going to add to the \ndeficit or reduce the deficit? Is it going to reduce health care costs? \nWhat is the impact? It takes them some time to do that. The Republicans \nknow if they are going to have a substitute, it will have to go through \nthe same rigorous appraisal, and they have not done that, I think \nbecause it is hard. In fact, from their political point of view, it \nmight be impossible to try to solve the problems facing health care in \nAmerica without taking the path we have taken.\n  What does this bill do? The basics are obvious. First,--and this is \nall backed up by the Congressional Budget Office--it will reduce the \ncost of health care. It will make it more affordable. A health care \npolicy for a family of four offered by an employer, on average, cost \n$6,000 10 years ago. Today, it costs $12,000 a year. It has doubled in \n10 years, and in 8 years it will double again to $24,000. We have to \nslow this down or it will reach a point where more and more people will \nbe uninsured, fewer businesses will offer health insurance, and more \nindividuals will find themselves unable to afford the basic protections \nthey need for themselves and their families.\n  So the Congressional Budget Office tells us we reduce the growth in \nthe cost of health care, and that is a good thing. They came through \nwith a dramatic revelation yesterday when they said this bill will \nreduce our deficit as well. If the cost of health care goes down, the \ncost of health care programs offered by government goes down. They tell \nus in 10 years we will save $130 billion from the deficit. That is a \ndramatic savings--the largest in history. But then the news got better. \nThey said, in the second 10 years, instead of saving $650 billion from \nour debt and deficit, it could reach double that amount: $1.3 trillion \nin savings in the second 10 years.\n  I would say to those who give speeches day after day about our \ndeficit, I invite you--in fact, I challenge you to come up with a bill \nthat does this, that gives us actual savings of $130 billion in 10 \nyears and $1.3 trillion in the next 10 years. It is hard to do. It may \nbe impossible for some to come up with such a bill.\n  This bill also will extend the coverage of health insurance so 94 \npercent of Americans will have coverage. Madam President, 30 million \nAmericans today who have no health insurance will have health insurance \nunder this bill. Half of them are poor enough that they will receive \nMedicaid; the other half will qualify for the insurance exchanges and \nother tax credits to help them pay their premiums so they can have and \nafford health insurance.\n  Ninety-four percent of Americans--we have never, ever achieved a \nlevel of insured Americans that reached that number. Thirty million \nAmericans will be receiving health insurance at the end of the day.\n  This bill will start giving consumers across America protections they \nneed against abuses from health insurance companies. One of the things \nnear and dear to my heart about this amendment, which has been \ncriticized by some, is this amendment, which was offered yesterday, has \nbeen on the Internet, for those who are interested to read it, for 24 \nhours, and will continue to be available.\n  This amendment says that as soon as this is signed, health insurance \ncompanies across America cannot deny coverage to children, those under \nthe age of 18, because of a preexisting condition. That means if your \nson or daughter is diagnosed with diabetes, juvenile diabetes, and you \nfind it difficult to get health insurance today because of that \npreexisting condition, they will no longer be able to discriminate \nagainst your child and your family because of this bill. That is one \nthing. There are many others.\n  This whole notion of health insurance companies waiting until you get \nsick and cut you off when you need them the most, that comes to an end, \nunder this amendment, in 6 months. So over and over again, we give \nconsumers across America a chance to have the coverage they paid for \nwhen they need it the most. We used to call it the Patients' Bill of \nRights, and it used to be bipartisan. It was Senator Kennedy and \nSenator McCain who brought it to us, and it failed because the health \ninsurance companies were so politically powerful. But we have got them \nthis time. If we can pass this bill, we finally have the protections \nthe American people so desperately need.\n  There are other provisions in the bill. Right from the beginning, we \nprovide more help to small businesses. These are businesses with 50, 25 \nemployees and an average payroll of $50,000 an employee to $25,000 an \nemployee or less. For each of those businesses, we say: We are going to \nhelp you buy health insurance for the owners of the business as well as \nfor the employees. Those are the folks who are struggling and losing \ncoverage, people such as the realtors in your hometown. Did you know \none out of four realtors in America has no health insurance. I did not \nknow it until they came to see me. Well, this gives them a hand. It \ngives them a tax break as a small business to provide health insurance \nfor their people.\n  I am going to reserve the remainder of my time. I will tell you, we \nare here today. We are burning the hours off the clock to vote at 1 \na.m. in the morning. It would be more humane to the people who work \nhere, to the Members of the Senate and their families, for us to reach \na gentlemanly and gentlewomanly agreement that we will have this vote \nat a more reasonable time. If we have the 60 votes, which I think we \nhave the commitments for, then we can decide how to move forward.\n\n  We have had a long, arduous, and sometimes taxing debate leading to \nthis moment. I think it is time for a vote. The sooner we can reach \nthat vote, the sooner the American people will know that we will either \nsucceed or fail in bringing stability and security when it comes to \ntheir health insurance, making that health insurance more affordable, \nextending the reach and protection of health insurance to record levels \nof Americans, making sure we have health insurance reform as part of \nthis, and at the same time, at the very same time reducing our deficit.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 1 minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask unanimous consent that the time under the quorum be \nallotted equally to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk (Sara Schwartzman) proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Is it correct, Madam President, the minority side has \nthe hour from 1:30 to 2:30?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct. Under the previous \norder, the time until 11:30 p.m. shall be controlled in alternative 1-\nhour blocks with the Republicans controlling the first hour.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I, then, Madam President, ask unanimous consent \nSenators Cornyn, Graham, Isakson, and myself be allowed to have a \ncolloquy during this first hour, from 1:30 to 2:30.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, here we are on our 21st legislative \nday, less than 4 weeks, on the most major piece of health care \nlegislation ever\n\n[[Page S13560]]\n\nproposed in the history of our great country. That is less than weeks \nthat we have been on this bill that seeks to change the way health care \nis delivered in America and also seeks to change the way individuals \nhave access both to health care itself as well as to insurance. During \nthis period of time--and we are headed, I might say, too, toward \npassage of this bill in the Senate over the next couple of days.\n  I do not remember, in my 15 years in the Congress, both in the House \nand in the Senate, any major piece of legislation such as this being \ndebated and ultimately brought to a final vote within such a short \nperiod of time. I have been involved in farm bills that have been on \nthe Senate floor for longer than this--any number of other pieces of \nlegislation that we deal with on a regular basis that have been on the \nSenate floor for longer than that period of time.\n  I heard the assistant majority leader a little earlier talking about \nthe fact that we have had the opportunity to amend this bill. The fact \nis, the Republicans have been offered the opportunity to introduce 10 \namendments to this massive piece of legislation for debate on the \nfloor. We have a number of other amendments that have been filed. The \nfour of us here today have significant amendments that we filed that \nnow we are not going to have the opportunity to call up. It is \nextremely unusual for such a massive change in American policy being \ndebated and voted upon without not only bipartisan support but without \nbipartisan participation from the standpoint of giving us the \nopportunity to file amendments, to have those amendments debated and \nvoted upon.\n  The assistant majority leader also referenced amendments by Senator \nCoburn. I am not going to speak for him. He will be on the floor of the \nSenate later today to certainly speak well for himself. But the fact \nis, he and other Members of the HELP Committee offered any number of \namendments, as well as Members of the Finance Committee offered any \nnumber of amendments, that were voted down in the HELP Committee and in \nthe Finance Committee on a pure partisan vote.\n  It was the opportunity for meaningful participation by Republicans, \nwho have some pretty good ideas about health care, to participate in \nthe development of this bill, and it simply did not happen.\n  Let me say what Republicans are for. There have been comments on this \nfloor that there has been no substitute bill offered. The fact is, \nSenator Burr and Senator Coburn, who will be on the floor a little bit \nlater, have spent hours on the floor of this Senate talking about their \nproposed bill that is not going to see the light of day. It has never \nbeen allowed to come up in committee, and it is not going to be allowed \nto come up on the floor of the Senate because the majority leader has \ndone what we call fill the tree. That is the Washington speak way of \nsaying that all amendments are now cut off. There will be no more \nadditional amendments debated and brought up for a vote. But that is \njust one of four separate plans that have been filed and laid on the \ntable, not just for the last 72 hours but for the last several months. \nThey have been available to look at online. There are any number of \ncosponsors to the bipartisan Wyden-Bennett bill. There is also the \nGregg bill. There is the Coburn-Burr bill. There are any number of \nalternate proposals out there that the majority has simply decided: We \ndo not think those bills are worth even debating on the Senate floor, \nso they have not allowed those bills to come up.\n  But what are Republicans for? We have said this over and over. Let me \njust say, No. 1, we are for meaningful, affordable access to health \ninsurance by every single American. We can do it in a way that does not \nraise taxes. We are for providing coverage for all Americans, including \nthose who have had preexisting conditions. We can do it in a way that \ndoes not raise taxes.\n  We are for trending down the cost curve; when it comes to health care \nreform, if we do not turn that cost curve downward, then we have failed \nthe American people. Frankly, the independent Congressional Budget \nOffice has said health care cost under the Reid proposal is going to \nnot only continue to go up but it is likely--not only will it continue \non its current curve, but it is going to go up and not down.\n  The way you can ensure that cost curve turns down, just two \nRepublican proposals that we think have an awful lot of merit but are \nnot going to be considered and certainly are not going to be included--\nare not included in the managers' amendment that has now been filed--\none of those is tort reform. Physicians all across the country have \nbeen crying for this for years. But, more so, health agencies and \nindividuals who have to pay health care bills have been crying for this \nfor years. We can do it in a way that will allow every aggrieved \nindividual who is injured as a result of negligent health care being \ndelivered to have their day in court. Yet we need to provide some means \nof the elimination of the frivolous lawsuits that go so much toward \nphysicians having to call for tests that they might not otherwise need; \nand also to prevent the spiraling costs, on the delivery side, of \nhealth care because of the high cost of malpractice insurance as well \nas other measures.\n  The other way we can trend that curve down is to provide preventive \nincentives to individuals across America to live healthier lives. There \nis example after example that we have talked about on the floor of the \nSenate--from health care providers, employers who have provided \nincentives in their program, their health insurance program, that have \nin fact lowered costs. We can do that. There are proposals to do that, \nbut they are not included in the managers' package.\n  Insurance reform--Republicans have been very strong about the fact \nthat, as a part of overall health care reform, we need to reform the \ninsurance industry, rein in some measures that have caused the cost of \nhealth insurance that is provided by employers to, again, not only \nlevel off but ultimately trend downward.\n  How do we do that, and what ideas have been proposed? We have \nproposed the sale of insurance policies across State lines. There is a \nprovision in the underlying bill that does that. I am very pleased to \nsee that included.\n  Another thing we can do is to allow for what is called associated \nhealth plans that Republicans have been promoting for years. Every time \nit has come up for a vote in this body, the Democrats have opposed \nallowing individuals across State lines to group together and spread \nthe risk of health insurance coverage. It would go a long way toward \nreducing the cost of health insurance premiums. But, unfortunately, we \nhave not been allowed to move forward with that proposal.\n\n  Let me mention a couple of things, before I turn to my friend from \nTexas, with respect to the changes in the Reid amendment that was filed \nyesterday. Again, there have been a number of individuals who have come \nto the floor since that amendment was filed yesterday to talk about the \nfact that it is online, and as we look through it more and more we are \nfinding more and more about it, that is true. But it certainly does not \nmeet the test of giving us 72 hours before we vote on it.\n  The number of pages in the bill now, the base bill plus the Reid \namendment plus the Indian health bill, which is now included by \nreference, totals 2,733 pages. The gross Medicare cuts--and these are \nnot slowing the growth of Medicare. These are direct Medicare cuts that \nare being used to finance the underlying health care bill--now totaling \n$470.70 billion. The gross tax increases in the Reid amendment now \ntotal $518.5 billion. CBO says the gross cost of the insurance coverage \nexpansion is $23 billion higher under the Reid amendment than it was \nunder the base bill. Federal revenues or Federal taxes increase by \nalmost $26 billion under the managers' package.\n  All told, the amendment reduces the deficit by $2 billion--going from \n$130 to $132 billion. But, boy, is that ever a figleaf. We are going to \ntalk about the CLASS Act that provides for that increase in the \ndeficit.\n  The Federal cost curve, according to CBO, still goes up. I alluded to \nthat a little bit earlier.\n  There is a slight increase in additional coverage--but still under \nthe Reid amendment there will be 23 million Americans left uninsured. \nThat is not what we have heard from the other side of the aisle from \nday one about making sure that every single American was covered.\n\n[[Page S13561]]\n\n  Despite the fact the Democrats have said changes in the managers' \npackage would improve the delivery system, CBO also says it is likely \nthat the amendment would have little impact on premiums.\n  As we move toward the cloture votes on this bill over the next couple \nof days, I think it is important for the American people to get some \nunderstanding of the fact that the deals that have been made, the deals \nthat have been cut to get the Democrats to 60 votes on this bill do not \ndo what has been said over and over by folks on the other side of the \naisle.\n  I would now like to ask my friend from Texas how it impacts Texas, \nthe managers' amendment, as well as the underlying bill and other \ncomments he has relative to the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I look forward to engaging with both the \nSenator from Georgia and the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham. I \nhave been in the Senate now for 7 years, which is not all that long \ncompared to the length of service of a number of Senators. I was and \nhave been proud to represent the 24 million citizens of the State of \nTexas here in the Senate and the seat that was first held by Sam \nHouston in 1846.\n  Sometimes the Senate is referred to as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. I think that description is a description that \ninspires schoolchildren and lovers of this great democracy of ours to \nadmire and respect this body. But I have to tell you, I think the \nworld's greatest deliberative body might not apply to this particular \npiece of legislation. It might, rather, be called the world's biggest \nrailroad because of the railroading of the legislation that was \nrevealed here only yesterday by Senator Reid, cooked up behind closed \ndoors with a variety of interest groups negotiating deals on the side, \ndeals that are unknown.\n  We know some of those pertain to hospitals, some to the \npharmaceutical companies. Then I heard one of our other Senators from \nNorth Carolina yesterday say we should call this ``The Price Is Right'' \nbecause we know a number of Senators held out for various inducements, \nfinancial inducements, to encourage them to get to the 60 votes.\n  So we do not know what kind of deals have been cut behind closed \ndoors, what kind of deals individual Senators may have made. But the \nAmerican people need to know what is in this legislation and how it \nwill affect them.\n  Unfortunately, notwithstanding the fact that the President of the \nUnited States said, You know what, when I am elected President, we are \ngoing to have negotiations around a big table and televise it on C-\nSPAN, good luck. So much for that broken promise.\n  We know other Senators who expressed the same concerns the Senator \nfrom Georgia did about having at least 72 hours by posting this on the \nInternet so the American people can read it and so we can consult with \nour constituents--the hospitals, the small businesses, the doctors--to \nsay how does this affect you?\n  We had eight Democratic Senators on October 6, 2009, who said they \nwanted the CBO scores and they wanted them posted 72 hours ahead of \ntime before the first vote. So much for that. We know that is going to \nbe thrown out the door as well.\n  That demand, I suppose, was made more for public relations rather \nthan any real desire to find out what is in the bill and share it with \nthe American people because we know legislative language will be \navailable only 40 hours before the first vote at 1 a.m. this morning, \nliterally in the middle of the night. The Congressional Budget Office \nscore is available only 37 hours before the first vote.\n  What we are talking about is this legislation. The Senator from \nGeorgia said 2,700 pages, I believe, when you consider all of the \nlegislation we are going to be asked to vote on the first time on a \ncloture vote at 1 in the morning, about 12 hours from now. We have been \nfeverishly reviewing this language to find out what is in it. Frankly, \nwhat we find out is that it makes things worse rather than better in a \nnumber of key respects.\n  For example, we know that America spends near double what any other \nindustrialized Nation does on health care. One of the stated goals, one \nwhich the Democrats and Republicans both agree on, is that this reform \nought to control those costs rather than make it worse. I have an \namendment, amendment No. 2806, designed to ensure that health care \nreform achieves the goal we all support.\n  We know that private insurance premiums have more than doubled in the \nlast 10 years for American families. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that taxpayer spending on government health programs will \nrise to 12 percent of our economy by 2050. That will be a debt of \n$322,000 for the unfunded liabilities of Medicare alone. This bill does \nnot make things better. It makes things worse, according to the Obama \nadministration Chief Actuary.\n  I have an amendment which would apply the truth test to the Obama \nadministration's own independent Actuary, based on the evidence the \nReid bill would increase health care costs for the Nation, for American \nfamilies, for American taxpayers. This amendment leaves it up to the \nOffice of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices. If that office finds the Reid bill does lower health costs as \nadvertised, the bill would then proceed to go into effect. But if, in \nfact, it does not, then it will not.\n  Advocates of the Reid health bill continue to promise it lowers \nhealth care costs, but this amendment will apply the truth test to the \nObama administration's own independent Actuary.\n  I see the distinguished majority whip on the floor. I am glad he is \nhere because he may have something to say about this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nthat I be allowed to call up amendment No. 2806.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is the 21st day of debate. There \nhave been four substantive amendments offered by the Republican side. \nThey have had ample opportunity to call for this----\n  Mr. CORNYN. I call for the regular order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Regular order has been called for. \nDoes the Senator object?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to comment on some \nof the other broken promises. The President made a solemn pledge that \nhe would sign a universal health care bill. This bill, as I understand \nit, still leaves 15 million people without insurance coverage. He says \nthe costs will be cut by up to $2,500 a year. The reality is the \naverage premiums would increase by $2,100.\n  I ask perhaps our distinguished colleagues from South Carolina and \nGeorgia to comment on the promises that the President has made with \nregard to transparency, the promises he has made with regard to \npremiums going down rather than up, the promises he has made with \nregard to Medicare--promises it appears this bill will not allow him to \nkeep.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Everything the 2008 campaign was about has basically been \ndiscredited and discarded in this whole health care debate. I thought \nit was change we could believe in. I thought there was going to be a \nnew way of doing business in Washington, and God knows there needs to \nbe. I thought we were going to negotiate the health care bill on C-SPAN \nand everybody would have a seat at the table, including the drug \ncompanies. I thought we were going to allow reimportation of \nprescription drugs to allow American consumers to purchase drugs \ndramatically cheaper.\n  Not only have we not had any negotiations on C-SPAN, you couldn't \nfind the room where the negotiations were going on. The old way of \ndoing business looks good compared to this process. There was a \nnegotiation going on on the biggest proposal we will probably ever vote \non, one-sixth of the economy, between two people: the Senate majority \nleader and the Senator from Nebraska.\n\n[[Page S13562]]\n\n  The second in command on the Democratic side told Senator McCain: I \nam just as in the dark as you are. We have gone to a promise of being \non C-SPAN to everybody was in the dark. I don't know how that plays. I \nhope it plays poorly because at the end of the day, what we are doing \nhere is absolutely unconscionable. When you thought it couldn't get any \nworse in Washington, when you thought your government had reached a low \npoint, well, it has gotten worse. I will be talking about the 60th vote \nhere soon, how they got that 60th vote. And if that is OK with the \nAmerican people, which I do not believe it will be, if that is OK with \nour body, then our best days are behind us as a country.\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I ask the Senator from South Carolina about this \nother promise? Does he recall the President saying in July of 2009, if \nyou like what you have, you can keep it? Is the Senator aware of the \nfact that according to the Congressional Budget Office, between 8 and 9 \nmillion people who would have been covered by employment-based plans \nunder the current law would not have an offer of such coverage under \nthis bill if passed, and seniors, because of the cuts to Medicare, \nparticularly Medicare Advantage, will actually have their benefits cut? \nHow do you reconcile those promises with what we see in this \nmonstrosity of a bill?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. They cannot be reconciled. I hope American seniors are \npaying attention. We are going to take $470 billion out of Medicare in \nthe next decade and use that money to create new government programs. \nIf you are senior citizens out there, the doctors and hospitals you go \nto--and it is hard to find Medicare doctors right now; a lot of doctors \nare reluctant to take Medicare patients because the reimbursement rates \nare so low. Rural hospitals are on their knees because the Medicare \nrates are so low. Take $470 billion out of the system and see what \nhappens to the provider community.\n  What does it mean to seniors? It means your chance of finding the \ndoctor or hospital to take care of you as a Medicare patient is going \ndown, not up. What does it mean to Medicare? It is due to go bankrupt \nby 2017. By taking money out of the system, not reforming Medicare, but \nusing it as another purpose has accelerated the problems of Medicare. \nNot only has that promise been broken, we have done something no other \nCongress has ever done to Medicare--take money out of it and give it to \nsomebody else. That is not right. We were within inches of expanding \nMedicare to people from 55 to 64 which would put the system at risk.\n  My point is simply this. We started this debate as a way to reform \nhealth care, and a lot of us agree on many things. It wound up being \nwhat does the Democratic Party need to do to pass a bill. Nobody cares \nwhat is in this bill anymore. All the objections about the CLASS Act \nand about fiscal responsibility and about the public options being in \nor out have given way to get this thing done before Christmas.\n  This is not about health care reform. It is about one political party \nfeeling as though they have to pass a bill no matter what is in it. And \nthat is sad.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I wonder if my colleagues will comment. I have one last \nchart I want to share with them and anybody who might be watching on \nthis Sunday afternoon shortly before Christmas.\n  Every public opinion poll I have seen says the American people do not \nwant us to pass this bill. So one has to wonder: All of us have to run \nfor election in our States. Obviously, to win an election, you have to \nget a majority of voters. But 56 percent of U.S. voters in the country \nsay they do not want this bill to pass. And yet this thing seems as \nthough it is on an unstoppable path toward passage because 60 Senators, \napparently defying the will of their constituents, seem determined to \npass the bill.\n  Can my colleagues explain to me what they think is going on here?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I think it is obvious it is pure arrogance on the part \nof the folks on the other side of the aisle. The American people do not \nwant it, but they are saying Washington knows better than the people \nback home know. That is pretty clear.\n  I know my colleague from Georgia is like me, when we go back home, we \nget stopped in the airport, in the grocery store, on the streets, all \naround different parts of Georgia. People are not happy about what is \ngoing on up here with respect to this bill. I wish to ask him about his \ncomments with respect to where we are.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Like the Senators from Texas and South Carolina and my \nsenior Senator from Georgia, we all represent the people who vote for \nus. And in reference to Senator Cornyn's question about popularity, \nabout the way people feel about this legislation, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record two letters--one from the Medical \nAssociation of Georgia and one from a consolidated group of medical \nassociations representing 92,000 physicians.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  MAG in Group Representing 92,000 Doctors Opposing Senate Health Bill\n\n       Atlanta.--The Medical Association of Georgia (MAG) is part \n     of a group of state and national specialty medical societies \n     that represents more than 92,000 practicing physicians from \n     across the U.S. that sent a letter to U.S. Senators today \n     urging them to oppose the ``Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act'' (H.R. 3590) because it clears the way for \n     government-controlled medical care.\n       MAG President Gary C. Richter, M.D., says, ``We believe \n     that this bill would create a staggering volume of new \n     federal regulatory requirements for medicine, that it isn't \n     sustainable from a budget standpoint, that a `public' or \n     `community' heath insurance option may lead to a single-payer \n     system, that the measure lacks meaningful tort reform and \n     actually discourages proven reforms like limiting attorney \n     fees and malpractice caps, and that the bill does not fix the \n     Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate, or SGR, formula.''\n       In the letter, the physician groups ask Senate leaders to \n     ``draft a more targeted bill that will reform the country's \n     flawed system for financing health care, while preserving the \n     best health care in the world.'' The letter states, ``We are \n     therefore united in our resolve to achieve health system \n     reform that empowers patients and preserves the practice of \n     medicine--without creating a huge government bureaucracy.''\n       The letter also highlights some of the bill's more \n     ``problematic provisions,'' stressing that it undermines the \n     patient-physician relationship. The correspondence points out \n     that the bill does not provide for the right to privately \n     contract--a ``touchstone of American freedom and liberty''--\n     and it stresses that ``patients should have the right to \n     choose their doctor and enter into agreements for fees and \n     services without penalty.'' The letter urges lawmakers to \n     develop legislation that ``allows patients and physicians to \n     take a more direct role in their health care decisions,'' and \n     it points out that decisions surrounding medical care isn't \n     an appropriate role for the government or other third party \n     payers.\n       Along with MAG, signatories include the Medical Association \n     of the State of Alabama, the Medical Society of Delaware, the \n     Medical Society of the District of Columbia, the Florida \n     Medical Association, the Kansas Medical Society, the \n     Louisiana State Medical Society, the Missouri State Medical \n     Association, the Nebraska Medical Association, the Medical \n     Society of New Jersey, the Medical Society of South Carolina, \n     the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, the American \n     Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the \n     American Association of Neurological Surgeons, the American \n     Society of Breast Surgeons, the American Society of General \n     Surgeons, and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. Three \n     past presidents of the American Medical Association--Donald \n     J. Palmisano, M.D., William G. Plested III, M.D., and Daniel \n     H. Johnson Jr., M.D.--also signed the letter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 December 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The undersigned state and national \n     specialty medical societies are writing you on behalf of more \n     than 92,000 physicians in opposition to passage of the \n     ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act'' (H.R. 3590) \n     and to urge you to draft a more targeted bill that will \n     reform the country's flawed system for financing healthcare, \n     while preserving the best healthcare in the world. While \n     continuance of the status quo is not acceptable, the shifting \n     to the federal government of so much control over medical \n     decisions is not justified. We are therefore united in our \n     resolve to achieve health system reform that empowers \n     patients and preserves the practice of medicine--without \n     creating a huge government bureaucracy.\n       H.R. 3590 creates a number of problematic provisions, \n     including:\n       The bill undermines the patient-physician relationship and \n     empowers the federal government with even greater authority. \n     Under the bill, (1) employers would be required to provide \n     health insurance or face financial penalties; (2) health \n     insurance packages with government prescribed benefits will \n     be mandatory; (3) doctors would be forced to participate in \n     the flawed Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) or \n     face penalties for\n\n[[Page S13563]]\n\n     nonparticipation; and (4) physicians would have to comply \n     with extensive new reporting requirements related to quality \n     improvement, case management, care coordination, chronic \n     disease management, and use of health information technology.\n       The bill is unsustainable from a financial standpoint. It \n     significantly expands Medicaid eligibility, shifting \n     healthcare costs to physicians who are paid below the cost of \n     delivering care and to the states that are already operating \n     under severe budget constraints. It also postpones the start \n     of subsidies for the uninsured long after the government \n     levies new user fees and new taxes to cover expanded coverage \n     and benefits. This ``back-loading'' of new spending makes the \n     long-term costs appear deceptively low.\n       The government run community health insurance option \n     eventually will lead to a single-payer, government run \n     healthcare system. Despite the state opt-out provision, the \n     community health insurance option contains the same \n     liabilities (i.e. government-run healthcare) as the public \n     option that was passed by the House of Representatives. Such \n     a system will ultimately limit patient choice and put the \n     government between the doctor and the patient, interfering \n     with patient care decisions.\n       Largely unchecked by Congress or the courts, the federal \n     government would have unprecedented authority to change the \n     Medicare program through the new Independent Medicare \n     Advisory Board and the new Center for Medicare & Medicaid \n     Innovation. Specifically, these entities could arbitrarily \n     reduce payments to physicians for valuable, life-saving care \n     for elderly patients, reducing treatment options in a \n     dramatic way.\n       The bill is devoid of real medical liability reform \n     measures that reduce costs in proven demonstrable ways. \n     Instead, it contains a ``Sense of the Senate'' encouraging \n     states to develop and test alternatives to the current civil \n     litigation system as a way of addressing the medical \n     liability problem. Given the fact that costs remain a \n     significant concern, Congress should enact reasonable \n     measures to reduce costs. The Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) recently confirmed that enacting a comprehensive set of \n     tort reforms will save the federal government $54 billion \n     over 10 years. These savings could help offset increased \n     health insurance premiums (which, according to the CBO, are \n     expected to increase under the bill) or other costs of the \n     bill.\n       The temporary one-year SGR ``patch'' to replace the 21.2 \n     percent payment cut in 2010 with a 0.5 percent payment \n     increase fails to address the serious underlying problems \n     with the current Medicare physician payment system and \n     compounds the accumulated SGR debt, causing payment cuts of \n     nearly 25 percent in 2011. The CBO has confirmed that a \n     significant reduction in physicians' Medicare payments will \n     reduce beneficiaries' access to services.\n       The excise tax on elective cosmetic medical procedures in \n     the bill will not produce the revenue projected. Experience \n     at the state level has demonstrated that this is a failed \n     policy. In addition, this provision is arbitrary, difficult \n     to administer, unfairly puts the physician in the role of tax \n     collector, and raises serious patient confidentiality issues. \n     Physicians strongly oppose the use of provider taxes or fees \n     of any kind to fund healthcare programs or to finance health \n     system reform.\n       Our concerns about this legislation also extend to what is \n     not in the bill. The right to privately contract is a \n     touchstone of American freedom and liberty. Patients should \n     have the right to choose their doctor and enter into \n     agreements for the fees for those services without penalty. \n     Current Medicare patients are denied that right. By \n     guaranteeing all patients the right to privately contract \n     with their physicians, without penalty, patients will have \n     greater access to physicians and the government will have \n     budget certainty. Nothing in the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act addresses these fundamental tenets, which \n     we believe are essential components of real health system \n     reform.\n       Senator Reid, we are at a critical moment in history. \n     America's physicians deliver the best medical care in the \n     world, yet the systems that have been developed to finance \n     the delivery of that care to patients have failed. With \n     congressional action upon us, we are at a crossroads. One \n     path accepts as ``necessary'' a substantial increase in \n     federal government control over how medical care is delivered \n     and financed. We believe the better path is one that allows \n     patients and physicians to take a more direct role in their \n     healthcare decisions. By encouraging patients to own their \n     health insurance policies and by allowing them to freely \n     exercise their right to privately contract with the physician \n     of their choice, healthcare decisions will be made by \n     patients and physicians and not by the government or other \n     third party payers.\n       We urge you to slow down, take a step back, and change the \n     direction of current reform efforts so we get it right for \n     our patients and our profession. We have a prescription for \n     reform that will work for all Americans, and we are happy to \n     share these solutions with you to improve our nation's \n     healthcare system.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         Medical Association of the State of Alabama; Medical \n           Society of Delaware; Medical Society of the District of \n           Columbia; Florida Medical Association; Medical \n           Association of Georgia; Kansas Medical Society; \n           Louisiana State Medical Society; Missouri State Medical \n           Association; Nebraska Medical Association Medical \n           Society of New Jersey; South Carolina Medical \n           Association; American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery; \n           American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive \n           Surgery; American Association of Neurological Surgeons; \n           American Society of Breast Surgeons; American Society \n           of General Surgeons; Congress of Neurological Surgeons.\n         Past Presidents of the American Medical Association: \n           Daniel H. Johnson, Jr., MD, AMA President 1996-1997; \n           Donald J. Palmisano, MD, JD, FACS, AMA President 2003-\n           2004; William G. Plested III, MD, FACS, AMA President \n           2006-2007.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I want to tell my colleagues what these letters say. The \nfirst one is to me from Gary Richter, the president of the Medical \nAssociation of Georgia. He writes in great detail about the \ndifficulties and problems they have with this legislation, beginning \nwith the stonewall against tort reform by only putting in a \ndemonstration project.\n  The Senator from Texas is aware of what tort reform can do because \nhis State has made a great improvement in medical malpractice costs \nbecause of tort reform, and we in Georgia have tried to experience the \nsame type of thing.\n  There are many other reasons in here as well. The interesting thing \nabout the letter from the 92,000 physicians represented by their \nmedical associations is they talk not only about what is in the bill \nbut what is not in the bill. I want to read, if I may, one paragraph to \ndemonstrate that point:\n\n       Our concerns about this legislation also extend to what is \n     not in the bill. The right to privately contract is a \n     touchstone of American freedom and liberty. Patients should \n     have the right to choose their doctor and enter into \n     agreements for the fees for those services without penalty. \n     Current Medicare patients are denied that right. By \n     guaranteeing all patients the right to privately contract \n     with their physicians, without penalty, patients will have \n     greater access to physicians and the government will have \n     budget certainty. Nothing in the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act addresses these fundamental tenets, which \n     we believe are essential components of real health system \n     reform.\n\n  That is a pretty strong statement from 92,000 American physicians \nabout this particular piece of legislation.\n  To follow up on the point made by the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina, I have a vested interest. I just got my Medicare card. \nDecember 1 I became Medicare eligible. When you talk about cutting $470 \nbillion, it gets personal. It gets personal with all those other \nseniors.\n  Think about this. Seniors in America have paid their entire lives, at \nleast since 1966 when it was created, They have paid a tax and their \nemployers have paid a payroll tax to go into a trust fund to pay for \ntheir health care after they are 65 years old.\n  We are now basically saying, I say to the Senator from South \nCarolina, we are taking $470 billion of the tax money you have paid \nover years of work and we are going to put it in a plan to pay for \nsomebody else's health care. That is basically what it does, and that \nis patently wrong.\n  One other thing I want to mention that is critical to me. We are all \nprofessionals at what we do. We all argue from our point of view. I \nunderstand that and respect that. But something was said earlier today \nwhich draws me to have a flashback to make the point about how much we \ntried on this side to contribute to improvements in health care and \nbetter access for all.\n  The very distinguished majority whip said he talked with realtors and \nthat three in four realtors were uninsured and this would help. The \nreason they are uninsured is they are not able to form risk groups \ntogether associated and affiliated as a like practice. Because of the \nIRS Code, which this does not amend, a company's employer, who has \nindependent contractors working for them, cannot by law provide them \nwith medical insurance.\n  In 2006 on the floor of the Senate, 57 Republicans and Democrats \noffered and voted for the associated health care bill or the small \nbusiness access to health reform--57 out of 100. We needed 60 like this \nbill needs to get to cloture. That bill would have allowed associated \nprofessions to join together, compete for insurance nationwide, form\n\n[[Page S13564]]\n\nrisk pools that are large enough to mediate and ameliorate high rates \nand have a more competitive rate.\n  He was correct in his statement that three in four do not have health \ninsurance. I was in that business. I know. The reason they do not is \nbecause they have to buy on the spot market because they cannot have a \ngroup plan. When they buy on the spot market, we are talking about \n$1,500, $1,800, $2,000 a month, which is unaffordable and \nunsustainable. But this bill does nothing to address that situation \nwhich is one of the largest holes in the uninsured problem.\n  In fact, when you see the estimates, those who are still left \nuninsured, a great many of them are going to end up being just those \nkinds of people--- independent contractors that the tax laws prohibit \nfrom associating and affiliating with others. And I was proud to be \npart of that 57, along with the other three distinguished Senators on \nthe floor and a number of Democrats.\n\n  There have been lots of efforts made by people on both sides to get \nus better access and affordable health care. But, unfortunately, they \nhave been blocked all over this philosophic argument of whether health \ncare is going to be government provided or competitive in the private \nsector. Unfortunately, the ship of state is moving toward the \ngovernment provision with this legislation, which is one of the reasons \nI oppose it.\n  I turn it back to the distinguished senior Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I rise to pose a question to the Senator, and I would \nask my colleagues to comment with respect to their States.\n  The Senator served in the State legislature for many years, and is \nvery familiar with our SCHIP program, which is called PeachCare, and he \nis also familiar with the rising Medicaid costs that we have seen in \nour State. What this bill does, in seeking to reach out, as I \nunderstand, is to expand the eligibility for Medicaid. We are all for \nMedicare, but this raises the eligibility level for Medicaid from 100 \npercent of the poverty level to 150 percent of the poverty level. That \nwill have a huge impact on every single State that is now going through \nvery difficult financial times.\n  We in Georgia have had a $3 billion shortfall this past year that had \nto be plugged. I saw the other day in the press where we have almost \nanother $2 billion our legislature is going to have to deal with next \nmonth in reducing services around our State. Every State is having that \nsame experience. Yet what this bill does is to put a mandate on States \nto increase the amount of money that States put into Medicaid. I know \nthe Senator is very familiar with that, and I would ask him to comment.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I appreciate the Senator bringing it up. It is what is \nknown in the trade as an unfunded mandate, but I will put some meat on \nthat bone.\n  This year the State of Georgia had a budget of about $17 billion, and \nthe Medicaid portion--just the Medicaid portion in Georgia--was over $2 \nbillion. So it is approaching, or getting close to, 16, 17, or 18 \npercent of the entire budget. If this bill passes raising the \neligibility from 100 percent to 150 percent, then in 2017--which is the \ntrigger date on this Medicaid provision--Georgia would go from $2.15 \nbillion to over $3\\1/4\\ billion in its share of Medicaid, and this at a \ntime of declining revenues and greater pressure. That is a recipe for \ndisaster.\n  Our State, like 43 other States in the United States, can't borrow \nmoney. We have to have a balanced budget. If the Federal Government \nmandates that we spend $3 billion, we have to cut it out of someplace \nelse in our State, such as education or our prisons or the park system \nor somewhere else.\n  But it is ironic that Senator Chambliss asked me that question \nbecause this morning, as I was preparing to come over, I had the \ntelevision on, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor of California, was \nbeing interviewed. He endorsed this provision originally, but he raised \nthe question that the provisions in this amendment will raise by $3 \nbillion the cost of Medicaid, just in the State of California--a State \nthat had a $60 billion shortfall last year, and next year, he \nestimates, will have a $20 billion shortfall. If we continue in \nWashington to mandate funding and don't put our money behind it, we are \npushing our States to the brink of bankruptcy, where a number of them \nalready are. It is not fair to say we are covering more people when we \nare bankrupting our States. We are not covering anybody if we are \npushing the cost off on someone else.\n  So I appreciate the senior Senator from Georgia raising that point, \nand I associate myself with Governor Schwarzenegger and his remarks \nthis morning about urging us not to force unfunded mandates on our \nStates.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I can respond to the senior and junior Senators from \nGeorgia on this point, my State population is 24 million. Over a 10-\nyear period of time, this is a $20 billion unfunded mandate--$20 \nbillion. Of course, we know--or at least we read and hear from some in \nthe press--that not all States are going to be treated the same. That \nwas, in fact, an inducement on the part of some Senators to vote for \nthe bill--to be one of the 60 votes--because they were either going to \nget a sweetener, in terms of being held harmless for at least a portion \nof that, or in the case of Nebraska, I guess all of it.\n  That strikes me as fundamentally unfair, but it also demonstrates the \nflaw in the way this bill has been negotiated. In order to try to get \nto the 60 votes, there has basically been a pay-to-play sort of \napproach to this, and it is just repulsive to me, frankly. Certainly, a \nlot of my constituents would wonder: What kind of games are going on \nthere?\n  I know the Senator from South Carolina has some thoughts about that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, this started out as a noble effort to reform health \ncare because it needs reforming. The inflationary cost of the \ngovernment is unsustainable. Medicare and Medicaid, as the Senators \nfrom Georgia indicated, are becoming huge problems that are \nunsustainable. Medicare is $36 trillion underfunded.\n  Now, what does that mean? It means that over the next 75 years, there \nis a $36 trillion shortfall of money to pay the benefits that have been \npromised, and that has to be dealt with.\n  What we are doing to Medicare makes the problem worse, not better. \nMedicaid is the largest expense in my State. It is a matching program. \nSo listen to this--if you are out there on a Sunday with nothing else \nto do but listen to me. If you don't live in Nebraska, here is what is \ncoming your way. Your State will be required to cover more people under \nMedicaid because the eligibility goes up to 133 percent above poverty, \nwhich is an increase over the current system. So throughout the Nation, \nthere are going to be thousands more people enrolled in Medicaid, and \nevery State, except one, is going to have to come up with matching \nmoney.\n  I have 12 percent unemployment in South Carolina. My State is on its \nknees. I have a 31-percent African American population in South \nCarolina. Yet how did the majority get the 60th vote on this bill? It \nwas the weekend before Christmas, and they were one vote short--here is \nwhat they did to get that one vote. They had a deal cooked up that no \none knew about but the two people talking. There was no input from \nanybody other than the majority leader and the Senator from Nebraska. \nAfter that meeting was over, they came up with a 380-page amendment to \na 2,000-page bill. They filed it yesterday, and we made them read it. \nWe heard it for the first time yesterday. Then the majority leader \nfilled up the tree so that there is no ability by any Republican or \nDemocrat to amend their work product.\n  This is a transparent new way of doing business: you cook up a deal \nin a back room--that is essentially sleazy, in my view--to allow one \nState, in order to get that vote, be held harmless for Medicare \nenrollees, and the rest of us have to go home and hear our constituents \nsay: Why can't you in South Carolina and Georgia get that deal? What \nkind of Senator are you?\n  Well, I will tell you; this is the kind of Senators we are. We are \nnot going to do that. We are not going to put the whole Nation at risk \nand take a broken system and make it worse just to get a vote. No way \nin hell.\n  On abortion, you are either for it or against it or you are \nindifferent. You can be whatever you are on abortion and be just as \ngood an American as I am. I am pro-life and proud of it. Most of us in \nAmerica, whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, don't want our Federal \ntaxpayer dollars to be used to pay\n\n[[Page S13565]]\n\nfor abortions. For 32 years, the Hyde amendment has been the law of the \nland, preventing taxpayer dollars to be used for abortion. In this \nhealth care reform, guess what. That is exactly what is going to \nhappen. There is a brave Democrat in the Congress--Bart Stupak, from a \nblue State--who stood up to his Democratic leadership and said: I will \nnot vote for a bill that allows Federal taxpayer dollars in the form of \nsubsidies to be used to fund abortion because I find that morally \noffensive, and I think most Americans agree with me. He brought the \nHouse to its knees, saying: You will not pass this bill to use \nfederally funded Federal dollars to fund abortion.\n\n  What did he get out of it? Nothing. Not one thing for Wisconsin. He \ngot out of that deal the pride of knowing that he stood up for the \nunborn.\n  So the bill comes to the Senate, and Senator Nelson from Nebraska \ntries to introduce the Stupak language that would be an absolute bar \nfrom using taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. He lost that amendment. \nHe said he could not vote for a bill that would allow taxpayer dollars \nto be used to fund abortion. But then he gets in a room with Senator \nReid, and he comes up with a compromise and he claims it solves the \nproblem. The problem is, his claim is not accepted by all those who \nfollow this. The compromise he has achieved on abortion is a miserable \nfailure.\n  Congressman Stupak says it is unacceptable. The National Right to \nLife Committee says it is unacceptable. The Nebraska Right to Life \nCommittee says it is unacceptable. The Council of Catholic Bishops says \nit is unacceptable. There is not one pro-life group in this country \nthat believes Senator Nelson has protected the rights of the unborn. So \nhow, in good conscience, do you vote for a bill when that was the big \nissue?\n  At the end of the day--one last thought--this bill would make an \nEnron accountant blush. They are talking about how it lowers the \ndeficit by $132 billion. But they do not tell you that the $247 billion \ndoctor fix is not in the bill. What am I saying? Over the next 10 \nyears, doctors, under the 1997 balanced budget agreement, will have \n$247 billion taken out of their practices unless Congress acts.\n  Since 1997, Congress, every year, has stepped to the plate and \nforgiven that cut, which is double digits. Everybody knows we are going \nto do that. But when it came to health care reform, they left out the \ndoctor fix because if you include it, it no longer is revenue neutral. \nIt no longer does what they say.\n  They say this bill cuts the deficit by $132 billion, but if you \ninclude the $247 billion, it runs up the deficit in the first 10 years, \nand in the second 10 years it adds $2 trillion to the deficit.\n  Long story short, this is what Enron did. People went to jail for \ndoing this in the private sector. They took the liabilities of the \ncompany and they hid them, making their balance sheet look better than \nit actually was. So when you hear this reduces the deficit by $132 \nbillion, they took out a liability that they know we are going to fund, \njust to cook the books.\n  If this is going to be OK for the country, then we have no hope as a \nNation of ever solving any hard problem. And I would like to say to my \ncolleagues: I know you want to be home. I know everybody on the other \nside wants to be home. I know you want to find ways to solve hard \nproblems. Troops in Afghanistan want to be home, too. At least they are \naway from home for a noble purpose. We are here trying to stop a \nlegislative process that, if it becomes legitimate--if this becomes the \nOK way of doing business, giving one Senator a deal you will not give \nanybody else and putting the whole country at risk just to get one \nvote--then I hope the American people will rise up in righteous \nindignation and throw us all out because nobody should be representing \nthe country this way.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator from South Carolina raises the point about \nthis bill being revenue neutral and it actually decreases the deficit. \nHow do they achieve that? They achieve that through some truly Enron \naccounting, as the Senator from South Carolina just said. But here is \nwhat happens: There is a certain amount of money that is projected by \nCBO to be generated in insurance premiums being paid by young \nindividuals across this country under what is called the CLASS Act. The \nCLASS Act is a new health care-generated program, a new entitlement \nprogram that is included in this bill that is going to provide long-\nterm care benefits for young, healthy Americans who, ultimately, are \ngoing to become invalid and need that long-term care.\n  Well, the fallacy in the numbers game that is being played is that \nCBO is saying it is true there will be a projection that we are going \nto save--the projection they are using says we are going to generate \npremiums from these young people who are not going to be entitled to \nthe benefits under this bill for 20, 30, 40 years from now. But even \nCBO recognizes that when these benefits begin being paid out, there is \ngoing to be an entitlement created that is going to blow the budget of \nthis particular new program all the way out the top.\n  In fact, the chairman of the Budget Committee, a Democrat from North \nDakota whom I admire and respect so much, has even said this particular \nprovision in this bill is a Ponzi scheme. It is something Bernie Madoff \nwould love. Yet here they are with straight faces on the other side of \nthe aisle coming in and saying we are really going to reduce the \ndeficit by passing this provision called the CLASS Act. It is beyond me \nhow anybody, with a straight face, can say that is actually a fact.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Isn't it true that is what is wrong with Social Security \ntoday? We have spent it for years and years rather than putting it in a \ntrust fund, and now the baby boomers are going: The money is not there? \nIsn't that the same thing?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator is exactly right, and exactly the same \nsituation with Medicare.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Just a question on a followup on the fiscal part the \nSenator from South Carolina brought up. It is also still true that the \ntaxes on this bill begin in 11 days--January 1, 2010--but the benefits \nbegin on January 1, 2014, and in that score of the first 10 years of \ncost, you have years of program that are not costing anything while you \nare raising revenues. So it is a ruse and a masking of the actual \nfiscal effect on the United States of America.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The only way Senator Reid could get the score that he \nkept going back and forth with the Congressional Budget Office on was \nto make sure the taxes started immediately. And they will. He has \nincreased taxes by $26 billion to come up with a proposal that he says \nis revenue neutral. That is an additional $26 billion. So it makes it a \ntotal of $518.5 billion in new taxes that are going to be paid by hard-\nworking, tax-paying Americans, and no benefits under this bill are \ngoing to start accruing until the year 2014.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask the senior Senator from Georgia, does he remember \nthis statement by President Obama? He said he will not sign a plan that \nadds one dime to our deficits, either now or in the future, period. Yet \nDavid Broder, perhaps one of the most respected journalists here in \nWashington, DC, who has been around a long time, said he has talked to \nall the experts and everybody he has talked to said these bills as they \nstand are ``budget-busters.'' Of course, I am sure the Senator also \nremembers a Washington Post-ABC poll that said 66 percent of those who \nresponded to the poll think this bill will make the deficit worse, not \nbetter.\n  In other words, we have a credibility problem between what is being \npromised here by the President and presumably by the proponents of this \nbill and the American people because they simply do not buy it. They do \nnot believe it. Maybe that is why that earlier number from the \nRasmussen poll said a majority of Americans do not want us to pass this \nbill but, rather, want us to start over and take a step-by-step or \nincremental approach.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. There is just no question but that the American people \nunderstand this. They get it. When we talk about cutting Medicare by \n$450 billion, do they really not think the quality of care under \nMedicare is going\n\n[[Page S13566]]\n\nto be diminished? Of course it is. Do the American people really think \nwe are not going to have an increase in the deficit when we are going \nto have almost a trillion-dollar bill in real, live dollars that is \ngoing to be passed by this body in the next couple of days, in all \nprobability? Surely the American people get that. They know this is \ngoing to increase the cost of health care and it is going to increase \nthe deficit. That is why they are opposed to this.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Sure.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let's talk about the CLASS Act a little bit more. It is a \nnew program that doesn't exist today where the Federal Government, as I \nunderstand it, will be offering long-term health care insurance to the \nAmerican people. It is a voluntary program at first, just like \neverything else around here. Guess who is going to sign up. It is \ncalled adverse selection. The sickest people in the country are going \nto sign up.\n  Under the bill as it is written, it is just like what Senator Isakson \nsaid about the underlying bill. You collect taxes for 10 years; you pay \nout benefits for 6. That is the way you get the money to make the \nnumbers come out right.\n  Guess what happens in this CLASS Act, the new program no one has \nheard much about. You start collecting premiums in 2011, but you don't \npay any benefits until 2016. Guess what happens. That generates $73 \nbillion of money to be used to say to the American people that this \nbill is paid for. But when you ask the CBO about what happens after \n2016, they say that by 2029, I think it is, the whole thing falls apart \nbecause the only people in the program are the sickest folks because it \nis a voluntary program, and at the end of the day, you have created a \nnew entitlement, and everybody in this body is going to be rushing to \nsubsidize premiums and get more people into this system. It will be \nanother entitlement that grows, and CBO says it will be a death blow to \nour fiscal soundness.\n  I ask the Senator from Georgia, when Senator Conrad, whom we all \nrespect, said this is a giant Ponzi scheme that Bernie Madoff would \nhave been proud of, do you think that is what he meant? You collect \npremiums and you make it look as if you have money you really do not \nhave and you put off paying out benefits. And at the end of the day, \nwould the Senator agree with me--I have a letter from October 23, 2009, \nfrom Senators Conrad, Landrieu, Lincoln, Warner, Lieberman, Bayh, and \nNelson to the majority leader saying: Please take the CLASS Act out of \nthe bill.\n  Would the Senator agree that the CLASS Act is still in the bill and \nthat anybody who votes to send this off to the President to become law \nhas become a coconspirator to the giant Ponzi scheme?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I don't think there is any question about that. The \nSenator is exactly right. It is what we in Washington call fuzzy math--\nutilization of money from one pocket to pay for something on the other \nside. At the end of the day, it just does not add up. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota was exactly right, it is a huge Ponzi scheme.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter \ndated October 23, 2009, just referenced by the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: We write regarding the merger of the \n     Finance and HELP Committee health reform bills. We know you \n     face a great many difficult decisions now, one of which is \n     whether to include provisions from the HELP Committee bill \n     known as the CLASS Act in the merged bill.\n       We urge you not to include these provisions in the Senate's \n     merged bill, nor to use the savings as an offset for other \n     health items in the merger.\n       While the goals of the CLASS Act are laudable--finding a \n     way to provide long term care insurance to individuals--the \n     effect of including this legislation in the merged Senate \n     bill would not be fiscally responsible for several reasons.\n       CBO currently estimates the CLASS Act would reduce the \n     deficit by $73 billion over ten years. But nearly all the \n     savings result from the fact that the initial payout of \n     benefits wouldn't begin until 2016 even though the program \n     begins collecting premiums in 2011. It is also clear that the \n     legislation increases the deficit in decades following the \n     first ten years. CBO has confirmed that the legislation \n     stand-alone would face a long-term deficit point of order in \n     the Senate.\n       Some have argued that the program is actuarially sound. But \n     this is the case because premiums are collected and placed in \n     a trust fund, which begins earning interest, and because the \n     HHS Secretary is instructed to increase premiums to maintain \n     actuarial solvency. We have grave concerns that the real \n     effect of the provisions would be to create a new federal \n     entitlement program with large, long-term spending increases \n     that far exceed revenues. This is especially the case if \n     savings from the first decade of the program are spent on \n     other health reform priorities.\n       Slowing the growth of health care costs should be a top \n     priority as we move forward with health reform. Inclusion of \n     the CLASS Act would reduce the amount of long-term cost \n     savings that would otherwise occur in the merged bill. The \n     CLASS Act bends the health care cost curve in the wrong \n     direction and should not be used to help pay for other health \n     provisions that will become more expensive over time and \n     increase deficits.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We hope that fiscally \n     responsible measures to improve access to long-term care can \n     be considered in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kent Conrad.\n     Mary L. Landrieu.\n     Blanche L. Lincoln.\n     Mark R. Warner.\n     Joseph I. Lieberman.\n     Evan Bayh.\n     Ben Nelson.\n       U.S. Senators.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am wondering if the Senator would yield for a question \nsince we have a unanimous consent for a colloquy.\n  The Senator was talking about this a little earlier, but one of the \nthings that has not been adequately discussed and because of the way \nthis bill has been railroaded and we have been denied an opportunity to \noffer amendments and we will be voting on the bill on Christmas Eve, as \nit is currently scheduled, I want to ask about the impact on \nbusinesses. You were in the real estate business and employed a number \nof people in your company. You had to meet a payroll and make sure you \nended up in the black and not in the red.\n  One of the things the National Federation of Independent Business \nsaid was that this bill will actually increase health care costs for \nbusinesses and the cost of doing business. I can't imagine anything \nworse that we could be doing during a recession, during a time when \nunemployment is at 10 percent, than making it more expensive to do \nbusiness and thus keep people on your payroll. Won't that be the impact \nof this, with higher taxes, with increased health care costs going to \nemployers, that it is actually going to make the unemployment problem \nworse rather than better?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I think the Senator from Texas is exactly right. I will \nbe the first to tell you, I am in the process of reading the 400-some-\nodd page managers' amendment. I haven't read all of it yet. It does \ntake out the public option, which, by the way, that was originally in. \nIt still may reappear at some date in the future. That was a real \nkiller. That raised tremendous costs. In fact, it made it more \nbeneficial for a company not to provide insurance and pay the fine and \nput people in the government option. That is not in the bill now, I \nunderstand that.\n  But let me tell you what is in the bill. What is in the bill are a \nnumber of taxes on small businesses that produce medical devices and \nmedical treatments. You know as well as I do that when the government \nraises your taxes, you have to raise your price to the consumer. What \ndoes that mean? It is not lowering the cost of health care. It is, \nthrough the tax mechanism, raising the cost of health care, either to \nthe insurance company that is in the exchange or to Medicaid or to \nMedicare or to the individual person in terms of their copayments.\n  You cannot hide the fact that when you are raising those types of \nrevenues--$514 billion; $50 billion a year over 10 years--that money is \ngoing to ultimately be paid by the consumer of health care. It may be \npaid by the company on its tax return, but it is a pass-through cost \nthat they are going to pass through to their consumer, which in turn is \ngoing to put more pressure on whoever insures that consumer, if, in \nfact, they are insured. So anytime\n\n[[Page S13567]]\n\nthe government raises taxes, it raises the cost of living for the \nAmerican people. That is just a common, well-known fact. The Senator is \nexactly correct.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. We have talked a little bit about the negotiations \nthat took place behind closed doors over the last few days. It is \nunfortunate that we have gotten to the point in this body and on this \nparticular piece of legislation where the issue of abortion has \ninjected itself into meaningful and affordable health care reform \nmeasures. But that is, in fact, what has happened. Similar to my friend \nfrom South Carolina, I am pro-life. We all are. I am very proud to be \nand have a strong voting record on that. The law of the land for well \nover 30 years has been that no Federal funds should be used to fund \nabortions. It makes no difference whether you are in one part of the \ncountry or the other; that is the law. That is the way it ought to be. \nIt ought not to be changed.\n  We have had any number of votes on abortion issues over the years. In \nevery instance, we have failed to pass a law that would provide for the \nuse of Federal funds for abortions. That is changing. Irrespective of \nwhat the Senator from Nebraska thinks he negotiated, that has changed.\n  I have three letters I will include for the Record. One is pretty \ninteresting because it is from a group of African-American ministers in \nmy home State. This group is headed by Bishop Wellington Boone. He \nwrote me a letter yesterday. Here is part of what he says:\n\n       We cannot emphasize enough that abortion is not health \n     care.\n\n  He is absolutely right.\n  There is also a letter from Cindy O'Keary, executive director of the \nHOPE Center in Woodstock, GA, who is appalled at the discussions and \nthe fact that we now are going to be using Federal money to fund \nabortions, and also a letter from Sadie Fields, State chairman of the \nGeorgia Christian Alliance, imploring us not to pass any kind of bill \nthat sets the precedent of providing Federal funds for the use of \nabortion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have all three letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Wellington Boone Ministries,\n\n                                  Norcross, GA, December 19, 2009.\n     Senator Saxby Chambliss,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: We would like to take the time to \n     thank you for your service to our country and to the citizens \n     of Georgia. We thank you and your colleagues in the Senate \n     who have stood against the terrible healthcare bill which \n     mocks reform and increases taxes, debt and federal power \n     while decreasing the freedom that Georgians value so highly. \n     All of these concerns, however, pale in comparison to fact \n     that the Senate version of the bill opens the door for the \n     federal funding of abortion.\n       Those of us who have stood for life over the years have \n     long known that the abortion lobby would never be satisfied \n     with the mere legalization of abortion: they want it to be \n     paid for by taxpayers. Many of your nominally pro-life \n     colleagues have proven that their support of human life has a \n     price: the Manager's amendment does nothing to prevent \n     federal funds from paying for abortion in the federally \n     subsidized healthcare exchanges. The charade that this is \n     some sort of compromise is insulting not only to pro-life \n     activists, but to the overwhelming majority of Americans who \n     don't believe that taxpayer money should pay for abortions.\n       Who will be aborted with this federal money? In Georgia, \n     56% of all abortions are performed on black women and \n     nationwide blacks have lost 35% of their population to \n     abortion since Roe v. Wade. The Senate also opened the door \n     for the federal funding of abortion among the indigenous \n     peoples of this country by excluding the Hyde amendment from \n     the reauthorization of the Indian Health Service. Perhaps \n     your colleagues in the Senate are not satisfied with how few \n     American Indians there are left.\n       We cannot emphasize enough that abortion is NOT healthcare. \n     It seems some members of the Senate want to take a practice \n     that was supposed to be ``safe, legal and rare'' and make it \n     ``common, legal and subsidized.'' To overturn longstanding \n     policy restricting the federal funding of the destruction of \n     American lives while calling it ``healthcare'' is nothing \n     short of evil.\n       We remain strongly opposed to the use of our tax dollars to \n     fund abortion. We ask you, as our Senator, not to let your \n     colleagues forget the line they are crossing if they vote for \n     cloture. Only time will tell if they can escape judgment for \n     their vote in their home states. But there is one Judgment \n     not one of us can escape. Your colleagues who have not yet \n     turned their backs on that Judge would do well to remember \n     this as they cast their votes.\n     Bishop Wellington Boone,\n       Fellowship of International Churches.\n     Dr. Creflo Dollar,\n       Creflo Dollar Ministries.\n     Dr. Alveda King,\n       King for America.\n     Mr. Dan Becker,\n       Georgia Right to Life.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Cindy O'Leary [cindyhopecenter@bellsouth.net].\n     Sent: Saturday, December 19, 2009, 4:48 p.m.\n     To: Harman, Charlie (Chambliss).\n     Subject: Senate Discussion and Vote on Health Care \n         Legislation.\n\n       Senator Chambliss, As a registered nurse and the executive \n     director for a pregnancy resource center that helps women and \n     men explore alternatives to abortion as they seek solutions \n     to what are often unexpected or unplanned pregnancies, I am \n     gravely concerned about the potential impact of government-\n     subsidized abortions, not only for the unborn, but for their \n     parents who may feel overwhelmingly swayed by economic \n     factors to make the most devastatingly wrong decision of \n     their lives.\n       I want to thank you for standing strong tomorrow on the \n     floor of the Senate in expressing the views of your \n     constituents and, according to the recent CNN poll which \n     revealed that six out of ten Americans are opposed to federal \n     funding of abortion, we the people of the United States, as \n     you promote a NO vote on the current health care legislation \n     before the Senate. The only conscionable YES vote will come \n     later for legislation that explicitly excludes the use of \n     federal funds for abortion.\n       It is my understanding that the so-called ``compromise'' \n     language included in Senator Reid's Manager's Amendment would \n     actually ensure that, for the first time EVER, federal funds \n     would be made available for the payment of elective \n     abortions. It is also my understanding that the Manager's \n     Amendment rejects other ``compromise'' proposals on abortion \n     that would have codified the House-approved ``Weldon \n     Amendment'' which prohibits government bodies from \n     discriminating against health care providers. Such \n     compromises included an ``individual'' opt-out from abortion \n     coverage, which the Manager's Amendment does not. The \n     Manager's Amendment rejects even the most broadly accepted \n     agreements on this issue.\n       Thank you for your courageous support for life and for \n     fighting against allowing the government of the people and \n     for the people to pick up the tab for abortions in America.\n                                               Cindy O'Leary, BSN,\n     Executive Director, The HOPE Center.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Georgia Christian Alliance,\n\n                                                December 19, 2009.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: The Georgia Christian Alliance and \n     its 65,000-plus supporters in Georgia strongly object to the \n     language contained in the newest version of the Democrat's \n     Health Care Reform bill that ensures, for the first time \n     ever, federal tax dollars will pay for elective abortions.\n       If this bill passes, millions of pro-life Americans who \n     believe that abortion is biblically and morally wrong will be \n     forced to fund an act that takes an innocent human life. A \n     Gallup Poll conducted in May 2009 finds 51% of Americans \n     identifying themselves as ``pro life'' on the issue of \n     abortion and 42% identifying themselves as ``pro choice.'' \n     This is the first time a majority of U.S. adults have \n     identified themselves as pro-life since Gallup began asking \n     this question in 1995.\n       For weeks, Democrat Senators and Representatives have \n     ensured pro-life Americans they would never vote for a bill \n     that contained federal funding for abortion. It would seem \n     they sold their pro-life position for a bowl of porridge. We \n     are deeply disappointed that they have gone back on their \n     word, and ask you and your colleagues in the U.S. Senate to \n     stand strong for innocent life as this bill moves forward in \n     any Senate vote and in any subsequent conference committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Sadie Fields,\n                                                   State Chairman.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, in closing, let me say, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina said it strongly and he is right: We have reached a \nnew day in this body. We have had deals cut behind closed doors that \nare going to provide benefits for individual Senators and their \nStates--whether Vermont, New Hampshire, Nebraska, Florida, or \nwherever--and that are going to require those of us who didn't have the \nopportunity to participate in the discussions and negotiations on this \nbill to represent to our citizens that they are going to have to pay \nmore for services than everybody all across America gets. There is \nnothing right about that. There is nothing fair about it.\n  I daresay, I have some relatives who live in Nebraska. They have to \nbe embarrassed and ashamed about this. They are going to be getting a \nhuge benefit simply because the Democrats needed 60 votes to pass the \nhealth care bill.\n\n[[Page S13568]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. One last thought, if I may. The Senator mentioned the \npeople in Nebraska. I know there are good, hard-working people all over \nthe country, particularly in Nebraska. A lot has been said about \nNebraska. I hope the people in Nebraska will be heard. This is not \nover. They may get 60 votes in the next couple days, but this is not \nover. We are going into the fourth quarter, and the most valuable \nplayer on our team is the American people. Speak up, speak out. If you \ndon't like what is going on, if you don't like the phony baloney \naccounting, if you are upset about your taxpayer dollars being used to \nfund abortions, speak up. If you think there is a better way of doing \nbusiness, let us know about it. There is a long way to go. It has to go \nback to the House. The House has a say. One Senator indicated the House \nbetter take it or leave it. That is not good government. That is not \nthe way it works. Three of us have been in the House. I want you to \nknow this is far from over. Public opinion matters to us all. To the \nAmerican people who are concerned about this being a done deal, it is \nnot. You can change the outcome. I hope you will get involved. At the \nend of the day, it is your country we are talking about.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, it has been more than a month since the \nmajority leader moved to proceed to the health care bill before us \ntoday. This bill will provide real reform for our Nation's flawed \nhealth care system. This bill is the product of years of hard work, \nstudy, and deliberation in both the Finance Committee and the HELP \nCommittee--and I mean years--all transparent, all aboveboard, all out \nin the open. In fact, in the Finance Committee, we initiated a new \nrequirement that all amendments to the bill would have to be posted in \nadvance on the Internet so everybody could know what they were, the \nsame with the bill itself. The mark was on the Internet for a couple 3 \ndays before we even went to markup. It is unprecedented how open and \ntransparent the process has been. The same is true in the HELP \nCommittee.\n  The culmination of these efforts has been the weeks of debate on this \nbill in the Senate. These provisions have been in the public domain for \na long time. It is true there could be minor changes here and there, \nbut most of this has been in the public domain for a long time. We have \nconsidered numerous amendments. We have engaged in a full and healthy \ndiscussion. The bill before us is fully paid for. It is important to \nkeep reminding colleagues over and over again: This is fully paid for. \nDon't take my word for it. That is what the CBO said. The American \npeople trust and realize, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \na nonpartisan organization, that this bill is fully paid for. It does \nnot add one thin dime to the deficit. You are going to hear others who \ndon't have their own proposals just want to be negative, want to try to \nshoot holes in this, try to say it adds to the deficit. That is their \nopinion. That is not the opinion of the CBO. CBO says it does not add \none thin dime.\n  This bill will also reduce the Federal deficit in the short term and \nover the long term. It reduces the Federal deficit. We are so very \nconcerned about deficits. We in the Congress are and the country is. We \nhave to begin as soon as we can to start getting those deficits down \nand the national debt lowered. This health care reform bill not only \nprovides health insurance coverage and reforms the insurance industry \ndramatically, it also takes the steps of lowering the deficit and \nlowering the long-term debt.\n  Let me quote from the Congressional Budget Office letter of \nyesterday:\n\n       CBO and [Joint Committee on Taxation] estimate that, on \n     balance, the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting \n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act incorporating \n     the managers' amendment would yield a net reduction in \n     federal deficits of $132 billion over the [10-year] period.\n\n  A net reduction of $132 billion. That is even better than the merged \nbill was just before we included the managers' amendment. That was a \n$130 reduction in the national deficit. With the managers' amendment, \naccording to the CBO, there is a net reduction in the Federal deficit \nof $132 billion over the 10-year period. What about later? Often people \nsay: Gee, I hear you, Senator, you are taking care of things in the \nshort term, but you are enacting legislation that will have an adverse \nlong-term effect. That is what you guys do back there.\n  You hear that often. Let me disclose what the Congressional Budget \nOffice says about that. This legislation will reduce the deficit \nmarkedly in the outyears. Here is what the CBO says in a letter \nreleased today:\n\n       All told, the [Congressional Budget Office] expects that \n     the legislation, if enacted, would reduce federal budget \n     deficits over the decade after 2019 relative to those \n     projected under current law--with a total effect during that \n     decade that is in the broad range [of] between one-quarter \n     and one-half percent of GDP.\n\n  What are they saying? They are saying that in the second 10 years, \nthe deficit will be reduced between one-quarter and one-half percent of \nGDP. That is between $630 billion and $1.3 trillion. That is real \nmoney. We are going to reduce the Federal deficit by this legislation \nalone. Let's take the between $630 billion and $1.3 trillion--roughly, \n$1 trillion in the next decade. That is important. That is significant. \nThat is a good start.\n  The legislation before us will extend insurance coverage to more than \n30 million Americans. Think of that, 30 million Americans who today do \nnot have insurance will get health insurance. That is so important. I \nhave forgotten the exact figure, but I remember there was a Harvard \nstudy that concluded that 45,000 Americans die every year because they \nhave no health insurance. Obviously, people without health insurance \ndie earlier, at an earlier age. Just for the sake of their own health, \nit is good those people get health insurance, let alone the benefit to \nhospitals by reducing uncompensated care.\n  This legislation will increase insurance coverage to more than 30 \nmillion Americans. I have just been passed a note that people have a \n40-percent higher chance of dying without health insurance. We are \nsaying to those folks, those 31 million Americans, we are going to \nfigure out a way so you have health insurance so you do not have that \n40-percent higher risk of death.\n  Here is what CBO says about coverage:\n\n       By 2019, the CBO and [Joint Committee on Taxation] estimate \n     that the number of nonelderly people who are uninsured will \n     be reduced by about 31 million.\n\n  CBO goes on to say:\n\n       Under the legislation, the share of legal nonelderly \n     residents with insurance coverage would rise from 83 percent \n     currently to about 94 percent.\n\n  That is 94 percent of the folks in our country, excluding seniors, \nbecause they have insurance under Medicare, excluding them and \nexcluding the unauthorized, the total number of Americans who have \nhealth insurance will rise from the current number of 83 percent to \nabout 94 percent.\n  This legislation will drive down premium costs for virtually all of \nus. It will drive down premium costs for virtually all. In an earlier \nletter, the CBO indicated premiums would go down for roughly 93 percent \nof Americans under the underlying bill. Premiums would go down about 93 \npercent for Americans. I was going to put a table in the record, but \nour rules don't allow us to put tables in, so I summarized. The \nconclusion of that summary is 93 percent of Americans will experience \nlower premiums--not dramatic for some folks but nevertheless down, and \ndown is better than not down.\n  Insurance costs would go down significantly for those receiving tax \ncredits in the new insurance exchanges. It will protect consumers from \nharmful insurance company practices. This is so important. As you know, \nno longer will insurance companies be able to deny coverage for those \nwith preexisting conditions. It is an outrage how much insurance \ncompanies deny coverage based on preexisting conditions. We all hear \nstories many times, if not from direct family members, from friends of \nfamily who run into this. It is so common, especially in the individual \nmarket as people buy insurance for themselves. Insurance companies deny \ncoverage, deny giving health insurance to somebody because of a \npreexisting condition. It is wrong.\n\n  No longer will insurance companies be able to drop coverage for those \nwho are sick. That is very important too. Companies often rescind \nwilly-nilly.\n\n[[Page S13569]]\n\nThey found something in the background of the person, you didn't tell \nus about that so we are rescinding your policy. That is not right. That \nis just not right. We prevent that from happening in this legislation.\n  It will also improve choice and competition in the insurance market. \nWe talk a lot about choice and competition. This legislation provides \nmore choice in choosing policies and more competition in the insurance \nmarket. It will also create a true marketplace where plans compete on \ncost and quality rather than on their ability to cherry-pick the \nhealthiest among us.\n  It will represent the largest tax cut for American families that \nCongress has passed since 2001. This legislation includes the largest \ntax cut for American families that Congress has passed since that tax \ncut bill in 2001, the largest. It is the tax credits people will \nreceive to help them buy insurance. That totals up, I think, to $440 \nbillion. I have forgotten the exact figures. But this is the largest \ntax cut for American families since 2001. It will provide billions of \ndollars in tax credits to help families, workers, and small businesses \nto buy quality, affordable health care insurance. The managers' \namendment makes this good bill even better. It will provide even more \nconsumer protections against harmful insurance industry practices.\n  For example, it will hold companies accountable for excessive premium \nrate increases. It will require them to spend more on consumer benefits \nand less on administrative costs and profits. That is new. That is even \nbetter consumer protection compared with the underlying bill. It will \nrestrict the ability of health plans to impose annual limits on \nbenefits. That is new, restricting the ability of health plans to \nimpose annual limits on benefits. It is wrong if you have an insurance \npolicy that, lo and behold, the company says: We didn't know you were \ngoing to be that sick so we stopped the benefits you can get, annually \nand also lifetime. We do both. We restrict the ability of health plans \nto impose not only annual limits but also lifetime limits on benefits.\n  This managers' package will ensure that companies cannot discriminate \nagainst children with preexisting conditions and do so right away, \nbeginning with plans that become effective midyear next year. The \npreexisting condition restriction would ordinarily not take effect for \na couple years, but for children the preexisting condition prohibition \nwill take effect right away. There are other provisions to help people \nbetween now and 2014. There is high-risk pooling, for example, lots of \ndifferent provisions in this bill which will help people get good \nbenefits and protection very quickly.\n  This legislation will provide tax credits to even more small \nbusinesses. The managers' amendment will provide even more tax credits \nthan the underlying bill. These benefits will now be available right \naway, in 2010. It is also a concern when will the tax credits for small \nbusiness go into effect--shouldn't they go into effect earlier. Under \nthis managers' amendment, these benefits will be available in 2010.\n  This will also provide more health insurance choices through a new \nmultistate option. That option offers consumers the same health \ninsurance Congress has today--no small matter. It will extend extra \nfunding for the Children's Health Insurance Program for 2 additional \nyears. We are all very concerned about kids' health care. The \nchildren's health care program has done a pretty good job. This has \nbeen extended, under the managers' amendment, for an additional 2 \nyears. It will do even more to control rising health care costs and \nreward even more providers for providing quality care to seniors \nthrough the Medicare Program. It will invest $10 billion in community \nhealth centers. They are so important, community health centers, for \nfolks who need help right away and don't have insurance, just need the \ncare right away. Especially in rural communities, it will provide \naccess to critical care where often that care is most needed.\n  These are the reforms which Americans have been waiting for, for \ndecades. Americans are waiting for these changes. They are waiting for \nthese reforms and have been for a long time. Decades may be an \nunderstatement. Our health insurance system just doesn't do what it \nshould for Americans, the people we represent. Finally, we are taking a \nvery significant first step to providing those reforms. These are \nreforms American families, workers, and businesses desperately need. \nThey are reforms on which our economic stability depends. That is no \nsmall matter either. If we get our insurance costs under control, that \nis more economic stability for everyone. It is not just for families \nwho don't know what the insurance company is or is not going to do, it \nis for small businesses that don't know whether premiums will be up or \nby how much next year. Why? It is more economic stability for families \nand small businesses and soon more economic stability for budgets, \nState budgets, our Federal budget.\n\n  We need to get a little more control over all the excessive costs \nthat are going up, and also the volatility, the yo-yo effect that \npremiums have and out-of-pocket cost impositions have on people. This \nwill help them very significantly.\n  So by and large, to be honest--I know this sounds a little naive, \nperhaps--I do not know why this bill does not get an overwhelming \nendorsement. This is a big vote on both sides of the aisle. Then we \ncan, next year, keep going from there; add new provisions that need to \nbe added, correct mistakes that probably this legislation is going to \nhave, but work together because most Americans want us to work together \nback here. They do not like us being partisan or political.\n  I must say, this place is getting a little more partisan over the \nlast couple years than it was earlier. It is not what the American \npeople want. They want us to do our job, do what is right. This bill \nclearly is in the bounds of reasonableness of what is right and what is \nthe right thing to do to get control of our health care system.\n  Again, I hope we can get this passed by a large margin. It will pass. \nBut I would like it passed by a large margin.\n  Madam President, I now yield 20 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Whitehouse.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank Chairman Baucus.\n  As we are here in the Senate today, Washington rests under a blanket \nof snow, reminding us here of the Christmas spirit across the Nation, \nthe spirit that is bringing families happily together for the holidays. \nUnfortunately, a different spirit has descended on this Senate. The \nspirit that has descended on the Senate is one described by Chief \nJustice John Marshall back in the Burr trial: ``those malignant and \nvindictive passions which . . . rage in the bosoms of contending \nparties struggling for power.''\n  Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Richard Hofstadter captured some \nexamples in his famous essay, ``The Paranoid Style in American \nPolitics.'' The malignant and vindictive passions often arise, he \npoints out, when an aggrieved minority believes that ``America has been \nlargely taken away from them and their kind, though they are determined \nto try to repossess it and to prevent the final destructive act of \nsubversion.''\n  Does that sound familiar in this health care debate? Forty years ago, \nhe wrote that. Hofstadter continued, those aggrieved fear what he \ndescribed as ``the now familiar sustained conspiracy''--familiar then, \n40 years ago; persistent now--whose supposed purpose, Hofstadter \ndescribed, is ``to undermine free capitalism, to bring the economy \nunder the direction of the federal government, and to pave the way for \nsocialism. . . .'' Again, familiar words here today.\n  More than 50 years ago, he wrote of the dangers of an aggrieved \nrightwing minority, with the power to create what he called ``a \npolitical climate in which the rational pursuit of our well-being and \nsafety would become impossible''--``a political [environment] in which \nthe rational pursuit of our well-being and safety would become \nimpossible.''\n  The malignant and vindictive passions that have descended on the \nSenate are busily creating just such a political climate. Far from \nappealing to the better angels of our nature, too many colleagues are \nembarked on a desperate no-holds-barred mission of propaganda, \nfalsehood, obstruction, and fear.\n\n[[Page S13570]]\n\n  History cautions us of the excesses to which these malignant, \nvindictive passions can ultimately lead: tumbrels have rolled through \ntaunting crowds; broken glass has sparkled in darkened streets; \n``strange fruit'' has hung from southern trees; even this great \ninstitution of government that we share has cowered before a tail \ngunner waving secret lists.\n  Those malignant moments rightly earned what Lord Acton called ``the \nundying penalty which history has the power to inflict on wrong.'' But \nhistory also reminds us that in the heat of those vindictive passions, \nsome people earnestly believed they were justified. Such is the human \ncapacity for intoxication by those malignant and vindictive political \npassions Chief Justice Marshall described. I ask my colleagues to \nconsider what judgment history will inflict on this current spirit that \nhas descended on the Senate.\n  Let's look at what current observers are saying as a possible early \nindicator of the judgment history will inflict. Recently, the editor of \nthe Manchester Journal Inquirer editorial page wrote of the current \nGOP, which he called this ``once great and now mostly shameful party,'' \nthat it ``has gone crazy,'' is ``more and more dominated by the lunatic \nfringe,'' and has ``poisoned itself with hate.'' He concluded, they \n``no longer want to govern. They want to emote.''\n  A well-regarded Philadelphia columnist recently wrote of the \n``conservative paranoia'' and ``lunacy'' on the Republican right. The \nrespected Maureen Dowd, in her eulogy for her friend, William Safire, \nlamented the ``vile and vitriol of today's howling pack of conservative \npundits.''\n  A Washington Post writer with a quarter century of experience \nobserving government, married to a Bush administration official, noted \nabout the House health care bill, ``the appalling amount of \nmisinformation being peddled by its opponents''; she called it a \n``flood of sheer factual misstatements about the health-care bill,'' \nand noted that ``[t]he falsehood-peddling began at the top. . . .''\n  The respected head of the Mayo Clinic described recent health care \nantics as ``scare tactics'' and ``mud.''\n  Congress itself is not immune. Many of us felt President Bush was \nless than truthful, yet not one of us yelled out ``You lie!'' at a \nPresident during a joint session of Congress. Through panics and \ndepressions, through world wars and civil wars, no one ever has--\nnever--until President Obama delivered his first address. And this \nSeptember, 179 Republicans in the House voted to support their heckler \ncomrade. Here in the Senate, this month, one of our Republican \ncolleagues regretted, ``Why didn't I say that?''\n  A Nobel prize-winning economist recently concluded thus:\n\n       The takeover of the Republican Party by the irrational \n     right is no laughing matter. Something unprecedented is \n     happening here--and it's very bad for America.\n\n  History's current verdict is not promising.\n  How are these unprecedented passions manifest in the Senate? Well, \nseveral ways.\n  First, through a campaign of obstruction and delay affecting every \nsingle aspect of the Senate's business. We have crossed the mark of \nover 100 filibusters and acts of procedural obstruction in less than 1 \nyear. Never since the founding of the Republic--not even in the bitter \nsentiments preceding the Civil War--was such a thing ever seen in this \nbody. It is unprecedented.\n  Second, through a campaign of falsehood: about death panels, and cuts \nto Medicare benefits, and benefits for illegal aliens, and bureaucrats \nto be parachuted in between you and your doctor. Our colleagues terrify \nthe public with this parade of imagined horrors. They whip up concerns \nand anxiety about ``socialized medicine'' and careening deficits, and \nthen they tell us: The public is concerned about the bill. Really?\n  Third, we see it in bad behavior. We see it in the long hours of \nreading by the clerks our Republican colleagues have forced. We see it \nin Christmases and holidays ruined by the Republicans for our loyal and \nprofessional Senate employees.\n  It is fine for me. It is fine for the Presiding Officer. We signed up \nfor this job. But why ruin it for all the employees condemned by the \nRepublicans to be here?\n  We see it in simple agreements for Senators to speak broken. We see \nit, tragically, in gentle and distinguished Members, true noblemen of \nthe Senate, who have built reputations of honor and trustworthiness \nover decades being forced to break their word, and doublecross their \ndearest friends and colleagues. We see it in public attacks in the \npress by Senators against the parliamentary staff.\n\n  The parliamentary staff is nonpartisan; they are professional \nemployees of the Senate who cannot answer back. Attacking them is worse \nthan kicking a man when he is down. Attacking them is kicking a man who \nis forbidden to hit back. It is dishonorable.\n  The lowest of the low was the Republican vote against funding and \nsupporting our troops in the field in a time of war. As a device to \nstall health care, they tried to stop the appropriation of funds for \nour soldiers. There is no excuse for that. From that there is no \nreturn. Every single Republican Member was willing to vote against \ncloture on funding our troops, and they admitted it was a tactic to \nobstruct health care reform.\n  The Secretary of Defense warned us all that a ``no'' vote would \nimmediately create a ``serious disruption in the worldwide activities \nof the Department of Defense.'' And yet every one of them was willing \nto vote ``no.'' Almost all of them did vote ``no.'' Some stayed away, \nbut that is the same as ``no'' when you need 60 ``yes'' votes to \nproceed. Voting ``no'' and hiding from the vote are the same result. \nAnd for those of us here on the floor to see it, it was clear: The \nthree who voted ``yes'' did not cast their ``yes'' votes until all 60 \nDemocratic votes had been tallied and it was clear that the result was \na foregone conclusion.\n  And why? Why all this discord and discourtesy, all this \nunprecedented, destructive action? All to break the momentum of our \nnew, young President. They are desperate to break this President. They \nhave ardent supporters who are nearly hysterical at the very election \nof President Barack Obama: the ``birthers,'' the fanatics, the people \nrunning around in rightwing militias and Aryan support groups. It is \nunbearable to them that President Barack Obama should exist. That is \none powerful reason.\n  It is not the only one. The insurance industry, one of the most \npowerful lobbies in politics, is another reason. The bad behavior you \nsee on the Senate floor is the last thrashing throes of the health \ninsurance industry as it watches its business model die. You who are \nwatching and listening know this business model if you or a loved one \nhas been sick: the business model that will not insure you if they \nthink you will get sick or if you have a preexisting condition; the \nbusiness model that, if you are insured and you do get sick, job one is \nto find loopholes to throw you off your coverage and abandon you alone \nto your illness; the business model, when they cannot find that \nloophole, that they will try to interfere with or deny you the care \nyour doctor has ordered; and the business model that, when all else \nfails, and they cannot avoid you or abandon you or deny you, they stiff \nthe doctor and the hospital and deny and delay their payments for as \nlong as possible--or perhaps tell the hospital to collect from you \nfirst, and maybe they will reimburse you.\n  Good riddance to that business model. We know it all too well. It \ndeserves a stake through its cold and greedy heart, but some of our \ncolleagues here are fighting to the death to keep it alive.\n  But the biggest reason for these desperate acts by our colleagues is \nthat we are gathering momentum, and we are gathering strength, and we \nare working toward our goal of passing this legislation. And when we \ndo--when we do--the lying time is over. The American public will see \nwhat actually comes to pass when we pass this bill as our new law. The \nAmerican public will see firsthand the difference between what is and \nwhat they were told.\n  (Mr. FRANKEN assumed the chair.)\n  Facts, as the Presiding Officer has often said, are stubborn things. \nIt is one thing to propagandize and scare people about the unknown. It \nis much tougher to propagandize and scare people when they are seeing \nand feeling and touching something different.\n\n[[Page S13571]]\n\n  When it turns out there are no death panels, when there is no \nbureaucrat between you and your doctor, when the ways your health care \nchanges seem like a good deal to you, and a pretty smart idea--when the \nAmerican public sees the discrepancy between what is and what they were \ntold by the Republicans--there will be a reckoning.\n  There will come a day of judgment about who was telling the truth. \nOur colleagues are behaving in this way--unprecedented, malignant, and \nvindictive--because they are desperate to avoid that day of judgment. \nFrantic and desperate now and willing to do strange and unprecedented \nthings, willing to do anything--even to throw our troops at war--in the \nway of that day of reckoning.\n  If they can cause this bill to fail, the truth will never stand up as \na living reproach to the lies that have been told, and on through \nhistory our colleagues could claim they defeated a terrible \nmonstrosity. But when the bill passes and this program actually comes \nto life and it is friendly, when it shelters 33 million Americans, \nregular American people, in the new security of health insurance, when \nit growls down the most disgraceful abuses of the insurance industry, \nwhen it offers better care, electronic health records, new community \nhealth centers, new opportunities to negotiate fair and square in a \npublic market, and when it brings down the deficit and steers Medicare \ntoward a safe harbor--all of which it does--Americans will then know, \nbeyond any capacity of spin or propaganda to dissuade them, that they \nwere lied to. And they will remember. There will come a day of \njudgment, and our Republican friends know that. That is why they are \nterrified.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank you, and I thank the chair for his \ncourtesy as well.\n  At this time of the year, millions of Americans are out in the stores \ndoing their holiday shopping. That is because we Americans enjoy our \nfree markets and our free enterprise system. Whether it is for a \nholiday or we are shopping for a car or food or a house, we Americans \nbelieve we ought to have quality choices in our marketplace, and \nAmericans, our people, ought to be rewarded when they shop wisely.\n  The American economy works this way for just about everything except \nhealth care. Today, American health care is mostly a competition-free \nzone. Insurance companies enjoy extraordinary privileges as monopolies. \nInsurers are exempt from the antitrust laws, and in scores of American \ntowns, our people can only get their health care under the heel of just \none health insurance company.\n  Today's health insurance market is essentially dysfunctional, and for \nmost Americans, they have no way to hold the insurance companies \naccountable. It has been that way since the middle of the last century, \nsince the days of wage and price controls. For literally 60-plus years, \nAmerican consumers have not been in the position to be able to hold the \ninsurance companies accountable and to get the value for their dollar \nthat they get in every other part of our economy.\n  Changing this broken health care marketplace is the heart of real \nhealth reform. The legislation we will vote on tonight--and, I might \nadd, the chairman of the Finance Committee is on the floor, and this \nessentially began with his white paper when we started working on it in \nthe Finance Committee--the legislation we are going to vote on tonight, \nin my view, starts the long march to empowering consumers, to turning \nthe tables on the insurance lobby, and to getting more value for our \nhealth care dollar. This can be done through a part of the health \nreform debate that got some discussion in the Finance Committee and \nthen, because people liked it and didn't know much about it, has since \nessentially gotten lost in the discussion; that is, the health \ninsurance exchanges.\n  For folks listening at home today, an exchange is going to be like a \nfarmers market. Various types of health plans are going to be marketed \nthrough the exchange, and for the first time--this was an area in which \nChairman Baucus and I had a great interest in the committee--it is \ngoing to be possible for folks to make apples-to-apples comparisons of \nthese various health plans.\n  There are requirements in the bill that keep the low-quality products \nout of the exchange. Chairman Baucus and I got interested in the need \nfor consumer protection particularly early on in programs, back in the \ndays after Medicare got established when seniors were buying 15 or so \nprivate policies to supplement their Medicare and most of them weren't \nworth the paper they were written on. So with these exchanges as they \nare designed, that is not going to happen. People are going to get \nvalue for their dollar on day one.\n  There are also some important consumer protection requirements, and I \nparticularly wish to commend the Presiding Officer of the Senate, whose \nwork I have been following. These consumer protection requirements will \nensure that now when a consumer pays a dollar in a premium, they are \ngoing to get a lot more back in benefits for their dollar. This \nprotection is called a loss ratio. People are going to hear a lot about \nthat concept. It is new, but it essentially means the insurance \ncompanies can't walk off with their premium dollar, use it on \nadministrative expenses, use it on salaries, but will instead return it \nto the public and the consumer in the form of benefits and premiums. I \ncommend the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Minnesota, for ensuring \nthis was all put in place. In my view, these ideas ought to appeal to \nboth Democrats and Republicans--these market-oriented consumer \nprotection principles--simply because they are just common sense.\n  So should section 10108 of Senator Reid's managers' amendment on \nwhich the majority leader, Chairman Baucus, and I worked very closely. \nIt is entitled ``Free Choice Vouchers.'' This section creates something \nthat has never existed before: a concrete way for middle-income \nAmericans who cannot afford their health care to actually push back \nagainst the insurance lobby and force insurance companies to compete \nfor the business of covering those middle-class folks in the insurance \nexchanges. Unlike today, where if a hard-working, middle-class American \ncan't afford just the one health insurance policy available to him and, \nthus, is out of luck, with this new provision, there will be a \ndifferent health care marketplace, with free enterprise choices that \ncan actually drive down costs for the middle class while ensuring those \nchoices are of good quality.\n  So the big hurdle, it seems to me, in setting up a new health care \nmarketplace, which began with Chairman Baucus's white paper in the \nSenate Finance Committee, is getting these exchanges and getting these \nvouchers in place.\n  We are going to be able to build on it. In my view, I think we will \nhave additional opportunities to build on these ideas before the \nlegislation goes to the President. For example, Senator Collins, our \nRepublican colleague from Maine, Senator Bayh, and I have written \nbipartisan legislation that has been endorsed by the influential \nNational Federation of Independent Business and we are working to \ninclude that proposal in this legislation. This bipartisan proposal \nwould permit employers who are in the insurance exchange and who \nvoluntarily choose to do so--let me emphasize that this is a matter of \na voluntary choice by employers--if they choose to do so, they could \ngive their workers a voucher so that those workers could shop for their \ncoverage. What this means is for millions of employers and employees, \nthe amendment would provide the opportunity to have a choice of \nAmerican health care plans.\n  These are unquestionably challenging days for American employers and \nworkers trying to be as competitive as possible in tough global \nmarkets. For employers who want more ways to help their workers and the \nemployers' bottom line and for workers who would like more take-home \npay and lower health expenses, this bipartisan amendment can be a \nlifeline. We hope our colleagues of both parties will agree and join \nour effort, and this can be part of the legislation that ultimately \nwill go to the President.\n  Let me close with this. My great hope is that long after 24/7 cable \nTV has moved on to other topics, Democrats and Republicans here in the \nSenate can figure out a new strategy for\n\n[[Page S13572]]\n\nworking together, a bipartisan strategy that will let us, together, tap \nthe full potential of real health care reform. That potential is for \nholding down costs, getting more value for our health care dollar, and, \nfinally, achieving quality, affordable health coverage for all \nAmericans.\n  I offer this thought because I have long felt both parties have valid \nviews on this topic. I believe our party is absolutely right in saying \nyou cannot fix American health care unless all Americans get good-\nquality, affordable coverage. If you don't do that, too often uninsured \nfolks will shift their bills to insured folks, there won't be enough \nprevention, and you won't be in a position to get the most value for \nthe health care dollar.\n  I continue to believe our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave valid points as well. They make valid points about the role of \nmarketplace forces, the role of competition, the role of choice.\n  There has to be a way in the days ahead--one of the things that has \npleased me is Chairman Baucus has said we are going to have a lot of \noversight hearings and a lot of work in the days ahead to actually \nimplement this. None of us think we can create a new health care \nmarketplace where there hasn't been one for 70 years in a matter of \nminutes. So I am very pleased Chairman Baucus has indicated we will be \ndoing a lot of the painstaking oversight work in the days ahead to \nactually implement this transformation in American health care, and I \nthink the chairman knows I will be his partner in those efforts to get \nthis implemented.\n  So after a year of tough financial hardships, let's find a way to \nbring to this Senate floor bipartisanship, common sense, and the good \nwill that is public service at its best.\n  I close by saying that I look forward to working with the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, who I know shares these views as well.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Oregon \nfor many reasons, one of which is his kind words, which are really \nappreciated but, much more important than that, his long dedication to \nhealth care reform. He even worked for the Gray Panthers way back \nbefore he came here. I remember the name Ron Wyden, Gray Panthers, a \ngood number of years ago. Then, lo and behold, both Houses of Congress \ntogether--we worked together on reforming Medigap coverage. It was an \noutrage. Today we talk about medical loss ratios of maybe 80 percent, \n85 percent, up to 90 percent, and so forth. I can remember back when it \nwas an outrage, the degree to which Medigap insurance coverage had \nmedical loss ratios of not 80 percent, not 70 percent, not 60 percent; \nit would be below 50 percent. Insurance companies were selling \ninsurance to seniors trying to cover that gap between what Medicare \nwould and would not cover, and just tragically low, embarrassingly low, \noutrageously low medical loss ratios.\n  Senator Wyden and I got together and got legislation passed to reform \nthe Medigap market--to make Medigap insurance plans more fair. They \nwere ripping seniors off, there was no doubt about it, and we got that \nchanged.\n  Now, on health care reform, an ardent advocate of more competition, \nmore choice in our health care system--it is clear we need more \ncompetition. It is clear we need more choice. On the competition side, \nin many of our States we find there is only one or two insurance \ncompanies that dominate the entire State. That is very true around our \ncountry. There is just not the competition there should be.\n  In addition, there is not the choice. A lot of employees would like \nto have more choice among insurance companies in their kinds of \npolicies, and so on and so forth. We have a system where most employees \nare tied to their employer; it is pretty much insurance coverage the \nemployer offers.\n  If we were starting from scratch maybe 20, 30, 40, 60, maybe 80 years \nago, we may not have had such an employer-based system as we have \ntoday. Our current Tax Code also tends to encourage excessive insurance \ncoverage because of our employer-based system.\n  Anyway, I am digressing. Senator Wyden got us thinking a lot earlier \nabout the problems that caused, and, frankly, I think he is right. I \nthink a lot of Americans think he is right. You can only take things a \nstep at a time here, and we are probably not going nearly as far as the \nSenator from Oregon wishes to go. But I thank him. He is there, he is \ndogged, and he works hard on behalf of seniors. He is an advocate of \nAmerican consumers, respected by health insurance companies, not \nletting the companies take advantage of citizens. I thank the Senator \nfor that.\n  I do not see any Senators on the floor on our side. If there were, it \nwould be a good time for them to speak. Pending the arrival of the \nDemocratic Senators, let me say a few things about small business.\n  Clearly, one of the goals of health care reform is to ensure that \nemployees of small businesses have good, quality, affordable health \ncare options. We all know that is clear. I have talked to small \nbusinesspeople.\n  I will never forget a conversation I had with a logger who has four \nor five or six people working for him. It was about 2 or 3 years ago. I \nasked him if he had health insurance. He said, yes, for his family--his \nwife and himself.\n  I asked: How about your employees? He said, no; he didn't. You could \ntell he wanted to, and he wasn't just blowing smoke. He clearly wanted \nto provide insurance for his employees, but it just pained him because \nit was too expensive.\n  We all hear stories like that; they are legion. I can remember \ntalking to another small businessman in my State of Montana, a \ncontractor, who has 5, 6, 8, 10, people working for him. He is just \nbeside himself because the insurance company told him his premiums are \ngoing to go up 40 percent next year.\n  He said: Max, I can't deal with that.\n  I asked: Why are they going up 40 percent?\n  He said: Well, they found a preexisting condition with respect to one \nof my employees. He said: Max, I was beside myself. I can't afford a \n40-percent increase. They said it would only be a 20-percent increase \nif I let him go. But he has been with me 15, 20 years and is one of my \nbest employees. I can't let him go.\n  He found another carrier and kept his employee. So he did find \nanother insurance carrier, but he had to pay about a 20-percent \nincrease in premiums. He was able to keep his employee, but that is \njust wrong. It is so hard for small businesses to provide health \ninsurance to their employees. I know it is a trite thing to say, but \nmost jobs in our country are created by small businessmen. That is \nwhere most of the jobs are, and it is where most of the creativity is. \nThat is, in many cases, where the greatest need is to help encourage \nentrepreneurism, American ingenuity, and where a small businessperson \ncan do a good job with the service he is providing.\n  Last year, 62 percent of small businesses did offer health insurance \nto their employees. Compare that with other companies that have, say, \n200 employees. Among all companies in America that have 200 or more \nemployees, 99 percent of them have offered their employees health \ninsurance. Contrast 62 percent of small businesses offer health \ninsurance and 99 percent of businesses with more than 200 employees \noffer health insurance.\n  Among the very small businesses in our country it is lower, lower \nthan 69 percent. Now it is only 49 percent--a very small number of \nemployees--that have health insurance through their small business \nemployer. There are clearly very significant reasons for that. There \nare barriers that prevent small businesses from finding affordable \nhealth insurance options. What are they?\n  Small businesspeople tell us the main reason--at least one of them--\nis that the premiums are just too high. I mentioned an example of the \ncontractor I talked with in my State, who said they are going to charge \na 40-percent increase in premiums as further evidence that premiums are \ntoo high. It is understandable that is one of the main reasons small \nbusinesses can't get health insurance.\n  In the past 10 years, premiums have risen 82 percent for single \nworkers and 93 percent for families employed by small business--\nvirtually doubled premiums in the last 10 years if you are a single \nperson and work for a very small business. That is not true for big \nbusiness.\n\n[[Page S13573]]\n\n  As health care costs rise, small businesses are forced to make \nworkers pay a greater portion of these expensive premiums. In 2008, for \nexample, employees at small businesses that did provide health \ninsurance paid more than twice what they paid just 8 years earlier--\ntwice as much.\n  The low rate of offering and higher cost-sharing responsibilities for \nemployees in small businesses often limit the ability of small \nbusinesses to attract and retain employees.\n  That is why the health care bill before us includes many provisions \nto make quality coverage for small business more affordable not only \nfor the businesspeople but for their employees. Before the managers' \namendment, the bill did include $24 billion in tax credits to help \nsmall businesses and charitable organizations purchase health insurance \nfor their employees.\n  The managers' amendment dedicates additional billions to providing \ntax credits to small businesses to make health insurance more \naffordable. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, which I know is near and dear to the heart of the Presiding \nOfficer--after all, they are an independent arbiter. They can tell us \nwith objectivity what this legislation is or is not--they estimate that \nthe tax credit for small businesses will provide $40 billion in tax \nrelief to small businesses over their first 10 years.\n  In addition, we start the tax credits a year early; that is, we start \nthem in 2010. In the earlier bill, it was 2011. In the managers' \namendment, we start in 2010, right away. This means that in just over a \nweek, after the legislation is passed and signed into law, eligible \nsmall businesses will be able to receive tax credits to help them buy \nhealth insurance for their employees. This expansion of the tax credits \nmeans eligible small businesses will now be able to receive up to 6 \nyears of tax credits. So now starting in 2010, eligible small \nbusinesses will receive tax credits worth up to 35 percent of the \nemployer's contribution to employee health insurance plans--35 percent.\n  Then in 2014, it is even better. Eligible small businesses will \nreceive tax credits worth up to 50 percent of the employer's \ncontribution to employee health insurance plans purchased in health \ninsurance exchanges. The employer would get 50 percent of the cost of \nthe health insurance, that would be available for credit; that is, the \nemployer can credit 50 percent, subtract from his income taxes 50 \npercent of the cost of insurance.\n  What do you have to do to qualify? Businesses must cover at least 50 \npercent of employee premium costs. If you cover half the employee \ncosts, you get to subtract your half from your income taxes. The value \ntax credit is based on the size of the business and the average wage \npaid to its employees.\n  The managers' amendment strengthens the assistance to small \nbusinesses by expanding the small business tax credit. In the managers' \namendment, the tax credit will be available to small businesses with \nfewer than 25 employees and less than $50,000 average annual wages. And \nthe full value of the tax credit is now available to small businesses \nwith 10 or fewer employees and $25,000 or less in average annual wages. \nIt moved up from $20,000 to $25,000 so more small businesses can \nqualify and take advantage of that tax credit. By expanding the wage \nthresholds, which I just described, more small businesses will be able \nto claim the tax credits. And tax credits will phase out more slowly as \nwages increase. This was a high priority for small businesses. We \nrecognized that and responded to it.\n  The small business tax credit will help make insurance affordable for \nmany small businesses. In 2011, 4.2 million Americans will be covered \nby quality, affordable health coverage; 4.2 million Americans will be \nable to take advantage of this. On average, small businesses across the \ncountry would receive a new tax credit of about $4,900 to help them \npurchase insurance. That is per employee, $4,900 to help them purchase \ninsurance for their employees.\n  The CBO estimates that the small business tax credit will help lower \ninsurance costs by 8 to 11 percent for the employees of small \nbusinesses receiving the credit. Let me say that again. CBO estimates \nthat the small business credit will help lower insurance costs by 8 to \n11 percent for the employees of small businesses who receive their \ncredit. Without the small business tax credit, many people would have \nto buy insurance through the exchange on their own without the benefit \nof a contribution from their employer.\n  One of the reasons many small businesses are currently unable to \nafford health insurance is because small businesses lack the buying \npower larger companies have to negotiate affordable group rates. The \nSenate bill creates small business insurance exchanges, known as SHOP \nexchanges, where small businesses can band together and pool their \nrisks, which will enhance their choice and buying power. These State-\nbased exchanges will be a critical tool to help small businesses with \nfewer than 100 employees shop for health insurance plans and determine \ntheir eligibility for tax credits to buy health insurance. Small \nbusinesses that prosper and grow beyond 100 employees would be allowed \nto continue shopping through the exchanges--pooling. The insurance \nplans sold in SHOP exchanges would be subject to the same transparency \nrequirements and consumer protections, so small businesses can feel \nconfident they are purchasing high-quality plans that will provide \nquality, affordable coverage for their workers.\n  The legislation also institutes reforms in the insurance market that \nwill protect individuals and small businesses purchasing plans both \ninside and outside these SHOP exchanges. These reforms will stop \ninsurance companies from denying coverage based on a person's \npreexisting health condition or increasing a person's health insurance \npremiums based on health status or on gender and occupation--a practice \nthat just has to be stopped.\n  These new regulations are essential to helping small businesses keep \nhealth care costs predictable from year to year. That is one of the big \nproblems. Small businesses face this sea of chaos, of volatility, \nuncertainty, unpredictability in knowing what their insurance costs \nwill or will not be. That is why insurance companies cherry-pick and \ntake advantage for themselves to maximize their profits, but it has the \nopposite effect on small businesses. This will help, frankly, to buy a \nlot more certainty that we desperately need.\n  The changes in the managers' amendment will go the extra step and \nensure this bill provides small businesses with the help they so \ndesperately need. Passing health care reform is critical to small \nbusinesses. Without reform--this is no small matter; I am not blowing \nsmoke here--without reform, many small businesses will be forced to \ndrop their health insurance coverage they may already have because they \ncan no longer afford it. They cannot afford the increase in premiums. \nThis will leave many employees to fend for themselves in the individual \nmarket. We know without this bill passing how unfair the individual \nmarket is to people.\n  Many of the provisions in this bill were designed with small \nbusinesses in mind. The bill gives small businesses access to a \nreformed marketplace where they will have improved buying power to \nnegotiate rates. And the Senate bill provides tax credits to help small \nbusinesses buy health insurance for their employees.\n  Data from CBO tells us that these reforms will make coverage more \naffordable for millions of small business employees. The small business \ntax credit will help reduce health care costs for small businesses and \ntheir employees. As a result of the larger health reform proposals in \nthe bill, there will be an increase in the percentage of small firms \nthat offer health insurance coverage.\n  We must act to help small businesses access to quality, affordable \nhealth care options for their employees. Too many small businesses \naround the country are waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I just heard my colleague from Montana \ntalk about jobs that are going to be lost, and the jobs are going to be \nlost if this bill passes.\n  There was an article in the Wall Street Journal that quoted the \nFederation of Independent Business, a wonderful organization that works \nso well with small businesses in this country. Their prediction is that \nif this passes--if this passes--the mandates in this bill will mandate \nthat employers provide\n\n[[Page S13574]]\n\nhealth care. This is going to cost 1.6 million jobs by 2013.\n  Then I got an e-mail from a friend in Dubois, WY, who says that if \nthis bill passes, he knows he is going to lay off workers--quite to the \ncontrary of what my colleague from Montana says when he says it is \ngoing to help keep people working.\n  At a time when the country is experiencing 10 percent unemployment, \nat a time when the people's No. 1 concern is jobs and the economy of \nthis country, we are now embarking on an additional spending spree when \nour national debt is at the highest levels ever.\n  I disagree with my colleague from Montana. I think, contrary to what \nhe suggested--he said: I am not just blowing smoke--I believe we will \nlose jobs if this passes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for one brief minute?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. When I am finished with our comments on this side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I also heard the majority whip come to the floor and \nsay the Republicans have only offered four amendments. I offered 19 \namendments. So I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and that I be allowed to call up my amendment No. 3148 to \nprotect individuals facing skyrocketing premiums.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The purpose of this amendment is----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, we have \nbeen----\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. So we have a 383-page amendment brought to the floor, \nread on the floor yesterday. I worked my way through it, along with my \nstaff--383 pages. And the majority whip comes to the floor and says the \nRepublicans have not offered amendments. I just tried to offer one, \nunsuccessfully, and it has been objected to.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside \nand that I be allowed to call up amendment No. 3153 to protect young, \nhealthy persons from increased insurance premiums.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, clearly this is a stunt. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending--and these are--I just heard the comments--these are amendments \nthat are aimed to keep the President's words that we will get insurance \npremiums under control, people will notice their premiums go down, that \nwe will make it better for people, easier for people. The Democrats \nought to accept all these amendments because they are intended to do \njust that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nthat I be allowed to call up amendment No. 3146. This amendment deals \nwith individual mandate penalties and creates personal accounts for \nyoung people who are penalized and they have to pay a fee and a fine if \nthey do not obey the individual mandate, and that would go into an \naccount for them so they could use that money to buy their own health \ninsurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, this is the fourth time \ntoday Senators on the other side----\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Regular order.\n  Mr. COBURN. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I understand this is going to improve \nMedicare. I heard the chairman of the Finance Committee say this is \ngoing to make Medicare stronger. I believe Medicare patients ought to \nhave the freedom to contract and the right to privately contract for \nmedical services with the physician of their choice.\n  If, as the chairman of the Finance Committee has now recommended in \nhis statement, it doesn't work out the way it is suggested--I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and I be \nallowed to call up amendment No. 2984, Medicare patient freedom to \ncontract.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. For the fifth time, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, that is why I am not surprised when I \nread polls that say negatives abound in polls about this bill, written \nin secret, brought to us just a little over 24 hours ago with a 383-\npage amendment, one that is now not going to be allowed to have any \namendments offered.\n  I just offered four different amendments aimed to strengthen the \nhealth care system of the country. Each time, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee is not even interested in hearing what the amendments \nare about.\n  The people of Wyoming say: Don't cut my Medicare, don't raise my \ntaxes, don't make things worse for me, especially in these economic \ntimes. This is a bill that is going to cut people's Medicare by $500 \nbillion, it is going to raise their taxes, and it is going to make \nthings worse for the people of Wyoming and this country. That is why \nthe front page of a local newspaper has a story, ``Doctor Shortage Will \nWorsen.'' Great concerns.\n  Even the Actuary of Medicare and Medicaid says that if all of this \ngoes through--and this is before we had the 383 new pages--if all of \nthis goes through, one in five hospitals is going to have significant \nproblems within the next 10 years and one in five doctors' offices may \nhave to close. That is why this health bill is scary.\n  For anyone who has not had an opportunity to read Dr. Coburn's, \nSenator Coburn's article in the Wall Street Journal, an editorial, \nThursday, December 17, I recommend the editorial to them. It is titled \n``The Health Bill Is Scary.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                        The Health Bill Is Scary\n\n                            (By Tom Coburn)\n\n       I recently suggested that seniors will die sooner if \n     Congress actually implements the Medicare cuts in the \n     healthcare bill put forward by Senate Majority Leader Harry \n     Reid. My colleagues who defend the bill--none of whom have \n     practiced medicine--predictably dismissed my concern as a \n     scare tactic. They are wrong. Every American, not just \n     seniors, should know that the rationing provisions in the \n     Reid bill will not only reduce their quality of life, but \n     their life spans as well.\n       My 25 years as a practicing physician have shown me what \n     happens when government attempts to practice medicine: \n     Doctors respond to government coercion instead of patient \n     cues, and patients die prematurely. Even if the public option \n     is eliminated from the bill, these onerous rationing \n     provisions will remain intact.\n       For instance, the Reid bill (in sections 3403 and 2021) \n     explicitly empowers Medicare to deny treatment based on cost. \n     An Independent Medicare Advisory Board created by the bill--\n     composed of permanent, unelected and, therefore, \n     unaccountable members--will greatly expand the rationing \n     practices that already occur in the program. Medicare, for \n     example, has limited cancer patients' access to Epogen, a \n     costly but vital drug that stimulates red blood cell \n     production. It has limited the use of virtual, and safer, \n     colonoscopies due to cost concerns. And Medicare refuses \n     medical claims at twice the rate of the largest private \n     insurers.\n       Section 6301 of the Reid bill creates new comparative \n     effectiveness research (CER) programs. CER panels have been \n     used as rationing commissions in other countries such as the \n     U.K., where 15,000 cancer patients die prematurely every year \n     according to the National Cancer Intelligence Network. CER \n     panels here could effectively dictate coverage options and \n     ration care for plans that participate in the state insurance \n     exchanges created by the bill.\n       Additionally, the Reid bill depends on the recommendations \n     of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in no fewer than \n     14 places. This task force was responsible for advising women \n     under 50 to not undergo annual mammograms. The administration \n     claims the task force recommendations do not carry the force \n     of law, but the Reid bill itself contradicts them in \n     section 2713. The bill explicitly states, on page 17, that \n     health insurance plans ``shall provide coverage for'' \n     services approved by the task force. This chilling \n     provision represents the government stepping between \n     doctors and patients. When the government asserts the \n     power to provide care, it also asserts the power to deny \n     care.\n\n[[Page S13575]]\n\n       If the bill expands Medicaid eligibility to 133% of the \n     poverty level, that too will lead to rationing. Because \n     Washington bureaucrats have created a system that underpays \n     doctors, 40% of doctors already restrict access to Medicaid \n     patients, and therefore ration care.\n       Medicaid demonstrates, tragically in some cases, that \n     access to a government program does not guarantee access to \n     health care. In Maryland, 17,000 Medicaid patients are \n     currently on a waiting list for medical services, and as many \n     as 250 may have died while awaiting care, according to state \n     auditors. Kansas, the home state of Health and Human Services \n     Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, faces a Medicaid backlog of more \n     than 15,000 applicants.\n       Other unintended consequences of the Reid bill could wreak \n     havoc on patients' lives. What happens, for instance, when \n     savvy consumers commanded to buy insurance realize the \n     penalty is the de facto premium? It won't take long for \n     younger, healthier Americans to realize it's cheaper to pay a \n     $750 tax for coverage instead of, say, $5,000 in annual \n     premiums when coverage can't be denied if you get sick.\n       OMB Budget Director Peter Orzsag's belief that mandatory \n     health insurance will become a ``cultural norm'' is \n     bureaucratic naivete that will produce skyrocketing premiums \n     and reduced care for everyone. My state's own insurance \n     commissioner, a Democrat, recently confirmed this concern to \n     me in a letter noting that ``the result will be higher \n     insurance rates due to a higher percentage of insured being \n     higher risk/expense individuals.''\n       But the most fundamental flaw of the Reid bill is best \n     captured by the story of one my patients I'll call Sheila. \n     When Sheila came to me at the age of 33 with a lump in her \n     breast, traditional tests like a mammogram under the standard \n     of care indicated she had a cyst and nothing more. Because I \n     knew her medical history, I wasn't convinced. I aspirated the \n     cyst and discovered she had a highly malignant form of breast \n     cancer. Sheila fought a heroic battle against breast cancer \n     and enjoyed 12 good years with her family before succumbing \n     to the disease.\n       If I had been practicing under the Reid bill, the \n     government would have likely told me I couldn't have done the \n     test that discovered Sheila's cancer because it wasn't \n     approved under CER. Under the Reid bill, Sheila may have \n     lived another year instead of 12, and her daughters would \n     have missed a decade with their mom.\n       The bottom line is that under the Reid bill the majority of \n     America's patients might be fine. But some will be like \n     Sheila--patients whose it lives hang in the balance and \n     require the care of a doctor who understands the science and \n     art of medicine, and can make decisions without government \n     interference.\n       The American people are opposing this bill in greater \n     numbers every day because the facts of the bill--not any \n     tactic--are cause for serious concern.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, here you have it. We have a bill that is \ngoing to be voted on at 1 in the morning on a Monday morning. Why? \nBecause the people who are proposing the bill are scared to let the \nAmerican people know what is in it. That is why public opinion has \nsoured on this proposal to the point that it is at the lowest level \never, with just 32 percent of Americans in favor, just less than one in \nthree. Less than one in three Americans supports what is being \nproposed.\n  I believe each one of my amendments would have raised the level of \nsupport, would have made this better for American taxpayers, for \nAmerican citizens, for American patients, for the patients who depend \non our health care system, for the providers who give the care, and for \nthe people who pay for it.\n  I see my colleague from North Carolina ready to rise. I am so happy \nto be joined on the Senate floor by these two wonderful colleagues who \nhave a great bill of their own that has gotten very little hearing, \nvery little opportunity, certainly no opportunity for a vote on the \nSenate floor.\n  As my Senate colleague from North Carolina gets his microphone ready \nto go, I will say that to be held to a false deadline of Christmas Day \non something as important as a bill that is going to impact the health \nof every person in this country, impact one-sixth of the economy of the \nUnited States--it is much more important that we get it right than that \nit gets rushed through with speed and secrecy, with not being able to \noffer amendments when a 383-page amendment by Senator Reid is dropped \non the table yesterday and a vote is going to be held at 1 in the \nmorning on a Monday morning.\n  It is astonishing that we do not have bipartisan support, people \nworking together to find solutions. It is astonishing when you have a \nbody such as this of 100 Members, 2 of whom are physicians with 50 \nyears of experience practicing medicine, working with the system, \nfighting against insurance companies and fighting against the \ngovernment, two physicians who know that you do not want anybody \nbetween you and your physician, you do not want a government \nbureaucrat, you do not want an insurance bureaucrat, you do not want \nanyone. But what we are looking at is the worst of all possible worlds.\n  I ask my colleague from North Carolina if he has some additional \nthoughts.\n  Mr. BURR. I do, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I look around this Chamber, and I see the \nbusts of many Vice Presidents who have served as the leaders of this \nChamber. It makes me wonder what would they think of the process in \nwhich we are currently engaged, individuals who, in a time of history \nof our country, took so seriously what went on in this Chamber and the \neffects it had on the American people.\n  I look at the process we are going through right now and see the way \nwe have trivialized this process--votes in the middle of the night. \nTwenty-four hours ago, there was not a managers' amendment. There was \nnot a score. Then yesterday morning we got a managers' amendment, 380-\nsome pages, and we got a score. Today we get a notice from the \nCongressional Budget Office saying that in their score, they made a \n$\\1/2\\ trillion error, a $500 billion, $\\1/2\\ trillion error in the \nprojection they sent to Congress. In 24 hours, $\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  Why doesn't this seem to bother those who are the authors of the \nbill? It is because it is not their money. It is the American people's \nmoney. That is the only way you could rationalize how you could be in \nWashington talking about spending $2.5 trillion at best to stop waste, \nfraud, and abuse, because, let's face it, Republicans and Democrats \nagree: There is no health care reform in here. There is a coverage \nexpansion, but there is no health care reform.\n  Democrats have walked to the floor and said that we lie. I am not \nlying. Show me the health care reform. Show me where you have \ndrastically changed, transformed health care. If you transform health \ncare, then you wouldn't have to steal $464 billion from Medicare.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield so I can show him?\n  Mr. BURR. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. He doesn't----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. BURR. I appreciate that, Mr. President.\n  We have gone through this, and we are refused the ability to offer \namendments. We are refused the opportunity to sit in the back room \nwhere the legislation was constructed. It is shared with us when they \nare ready. But they use everybody's money. Tell me how it is fair to \nthe American people.\n  When Nebraska gets a sweetheart deal under Medicaid, and \nMassachusetts and Vermont, in the managers' amendment, when Nebraska is \ntold: We are going to expand Medicaid and we are going to hold you \nharmless in perpetuity, you will not have to pay, tell me how that is \nfair to the taxpayers of Virginia, tell me how it is fair to the \ntaxpayers of Ohio, tell me how it is fair to the taxpayers of North \nCarolina that they are going to pay for what Nebraskans should be \nobligated to pay. I believe, knowing Nebraska, that the people of \nNebraska would want to pay their fair share. But, no, to buy a vote, \nthey have been given a deal.\n  This bill is still $2.5 trillion. It still steals $464 billion from \nMedicare. It still puts a tremendous unfunded mandate on every State in \nthis country with the exception of the State of Nebraska. There are a \nnumber of States that have a grace period for some period of time, \nwhatever it took to get their comfort level of their vote, but for \nevery other State, at some point they are going to be obligated to pick \nup that difference.\n  We cover 3l million Americans who were not covered--that is a \nwonderful thing--and 15 million of them are dumped into Medicaid, the \nworst health care delivery system that exists in this country, a health \ncare system that only has the opportunity today to see 60 percent of \nthe available doctors because the other 40 percent will not see them.\n\n[[Page S13576]]\n\n  Oh, by the way, what did the Chief Actuary of the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services say?\n\n       The Reid bill is especially likely to result in providers \n     being unwilling--\n\n  Unwilling--\n\n     to treat Medicare and Medicaid patients, meaning that a \n     significant portion of the increased demand for Medicaid \n     services would be difficult to meet.\n\n  The Chief Actuary went on to say:\n\n       The CMS actuary noted that the Medicare cuts in the bill \n     could jeopardize Medicare beneficiaries' access to care.\n\n  I just heard the Senator from Rhode Island basically come out and say \nthat was a fabricated thing on the part of somebody on this side of the \naisle. I am quoting the Chief Actuary, the President's chief health \ncare budgetary person. The Actuary said it ``could jeopardize Medicare \nbeneficiaries' access to care.'' He goes on to say that he finds that \nroughly 20 percent of all Part A providers--hospitals, nursing homes, \net cetera--would become unprofitable within the next 10 years as a \nresult of these cuts. Hospitals will close, nursing homes will close. \nThis isn't fabrication. This is the Chief Actuary of the Centers for \nMedicare & Medicaid Services, who is part of this administration. The \nCMS's Actuary found that further reductions in Medicare growth, through \nthe actions of the independent Medicare advisory board--this is the \nadvisory board that is being set up to make determinations about \ncoverage in the future--which advocates have pointed to as a central \nlinchpin to reducing health care spending, may be difficult to achieve \nin practice.\n\n  In other words, we are making claims that aren't right, it is the \nauthors of the bill who are making claims that are not accurate, \naccording to the Chief Actuary.\n  I yield to the minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from North Carolina, if that were \nnot bad enough--and it may have been referenced here on the floor \nbefore I came out--we have an announcement from the Congressional \nBudget Office just today. The Senator from North Carolina may have \nreferred to this. On the Director's blog today--the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office--is the headline: ``Correction Regarding \nthe Longer-Term Effects of the Manager's Amendment to the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act.''\n  CBO has discovered an error in the cost estimate released yesterday--\nyesterday--related to the long-term budgetary effect of the manager's \namendment. They go on to say they were about $\\1/2\\ trillion off in \nlooking at the long-term effects beyond the 10-year window, which \nfurther illustrates why we ought not to be rushing this thing through, \nand we ought to have further opportunity to discover what other \nproblems there are, in addition to the ones the Senator from North \nCarolina has outlined with regard to special treatment for some States \nwhich all the rest of our States have to pay for.\n  Mr. BURR. The minority leader makes a great point. If we waited \nanother day to vote, we might save another $\\1/2\\ trillion. That is \nprobably in the best interest of the American taxpayer.\n  I will wrap up, Mr. President, because I know Dr. Coburn wants to \nspeak. Let me say this. I said earlier this still steals $464 billion \nfrom Medicare. It also still raises taxes and fees to the tune of $519 \nbillion. Many of those taxes and fees, by the way, are going to impact \npeople well below the $200,000 threshold the President promised he \nwould never touch.\n  We have just learned in the managers' amendment that we have dropped \nthe doctor fix. They should be comforted in knowing that they have a 2-\nmonth extension, but the 1-year extension was dropped in the managers' \namendment. Dropped. Why? Because they had to pay for what they were \ndoling out to get extra votes.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time, Mr. President, to set aside the \npending amendment, and I wish to call up amendment 3134, which is a 3-\nyear doctor fix of the SGR and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. For the sixth time we are engaged in this stunt, so I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BURR. Well, Mr. President, my hope is no other Member from the \nother side will come to the floor and say that Republicans haven't come \nup with substantive amendments to this bill.\n  Dr. Coburn and I participated in 56\\1/2\\ hours in the HELP Committee. \nWe offered numerous amendments. Some technical amendments were \naccepted. The amendments that meant anything were rejected along party \nlines. We have filed a comprehensive health care reform bill--the first \none introduced in Congress--in May of this year, I believe. Still, \nMembers from the other side come to the floor and say Republicans \nhaven't offered anything. We were the first. They may not have liked \nit, but we were the first.\n  You know what, it doesn't cost this much and it doesn't raise taxes. \nI think Dr. Coburn will later talk about that bill a little.\n  I was glad to see that politics comes from all sides. In the \nmanagers' amendment we dropped the tax on botox. Hollywood spoke out \nabout this tax on one of their health care tools. And what did we \nreplace it with? We have now put a 10-percent tax on tanning salons. \nHow in the hell does that affect health care? Explain that to me. Are \nwe going to tax everything in this country? I can make a tremendous \ncase that the 10-percent tanning salon tax gets exactly the person that \nthe President said he wasn't going to affect, people who make under \n$200,000--or are we income testing the tanning tax, too?\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURR. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. If we are going to tax tanning salons, why don't we tax \nanybody who goes to the beach? Because true sunlight is much worse for \nyour skin than a tanning salon. So if the intention was to prevent \ndisease, why wouldn't we tax it where most of the disease occurs? Or \nhow about kids' sports in the summer. Let's tax kids' baseball. Or \nswimming. Let's tax all the swimming pools because we have exposure to \nUV light.\n  This shows the precariousness and the silliness of a large portion of \nthis, and I yield back.\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator makes a great point, and I am sure we have \nloaded the chairman of the Finance Committee with additional good ideas \nhe can go back and think on. I am sure before it is over, we will fine \nparents who don't put suntan lotion on their children--especially if it \ndoesn't meet high enough SPF to block everything the Sun might produce.\n  This is out of control. This is not the way to write a bill that \naffects one-sixth of the U.S. economy. I mean it is bad enough it is \ndone behind closed doors, in a back room, with only a few people there, \nbut when the No. 2 Democrat can walk on the floor and say: I haven't \nseen it, either--well, if the No. 2 Democrat hasn't seen it, how many \npeople were there? How many people had input into this? Was it just \nLeader Reid and Senator Nelson? Was it the Presiding Officer from \nMinnesota? Nobody knows. Nobody knows. The truth is, and what we do \nknow is that the American people don't like the process, and more \nimportantly the American people don't like the bill.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee and others have said: But once \nit is out there and they get a taste of this, they are going to like it \nthen. Well, let me remind my colleagues: It is too late. The Chief \nActuary already told us: Hospitals are going to close, nursing homes \nare going to close, doctors are going to quit practicing medicine. They \nwill quit seeing Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. How do you repair \nthat after you have done the damage? Are we willing to risk that for \nthe future of this country and generations yet to come?\n  Boy, we have a few hours--8 or 10 hours--before we vote. I hope \npeople get some sense. I hope they pull back from this. Let's leave for \nChristmas. Let's think about this. Let's go home and talk to people. \nLet's listen to people in this country. If we do, we might come back, \nget a new piece of paper, take some of the things in this bill and take \nsome of the things we have talked about on this side of the aisle, take \nsome of the things the American people have talked about, and find a \nway for 100 percent of the doctors, nurses, and hospitals to survive; \nfind a way for 100 percent of the American people to have coverage, and \nnot the 31 million covered in this bill, leaving 24 million outside the \nscope of coverage.\n\n[[Page S13577]]\n\n  You see, when we set out we had three objectives: One was to cover \nall the American people. We flunked. Another was to invest in \nprevention, wellness, and chronic disease management. The doctor and I \nboth say we haven't come anywhere close to doing that. The third and \nmost important was to make sure it is fiscally sustainable. CBO, CMS, \nwherever you want to go, the only way this is fiscally sustainable is \nif the independent Medicare advisory board continues to cut \nreimbursements, the scope of coverage, to meet how much we are willing \nto spend on health care to say it is affordable.\n\n  I don't believe that is reform. I believe that is legislation that \npicks winners and losers, and that is not the role of the Senate of the \nUnited States.\n  I yield to the good doctor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to raise an issue. It was raised in the Finance \nCommittee markup; it was raised in the health care markup. I have \nbehind me the Medicare cuts, and I understand they have been slightly \nreduced in home health--in the rebuild--but we are going to cut \nMedicare. We are not going to cut it significantly in the fraud--$2 \nbillion. That is where the real waste is.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island came down here and said we are trying \nto scare people, but when we offered the opportunity for the chairman \nof the committee to prohibit rationing of health care in this country, \nboth the chairman and the Senator from Rhode Island voted against it. \nIt was simple, straightforward, saying no matter what we do in health \ncare, we are not going to do what other countries have done, and that \nis ration health care. Straight up-and-down votes--party-line votes--\nagainst it.\n  In fact, we are going to ration health care. That is what this bill \ndoes. The way we are going to control cost is through the mechanisms \noutlined in this bill that are going to allow government bureaucrats to \ndecide what you can get treated for, when you can get treated for it, \nand where you can get treated for it. The rebuttal to that is: In \nMedicare, it is already illegal for them to ration care, so we don't \nneed a prohibition. The fact is Medicare is rationing right now. They \nare rationing virtual colonoscopies, they are rationing bone \ndensitometry, they are rationing Epogen, they are rationing Neupogen--\ntwo key drugs to maintain survival during the treatment of \nchemotherapy. They are practicing medicine.\n  So when given the opportunity to vote and put an absolute prohibition \non the rationing of health care, what did the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee do? He voted against that. Because what he recognizes is the \nultimate plan. And the answer to Senator Burr's question is: This will \ncollapse. It is not going to be sustainable. The Medicare cuts won't be \nmade by us. We will put it off on a commission and say: Oh, we had to \ndo it, and the result of that will be rationing.\n  The other result will be what the Senator from Vermont actually \nwants, which is a single-payer, government-run system. That is why he \nis intellectually honest. He brought it to the floor and said this is \nhow I think we ought to solve health care. We ought to have the \ngovernment run it, and we ought to have the government make the \ndecisions. He was honest about it. That is where this bill is going. So \nif you are a Medicare patient, you should be concerned. If you are a \nMedicare Advantage patient, you should be concerned.\n  I have had criticism leveled at me because I do what the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee suggests--I make competitive bidding for Medicare \nAdvantage. But there is a big difference. Mine has no cuts in benefits. \nThey cut benefits 50 percent, in terms of the Medicare Advantage \ndifferential.\n  There are three things you can do to fix health care in this country: \nYou can incentivize prevention and the treatment of chronic disease \nbased on outcome; you can create transparency so that purchasers in the \nmarket can actually make a judgment about value and quality; and you \ncan assist those who are on the lower rungs of the economic ladder to \nget the same kind of care we get. Those are the three things you can \ndo.\n  I readily admit we don't have a great competitive model in the \ninsurance industry. I want to change that. We had Senator Wyden come to \nthe floor and say that he loves the free enterprise spirit, yet we want \nto put an artificial fix in terms of the insurance company, in terms of \nwhat you have to have for a return. What if an insurance company came \nup with 20 percent greater efficiency in terms of outcomes and \nbenefits? They still have to spend that money? In the name of the free \nenterprise system we are going to kill free enterprise? As a practicing \nphysician, I bristle at the way I run into insurance companies. There \nis no question about it. We need to fix that.\n  The point Senator Burr was making is this says it is this way or the \nhighway, when the option we offered--the Patients' Choice Act--cuts \ntaxes, doesn't raise taxes; expands exactly to the level or beyond of \nthis bill and it does at in a faster rate. It extends the life of \nMedicare. It gives Medicaid patients the same kind of care we get. But \nit was defeated in committee on a party-line vote. It was filed as an \namendment here but not accepted. We had 10 amendments voted on from our \nside on 2,400 pages of legislation--10 amendments. So it is not about \nbeing bipartisan, it is about you have to take this or leave it.\n  What the American people ought to pray for is that somebody can't \nmake the vote tonight. That is what they should be praying for, so that \nwe can actually get the middle--not me, not mine. I understand I am way \nover here. But we ought to get the middle of America and the middle of \nthe Senate a bill that can run through this country and actually do \nwhat we say we all want to do. There is a large difference of opinion, \nand it is not rhetoric that is unfounded, as Senator Burr outlined, and \nas Dr. Barrasso outlined with an estimate by NFIB of 1.6 million jobs \nlost. That may be old data, because who knows what the data is now. We \nhaven't had a chance to look at it, because 30 hours after the bill is \nintroduced for cloture and the cloture motion is filed, we are going to \nvote on it. I am not sure this is a great way to run the country.\n  What is in the bill? There are zero guarantees that taxpayers won't \nfinance abortion.\n  There are zero prohibitions on the rationing of health care--zero. \nThere is not one shred of evidence that we are not going to ultimately \nration health care under this bill. We are. And the only reason you \nwould vote against a rationing amendment is because you intend to see \nrationing carried out.\n  There are zero Senators required to enroll in either Medicaid or a \ngovernment-run option, either through OPM or Medicaid.\n  There are now 10 new taxes created. There are 71 new government \nprograms created. There are 1,697 times that the Secretary of HHS is \ngoing to write the regulations, and based on CRS calculations there are \nbetween 15,000 and 20,000 new Federal employees who are going to be \nrequired to carry out this legislation.\n  There are 3,607 times, before we got the Reid amendment, that the \nlegislation says the word ``shall.'' ``Shall'' is a very important word \nbecause the word ``shall'' takes away your options. There is no option \nwhen the word ``shall'' is used. The word ``shall'' also says whoever \nis directing the ``shall'' obviously has more wisdom, more knowledge, \nmore experience than the person the ``shall'' is applied to.\n  What we have said is, in all our wisdom, in all our many years of \npracticing medicine and being involved in the care of patients, that \n3,607 times we are going to tell the American people what to do.\n  One of the big ``shall also's'' that I do not think will ever hold \nscrutiny before the Supreme Court is, you shall buy an insurance \npolicy. That doesn't fit anywhere in the Constitution that I read. If \nyou do the legal research on it, as my staff lawyers from the Judiciary \nCommittee have done, it is highly unlikely that will ever hold up. So \nthe whole premise of a large portion of the taxes collected in this \nbill will be out the window.\n  It also will totally change, through adverse selection, all of the \ninsurance premiums in this country because, if you do not have an \nindividual mandate making people buy insurance, the costs relative to \nthe illness and the age, even though we have compressed the ratios, \nwill rise exorbitantly.\n\n[[Page S13578]]\n\n  There are still going to be 24 million people left without health \ninsurance in this country. There is a $10 billion cost just for the IRS \nimplementation of this bill. There is at least $25 billion in mandates \nplaced on the States, unfunded mandates. Actually it is much higher \nnow. There is $28 billion-plus in new taxes on employers. There is $100 \nbillion, by conservative estimates, in fraud and Medicare and Medicaid \na year, and this bill goes after $2 billion over 10 years. So we are \ngoing to go after $2 billion out of $1 trillion--not $200 billion, not \n$20 billion--we are going after $2 billion.\n  There is $118 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage but only for \nthose people who do not live in the State of Florida and a couple of \nother places. If you happen to live in Oklahoma, citizens under the \nMedicare Advantage are going to lose.\n  This is now over $500 billion in new taxes on Americans. There is a \nquarter of a trillion dollars not in this in expense that everybody \nknows is an expense. We are going to restore the SGR. We are going to \nfix that. And that quarter of a trillion dollars is based on no \nincrease in physicians over the next 10 years. How many in this body \nthink we are not going to increase the pay of physicians in Medicare \nunder the next 10 years? The assumptions in the CBO report that \naccompanied the Reid amendment, if you read what they said, they said \nit is highly unlikely. So that is a quarter of a trillion dollars even \nthough it was not in their numbers.\n  It also said if, in fact, the cuts came through, which they thought \nhighly unlikely that they would, and if they didn't, then the fiscal \nnumbers associated with the bill are out the window. The final number \neverybody ought to be paying attention to is $12.1 trillion; $12.1 \ntrillion is what our kids owe outside of owing ourselves--$1.1 \ntrillion. That is going to double in the next 10 years.\n  Anybody with a lick of common sense who looked at the numbers on this \nbill would say: Washington, your accounting programs aren't any \ndifferent from Enron. The same fate of those who created the Enron scam \nought to apply to the Congress of the United States. The very fact we \nare not considering an SGR fix is evidence of that. At least you have \nto add a quarter of a trillion dollars every 10 years to this bill just \nto keep doctors even. And don't forget the fact that 34 million new \nAmericans over the next 10 years are going to enter Medicare--are going \nto enter Medicare.\n  What are the alternatives? I will not offer other amendments and make \nthe chairman object to them because I know his answer. He calls it a \nstunt. It is not a stunt when you do not have vigorous amendments \noffered on the Senate floor. It is not a stunt. The stunt is not \nallowing amendments to be offered. To allow only 10 of our amendments \nto be offered on this bill is beneath the dignity of the Senate--on the \nbiggest bill in the last 100 years in this Congress, the only bill in \nthe last 100 years that is going to affect every American in a personal \nway but also in a fiscal way, a financial way.\n  There was an amendment to be offered, a conscience protection for \nphysicians. We didn't get a vote on it. Should we force physicians in \nthis country to perform abortions or should we have a vote on whether, \nif they have a conscience protection, they ought to be exempted from \nthat? Should that not be a part of health care reform? We are not going \nto get a vote on that.\n  How about an amendment to reduce the waste, fraud, and abuse in \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs and protecting Medicare benefits? And \nincreasing the fraud and waste from $2 billion to $100 billion over the \nnext 10 years, that is just 10 percent of what is there. We are not \ngoing to get a vote on that. It is not going to be available. The \nAmerican people are not going to get to hear the debate on that. They \nare not going to make up their mind. Why? You don't want them to hear \nthe debate on it. If you truly wanted to have a debate on fraud we \nwould have a debate on fraud, and we would have an amendment saying put \nyour stamp down, or are you for the people who are defrauding? Or are \nyou for the status quo? We are for the status quo. We are for the well-\nconnected.\n  The amendment on rationing that I talked about--or an amendment to \nlimit the bureaucratic increase associated with this bill, which is an \namendment I offered, we are not going to get a debate on that. That is \na very straightforward amendment. It just says we are not going to \nincrease the number of bureaucrats to implement this bill. We are going \nto drive efficiency in HHS; that is where this is going to. We are \ngoing to say: You can't get a net increase in bureaucrats so get more \nefficient. Since we are running $1.4 trillion or $1.5 trillion \ndeficits, that is something that everybody else in the country would be \ndoing, but we are not going to do that. We are not going to allow an \nopportunity for a vote or debate on that. We are not going to have that \nopportunity.\n  I have heard the majority mention several times that we didn't have \nanything to offer. We offered the Patients' Choice Act. CBO said it cut \nlong-term costs on Medicaid, that it saved money on Medicare. They said \nit saved $1 trillion over the first 10 years for the State and the \nestimates. Because we couldn't get the commitment that was made to us \nby the chairman of the HELP Committee that he would score the bill, the \nbill didn't ever get scored by CBO--but an outside score says it saves \nat least $70 billion the first 10 years and far in excess of that \nafterwards. It covers more people than this bill, saves personal \nchoice, doesn't put somebody between you and your doctor.\n  I heard the Senator from Rhode Island say we were lying about that \nhappening. It is happening today, both from insurance companies and \nMedicare and Medicaid. So if we really wanted to reform health care we \nwould be attacking that. Instead, we are going to make it worse.\n  Let me tell you how we are going to make it worse. We are going to \nuse cost comparative effectiveness, which is exactly what the U.S. Task \nForce on Prevention Services did. They used cost comparative \neffectiveness, and when they looked at breast cancer, they said it is \nnot cost effective to screen women before the age of 50. You know what. \nThey are right. It is not cost effective. But it certainly is \nclinically effective, especially if your wife is the one who is 40 and \nhas breast cancer and it was found by a mammogram.\n  You see, judgment goes out the window. What do we do? We reversed \nthat finding, one of the first things we did as we started the debate.\n  Are we going to do that every time the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce issues a ruling that is cost effective but not clinically \neffective? Are we going to do that every time the cost comparative \neffectiveness panel says: You will do this, and the American people \nsay: That isn't right, the American Cancer Society says: That isn't \nright. Every time we get one of those rulings will we have to pass a \npiece of legislation to change it?\n  The purpose of the three panels is well intended. The Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission is well intended. Help us cut costs. But \nthe only way you go for cost is through prevention and management of \nchronic disease. You are not going to cut costs any other way because \n75 percent of everything we spend is on five chronic diseases. So \nunless you attack the real problem, the real disease, with our health \ncare system, you are not going to solve it.\n  The lack of art in medicine will become readily apparent in 2015, \n2016, and 2017. We will see bureaucratic decisions in between a patient \nand their provider. That is not a scare tactic. That is absolute fact. \nWe have it now with Medicare. It is there. If I have a woman who is 55 \nyears of age today and I order bone density testing on her and find she \nhas severe osteoporosis, I put her on medicine but am forbidden by \nMedicare to do the followup exam that is clinically necessary to see if \nthe medicine is working, and not only that, under Medicare rules, she \ncan't even use her own money to buy that test. So 2 years later, we do \nthe test, and we haven't corrected her disease. Now we change medicines \nto try to find out, but we can't find out again. So she ultimately \nfalls and breaks her hip. There is a 20-percent mortality rate from \nfalling and breaking one's hip. But those are the rules we are \noperating under now, right now, that you want to expand.\n  Government isn't ever compassionate. It is never compassionate. \nPeople are compassionate. Thought has\n\n[[Page S13579]]\n\nto be in the middle of the practice of medicine, not distant thought, \nnear thought. The very fact that an insurance company tells the doctors \nwhat they can and cannot do is no worse than what we are getting ready \nto do with the rest of government-run health care. We didn't fix that \nproblem. We didn't address that problem with this. We didn't guarantee \nthat you could walk with your feet. We said: Here is how much money you \ncan earn, but we didn't address that.\n  I will give two examples. Two people I have taken care of for over 15 \nyears, both had no clinical indications that they had anything wrong. I \ncontacted the insurance company. I thought they needed an MRI of the \nbrain. Both of them were denied. I got friends who are radiologists to \ndo their MRI. They both had brain tumors. One is still alive. What we \nare setting up isn't any different than what you have a complaint and \ngripe about now with the insurance industry. You didn't fix that in \nthis bill. There is no health care reform in this bill. There is health \ncoverage expansion, but there is no reform.\n  One of those people is still alive, but had we followed either \nMedicare guidelines, cost comparative effectiveness panel guidelines, \nwhich would have forbidden doing an MRI, that one person out of the two \nwould be dead today. So as we sit here and look at our health care \nsystem, my biggest worry is, I will be in Medicare. I will get \nrationed. I know that. The way we are going about it, that is what is \ngoing to happen. We are going to ration care. We will not vote to not \nration it. You know it is going to be rationed or you would have voted \nfor the amendment in committee that provided a prohibition.\n  But my real concern is not my generation. My real concern is those \nwho will follow us with $12.1 trillion worth of debt and the fact that \nevery one of those is 25 years of age and younger today. Twenty years \nfrom now, they will be responsible for $1 million of both debt and \nunfunded liabilities for which we will have to collect, on average, \n$70,000 a year just to pay the interest on what we are sending them. \nBefore they pay the rest of their income taxes, before they pay payroll \ntaxes, before they pay unemployment taxes, before they send their kids \nto school, before they buy health insurance, before they buy a home, \nbefore they buy transportation, the real worry that should be in front \nof this country, which is the No. 1 issue on the public's mind, is: How \ndo we get out of this financial mess? That is the No. 1 issue on \npeople's minds. It is not health care.\n  I have no hopes of convincing my colleagues that through 25 years of \npracticing medicine, dealing with Medicare, dealing with Medicaid, that \nthat is of any value to you. Because we are hell-bent on passing a \nhealth care bill and dealing to make sure we can and creating \ninequities throughout this country and dividing our country.\n  We heard the Senator from Rhode Island characterize us as liars, \nbirthers, supporters of the Aryan nation. That is what I heard. I sat \nand listened to it. I think he doth protest too much, for he knows that \nis not true. There is nobody on our side of the aisle who cares any \nless than anybody on the other side of the aisle about fixing health \ncare. The rub is, you believe the government is the most powerful thing \nand the best way to do it. We don't agree with that. We actually \nbelieve in the American people. We actually believe in the \nentrepreneurial spirit of the average American making good decisions \nfor themselves every day, doing things we never do, which is \nprioritizing where their money is going to go and how they are going to \nspend it and working like heck to advance the cause of their own \nfamily, their own freedom, and their own liberty. You don't believe \nthat because, if you did, you would never put this kind of bill on the \nfloor. This bill limits liberty. This bill says you shall.\n  Think of the first big step in this bill. In the United States, you \nno longer have the ability to not buy health insurance. If you have \n$\\1/2\\ million in the bank and you want to put that at risk and say: I \ndon't want to, you either have to pay a fine, a tax, or you have to buy \nhealth insurance. So where is the liberty and where is the commerce \nclause in that and where does that tie in with individual liberty and \nindividual responsibility? We say: If you don't want to be responsible, \nthen we will make you responsible. We don't say: You have to suffer the \nconsequences of your lack of responsibility.\n  What built this country was people figuring out if you don't act \nresponsibly, it is going to cost you. We are going to put a block on \nthat and say: You don't have to act responsibly. You don't have to act \nin your own best economic interest. Don't worry. We will take care of \nit.\n  Jefferson warned of that. One of the Founders of this country warned \nus against doing the very thing we are doing today. If you read the \nFederalist Papers, you will see what Madison wrote about the welfare \nclause and the commerce clause. He said, whenever the Senate starts to \nthink about claiming it means something different than it does, here is \nwhat we want you to know. It doesn't. It is very limited in scope.\n  I said yesterday in a press conference that this country is at the \npoint of a crisis of confidence such as we have not seen in hundreds of \nyears. It is true. Whether you are a very liberal individual or a very \nconservative individual, you don't have any confidence in us. The \nreason you don't is because we don't act in the country's best \ninterest. We act in our political best interest. Republicans are \nequally guilty. We look at partisan issues rather than principled \nissues. What we miss in all that is the best right thing for the \ncountry. We are missing it with this bill. We are missing the best \nright thing for the country.\n  Mr. CORKER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORKER. I was listening to the Senator from Oklahoma. I know he \ncares deeply about his patients and continues to treat patients as he \nserves in the Senate. What he has done is pointed out the fact that \nthere will be much interruption, changes in the physicians' and \npatients' relationship. But the big picture is what the Senator is \nconcerned about, too; that is, the tremendous indebtedness this country \nhas by the fact that--the good chairman of the Finance Committee is \nhere today listening patiently, and I know this has to be painful to \nhim--half the reform we are talking about is actually putting people in \nMedicaid, a program that 40 percent of physicians will not see and 50 \npercent of specialists will not see.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. And the outcomes are poor.\n  Mr. CORKER. Last weekend, the New York Times talked about many \nphysicians prescribing antipsychotic drugs to young people because they \ndon't want to deal with them on Medicaid. So half this reform is people \ngoing into this type of program and half the money is coming from \nMedicare, which is insolvent.\n  We have spent all this time, all kinds of bipartisan meetings. I know \nyou spoke about the issue of partisanship. I know the good chairman is \nhere. We, early on, said we wanted to join in health care reform. We \njust didn't want to take money from Medicare, which was an insolvent \nprogram, to fund it. What was the major building block of this program? \nTaking $464 billion from Medicare to fund reform. We were, in essence, \nblocked out on the front end saying something we thought was the wrong \ntype of principle to build upon.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, if, in fact, we got rid of 50 percent of \nthe fraud in Medicare and Medicaid, we would generate $600 billion \nevery 10 years, more than offsetting the cuts that have been outlined \nin this bill.\n  Mr. CORKER. So if I understand correctly, of the new patients going \ninto Medicaid, 50 percent of the money comes from an insolvent program. \nWe are not dealing with the doc fix. Much of the savings they have \ntalked about is just like the doc fix that back in 1997, the AMA, both \nsides of the aisle agreed to do something to save money for Medicare. \nAs the Senator knows now, the Reid amendment takes out all the doc fix, \nnow with a $285 billion gap over the next 10 years to deal with \nphysicians. It is another example of how we don't have the courage. We \nput in place cuts. We are not going to do that. We know what damage \nthat will cause to patients. In this particular case, we should not do \nthat. But the fact is many of these cuts that have been discussed will \nnever take place. They will never take place. At the end of the day, I \ncome back to the very thing you talked about; that is, we have $12 \ntrillion in debt, $38.6 trillion in unfunded\n\n[[Page S13580]]\n\nliabilities for Medicare alone, and here we are passing a bill that is \nusing up the resources we might otherwise use to make it solvent.\n  Instead of doing that, we are leveraging a whole new entitlement. I \nheard some of the pundits this morning parroting some of the things I \nhave heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle. Let's pass \nthis bill. We know it is not very good, but we will fix it as we move \nalong.\n  What I fear is the way we are going to fix it, we are going to fix it \nby adding tremendous debt on future generations. My guess is over the \nnext very short period--2 or 3 months--the other side of the aisle is \ngoing to come right back up here with a huge, several hundred billion \ndollar unpaid bill to deal with one of these issues we have been \ntalking about. That is the way business is done here.\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator raises a good question. How long have we \nknown and how long has Medicare been in trouble that we haven't fixed \nit? We will not fix it. We will do exactly what the Senator says, what \nwe always do, what we have done since I have been in this body. We put \nthe credit card into the machine and say: Transfer this to your \ngrandkids. We take no pain ourselves. What is lacking in our country \ntoday is moral character to lead on the basis of sacrifice. It should \nstart with us as Senators in this body.\n  Mr. President, I understand our time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I look forward to \nhearing the remarks in the cloakroom of the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, just a couple, three points here, and I \nsee the Senator from Ohio wishes to speak.\n  Several times during this afternoon, Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle, in my judgment, put on a little demonstration of trying to \noffer amendments. They repeatedly asked consent to suspend the normal \nworking of the cloture rule to offer amendments. Earlier, I note for \nthe Record, they slow-walked the process when an amendment was in \norder. They wanted the whole amendment read. And now they are trying to \noffer amendments, again, to slow down the process. This is clearly a \ntactic to slow the process. It is not part of the regular order. That \nis clearly what is going on here. Those were not, despite the \nprotestations to the contrary, serious amendments.\n  Normally, when a Senator offers a unanimous consent request, they \nallow the other side to speak briefly on the subject, at least on the \nreservation of the right to object. That was not allowed here. My \ncolleagues did not allow me that courtesy earlier today, to comment \nwith a reservation of the right to object. So I want to take a moment \nnow to explain what they are really up to. I could not because they \nwould not give me the courtesy to say any words during the reservation. \nThat is why I made that statement.\n  I heard one Senator from the other side of the aisle complain that \nthe majority is holding tonight's vote at 1 a.m. in the morning on the \ncloture motion. Let me set the record straight. The majority would be \nhappy to have this vote earlier. We would be happy to have this vote \nmaybe in 10 or 15 minutes from now. We would be happy to have this vote \nat a decent time. It does not have to be at 1 a.m. tomorrow. It is the \nother side which is insisting that vote be at 1 a.m. in the morning. So \nit is they who are insisting on enforcing the letter of the Senate \nrules. It is their right, but it is also they who are insisting on \ndelay.\n  I also want to put to bed some of the assertions that they claim this \nbill does not do real health care reform. Let me mention a few health \ncare reform provisions in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if you or any of my colleagues have read \nthis second article in the New Yorker magazine by Atul Gawande. The \nfirst article talks about two towns in Texas, basically. The second is \nbasically looking to see whether this bill does reform health care and \nwhether it does cut down health care costs. It is an article I highly \nrecommend to all of my colleagues in a recent issue of the New Yorker \nmagazine.\n  But, basically, Dr. Gawande concludes this bill includes all of the \nconstructive provisions health care economists, stakeholders, and \npeople who have studied this issue suggest should be part of health \ncare reform. That is his conclusion anyway. I am happy he said that \nbecause we worked mightily to make sure we have all the provisions we \ncan here to help constrain health care costs.\n  What are they? Well, one--although some may disagree with the \npolicy--is an excise tax on high-cost plans, so-called Cadillac plans. \nIt is a bit debatable. Last night I saw a TV ad where a group was \nadvocating passage of this bill: But just not my high-cost plan. Pass \nthe bill, but just not my high-cost plan. I understand the tenor and \nimport of that TV ad, but the main point is, we do have to begin to \nlimit to some degree the excessive cost of some plans, and I think we \nare very fair and modest here in proposing an excise tax on those high-\ncost plans. The trick is to set the level at the proper level, not too \nhigh, not too low. I think this bill does that.\n  In addition, all the delivery system reforms this bill enacts with \nrespect to Medicare are so important to improving quality and reducing \nexcess costs. We all know through history that when we reform Medicare \nand make changes in Medicare, the private sector follows. So the \nprivate commercial market will follow whatever Congress does with \nrespect to Medicare; and that is, make good, positive changes. Why? \nBecause Medicare is such a large provider of care, it tends to have a \nreal effect on what other providers do.\n  What are some of those? Well, basically, we start to change the way \nwe pay doctors and hospitals; that is, we start to pay on the basis of \nvalue rather than volume, that is quality rather than quantity. The \nparadox of that is, when people stop to think about it, we are going to \nboth cut down costs and increase value at the same time because we will \nbe focused on quality. When you focus on quality--not just quantity, \nnot the whole volume of services, but, rather, focus on quality--you \nare going to get better quality, but your costs are going to go down \nbecause you are not reimbursing things such as excessive MRIs, \nexcessive CAT scans, excessive high-cost procedures that do not, in \nmany cases, get to the quality of health care but, rather, are very \nexpensive, and Medicare pays for them. So we are moving more toward \nreimbursing based on quality and value than quantity.\n  What else is reform of the health care industry? One is bundled \npayments and the shared-savings program, which we refer to as \naccountable care organizations. This allows hospitals and groups to get \ntogether to cut down costs. We have bundling in here, which is another \nidea that moves along the same lines. I might add, too, the CMS \nInnovation Center and the Independent Payment Advisory Board suggest \nsome of these.\n  The bill makes it easier for employers to offer workplace wellness \nprograms. We give employers greater flexibility to offer premium \ndiscounts for workers who are committed to leading healthier \nlifestyles. There is a lot of emphasis here on wellness and lifestyles. \nWe give incentives to employers to have wellness programs and \npreventive programs, which will help, obviously, the worker, but, in \naddition to that, cut down costs.\n  There are other provisions here. This bill keeps getting stronger. \nThe so-called freshmen package, led by Senator Warner, will give the \nSecretary additional authority to expand delivery system reforms. It \nexpands the scope of the Medicare board to the private sector.\n  There are many other provisions in here.\n  The Nation's employers, through the leadership of the BRT, played an \nimportant role in developing that package.\n  And the manager's amendment included a provision that will provide \ngreater access to Medicare data to measure performance.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that this bill will revolutionize health \ncare.\n  But don't take my word for it.

Garber, M.D., Ph.D.\n       Henry J. Kaiser, Jr., Professor, Professor of Medicine, \n     Professor of Economics, Health Research and Policy, and of \n     Economics in the Graduate School of Business (courtesy), \n     Director, Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research and \n     Center for Health Policy Stanford University.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 17, 2009.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President, As the full Senate prepares to debate \n     comprehensive health reform legislation, we write as \n     economists to stress the potential benefits of health reform \n     for our nation's fiscal health, and the importance of those \n     features of the bill that can help keep health care costs \n     under control. Four elements of the legislation are critical: \n     (1) deficit neutrality, (2) an excise tax on high-cost \n     insurance plans, (3) an independent Medicare commission, and \n     (4) delivery system reforms.\n       Including these four elements in the reform legislation--as \n     the Senate Finance Committee bill does and as we hope the \n     bill brought to the Senate floor will do--will reduce long-\n     term deficits, improve the quality of care, and put the \n     nation on a firm fiscal footing. It will help transform the \n     health care system from delivering too much care, to a system \n     that consistently delivers higher-quality, high-value care. \n     The projected increases in federal budget deficits, along \n     with concerns about the value of the health care that \n     Americans receive, make it particularly important to enact \n     fiscally responsible and quality-improving health reform now.\n       In developing our analysis and recommendation, we received \n     input and suggestions from Administration officials, \n     including the Office of Management and Budget and others, as \n     well as from economists who disagree with the \n     Administration's views.\n       The four key measures are:\n       Deficit neutrality. Fiscally responsible health reform \n     requires budget neutrality or deficit reduction over the \n     coming years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) must \n     project that the bill be at least deficit neutral over the \n     10-year budget window, and deficit reducing thereafter. \n     Covering tens of millions of currently uninsured people will \n     increase spending, but the draft health reform legislation \n     contains offsetting savings sufficient to cover those costs \n     and the seeds of further reforms that will lower the growth \n     of spending. Deficit neutrality over the first decade means \n     that, even during the start-up period, the legislation will \n     not add to our deficits. After the first decade, the \n     legislation should reduce deficits.\n       Excise tax on high-cost insurance plans. The Senate Finance \n     Committee's bill includes an excise tax on high-cost health \n     insurance plans. Like any tax, the excise tax will raise \n     federal revenues, but it has additional advantages for the \n     health care system that are essential. The excise tax will \n     help curtail the growth of private health insurance premiums \n     by creating incentives to limit the costs of plans to a tax-\n     free amount. In addition, as employers and health plans \n     redesign their benefits to reduce health care premiums, cash \n     wages will increase. Analysis of the Senate Finance \n     Committee's proposal suggests that the excise tax on high-\n     cost insurance plans would increase workers' take-home pay by \n     more than $300 billion over the next decade. This provision \n     offers the most promising approach to reducing private-sector \n     health care costs while also giving a much needed raise to \n     the tens of millions of Americans who receive insurance \n     through their employers.\n       Medicare Commission. Rising Medicare expenditures pose one \n     of the most difficult fiscal challenges facing the federal \n     government. Medicare is technically complex and the benefits \n     it underwrites are of critical importance to tens of millions \n     of seniors and Americans with disabilities. We believe that a \n     commission of medical experts should be empowered to suggest \n     changes in Medicare to improve the quality and value of \n     services. In particular, such a commission should be charged \n     with developing and suggesting to Congress plans to extend \n     the solvency of the Medicare program and improve the quality \n     of care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries. Creating such a \n     commission will make sure that reforming the health care \n     system does not end with this legislation, but continues in \n     future decades, with new efforts to improve quality and \n     contain costs.\n       Delivery system reforms. Successful reform should improve \n     the care that individual patients receive by rewarding health \n     care professionals for providing better care, not just more \n     care. Studies have shown that hundreds of billions of dollars \n     are spent on care that does nothing to improve health \n     outcomes. This is largely a consequence of the distorted \n     incentives associated with paying for volume rather than \n     quality. Health care reform must take steps to change the way \n     providers care for patients, to reward care that is better \n     coordinated and meets the needs of each patient. In \n     particular, the legislation should include additional funding \n     for research into what tests and treatments work and which \n     ones do not. It must also provide incentives for physicians \n     and hospitals to focus on quality, such as bundled payments \n     and accountable care organizations, as well as penalties for \n     unnecessary re-admissions and health-facility acquired \n     infections. Aggressive pilot projects should be rapidly \n     introduced and evaluated, with the best strategies adopted \n     quickly throughout the health care system.\n       As economists, we believe that it is important to enact \n     health reform, and it is essential that health reform include \n     these four features that will lower health care costs and \n     help reduce deficits over the long term. Reform legislation \n     that embodies these four elements can go a long way toward \n     delivering better health care, and better value, to \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n       Dr. Henry Aaron, The Brookings Institution.\n       Dr. Kenneth Arrow, Stanford University, Nobel Laureate in \n     Economics.\n       Dr. Alan Auerbach, University of California, Berkeley.\n       Dr. Katherine Baicker, Harvard University.\n       Dr. Alan Blinder, Princeton University.\n       Dr. David Cutler, Harvard University.\n       Dr. Angus Deaton, Princeton University.\n       Dr. J.

The CMS Actuary agrees that this bill bends the cost \ncurve. The folks at the Commonwealth Fund say the bill will save \nfamilies $2,000 per year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an excerpt from Dr. \nGawande's article from the New Yorker be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Excerpt From Gawande Article in New Yorker\n\n       There are hundreds of pages of these programs, almost all \n     of which appear in the House bill as well. But the Senate \n     reform package goes a few U.S.D.A.-like steps further. It \n     creates a center to generate innovations in paying for and \n     organizing care. It creates an independent Medicare advisory \n     commission, which would sort through all the pilot results \n     and make recommendations that would automatically take effect \n     unless Congress blocks them. It also takes a decisive step in \n     changing how insurance companies deal with the costs of \n     health care. In the nineteen-eighties, H.M.O.s tried to \n     control costs by directly overruling doctors' recommendations \n     (through requiring pre-authorization and denying payment); \n     the backlash taught them that it was far easier to avoid \n     sicker patients and pass along cost increases to employers. \n     Both the House and the Senate bills prevent insurance \n     companies from excluding patients. But the Senate plan also \n     imposes an excise tax on the most expensive, ``Cadillac'' \n     insurance plans. This pushes private insurers to make the \n     same efforts that public insurers will make to test \n     incentives and programs that encourage clinicians to keep \n     costs down.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma at one point \nquestioned the constitutionality of the mandate to buy health \ninsurance. I might say, we thoroughly studied this issue. I believe \nthere is ample authority for Congress to enact such a provision under \nthe Commerce Clause, and also under the congressional authority to tax \nand spend for the general welfare provided for in the Constitution.\n  I might also add, Prof. Mark Hall of Wake Forest University has done \nan excellent survey article on this subject. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the conclusion of Professor Hall's article, \nfound at www.oneillinstitute.org, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13582]]\n\nLegal Solutions in Health Reform--The Constitutionality of Mandates To \n                       Purchase Health Insurance\n\n                         (By Mark A. Hall, JD)\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n                   Prepared by the O'Neill Institute\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Health insurance mandates have been a component of many \n     recent health care reform proposals. Because a federal \n     requirement that individuals transfer money to a private \n     party is unprecedented, a number of legal issues must be \n     examined. This paper analyzes whether Congress can legislate \n     a health insurance mandate and the potential legal challenges \n     that might arise, given such a mandate. The analysis of legal \n     challenges to health insurance mandates applies to federal \n     individual mandates, but can also apply to a federal mandate \n     requiring employers to purchase health insurance for their \n     employees. There are no Constitutional barriers for Congress \n     to legislate a health insurance mandate as long as the \n     mandate is properly designed and executed, as discussed \n     below. This paper also considers the likelihood of any change \n     in the current judicial approach to these legal questions.\n\n\n                          POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS\n\n       Congress's Authority to Regulate Commerce: The federal \n     government has the authority to legislate a health insurance \n     mandate under the Commerce Clause of the United States \n     Constitution. A federal mandate to purchase health insurance \n     is well within the breadth of Congress' power to regulate \n     interstate commerce. Congress can avoid legal challenges \n     related to the 10th Amendment and states' rights by pre-\n     empting state insurance laws and implementing the mandate on \n     a federal level. If Congress wants states to implement a \n     federal mandate, it has the following two options:\n       Conditional Spending: Congress may condition federal \n     funding, such as that for Medicaid or public health, on state \n     compliance with federal initiatives.\n       Conditional Preemption: Congress may allow states to opt \n     out of complying with direct federal regulation as long as \n     states implement a similar regulation that meets federal \n     requirements.\n       Congress's Authority to Tax and Spend for the General \n     Welfare: Congress also has the authority to legislate a \n     health insurance mandate under its Constitutional authority \n     to tax and spend. There are no plausible Tenth Amendment and \n     states' rights issues arising from Congress's taxing and \n     spending power. However, Congress' taxation power cannot be \n     used in a way that burdens a fundamental right recognized in \n     the Constitution's Bill of Rights and judicial \n     interpretations by the U.S. Supreme Court. Since there is no \n     fundamental right to be uninsured, no fundamental rights \n     challenge exists.\n       Other Relevant Constitutional Rights: Challenges under the \n     First and Fifth Amendments relating to individual rights may \n     arise, but are unlikely to succeed. The federal government \n     should include an exemption on religious grounds to a health \n     insurance mandate as an added measure of protection from \n     legal challenges based on religious freedom. In the \n     alternative, the federal government can simply exempt a \n     federal insurance mandate from existing federal legislation \n     protecting religious freedom.\n       Considerations: To avoid a heightened level of scrutiny in \n     any judicial review, the federal government should articulate \n     its substantive rationale for mandating health insurance \n     during the legislative process.\n\n\n                     legal issues & applicable law\n\n       Commerce Clause: Congress has the power to regulate \n     interstate commerce, including local matters that \n     substantially affect interstate commerce. Health care and \n     health insurance both affects and is distributed through \n     interstate commerce, giving Congress the power to legislate \n     an insurance mandate using its Commerce Clause powers.\n       Taxing and Spending Power: Congress has the power to tax \n     and spend for the general welfare. It can use its taxing \n     power to implement a ``pay or play'' model to tax individuals \n     that did not purchase insurance or provide tax benefits to \n     those that do purchase insurance. Congress can also use its \n     spending powers to influence state action. The taxing power \n     of the federal government can be limited if a tax \n     intentionally and directly burdens the exercise of a \n     fundamental right.\n       Federalism: The 10th Amendment and principle of state \n     sovereignty in the Constitution prohibit the federal \n     government from commanding the states to implement federal \n     law or policies that would interfere with state sovereignty. \n     This is referred to as the ``anti-commandeering'' principle. \n     A federal employer mandate covering state and local \n     government workers appears consistent with existing \n     Constitutional decisions but still might be susceptible to \n     challenge under the Tenth Amendment.\n       Individual Rights: The First and Fifth Amendment contain \n     provisions that may have some bearing on a health insurance \n     mandate.\n       Free Exercise of Religion: The First Amendment's Free \n     Exercise Clause protects the free exercise of religion. In \n     addition, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) \n     prevents the federal government from enacting a law that \n     substantially burdens an individual's exercise of religion, \n     unless the government has a compelling interest.\n       Due Process and Takings Clauses: The Fifth Amendment \n     includes two relevant provisions. The Due Process Clause \n     guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, \n     or property without due process of law. The Takings Clause \n     states that the government may not take an individual's \n     property without just compensation.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       The Constitution permits Congress to legislate a health \n     insurance mandate. Congress can use its Commerce Clause \n     powers or its taxing and spending powers to create such a \n     mandate. Congress can impose a tax on those that do not \n     purchase insurance, or provide tax benefits to those that do \n     purchase insurance. If Congress would like the states to \n     implement an insurance mandate, it can avoid conflicts with \n     the anti-commandeering principle by either preempting state \n     insurance laws or by conditioning federal funds on state \n     compliance. A federal employer mandate for state and local \n     government workers may be subject to a challenge; however, \n     such a challenge is unlikely to be successful. Individual \n     rights challenges under the First Amendment's Free Exercise \n     Clause or RFRA are unlikely to succeed, although a federal \n     insurance mandate should include a statement that RFRA does \n     not apply or provide for a religious exemption. Fifth \n     Amendment Due Process and Takings Clause challenges are also \n     unlikely to be successful. The legal analysis presented is \n     likely to endure, as the Supreme Court's current position and \n     approach to interpreting relevant constitutional issues \n     appear to be stable.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might also say, Mr. President, the Senator from \nOklahoma said the independent Medicare advisory board would ration \ncare. In fact, he even accused us in the Congress--myself included--of \nvoting against a prohibition on rationing. But, I might say, I am not \nfor rationing care in the sense that the Senator from Oklahoma talked \nabout. I do not think anybody in this Congress is. We have to find a \nsystem that starts to control costs in a fair way, that increases \nquality but also cuts costs. That is the underlying premise of the \ndelivery system reforms in this bill. But do not just take my word for \nit. Right here in the bill, on page 1004, the bill says, with regard to \nthe advisory board:\n\n       The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration \n     health care.\n\n  I chuckle a little bit when I say that because the Senator from \nOklahoma is very concerned about using the word ``shall.'' If he does \nnot like ``shall,'' then I suppose he means the board would have \ndiscretion. But we say ``shall not include any recommendation to ration \nhealth care.'' That is on page 1004 of the bill. It is right there in \nblack and white letters. Read the bill. The prohibition against \nrationing of health care is right there.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Ohio, who wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Finance chairman for his \nleadership.\n  I have sat here listening. I was watching the debate in the last hour \nfrom my office, and then I came over in the last 20 minutes or half \nhour and watched from here. I am incredulous when I hear my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle talk about ``saving Medicare.'' This is \nthe same group of people, with only one exception on the whole \nRepublican side of the aisle, in 2003, who rammed through the Medicare \nprivatization bill that was written by the drug companies and the \ninsurance companies for the drug companies and the insurance companies.\n  Two things: One, they never paid for it. There was no discussion, no \ninterest, no move to pay for their bill at all. Then they criticize \nthat our bill is costing too much and running up the debt, when the \nCongressional Budget Office--which everyone knows is fair--they \ncomplain about the Congressional Budget Office. It is like at a \nsporting event. The losing team complains about the ref.\n  The other side, because they are losing, complains about the \nCongressional Budget Office. We know it plays fair. We cite it. We \nmust. We do. It helps us move forward and helps us figure things out. \nBut they did not even try to pay for their Medicare privatization bill \nbecause the drug companies and the insurance companies would not have \ngotten their way so much if they tried to pay for it. But the second \nthing is, their bill shortened the life expectancy of Medicare.\n  Our bill increases the life expectancy of Medicare for 10 years. And \nthey have the gall to come to the floor and say our bill does not treat \nMedicare right, that our bill is going to ruin Medicare, that our bill \nwhatever.\n  If you are a senior citizen in our country, understand what this bill \ndoes\n\n[[Page S13583]]\n\nfor Medicare. This bill guarantees benefits, No. 1. No. 2, this bill \nlengthens the life of Medicare for several years, as I said. No. 3, \nthis bill helps with the cost of prescription drugs by closing that \ndoughnut hole my friends on the other side of the aisle created back in \n2003 with President Bush because the drug companies wanted it that way \nand the insurance companies wanted it that way.\n  Last, this bill provides all kinds of services to seniors they were \nnot getting before--mammograms, colonoscopies--for free because we \nwant--not that we want to do a give-away but we want seniors to be \nhealthy and live longer and have healthier lives. We know that is good \nfor our country. It is good for them. It is good for our families. I am \nincredulous when I hear them talk about Medicare.\n  The second thing I am incredulous about when I hear them, that is \npretty unbelievable, is how they talk about partisanship. In the \nHealth, Education, Labor, Pensions Committee, which Senator Coburn sits \non and Senator Burr sits on--two of the people who were talking \nearlier--and the Presiding Officer sits on, we accepted 160 amendments. \nI voted for almost all of them. They made sense. Some were minor; some \nwere more major. That gave this bill a bipartisan flavor to it.\n  But now they say the bill is too partisan and we were not listening, \nthey say we are rushing it through--whatever they say. But the reason, \neven with those 160 Republican amendments, they do not want to pass it \nis twofold. One is people such as Senator DeMint said: This is the \nPresident's Waterloo. If we can defeat this, we can end his presidency. \nSo part of their opposition is strict win-at-any-cost partisanship.\n  The other reason is, even though there are 160 Republican amendments, \non the big questions of the day, it is a philosophical difference. Go \nback to 1965. Very few Republicans supported Medicare. On the key vote \nin the House of Representatives, only 10 out of 160 or 170 Republicans \nsupported Medicare. Over here, in those days, there were a few sort of \n``Rockefeller Republicans'' who supported it. But, by and large, the \nmainstream Republican party, at least in Congress, opposed Medicare.\n  So just like they opposed Medicare because it was a big question, \nthey are opposing this bill because it is a big philosophical question. \nThat is fine they disagree with us, but do not accuse us of \npartisanship when, one, many of them want President Obama to fail. That \nis a strategy. It is a political strategy. But, second, do not accuse \nus of partisanship when 160 Republican amendments were in this bill in \nmy committee, and in Senator Baucus's committee many amendments were \naccepted that were Republican amendments.\n  Then to say we have to slow this down because it has gone too fast, \nthese negotiations have been going on for months. In the Finance \nCommittee, the Gang of 6 started in mid-June officially, and it began \nbefore that.\n  I want to put a human face on this. When they say, let's not move too \nfast, do you know why I want to move, why I want to get this done by \nChristmas? We do not deserve to have Christmas with our families until \nwe finish this. Do you know why? Because every day in my State--in \nDefiance and in Williwick and in Warren and in Steubenville--every day \nin my State, 390 Ohioans--lose health insurance.\n  Do you know what else? One thousand people every single week in this \ncountry die because they did not have insurance. So 390 people in my \nState alone--probably 350 in Michigan; probably 250 in Minnesota--every \nsingle day are losing their health insurance, and in this country 1,000 \npeople a week are dying because they do not have health insurance. A \nwoman with breast cancer is 40 percent more likely to die if she is \nuninsured than if she is insured--40 percent more likely to die if she \nis uninsured than if she is insured.\n\n  So when I see my friends stall and stall, and they have all kinds of \nreasons--they have the clerk read the bill, they try to talk too long--\nwhatever it is, however they are stalling in so many different ways, \nthey should think about those 390 Ohioans who lose their insurance \nevery day, think about the 1,000 people a week who die because they \ndon't have insurance, and think of the woman with breast cancer without \ninsurance who just has more trouble fighting back.\n  To further put a human face on this, I wish to share some letters \nfrom people in Ohio who have written me. These are people who \nunderstand how important it is because it is important to their \npersonal lives, their families, their loved ones, themselves, that we \ntake care of this bill by Christmas.\n  Sandra from Franklin County writes:\n\n       In December 2008, my partner lost her job. In July of this \n     year she started working part-time in the evening, which \n     didn't offer insurance. In October she found full-time work. \n     We are grateful she is now employed. The job has no coverage. \n     While she was unemployed, it hurt us financially. We are \n     behind on some bills. But we can't afford health insurance \n     for her now. It's a similar story with a friend of mine. He \n     lost his job last year. After looking for a job, he decided \n     to go back to school. He finally found a job and is happy for \n     that. But he also doesn't get insurance.\n\n  Maria from Montgomery County writes:\n\n       I work in a school and come in contact daily with \n     struggling families who can't afford basic medical care for \n     their families. Please help. We want an America that sees \n     health care as a right for all.\n\n  Today, I was on ``Face the Nation'' with Senator Landrieu and Senator \nAlexander. A woman I was talking to works there part time as a \ncontractor. She has a contracting relationship with them. She helps \nprepare people before they go on the air. She is not employed by CBS; \nshe is an independent contractor. She has her small business. She has \ninsurance and she pays a whole lot of money for it, and she said: Five \nyears from now, I am going to be on Medicare. I look forward to having \nthe stability and predictability of real health insurance. That is why \nthis is so very important.\n  Roberta from Greene County down in Xenia, between Dayton and \nColumbus:\n\n       I am a senior citizen who feels uncomfortable using my \n     fabulous Medicare benefits when others--parents, ill people, \n     the unemployed--don't have any health care at all. Please \n     pass health care reform for all who need and are without \n     medical care.\n\n  Roberta, who is on Medicare, knows and understands, No. 1, how \nimportant Medicare is to her. She also knows she is going to get more \nfrom this bill, including free screenings for mammograms, a free \nphysical every year, and the cost of prescription drugs will be less \nbecause we are closing the doughnut hole. She knows this bill--unlike \nwhen the Republicans tried to privatize Medicare in 2003--actually \nlengthens the life of Medicare.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question? I \nam going to be speaking at the end of this hour that has been allocated \nto our side, and I don't want to interrupt the Senator from Ohio but \nfor one reason. I don't know if the Senator from Ohio heard or is aware \nof a statement made earlier today by our colleague from Oklahoma, \nSenator Coburn, who came to the floor and said:\n\n       What the American people ought to pray is that somebody \n     can't make the vote tonight. That is what they ought to pray.\n\n  I have been trying to reach Senator Coburn because he is on a \ncommittee on which I serve and I work with him. This statement troubles \nme. I am trying to reach him to come back to the floor and explain \nexactly what he meant about a Senator not being able to make the vote \ntonight.\n  I don't know if the Senator from Ohio is familiar with this \nstatement, but I am reaching out to Senator Coburn. I will be on the \nfloor in the next 45 minutes, and I hope he will join me.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio for yielding.\n  Mr. BROWN. I did not see that quote, but I watched what happened here \n2 nights ago when we were trying to pass the Defense appropriations \nbill to make sure our troops were funded in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nstateside and in Europe and everywhere else--Korea, everywhere. The \nRepublicans wanted to kill that even though it would mean no funding, \nit would mean military layoffs, it would mean we wouldn't be able to \nget the things and supplies we need for the troops, because they said: \nWe want to kill health care reform. I don't understand the \ndesperation--except maybe I do because everything about this debate is \nprotecting the insurance companies. I guess that is more important to \nthem than anything else. So I will be interested too. I appreciate the \nassistant majority leader's\n\n[[Page S13584]]\n\ncomments on why Senator Coburn said that.\n  Let me close with one last letter.\n  Valerie from Cuyahoga County, which is in northeast Ohio:\n\n       I thank the Lord that my husband has a job with health \n     benefits. If he didn't have it, I would be knee deep in \n     medical bills. I know how important insurance is. I could \n     never imagine not being able to go to the doctor. I have had \n     many surgeries and had my fair share of doctors' visits. \n     Could you imagine yourself without medical insurance or not \n     being able to go to the doctor?\n\n  She says:\n\n       I bet most Senators and Congressmen never had to worry \n     about that. But many Americans have that worry and it is a \n     scary, scary feeling. The time is now to pass health reform.\n\n  I know my colleagues have good health insurance. Of course they do. \nThat is a good thing. But I also know many of my colleagues don't spend \nmuch time talking to people who don't.\n  Most people in our--if you are a Congressman or a Senator making \n$170,000 a year, most people you see and socialize with probably are \npretty upscale, probably have insurance. Most of us don't spend nearly \nenough time--I know the Presiding Officer does this in Duluth and \nRochester and all over Minnesota. I know the Senator from Colorado, who \nworked on a lot of these issues with me in the House, when he goes to \nBoulder and when he goes home to Denver, he talks to people who don't \nhave insurance.\n  I just wish more of my colleagues who oppose this bill would meet \nsome of the 390 people in my State or in their States who lose their \ninsurance every day. I wish they would talk to a woman who has breast \ncancer without insurance, knowing she is more likely to die. I wish \nthey would talk to some of those people whose family members die \nbecause they don't have insurance. Because most of us dress like this \nand most of us hang around with people who dress like this and \ngenerally we have good insurance, I think we are a little out of touch. \nI hope we can pass this bill, go back home, and meet some of these \npeople for whom this is going to matter because I think it will make a \ndifference in how we all look at this.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Udall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMontana for yielding. I thank him for his tremendous leadership on this \nimportant fight here on the floor of the Senate.\n  First, I commend my colleagues for strapping on their snow gear. The \nPresiding Officer comes from the State of Minnesota, where this kind of \na storm we have had over the last few days is not that unusual a \ndevelopment. I like a good 16-inch dusting from time to time. We all \nknow what an important issue reforming our health care system is, and \nbraving the elements is a small price to pay.\n  I have come to the floor a lot over the past few months to discuss \nthe challenges that are facing us as we work toward fixing our broken \nhealth care system. One overarching theme I continue to emphasize is \njust how important this is to putting our economy back on track.\n  We have a bloated $12 trillion Federal debt which is being fed daily \nby growing health care costs. Every day, employers, small and large, \nare laying off workers and slashing benefits for their employees. Great \nAmerican businesses, especially in our manufacturing sector, have \nnearly collapsed because of the rising costs of providing health care \nfor their workers.\n  Those Americans who have coverage lack the peace of mind in knowing \nthat their insurance will be there just when they need it. This lack of \nstability and peace of mind is a fundamental problem with the status \nquo today because it takes away one of the things valued most by \nAmericans: their freedom. Today, they are reluctant to move to a new \njob, to advance their education, or start a small business for fear \nthey won't be able to provide health care for their families.\n  As we struggle to mend our economy, we can't afford to tell people to \nstay put. We know from history that encouraging the entrepreneurial \nspirit of Americans is the key to promoting small business, creating \njobs, and driving our economic recovery. Small businesses have \naccounted for 65 percent of all new jobs created in the past 15 years, \nbut today anyone who owns or has ever tried to start their own business \ncan attest to why rising health care costs is such a major problem in \nthis country.\n  Take, for example, the story of a gentleman who just recently \ncontacted me from Denver. I will pick up on the theme the Senator from \nOhio was touching upon. If we listened to the people in our States, \nthere would be no question that this reform is necessary. Dave is a \nsmall business owner. Last year, he saw his insurance premiums \nskyrocket 27 percent for his employees. When he questioned this \nunbelievable increase, his insurance company said all he needed to do \nto save money was just stop offering coverage to his employees. Just \nlet them buy their own insurance, his insurance company told him. When \nhe looked into that, when he checked it out, he found out that nearly \nhalf of his workforce would be ineligible for coverage because of \npreexisting conditions and that those who could obtain coverage were \npriced out and couldn't even afford it.\n  I hear this story time and time again--small business owners who want \nto do the right thing but end up facing annual double-digit increases \nin their costs. This is so troubling in this economic time because \nsmall businesses pay on average 18 percent more than large employers \nfor the same level of coverage.\n  The status quo--and the Presiding Officer has been articulate and \neloquent and involved in this fight--as he knows, is unacceptable, and \nwe can't kick the can down the road any longer. The good news is the \nlegislation we are considering contains essential provisions aimed at \nhelping small businesses, individuals, and American families across our \ncountry. Let me touch on a few of the important provisions that are in \nthis final package.\n  Health insurers will be organized into well-regulated marketplaces \nand finally forced to compete. This would then involve a creation of a \nmore transparent process for individuals and small businesses, so, for \nthe first time, you can actually compare insurance plans side by side.\n  The legislation helps individuals pay for these newfound health \ninsurance options. More than half of the cost of reform goes to \nfinancing tax credits to put money back in the pockets of middle-class \nfamilies to help them purchase a health plan. As Chairman Baucus has \npointed out, these tax credits represent the biggest tax cut since \n2001.\n  In addition, starting in 2010, many small businesses will also \nqualify for new tax credits worth up to 50 percent of the cost of \nproviding health insurance to their employees.\n  Also in this bill--I can't emphasize this enough--Americans will no \nlonger go bankrupt because of health care costs. We are the only \ndeveloped country in the world where citizens go bankrupt because they \nhave health care costs they can't afford.\n  Insurers will be prohibited from denying access to health care \nbecause of preexisting conditions, limiting coverage because of age or \ngender, or dropping the insurance someone has already paid for simply \nbecause they get sick.\n  Regardless of what we hear from our friends on the other side of the \naisle, this legislation saves money, it strengthens Medicare, it \nreduces the deficit, and it puts us on a path to finally addressing our \ngrowing national debt. In fact, noted MIT economist Jon Gruber \nestimates this bill will save small businesses 25 percent, or about $65 \nbillion per year, on health insurance. That translates into $30 billion \nin take-home pay and an estimated 80,000 saved jobs.\n  While the bill before us makes important improvements, I would also \nlike to say a few words about the package of amendments offered by the \ndistinguished majority leader. I took some time, as I think we all did \nover the last snowy 24 hours, to familiarize myself with the changes, \nand I wish to touch on some of the most promising revisions that have \nbeen made.\n  I wish to first note my appreciation for including the freshman \npackage. These amendments were offered by myself and the freshman \nclass, of which the Presiding Officer is a member, and\n\n[[Page S13585]]\n\nthey have attracted bipartisan support. They boast the endorsements of \nbusiness, labor, and consumer groups. The provisions inject more cost \ncontainment in the bill, cut down on regulatory and bureaucratic \nredtape, and push even more aggressively toward a reformed health care \nsystem.\n  I am particularly pleased to see a provision I worked on that would \nexpand the scope of a new board designed to strengthen Medicare. The \namendment would task this board not only to monitor Medicare but to \nlook for ways to improve the entire health care system as a whole. I \nbelieve the independent payment advisory board is one of the best cost-\ncontainment tools in the bill, and I want to acknowledge Senator \nRockefeller for his work in developing the idea, as well as Leader Reid \nfor putting even more bite into the authority of this important panel \nof experts.\n  Second, I wish to express how proud I am that Majority Leader Reid \nput so much emphasis in the managers' amendment on improving health \ncare in rural America. The difficulty of accessing health care in rural \ncommunities is a unique struggle I have been increasingly concerned \nabout, especially as I have traveled around Colorado's rural areas in \nthe past several months. I am glad to see the inclusion of an amendment \nI authored to establish a rural physician pipeline training program \ndesigned to help bolster our rural health care workforce. Many of my \ncolleagues joined me in offering this important amendment which has the \npotential to recruit and train more doctors to practice in rural areas.\n  In addition, I also authored an amendment that would establish an \nexplicitly rural element to the community transformation grant program \nwhich is aimed at helping prevent and reduce chronic disease in \ncommunities across the country.\n  My amendment would ensure that rural areas are getting their share of \nthis critical prevention and wellness funding, and I was very proud to \nsee this important change included as well.\n  As I begin to close, I wish to say that although this bill has been \nstrengthened significantly by the majority leader's efforts, it is not \nperfect. But I do not think anyone expects Congress to craft a perfect \npiece of legislation. We could never send the President a bill that \nfixes all the problems in our health care system or exactly reflects \nthe priorities of every single Member of Congress, including myself. \nBut what I am confident of is, this legislation can establish a sturdy \nfoundation upon which we will build, improve, and strengthen access to \nhealth care in America.\n  Will there be mistakes made along the way? I do not doubt it. But as \na lifelong mountain climber, I know from experience that the stumbles \nyou experience along the way are a necessary part of reaching any \nmountaintop. Providing insurance and quality care for all our citizens \nis a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve the health and well-\nbeing of every American. These are the goals of our health insurance \nreform and, over the next few days, I look forward to passing a bill \nwhich modernizes our health care delivery system, increases much needed \nchoice and competition in the health insurance industry, and helps put \nour economy back on track, while improving the financial security of \nmiddle-class working families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nMontana for the extraordinary work he has put in on this bill for so \nlong, so many months, so many years. Thanks also go, of course, to the \nDemocratic leader, our majority leader; Senator Dodd; and others who \nhave worked so hard to get us here.\n  We are in a pivotal moment in the long fight to reform our health \ncare system. Everyone should, by now, be well aware of the history--how \nPresidents of both parties have tried and failed to achieve reform and \nhow, after months of painstaking review, we have arrived at this \ninstant, closer than ever to health care reform.\n  It would be impossible to fashion legislation on an issue so massive \nand so complex on which all could agree in every detail. Those seeking \nperfection will have to look outside this Chamber or, for that matter, \nin any piece of complex legislation.\n  But when they look outside the walls of this Capitol, Senators will \nalso find problems that dwarf the imperfections in this bill. They will \nfind a broken health care system, one in which we pay vastly more than \nother wealthy nations for care that is, in many cases, demonstrably \ninferior. They will find Americans struggling to afford the health care \ncoverage they have and employers struggling to provide insurance to \ntheir employees. They will find manufacturers struggling under a costly \nhealth care burden, from which their international competitors were \nlong ago freed. They will find employee and employer alike plagued by \nnever-ending uncertainty about the cost and availability of health \ninsurance, an instability that haunts families and hinders job \ncreation. They will find costs rising so fast they threaten to swallow \nthe rest of the Federal budget and sink family budgets. They will find \nastonishing amounts of money spent, not on better care or innovative \ntreatments but on overhead and bureaucracy. They will find millions of \nAmericans with no coverage at all--a tragedy for the uninsured and a \nsource of inefficiency and expense that make health care more expensive \nfor all of us.\n  So the choice before us now is whether any imperfections we might see \nin this bill outweigh the mountain of evidence that our current system \nis in dire need of repair. It is between moving forward on a \nsignificant repair of a broken system or quashing yet another attempt \nto reform health care in surrender to the status quo and to the \nrhetoric of distortion and fear.\n  To me, this choice is clear: We cannot wait any longer for health \ncare reform. The people of my State cannot wait. The people of this \nNation cannot wait. Now is the time for all those years of frustrated \neffort, all the research and analysis, all the debate and discussion, \nfor us to reform a broken system. We must vote for cloture on the \nmanagers' amendment before us and continue to vote for cloture on the \nendless filibusters that confront us because we cannot wait.\n  We cannot wait any longer to reform this system because its costs are \nout of control. In 1990, this Nation, 12.3 percent of its gross \ndomestic product on health care. That is $1 in $8. By 2018, the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, estimates that figure will \nincrease to 20 percent, and $1 in every $5 will go to health care. CMS \nestimates that after spending about $6,000 per capita on health care in \n2003, we will spend more than $13,000 per capita in 2018, more than \ndoubling our per-person expenditures in 15 years.\n  This translates directly into unsustainable costs for the American \npeople. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, thousands fewer of \nour businesses are offering insurance than a decade ago, a clear sign \nthey can no longer sustain cost increases of 6 percent or more, year \nafter year. If we do nothing, these costs will continue to rise at a \nrate which will swallow the budgets of families, businesses, and \ngovernment.\n  We cannot wait any longer because, even for those fortunate enough to \nhave insurance where they work, they are increasingly unsure it will be \nthere when they need it most. Every Member of this body has heard from \nconstituents who thought they had solid health insurance, only to find \nout their insurer had wriggled out of paying for desperately needed \ncare or found a convenient preexisting condition that voided their \ncoverage or capped their coverage, so they faced a crushing choice \nbetween treatments they had to have and costs they could not afford. \nEven in cases where families have health insurance, medical emergencies \ncan leave debilitating costs in their wake. According to a study in the \nAmerican Journal of Medicine, 62 percent of all bankruptcies filed in \nthe United States in 2007 involved medical costs; and even more \ncompelling, three-quarters of those bankruptcies involved people who \nhad health insurance when they got sick. There can be no more clear \nsign of the need to act than the fact that having health insurance is \nno insurance against bankruptcy from medical costs.\n\n[[Page S13586]]\n\n  We cannot wait any longer because so much of the enormous cost at the \nheart of this health care crisis is money spent on that having little \nor nothing to do with quality care. For example, for those who purchase \ninsurance in the individual market, roughly 30 percent of the costs \nthey pay will stem from the insurance company's administrative \nexpenses--on bureaucracy, not medicine. A 2003 study published in the \nNew England Journal of Medicine found that, in 1999, Americans spent \nover $1,000 per capita on health care administration costs--more than \n$1,000 for every man, woman, and child in this Nation spent on \npaperwork and redtape. Electronic medical records, which make \nadministration more efficient and improve the quality of care, are \nstill not in use for most patients.\n  Finally, we cannot wait any longer because the inefficiencies of our \nsystem are crushing us and our budgets and, even more pointedly, \nbecause so many lives are at stake. One hundred forty thousand \nAmericans have lost their lives since 2000 because they lacked health \ninsurance. We cannot afford to walk down this road any longer. We must \nchange direction. This bill will do it in a positive way.\n  An analysis by the Urban Institute, using methodology developed by \nthe Institute of Medicine, determined that since 2000, nearly 140,000 \nAmericans have lost their lives because they lacked health insurance. \nOther studies show that breast cancer patients, stroke victims and \nother patients are, as common sense suggests, far more likely to die \nfrom their conditions if they lack adequate health insurance. These are \nrigorous studies that bring us to an inescapable conclusion: If we fail \nto act, Americans will continue to lose their lives when they need not, \nsimply because they don't have adequate health insurance, or any health \ninsurance at all.\n  For these reasons and many others, it is long past time to reform our \nsystem. The question we must then answer is, will we come closer to a \nhealth care system worthy of this Nation if we pass this bill?\n  I believe we will. The legislation before us will reform the \ninsurance system in powerful ways, protecting patients from the host of \nabuses they now so often face. We will begin to control spiraling costs \nin many ways, and establish research centers to find new ways to \nimprove care and lower costs. We will create powerful incentives to \nreduce administrative burdens and costs. And we will bring millions of \nAmericans into the health care system, reducing the number of \nuninsured, and reducing what is both a burden of inefficiency on the \nsystem and a moral blemish on our Nation.\n  We are out of time and out of excuses. Now we must choose. Choose \nbetween beginning to reform on the one hand and continuing the status \nquo on the other. Our individual problems with this bill cannot be \nallowed to overshadow the much larger problems with our health care \nsystem. Near the end of this long path toward health care reform, we \ncannot turn back. The Senate needs to move forward.\n  Again, I thank my good friend from Montana and the other leaders who \nhave made it possible for us to get to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nMontana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I wish to renew my \ninvitation to Senator Coburn to please come to the floor but do it soon \nbefore my time expires. I called his office to make sure he knew I was \ntrying to reach him. I have spoken on the floor to alert the Republican \nside that I wished to ask him to explain a statement he made on the \nfloor earlier today. The statement of Senator Coburn of Oklahoma said:\n\n       What the American people ought to pray is that somebody \n     can't make the vote tonight. That's what they ought to pray.\n\n  I am troubled by this statement. I want to give the Senator from \nOklahoma an opportunity to explain it because the simple reality is, I \ndon't think we should be wishing misfortune on any of our Senate \ncolleagues on either side of the aisle. I don't know if this was an \ninnocent statement or something he now wants to clarify. But as stated, \nit troubles me.\n  It troubles me because I am afraid it reflects the situation we find \nourselves in too often in the Senate, where people are literally \ninvoking God's name in prayer for political purposes--in this case, to \nwish misfortune on one of our colleagues who would not be able to make \nour 1 a.m. scheduled rollcall. I do not wish misfortune on any of our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wish to ask my colleague, who knows the Senate \nprocedures so very well, why are we having a 1 a.m. vote? Isn't it \npossible it could be a different time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator because he is exactly right. Under \nthe usual business of the Senate, we agree that we will do something \nmore thoughtful and humane and a vote at an earlier time. Senator Reid \nhas approached Senator McConnell and said we have one of our Senators, \nSenator Byrd of West Virginia, with significant health problems, who \nwas been brought to the floor now early in the morning, late at night, \nand in a wheelchair. He looks better than ever, I might add. He is \nbeing asked to show up at 1 in the morning because we could not reach \nwhat is usual comity and gentlemanly accord on scheduling a vote.\n  It is unfortunate because now we face this 1 a.m. vote and with no \ncooperation on the other side to even change the vote for a very humane \nreason.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The requests on this side for a vote at a reasonable \nhour--now it is 10 after 5 say maybe 5, 6, 7, 8 eight clock--a \nreasonable time, instead of 1 a.m., have been rejected by the other \nside?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Unfortunately, the Senator from Montana is correct. What \nthe Senator from Oklahoma says is:\n\n       What the American people ought to pray is that somebody \n     can't make the vote tonight. That's what they ought to pray.\n\n  I do not think it is appropriate to be invoking prayer to wish \nmisfortune on a colleague. I want him to clarify that. I have invited \nhim. I tried to reach out to him. He is my friend and I have worked \nwith him. But this statement goes too far.\n  The simple reality is this. We are becoming more coarse and more \ndivided. It is understandable we would disagree on political issues. \nThat happens all the time. But, unfortunately, we have allowed that \npolitical disagreement to spill over into our personal relationships \nand friendships and that does hurt this institution.\n  We rely on one another on both sides of the aisle so much. I would \nsay from the start that Senator Reid has offered the Republican side of \nthe aisle accommodations and asked we try to do things that might help \nthe families and individuals in the Senate, and we have not had any \nluck to date.\n  Hope springs eternal. I hope Senator Coburn can make it to the floor \nto explain his statement. Earlier this week, there was a prayercast \ninvolving several Senators--I did not hear it; I only heard references \nto it--where they were actually in a group praying for the defeat of \nthis legislation on health care reform. It is their right to do that.\n  I can recall as a high school football player saying a prayer my team \nwould win a football game. I don't know if God had any time to worry \nabout my little football game. But when it reaches a point where we are \npraying, asking people to pray that Senators won't be able to answer a \nrollcall, I think it has crossed the line. I hope my friend and \ncolleague from Oklahoma will come and explain exactly what he meant.\n  I wish the bill before us were different. I wish it had a strong \npublic option. I wish it offered Medicare to people 55 years and older. \nI wish it eliminated the McCarran-Ferguson antitrust exemption for \nhealth insurance companies. Unfortunately, it does not do those things.\n  My disappointment over those elements should not lead me to conclude \nthis bill is wanting or bad. The opposite is true. We have to look to \nthe positive side of what this legislation will do.\n  This health care reform will extend the reach of health insurance \ncoverage to 30 million more Americans. I see on the floor this evening \nmy colleague from Arizona. He and I were on a television show early \nthis morning. I am sure we got great ratings because the\n\n[[Page S13587]]\n\npublic can't wait to hear us, but during the course of that television \nshow, the Senator from Arizona expressed concern that 20 million \nAmericans would not be covered by our bill.\n  Interesting, isn't it? Today 50 million Americans are not insured; 50 \nmillion Americans are uninsured. This bill will provide insurance for \n30 million more, meaning 94 percent of Americans will have coverage, \nthe highest percentage in the history of our country. The Senator from \nArizona says it does not go far enough to include more people.\n  We have waited patiently now for 21 days during the course of this \ndebate on health care reform for the Republican plan for reforming \nhealth care. It has never been produced. Promised but never produced. I \nthink the reason is obvious. It does not exist. Several times they have \nsaid on the floor: We have a plan, and they will wave a bill at us. \nWhen the Republicans had a chance over a 3-week period of time to offer \ntheir substitute, they never did. In fact, in over 20 days of active \ndebate on the floor, there were exactly four Republican amendments on \nhealth care reform. Four in 20 days, 1 every 5 days. At that rate, how \nlong would the Republicans have us stay on the floor waiting for the \nnext amendment?\n  That is the reality. They offered six motions to stop the debate, \nremove the bill from the floor, and send it back to committee. Of \ncourse, when it came to actual substantive amendments changing sections \nof the bill, they would not do it. So the Republicans have come up \nempty. They are running on empty when it comes to health care reform \nwhich means this task of writing a bill is either beyond their pay \ngrade or beyond their will and they like the system as it exists.\n  I do not. Fifty million uninsured Americans is unacceptable in this \ncountry. I think we have to reach a point where we move forward with 30 \nmillion now and then find ways to bring in the additional 20 million. \nRemember, when Social Security was enacted into law, with the \nresistance of the Republicans--they resisted it saying it is too much \ngovernment--the safety net extended to widows. We extended in years \nthat followed Social Security protection to dependents, survivors, and \nthe disabled and we added a cost-of-living adjustment.\n  It was not the end of Social Security in the 1930s. In the years that \nfollowed, we built on the original bill and we will build on this \noriginal model of health care reform. The same thing is true under \nMedicare. Medicare as originally offered did not cover disabled people. \nIt did not provide home health care, therapy, or prescription drugs. \nOver the years, we added those benefits.\n  I believe this is an important starting point. I also think it is \nimportant we provide insurance protection for Americans. When it comes \nright down to it, too many people are denied the therapies, the \nsurgeries, the medications their doctors recommend because some clerk \nin an office at a health insurance company is instructed to just say \nno, and they say no repeatedly.\n  We also make sure that patients are first, even with our additional \namendment guaranteeing the right of people to pick their doctor and \nkeep their doctor. It is a patient-first approach that we are using on \nthis bill.\n  We hold the health insurance companies accountable and say if they \nturn around and gouge the patients before they want to be part of the \ninsurance exchange, they can be disqualified. We saw what happened with \ncredit card reform. When the banks had their way after the passage of \ncredit card reform and during the period before it went into law, they \nran up the interest rates on credit cards. I got letters in the mail \nfrom American Express and others saying: Incidentally, because of the \nnew Federal law, we are going to raise your interest rate on your \ncredit card over 20 percent. We know some of these merchants, given \nenough time, will capitalize on that time and try to exploit that \nsystem. Our bill is going to go after them.\n  The medical loss ratio is an important part in the bill. I am sure \nthe health insurance companies are not going to be happy with it. It \nsays: Stop taking those premium dollars and turning them into \nadministrative expenses, advertising, bonuses for CEOs' high-paid \nsalaries. Take the money and pay for medical services for the people \nyou insure. If you do not, if you take too much of this money for \nprofiteering, you are going to have to rebate it to your customers. It \nis changing the balance, giving customers a chance when it comes to \nhealth insurance--something that is long overdue.\n  We extend the health care safety net in this bill. Mr. President, 1.8 \nmillion people in my home State of Illinois will have access to \naffordable health insurance. I have met them. They are hard-working \npeople, small businesses, part-time employees, unemployed people--none \nof them has health insurance. Again, 1.8 million in my State of almost \n13 million are going to have the chance to be covered.\n  We will have 10,000 more community health centers.\n  I cannot tell you what an exciting idea this is. If you visit a \ncommunity health center in Arizona or Illinois, you know what I am \ntalking about. This is a clinic in a neighborhood, usually, or small \ntown where people can literally walk through the front door and get \naccess to primary care physicians who will help them through their \nmedical difficulties. They do not have to wait until they are so bad \nthey end up in an emergency room where costs are dramatically higher. \nThey have a doctor, a nurse, a medical professional, a dentist right \nthere in their community. We estimate this bill will add 10,000 more \ncommunity health clinics across the United States. That is going to be \na dramatic change.\n  It also will create the opportunity for 20,000 more primary care \nphysicians across America. If there is anything more we need, it is \nfamily care, internists who can deal with the medical needs of people \nbefore they are referred to a specialist or before their situation has \ndeteriorated.\n  This bill is going to provide for all people under 133 percent of \npoverty--that is about $29,000 for a family of four--the security of \nknowing they are under Medicaid protection without health insurance \ncosts, without health insurance premiums. We will say to those working \npoor people: You are going to have health insurance. We also believe \nthat progress is going to take some time.\n  I recall that Senator Teddy Kennedy, who I wish were here for this \ngreat battle for which he prepared for four decades, said in his book \n``True Compass'' toward the end that real reform is never over. It is \nnot. This is a beginning. It is an important beginning. It establishes \nimportant principles.\n  I say to the critics, we don't expect every aspect of this bill to \nwork perfectly. It is an imperfect product made by mere humans trying \nto do their best. But some of the things in this bill are going to \ndramatically change health care in America for the better. We are going \nto find ways to deliver quality care to people in a cost-effective way. \nWe are going to change parts of our system today which, unfortunately, \nunder this current system are out of control. The costs are out of \ncontrol.\n  Moving coverage to an additional 30 million people, 94 percent of \nAmericans under coverage, something no other bill from either side of \nthe aisle has proposed, reducing our deficit--incidentally, we now have \na CBO statement which makes it clear that the budget savings in the \nsecond 10 years--the first 10 years is $130 billion; the second 10 \nyears is up to $1.3 trillion. They qualified it, but it still is the \nmost dramatic deficit reduction bill in the history of the United \nStates. There has never been a bill that has come before us that \nreduces our deficit so dramatically.\n  It reduces it because it works. It brings down the cost of health \ncare. As far as Medicare is concerned, this bill will add at least 9 \nyears of life to Medicare. Medicare, which is going to face serious \nfinancial problems in about 7 or 8 years, has a new lease on life with \nthis bill of 9 or 10 years.\n  To say this saves Medicare and puts it on sound footing is a fact \nthat has been confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office, all the \nspeeches on the floor notwithstanding.\n  This bill is also going to move us forward in the whole area of \nlooking at ways to deal with medical negligence and medical \nmalpractice. We provide incentives and grants to States to find ways, \nwithout penalizing the true victims of medical malpractice, to reduce \nthe incidence of lawsuits, to reduce defensive medicine. That is a \nconscientious and thoughtful way to approach this.\n\n[[Page S13588]]\n\n  I would say, if I were to ask anyone to offer a prayer--and I don't \ndo that very often--I would say a prayer for the 50 million uninsured \nAmericans, folks who go to bed without peace of mind that they have \nhealth insurance for themselves and their families. I would say a \nprayer for those turned down by health insurance companies when their \ndoctor says they need a certain therapy or a certain medication or a \ncertain surgery. Those are the people I think of. I pray good fortune \nfor them. I do not pray for misfortune for anyone in the Senate--not \nfor any of my colleagues, not for any of my political opponents. I do \nnot think that is appropriate use of prayer to do that.\n  I am sorry, as I bring this to an end, that the Senator from Oklahoma \nhas not been able to come to the floor. I have tried now on several \noccasions through the cloakroom and other ways to invite him to come \nand explain his remarks. I am troubled when he says the American people \nought to pray that somebody can't make the vote tonight. I pray for \neverybody. I don't pray for misfortune for anyone in the Senate. Let's \nhave the vote. Let's have all 100 Senators here voting their \nconscience, voting their heart.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will be a bit presumptuous here that I \ncan speak for most Senators and probably most of the American people. \nOne thing in life that is so difficult to deal with is when you are \nworking with somebody, irrespective of a situation, and trying to \nresolve an issue, a problem, and the person you are talking to or \nworking with is not dealing in good faith. When each side is dealing in \ngood faith, then each side will begin to recognize the merits of the \nother person's point of view and each person tends to recognize the \ndeficiencies and faults of his own point of view. It is a good-faith \nexchange.\n  Not very many things in life are black and white and not many issues \nare black and white. Most of them are some shade of gray. I may think \nthat even though my issues--I am not white and the other guy is black, \nI like to think my shade of gray is more light than his shade of gray. \nThat is not relevant. What works is when both sides talk to each other \nand try to make an accommodation.\n  I think I can safely say most Americans think our health care system \nneeds some repair. It is too costly. There are too many cases when the \ninsurance industry cherry-picks and takes advantage of people. It is \nnot the right thing to do.\n  Also, we have to find a different way to pay for doctors and \nhospitals, reimbursing on basic quality, not quantity. Almost all \ndoctors agree we should move in that direction.\n  A few minutes earlier, one Senator got up and said CBO has made this \nhuge error, a $\\1/2\\ trillion error. He goes on and on about this $\\1/\n2\\ trillion error. To be honest, if we are going to deal in good faith, \nwe should mention the pluses and the minuses, and let the Senators and \nthe public figure out where all this nets out.\n  CBO has made many statements, most of which I think the Democratic \nside has relied on, and CBO has made statements that the Republican \nside has relied on. It is not black and white. It is a shade of gray.\n  In this case, it is true that CBO sent a letter, I think it was \ntoday--in fact, I have it here with me--that said they made a $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion error in the second 10 years. What was the error? I don't \nremember the exact figure, but essentially I think CBO said this \nlegislation will reduce the debt in the last 10 years by I think it was \n\\1/2\\ percent of GDP which comes out to about $1.3 trillion to the \ngood. It reduces the debt by $1.3 trillion.\n  CBO in a letter to us came back and said they made a mistake. This \nlegislation does reduce the Federal budget deficits over the subsequent \n10 years but not by as much. A \\1/2\\ percent GDP should have been \nbetween a \\1/4\\ percent GDP and \\1/2\\ percent GDP.\n  Half the story is CBO said they made an error of \\1/2\\ percent GDP. \nBut the full story is, still, nevertheless, the Congressional Budget \nOffice says:\n\n       All told, CBO expects that the legislation, if enacted, \n     would reduce federal budget deficits over the decade over \n     2019 relative to those projected under current law--with the \n     total effect during that decade that is in a broad range \n     between one-quarter and one-half percent of GDP.\n\n  Essentially, they are saying: We made a mistake at CBO, but still \nthis is going to reduce deficits between $615 billion and, say, $1.3 \ntrillion. That is the full story.\n  I hope when we debate here that we give both sides of the story. That \nway we can work more toward common ground what is right. Nobody is \ntotally right. Each of us is here serving in good faith. We want to do \nwhat is best for our people in our home States, and we are trying. \nDifferent States have different points of view. We are going to get \nbetter solutions in health care reform if we talk to each other in good \nfaith and give the whole story, not just part of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments my colleague from \nMontana made. I think the point my colleague earlier was trying to make \nwas that we just got the bill yesterday and have not gotten a full CBO \nor final CBO score; that the correction simply revealed the fact there \nis a lot there to digest, and we ought to have more time to understand \nexactly how the interrelated pieces of the bill work, how all the CBO \nscoring relates, and so on. When CBO can make about a $600 billion \nerror, as I understand, that is a big error. So there is probably more \nand a lot we don't understand. It would be helpful if we had more time \nto understand this and how it all works, and that was the point my \ncolleague was making, I believe.\n\n  But I do appreciate my colleague pointing out it is better we work in \ngood faith and, for the most part, I certainly recall the long \nconversations the ranking Republican, Senator Grassley, and the \nchairman of the committee had. I know they worked in good faith, and it \nwould be best if we did that. It is to that end I wish to speak to some \ncomments a colleague made earlier today.\n  I don't know whether it is frustration or maybe just the lens through \nwhich partisans view things and their opponents, unfortunately, that \nspawned the remarks earlier today from one of our Democratic \ncolleagues, but in either event, his characterization of his Republican \ncolleagues, I think, requires response.\n  He began by talking about the malignant and vindictive passions that \nhave descended on the Senate. Here is what he said, and I am quoting:\n\n     . . . too many colleagues are embarked on a desperate, ``no \n     holds barred'' mission of propaganda, obstruction and fear. \n     History cautions us of the excesses to which these malignant, \n     vindictive passions can ultimately lead. Tumbrils have rolled \n     through taunting crowds, broken glass has sparkled in \n     darkened streets, strange fruit has hung from southern trees.\n\n  I couldn't believe my ears, these references to Kristallnacht, one of \nthe first and most vicious attacks on the Jews by the Nazis, and \nhanging of Blacks. The majority leader's remarks last week, comparing \nthe Republicans' position on health care to the proslavery movement, \nremain largely ignored as the clumsy, offhand remarks of a partisan, \nbut the references earlier today appeared not to be off-the-cuff \nmistakes but prepared text, deliberately delivered by one of the \nbrighter minds of the Senate.\n  Our colleague went on to acknowledge, and I quote again:\n\n     . . . that in the heat of those vindictive passions, some \n     people earnestly believed they were justified. Such is the \n     human capacity for intoxication by those malignant and \n     vindictive political passions.\n\n  Well, yes, Republican Senators do believe our position is justified--\nin fact, correct. There are honorable people on both sides of the aisle \nwho obviously have to agree to disagree. But our colleague attributes \nno good motive to Republicans, whose passions are simply ``malignant \nand vindictive.'' He adduces evidence to support his claim. First, an \nunnamed editor of the Manchester Inquirer who wrote that the GOP ``has \ngone crazy'' and an unnamed economist who believes our party has been \ntaken over by the ``irrational right.'' A Philadelphia columnist talked \nabout ``lunacy on the Republican right.''\n  Further quoting now: `` . . . it has gone crazy, is more and more \ndominated by the lunatic fringe and has poisoned itself with hate.''\n\n[[Page S13589]]\n\n  I wonder if my colleagues believe our position is animated by hatred. \nWhy else would we oppose this legislation? Well, he answers that \nquestion too. It is because, he says, first of all:\n\n     . . . to break the momentum of our new young President. They \n     are desperate to break this President. They have ardent \n     supporters who are nearly hysterical at the very election of \n     President Barack Obama--the birthers, the fanatics, the \n     people running around in right-wing militias and Aryan \n     support groups. It is unbearable to them that President \n     Barack Obama should exist. That is one powerful reason. It is \n     not the only one.\n\n  Well, talk about vindictive passions. Does my colleague believe that \nis why I oppose the legislation--or my colleague John McCain? I hate to \ndisappoint some folks, but I don't care about the political fortunes of \nthe President, at least not right now. I may about 3 years from now. I \ndon't like this bill. That is why I oppose it.\n  My colleague says there is another reason. He says it is the \n``insurance industry,'' which he proceeded to demonize. I am not one to \ndefend the insurance industry, but it is strange to see it so demonized \nby my colleague, whose party brags of getting another 30 million people \ninsured by what? The insurance industry. Why subject these folks to \nsuch awful torture? But the real irony is, the legislation which we \noppose, the insurance industry supported. It made a deal with the Obama \nadministration and key Senate Democrats: You mandate that every \nAmerican has to buy one of our policies, and we will support your bill. \nThere was a deal all right, but it was between the insurance industry \nand key Democrats. The insurance industry obviously didn't dictate the \nRepublican position, which largely opposes the individual mandate.\n  Well, finally, our colleague also accused Republicans of engaging in \nsomething else. He said we were engaged in a:\n\n     . . . campaign of falsehood about death panels and cuts to \n     Medicare benefits and benefits for illegal aliens and \n     bureaucrats to be parachuted in between you and your doctor.\n\n  He went on to state:\n\n       Our colleagues terrify the public with this parade of \n     imagined horrors. They whip up concerns and anxiety . . . \n     then they tell us the public is concerned about the bill.\n\n  So the reason the public is opposed to the bill is because of the \npower of Republican Senators to terrify our constituents about imagined \nhorrors. Let us look at the examples given.\n  I don't know of any Republican Senator who has characterized the \nhealth care rationing as coming from death panels. I heard that phrase \nin another context. We have tried to discuss the provisions of the bill \nwe believe do result in rationing. The chairman of the committee and I \nhave had a lot of debate on this subject. I wish Senator Roberts and I \ncould offer a couple of the amendments we wanted to offer to make sure \nthere is no rationing in the bill. I think it is a real problem and \nshould be debated on its merits.\n  The benefits for illegal aliens, I suspect he was referring there to \nthe House debate, but it is still the case that there are completely \ninadequate provisions in the bill to verify eligibility for benefits. \nYou can even apply by telephone, so just about anybody could apply for \nsome of the benefits.\n  Third, the matter of Medicare benefits. I don't think we are \nterrorizing our constituents about Medicare benefits, unless they \nunderstand the facts, and the facts are that Medicare benefits are \ngoing to be cut. The Congressional Budget Office says the Medicare \nAdvantage benefits are going to be reduced from a monthly actuarial \nvalue of $135 down to $49 a month. That is CBO saying there is going to \nbe reduction in the benefits for those who have the private Medicare \nAdvantage policies. That includes dental, vision, hearing, vision care, \nfitness, and a variety of other programs.\n  We have had a semantic debate in this Chamber between those who say: \nWell, the fundamental benefits of the Medicare law are not specifically \neliminated or reduced in the legislative language of the bill. That is \ntrue. But what is also true is, the additional benefits in Medicare \nAdvantage are being reduced. That is unassailable. It is also true--and \nCMS, for example, refers to this--that enrollment is going to be \nreduced because of these reductions in benefits. They talk about the \nlower benchmarks, and they say when it is fully phased in, enrollment \nin Medicare Advantage plans would decrease by about 33 percent. So this \nis not some kind of fantasy. This is taken from the Congressional \nBudget Office and from the CMS Actuary.\n  Finally, in addition to the Medicare Advantage, the Actuary says \nsimulations by the Office of the Actuary suggest that roughly 20 \npercent of party providers; that is, hospitals, nursing homes, home \nhealth care, would be unprofitable within the 10-year projection period \nas a result of productivity adjustments. That means they would go out \nof business. Obviously, senior care is going to be affected by this \nlegislation, and we believe negatively so. That is an honest debate to \nhave, and it is one which we would like to have.\n\n  But, finally, my colleague turned the world upside down by arguing \nthe only reason we are here the week before Christmas is because of \nRepublican bad behavior; that we ruined the holidays for the \nprofessional staff because we followed the procedures of the Senate \nthat require the reading of the bill.\n  It is true that requirement is usually waived, but then we usually \nhave plenty of time to know what is in a bill. Usually, a bill works \nits way through committee and both parties know what is in it. We both \nhelp to write the bill. It is transparent. It is usually printed long \nbefore it comes to the Senate floor so we know what is in it. The \nreason it was read was so our staff would, in fact, have time to read \nit, to advise us--because we didn't all have time to read it \nourselves--and to advise the public, our constituents, of what is in \nit. Again, we received it yesterday and we are voting on it tonight. \nThat is very little time to know everything that is in there.\n  The more we learn about what is in there, the angrier a lot of people \nget. The special deals for one State, for example, are simply wrong. \nThat is why you take time to see what is in it. The majority of the \npublic, according to opinion polls, want us to take more time to \nunderstand what is in this bill.\n  A final point on this. I have to say, the majority leader dictates \nthe schedule of the Senate. All Senators are pretty much equal, but the \nmajority leader has two things he can do and only he can do. He has the \nright of first recognition, and he has the right to set the schedule. \nBy the schedule, I mean when he files a cloture motion, which is what \nbrings this bill to the floor or this amendment to the floor. When he \nfiles the cloture motion, that is what determines when the vote will \nbe. He determines when to bring the Senate back in session. Under the \nrules, an hour after he brings us back in session, the cloture motion \nripens and we have a vote.\n  He can set that time at any time. He can say tomorrow morning, at 9 \na.m., the Senate will come back in session and we will vote at 10 a.m. \nThe leader could do that. That is his right, and he is the only one who \nhas the right to do that. But instead, he says we will come in at 1 \nminute past midnight tonight. Therefore, the vote will be 1 minute past \n1 a.m. tomorrow morning. It is his right to do that.\n  We didn't do that; he did that. He is the only one who has the right \nto set that schedule. If he wanted to set a schedule that was a little \nmore convenient for all the Members--including our dear friend, the \nSenator from West Virginia, who is ill and indeed does have to get out \nof a bed to come in a wheelchair to this Chamber--the majority leader \nhas it within his power to say we will do it at a more convenient time.\n  Why would he do it in this way? Because he has deliberately decided--\nand all majority leaders have not done quite this but have done similar \nthings--to set a recess and then work us up against the recess so we \nwill have an incentive to finish. It is usually a pretty good \nincentive. Certainly, going home for Christmas is a big incentive. So \nthe majority leader figures, if he can schedule this bill and the \nvarious votes in such a way that we end up voting on it on Christmas \nEve, that maybe then we will hurry up and try to do it because, as one \nDemocratic staffer is quoted as saying: ``We need to hurry up and pass \nthis bill because the longer it hangs around the harder it will be''--\nmeaning to pass it. That is true. The more the public finds out about \nit, the less they like it.\n  So the majority leader is trying to get it done as quickly as he can, \nand ``as quickly as he can'' means scheduling us for a vote 1 hour \nafter we come\n\n[[Page S13590]]\n\nin. Since there has to be an intervening day--and today is the \nintervening day--tonight, at 1 minute after midnight, we will reconvene \nfor the next day and then have the vote at 1 a.m. It is purely the \nmajority leader's decision to do it that way. Republicans have nothing \nto do with it.\n  If I had my way, we would vote at 10 o'clock in the morning. But that \nis not the way it is going to be. So please don't say it is Republican \nbad behavior that results in having to vote on this bill late at night. \nThe process is determined by the majority leader.\n  I guess I am going to conclude by saying I don't believe this bill \ncan be sold on its merits, and I think that is another reason why we \nhave to hurry up and do it--before the public figures out what is in \nit. The public opposes this bill not for the reasons imagined by my \ncolleague but because it will cut Medicare benefits, it will increase \ninsurance premiums--not cause them to go down--it will raise taxes, put \nthe government in charge of too much, it will cost trillions of \ndollars, and it will result in the delay and denial of care. That is \nwhy the majority of Americans want us to start over and address the \nproblems on a step-by-step basis.\n  I was amused by my counterpart, the Democratic whip, saying \nRepublicans have only offered four amendments. I think it was seven but \nsay it is four. Guess who determines how many amendments we get to \noffer? The majority leader. He sets that schedule as well. He says now \nit is our turn to offer an amendment. Then it is your turn. The way he \nmanaged the schedule, we only got to file either four or seven \namendments. We have 200 amendments pending. We would love to get as \nmany of these pending and voted on as possible. Believe me, it is not \nRepublicans who don't want to vote on our amendments. The majority \nleader, again, has set the schedule.\n  This is why we oppose the bill. It is why we don't like the process. \nWe respect what our constituents are telling us. We believe this bill \nwill be bad for them, and it will be bad for our country. Our \nDemocratic colleagues have a different position. Neither their position \nnor ours is malignant, nor should they be expressed vindictively.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have all been waiting for many weeks \nwhile the Democratic leadership worked behind closed doors, out of \npublic view, to write this new health care reform bill, and this \nprocess, of course, is very much contrary to what the President \npromised during the campaign--that negotiations on the health care \nreform bill would even be on C-SPAN so everybody in the country could \nsee it. So now a very secretly put together bill is out for our \nconsideration with just a few days to consider it.\n  Last week, they were considering expanding Medicare to people between \n55 and 64 years of age--also, increasing Medicare to cover people up to \n150 percent of poverty--and thirdly, having a government-run plan run \nby the Office of Personnel Management.\n  Now we have something entirely different. We have the Reid amendment, \nand it is chock full of special deals. It does nothing to fix the fatal \nflaws in the 2,074-page bill we started with, and now we have a bill \nthat is probably 400 pages longer than 2,074 pages.\n  What kind of changes does this new amendment make to the original \nReid amendment? Well, one tax disappears--it was a tax on cosmetic \nsurgery--and in its place we have a new tax, a tax on tanning bed \nservices. The dial on the Medicare payroll tax is turned up. So the \nfirst-time marriage penalty in a Medicare tax--one that hits about half \nthe two-earner couples--is enhanced. Well over 1 million couples get to \nlook forward to that tax hit--can you believe it?--just for being \nmarried. So the old marriage penalty is back. The dial on the insurance \nfee is also turned up in the back end of the bill.\n  But with respect to a few favored insurance companies, the fee is \nturned off. The very limited small business tax credit is expanded--\nover $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes, according to the official \ncongressional scorekeepers. What kind of tax changes stay the same? \nBasically, the managers' amendment in the underlying Reid amendment \nstill imposes new taxes--new taxes on everything from tanning beds to \ninsurance companies to wages to heart valves to drugs and even more.\n  Contrary to what has been said on the Senate floor this very day, the \ntax burden still rests on many middle-class folks. As has been said, \nthere is a sizable subsidy that 12 million tax-filing families and \nindividuals receive. We do not dispute that. But what the other side \ndoes not want to acknowledge is this: There are 42 million tax-filing, \nmiddle-class families and individuals who will pay higher taxes under \nthis 2,000-plus page bill. For every middle-class, tax-filing family \nwho receives an insurance subsidy, three middle-class families will pay \nhigher taxes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a \ncorrected version of an article from Congressional Daily, dated \nDecember 18, of this year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From CongressDaily AM, Dec. 18, 2009]\n\n         Labor Cites JCT Analysis To Argue Against Cadillac Tax\n\n                            (By Peter Cohn)\n\n       Labor officials Thursday unveiled new ammunition in their \n     fight against a proposal to tax high-cost health insurance \n     plans in the Senate health bill, citing a congressional \n     analysis that found more than 22 million households earning \n     less than $200,000 would see a tax increase by 2019.\n       That figure could rise a bit as the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation did not distribute information on tax returns for \n     married couples earning up to $250,000, which is the \n     threshold set by President Obama when he pledged not to tax \n     the middle class. The tax issue could be the most intractable \n     difference between Senate and House-passed legislation--which \n     instead relies on a millionaires' surtax--as Democratic \n     leaders struggle to cobble together a bill that can pass in \n     both chambers next year. Communications Workers of America \n     President Larry Cohen, whose group released the JCT figures, \n     said they demonstrate ``irrefutably that the excise tax--\n     which will result in reduced coverage and increased costs for \n     our middle class families--is the opposite of reform.''\n       Most House Democrats and union officials are adamant that \n     the final version does not break Obama's pledge and tax those \n     households earning less than $250,000. Obama at one point \n     appeared to endorse the House bill's surtax, which is the \n     single-biggest revenue source in either bill at $460.5 \n     billion. There are major problems with that tax in the \n     Senate, however, not least because it is not indexed for \n     inflation. It also could affect about one-third of all income \n     earned by small business owners that file individual tax \n     returns, according to JCT.\n       ``This is going to be a major problem, no question about \n     it,'' said a senior Democratic aide. ``The White House is \n     going to have to weigh in and provide some direction.''\n       There have been some mixed signals. The president in a July \n     press conference said the House surtax ``meets my principle'' \n     of not burdening ``families who are already having a tough \n     time.'' In a speech to Congress after Labor Day, however, \n     Obama endorsed the Senate excise tax as a ``modest change \n     that could help hold down the cost of health care for all of \n     us in the long run.''\n       The 40 percent excise tax in the Senate bill would affect \n     employer-sponsored coverage worth more than $8,500 for single \n     workers and $23,000 for family plans beginning in 2013. Those \n     figures would rise with inflation, plus 1 percent each year, \n     with higher beginning thresholds for older workers and those \n     in high-risk professions. Certain high-cost states would be \n     granted additional room before the tax kicks in.\n       In a White House blog post Wednesday, National Economic \n     Council Deputy Director Jason Furman said the Senate bill \n     would not hike taxes on the middle class and actually would \n     provide a net tax cut.\n       He noted JCT estimates that only 3 percent of health \n     premiums would be affected in 2013, a figure that rises to 8 \n     percent by 2019, as well as the higher wages that would \n     accompany a decrease in costly health benefits.\n       One school of thought holds that whatever bill is able to \n     muster 60 Senate votes will form the basis for the final \n     legislation, and House Speaker Pelosi will have to deliver \n     the votes in her chamber. Another says 188 House Democrats \n     that oppose the Senate tax--a broad cross-section led by \n     second-term Rep. Joe Courtney of Connecticut, who requested \n     the new JCT data, and Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan--won't \n     allow the House to be steamrolled.\n       ``How did they get into this mess?'' one labor official \n     asked. ``They've set this thing up terribly, and they have a \n     huge problem in their Caucus.''\n       The senior Democratic aide said another Senate provision, \n     an increase in the Medicare payroll tax for those earning \n     above the $200,000 and $250,000 thresholds, could meet the \n     House test. Another idea, promoted by Sen. Debbie Stabenow, \n     D-Mich., would apply the Medicare tax to unearned income such \n     as capital gains and dividends and also has some cache in the \n     House.\n       But those proposals also have the disadvantage of being \n     prime revenue sources to\n\n[[Page S13591]]\n\n     help shore up Medicare's finances over the long haul, which \n     could be negated if used up to help expand healthcare \n     benefits to younger workers.\n       House moderates at one point considered a plan authored by \n     the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way to tax ``excess \n     medical inflation,'' or healthcare premiums that are rising \n     much faster than overall economic growth. Sen. Thomas Carper, \n     D-Del., an honorary Third Way co-chairman, has pitched the \n     idea in his chamber as well. He continues to argue it could \n     be a fallback position; other sources on and off Capitol Hill \n     suggested the train has already left the station and it was \n     too late to inject a new and untested idea into the mix.\n       What is striking is the amount of agreement between unions \n     and Republicans on the Senate's excise tax, however. \n     Republicans, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have long \n     held that taxing employer-provided health coverage is the \n     best way to keep costs down and raise revenues. But in \n     opposing the overall health bill, they have latched on to the \n     fact that the excise tax and other taxes in the bill would \n     hit those middle-class workers Obama wants to protect.\n       According to JCT data analyzed by Senate Finance Committee \n     Republicans, the number of households earning less than \n     $200,000 that would be hit with a tax increase number closer \n     to 42 million in 2019, or about 25 percent of all tax filers \n     under that threshold.\n       They looked not only at the excise tax but also a scaled-\n     back itemized deduction for medical expenses for those with \n     costs not covered by insurance, and those affected by the \n     Medicare tax that have losses bringing their income under the \n     thresholds.\n       The numbers factor in those who receive premium tax credits \n     and subsidies to offset the cost of buying health coverage in \n     the bill. Most of those hit with net tax increases earn \n     between $50,000 and $200,000 annually. Of those households \n     earning under $75,000, roughly 12 million would come out \n     ahead, JCT found, including many who earn too little to pay \n     taxes.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This new compromise does not fix any of the core \nproblems in this original 2,074-page Reid bill. It is still that long \nof a bill. It is still a $2.5 trillion massive bill as far as costs are \nconcerned. The Reid amendment actually adds 400 more pages.\n  These closed-door negotiations did not produce a better product. \nQuite the opposite. It still taxes middle-class families, seniors, and \nveterans. Millions of people still will not be able to keep what they \nhave, as the President promised in the last campaign. A lot of people \nwho were hoping to pay less as a result of the word ``reform'' will \nstill end up paying more.\n  I am not just talking about the young and the healthy. It still \nimposes higher premiums for prescription drug coverage on seniors and \nthe disabled. It still permanently cuts all annual Medicare provider \npayment updates based on productivity gains outside of health care. \nThese cuts still go into effect, even if it means providers will get a \nnegative payment update, and these permanent cuts still threaten \nMedicare access to care.\n  The bill still cuts $120 billion from Medicare Advantage, cuts that \nwill reduce Medicare benefits for 11 million beneficiaries, contrary to \nwhat the President told us in his speech in September--that nobody is \ngoing to get cut in Medicare. This bill still creates a new body of \nunelected officials with broad authority to make further cuts in \nMedicare beyond the $40-some billion that are in this bill.\n  This bill still unwisely makes the board permanent. This bill still \nrequires this board to continue making even more cuts in Medicare and \nto do that forever into the future.\n  The damage this group of unelected people could do to Medicare is \nunknown, but we certainly do know how impossible it will be to undo any \ndamage that unelected board does, if Congress decides we ought to undo \nit. That is because whatever cuts they make we have to offset, and \nstirring up that money is very difficult for offsets.\n  This bill passes a $26 billion unfunded mandate on to the States \nbecause the Reid amendment even made this problem worse by adding $1 \nbillion to that unfunded mandate for States under Medicaid. These \nincreased costs will cause States to raise taxes, maybe cut education, \nmaybe cut transportation, and maybe cut law enforcement. But it is \nstill money the States have to dig up.\n  This bill still has the CLASS Act in it, even though the \nadministration's own Health and Human Services Chief Actuary says it \nruns the risk--a great risk--of being unsustainable.\n  It still has a special carve-out for committee and leadership staff \nfrom having to use the health insurance exchanges. This is a cute move \non the part of somebody in these closed-door offices. I got an \namendment through the Senate Finance Committee on a unanimous basis \nthat, if the people of this country have to use the exchange, employees \nand Congressmen on Capitol Hill ought to use it. But, no; when you get \nto the secrecy behind doors, just the Congressmen and their permanent \nstaffs but not the thousands of people who serve on leadership staff or \ncommittee staff, they still got the deal they have today. So they are \nnot going to know what the American people are going through by using \nthe exchange.\n  This bill still has special deals for brand-name drug makers that \nwill reduce access to generic drugs, making drug costs even higher for \neveryone. What this process has shown is that there is a clear and \nsignificant philosophical difference between this side of the aisle \nversus that side of the aisle. Those differences are still there, and \nthe lines between us on this specific piece of legislation become \nbrighter still, even though maybe on 90 percent of the legislation \ngoing before this body, there is bipartisan cooperation. But on this \none, restructuring one-sixth of the economy, health care being a life-\nor-death issue for 306 million Americans, this is different from \nanything this body has tried before. On something such as this, maybe \nthere is a legitimate reason for having differences.\n  Republicans tried to reduce the overall cost. They said no. They \nincreased the spending in the bill. Republicans tried to reduce the \npervasive role of government. They said no, and they increased the role \nof government. Republicans tried to make it harder for illegal \nimmigrants to get benefits. They said no, and that still has not been \nfixed. Republicans tried to guarantee that Federal funding for \nabortions would not be allowed under this bill. That has been the \nFederal policy since 1976. That has even had bipartisan support ever \nsince the Hyde amendment was put in place that year. But they said no. \nThey wouldn't agree to apply that policy. That still has not been \nfixed. Republicans tried to allow alternatives to the individual \nmandate and the harsh penalties associated with it. They said no. They \nhave subjected even more people to the mandate, and they have raised \npenalties. Republicans tried to raise medical malpractice reform. They \nsaid no. Real lawsuit reform is still not in this bill.\n  We have watched while the other side has expanded government \ncoverage. Since this process began, the other side has been working \nhard to move millions of people from private coverage to government-\nsubsidized coverage. The bill creates new government programs that \ncover families making close to $100,000 a year. When we hear about that \nin rural America, in the Midwest part of the United States, they think \nwe have gone bananas in this body by subsidizing families making \n$100,000.\n  At the end of the day, after raising billions in new taxes, cutting \nabout $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare, imposing stiff new penalties for \npeople who don't buy insurance and increasing costs for those who do, \nstill 23 million people will not have health insurance. I don't think \nthis is what the American people had in mind when we promised to fix \nhealth care.\n  The Reid bill imposes a $2.5 trillion tab on Americans. It kills jobs \nwith taxes and fees that go into effect 4 years before the benefits of \nthe bill take hold. It kills jobs with that employer mandate. It \nimposes $\\1/2\\ trillion in higher taxes on premiums, on medical \ndevices, on prescription drugs, and yet more. It jeopardizes access to \ncare with massive Medicare cuts. It imposes higher costs. It raises \npremiums. It bends the cost curve in the wrong way because people would \nexpect you to bend inflation down, but this bill takes it up. This is \nnot what people have in mind when they think about health care reform.\n  We have been hearing repeatedly from the majority whip from Illinois \nthat the Republican side has offered only four amendments. I found this \nto be rather astonishing. The majority whip should know, because they \nare filed at the desk, that Republicans have put forth 214 amendments. \nIn addition to striking some of the bad ideas in the Reid bill, these \namendments also contain Republican proposals that are\n\n[[Page S13592]]\n\nimprovements over the Reid bill. But in this rush to get it done, the \nmajority has decided they don't want to consider any more of the 440 \namendments filed at the desk.\n  Let's be clear. We keep them so people can have access to them \nanytime they want to, the 440 amendments that have been filed, that we \nare accused of not offering any suggestions or improvements. Right here \nin these three binders, any one of the amendments you want, it is \nthere.\n  Since this happens to be the case, I would like to take them up on \ntheir interest in considering additional amendments. The majority \nleader and my friend, the Senator from Montana, have both said they \nwant this bill to fill the doughnut hole in the Medicare Part D \nProgram. I share my colleagues' desire to provide even more protection \nthan seniors get under Medicare. I filed an amendment that is in this \nbinder, amendment No. 3182, that would use the savings from medical \nliability reform, which happens to be about the second or third thing \nthat always comes up at my town meetings that the people in this \ncountry feel we ought to be working on if we are going to make real the \nword ``reform.'' It would put that $50 billion into savings toward \neliminating the doughnut hole. The amendment puts the needs of 27 \nmillion seniors ahead of the needs of trial lawyers. I can't speak for \nmy colleagues, but that seems like a pretty easy decision.\n  To my good friend from Montana, I only have one unanimous consent \nrequest. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment in \norder to offer amendment No. 3182, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \ndoughnut hole will be filled. I have made that promise. Senator Reid \nhas made that promise. The White House made that promise. When the bill \nis presented on the President's desk, the doughnut hole will be filled \nbut not in the way suggested by my friend from Iowa. He is one of my \nbest friends in the Senate, and it is with regret that I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I find it disappointing that we would miss the \nopportunity to forgo $50 billion in savings that could make \nprescription drugs more affordable for 27 million seniors. Even though \nmy friend has just said they are filling the doughnut hole, I would \nquickly say it is being filled in a way that the big pharmaceutical \ncompanies are going to make sure they are selling prescription drugs, \nprescribed drugs, for a long period of time and not have the savings \nthat ought to come from using generics to a greater extent. This $50 \nbillion--actually $54 billion--that CBO says we would save with medical \nmalpractice reform would be a better way of filling that doughnut hole.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to make a parliamentary inquiry about the \npending managers' amendment. My inquiry will be whether the pending \namendment, which everyone agrees is critical to the health care reform \nlegislation before us, complies with Senate rule XLIV.\n  Senate rule XLIV was adopted as part of major ethics and government \nreform legislation. It was passed in 2007. Its title was the ``Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act.'' The Democratic leadership made it \nthe first bill introduced when they took over the majority in 2007. It \nenjoyed broad bipartisan support. I wish the reform had been tougher. \nThe part of the legislation that became Senate rule XLIV dealt with the \ntransparency of earmarks. They are technically defined as ``limited tax \nbenefits'' and ``congressionally directed spending items.''\n  Rule XLIV applies to floor amendments such as the pending managers' \namendment. Rule XLIV requires the sponsor of the amendment--in this \ncase, Senator Reid--to provide a list of these narrow provisions. \nSenator Reid has not provided the list. We received the several-\nhundred-page amendment yesterday morning. Republican staff have \nperformed a preliminary review. That review finds that some items \nmight--I repeat, might--be limited tax benefits. There are press \nreports about narrowly crafted exceptions to the insurance fee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nDow Jones article dated December 19, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From Dow Jones Newswires]\n\n  Senator Nelson Wins Tax Carve-Out for Mutual of Omaha in Health Bill\n\n                          (By Martin Vaughan)\n\n       Washington (Dow Jones)--Insurance giant Mutual of Omaha \n     will see less of a hit from a $10 billion-a-year industry-\n     wide tax on health insurance providers, under the terms of a \n     deal worked out between Senate Democratic leaders and Sen. \n     Ben Nelson (D., Neb.).\n       Under revised Senate health legislation unveiled Saturday \n     by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.), the tax on \n     insurers will begin in 2011 at $2 billion a year, eventually \n     rising to $10 billion annually. The tax is to be divided up \n     based on each company's market share.\n       Senate aides who reviewed the legislation said provisions \n     in the revised bill are specifically crafted to protect \n     Nebraska insurers, including Mutual of Omaha.\n       The tax carve-out appears to be one of several concessions \n     Nelson won from Democratic leaders before agreeing to add his \n     vote, the final one needed to secure passage in the Senate, \n     to the healthcare measure.\n       ``The biggest issue for us was abortion,'' said Jake \n     Thompson, a Nelson spokesman. ``But Sen. Nelson also wanted \n     to ensure that Nebraskans won't face increased premiums as a \n     result of a fee that was going to be imposed.''\n       Nelson inserted a provision that will carve out \n     supplemental Medicare insurance from that tax. That provision \n     will benefit Mutual of Omaha, but also other insurers that \n     offer so-called Medigap policies, Thompson said.\n       Nelson also won support for a provision ensuring that \n     Nebraska won't have to foot any costs for new Medicaid \n     enrollees. That is important because the Senate bill expands \n     Medicaid eligibility, potentially increasing costs for many \n     states under a cost-sharing system with the federal \n     government.\n       Most other states will be required to pick up between 5% \n     and 18% of coverage costs for new Medicaid enrollees, with \n     the federal government picking up the remainder.\n       The revised bill introduced by Reid also carves out non-\n     profit insurers that meet certain criteria, especially in \n     Nebraska and Michigan, from the new industry-wide tax.\n       ``Several states had unique circumstances, and [Reid] \n     thought it was appropriate to provide a narrow exemption from \n     the fee for a couple of states that had unique \n     circumstances,'' a Senate Democratic aide said in a \n     conference call with reporters.\n       ``Nebraska also had circumstances that necessitated the \n     relief,'' the aide said, without elaborating.\n       ``This legislation is good for our country and good for \n     Nebraska,'' Nelson said in announcing his support for the \n     healthcare bill Saturday.\n       One provision in the bill is narrowly tailored to apply to \n     Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Nebraska, Nelson's spokesman said. \n     It says that a company that is a mutual insurance company and \n     had a market share in a state of between 40% and 60% in 2008 \n     would be exempt from the tax.\n       Senate transparency rules enacted after Democrats took over \n     the chamber in 2006 discourage narrowly crafted tax breaks, \n     also called tax earmarks. Senators are required when offering \n     amendments that include such provisions to publish a list in \n     the Congressional Record, and the amendments could be subject \n     to procedural objections.\n       The Senate GOP aide said that carving one insurance \n     provider out of the tax could put it at a distinct advantage \n     with respect to competitors. The Joint Tax Committee has \n     estimated that the tax could result in increased premiums to \n     consumers of between 1% and 1.5%.\n       ``If one company is protected from that fee, you're talking \n     about a significant pricing differential,'' the aide said.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Likewise, single State Medicaid provisions might be \ndetermined to be congressionally directed spending items. Under rule \nXLIV, the determinations are not made by the minority staff.\n  In order to ensure transparency of narrow provisions, the burden is \non the sponsor to provide the list.\n  This is my parliamentary inquiry: Does rule XLIV of the Standing \nRules of the Senate require that if a Senator proposes an amendment \ncontaining congressionally directed spending or a limited tax benefit, \nthat the sponsor of those provisions and the names of the Senators \nrequesting them be printed in the Record?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Paragraph 4(a) of rule XLIV requires that a \nSenator proposing an amendment containing a congressionally directed \nspending item ensure as soon as practicable that a list of such items \nbe printed in the Congressional Record.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Has the majority leader provided a list of these \nspecial\n\n[[Page S13593]]\n\ndeals and of the Members requesting them for the Record as required by \nthe Senate rules?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is not aware of whether that has \noccurred at this time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So what is the situation as far as the rule being \nprovided, as long as the Senate has not been made aware of this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This part of rule XLIV simply requires that \nthe Senator mentioned make a good-faith effort to comply with paragraph \n4(a). It does not impose a condition that would precede the amendment, \nthat it could not be heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, a lot of attention has been paid to the \nposition of the senior Senator from Nebraska on this legislation. Page \n98 of the amendment provides that the State of Nebraska is carved out \nfrom being responsible for paying for additional Medicaid patients \nadded under the bill. It is the only State explicitly carved out from \nthis requirement.\n  I address this as well to the chairman of the committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nit be in order to offer an amendment to extend to all States the same \nbenefit that provides 100 percent Federal funding to the State of \nNebraska for their expanded Medicaid Program. This would give the same \ntreatment to other States that currently only Nebraska would enjoy \nunder this bill. If the bill is a good thing for all States, then it \nseems to me it should be applied equally to all States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, since that was the broader context of that \nintent and there are other States that are hurting as well, I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside in order to \noffer an amendment to the extent that Colorado and Montana and Virginia \nwould get the same benefit that provides 100 percent Federal funding to \nthe State of Nebraska forever for their expanded Medicaid Program, \nwhich would give the same treatment to these other States that I have \nmentioned that currently only Nebraska would enjoy under the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as enticing \nas that might sound, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, following up on that, I happened to see \nGovernor Schwarzenegger on television today. He said he had initially \nbeen inclined to support this legislation until he realized what it \nwould do to his Medicaid budget in California--it would cost them $3 \nbillion and they do not have that $3 billion. Indeed, they didn't have \nthe money necessary to meet their current obligations under Medicare.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside and it be in order to offer an amendment to extend to the State \nof California the same benefit that provides 100 percent Federal \nfunding to the State of Nebraska for their expanded Medicaid Program. \nThis would give the same treatment to California as Nebraska would \nobtain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think I would be remiss if I did not \nask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside and that these \nprovisions be extended to my State of Alabama which is also in a \nserious condition financially and whose Governor has expressed \nunequivocal opposition to the burdens on the State Medicaid Program \nthat passing this legislation would impose. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the same benefit that provides 100 percent Federal funding to the \nState of Nebraska for their expanded Medicaid Program apply to the \nState of Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, why are we here voting tonight at 1 a.m. \nand probably voting all the way to Christmas Eve? I think the answer \nfundamentally is on the health care matter, that after much talk about \na bipartisan health reform effort and some work toward that end, the \nPresident and the Democratic leadership in the Congress decided they \nhad the majorities in the House and the Senate and that they would use \nthose majorities to pass the legislation that they wanted without \nRepublican input. I know that has happened on occasion around this \nSenate, but I don't believe it has ever happened on a matter of such \nsignificance.\n  These major kinds of policy matters have historically been bipartisan \nor had substantial bipartisan support. We are talking about health \ncare, involving every American. We are talking about raiding, not \nstrengthening, Medicare, a program that is already in deep trouble. We \nare talking about a major governmental intervention into one-sixth of \nthe American economy. These are pretty big issues.\n  Even more significantly, our Democratic colleagues are concerned \nabout the American people, who, by consistent majorities, reject this \nplan. They are fearful of them. So they want to move this bill forward \nnow, sooner, faster, quicker, with less discussion and less debate. \nInstead of working together to improve a broken health care system, the \ndecision has been reached to railroad this bill through before \nChristmas.\n  They say the President promised reform. He was elected and so they \nwill just ram it through no matter what the American people, for that \nmatter, think.\n  Just for example, a recent CNN poll--I do not think that is a \nrightwing entity--61 percent oppose the Senate bill, only 36 percent \nsupport it. Just a little more than one-third support and over 60 \npercent oppose. Those are lower numbers than President Bush received \nfor his plan to reform Social Security.\n  So, why do they do this? Well, because they think they know better \nthan you do, because they want to make history. And if you object--as \nthe Senator from Rhode Island said this morning--you and the rabble \ndisagree with us, why, you are mean-spirited, coldhearted, and \nfearful--as to whatever those words were--you are just like those great \nunwashed whom you represent. So I think there is an unusual amount of \ndisdain here for any political and substantive disagreement about this \nincredibly important legislation and I think a disdain for the concerns \nof the American people, as represented in rallies, in tea parties, and \nin polling data.\n  Is this all just illogical fear? Are these people totally \nirresponsible to worry about the future financial condition of their \nchildren?\n  A colleague of mine showed me this great cartoon that showed a man \nstanding beside Santa Claus, and Santa said: What would you like? I \nthink the man was President Obama. And he said: Health care. And there \nwas also a little boy, sitting on Santa's lap, and he said: What do I \nget? And Santa said: You get the bill.\n  Well, the people know this is a significant issue for the future \ndirection of our country, and I think they are saying that this what \nnot what they intended during the last campaign. I remember this \ndefining moment--do you not?--when Joe the plumber accosted President \nObama, and they discussed redistributing the wealth around. And what an \neffort there was to suggest that President Obama did not really believe \nin that idea, but that he believed in freedom and individual \nresponsibility and was not going to tax the average person, and those \nkinds of things. So the campaign survived that little dust-up.\n  But I think the American people are saying: Fool me once--during the \ncampaign--shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. They are not happy \nwith this bill. Polls show the tea parties are more popular than the \nRepublican or Democratic Parties. So I think this use\n\n[[Page S13594]]\n\nof raw power--the idea that we must get this bill done before \nChristmas, and we will pay any price necessary to get the votes to do \nit--is not good.\n  I am amazed that people would criticize those of us who do not agree \nwith this legislation--and I am prepared to talk at some length about \nthe substantive reasons about it--that we are somehow obstructionist \nbecause we would like to have more than 1 day, really, to consider a \n383-page amendment and see what all was placed in it.\n  So my colleagues have been saying the people are misinformed and they \nhave been subjected to lies and misinformation. Well, just a few days \nago, I heard the President declare that if you do not pass this \nlegislation, your insurance premiums are going to go up, which is not \nuntrue. But what he did not convey--and I think most people understand \nalready, however--is that even if the bill passes, premiums will go up \nsome, double digits more than they would have gone up if the bill had \nnot passed. A few people will see a modest--less than 1 percent, maybe \nsome over 1 percent--reduction in the rate of increase in their \ninsurance premium, but a lot of people are going to see double-digit \nincreases in their premium, particularly the people who are not in \ngroup plans. Those are the ones for whom insurance premiums are the \nmost unfair and who are getting rooked the most by insurance. We ought \nto be taking care of this problem because they are not in group plans \nand they are not in companies that subsidize it. They do not work for \nthe government that subsidizes their health care.\n  But the President has the bully pulpit. He lectured the whole \nCongress. He hauled us out and talked about it in a joint address to \nCongress. He got $150 million from the big PhRMA drug companies to \nadvertise in support of this bill, as it has been reported. Robert \nReich, a great liberal, Secretary of Labor under President Clinton, \nscathingly condemned that deal that PhRMA made with the White House \nover the doughnut hole and their contribution for advertising.\n  I will just have to say, the majority has found no price too high, no \ndepth too low in order to get that 60th vote so they can go forward. \nAnd we have got to get it done now, pass this managers' amendment that \nthe majority leader has plopped down--the one that was written in \nsecret and we just saw yesterday morning at about 10 o'clock.\n  Well, I will just say, how should we judge the overall merits of the \nbill? How should we decide whether to vote for it or against it? I \nwould say that one good way is to judge it by its own promises, to \njudge it by what the American people have been told the bill will do, \nhow much it will cost, and those kinds of things.\n  Well, there are some facts and some fictions here. We just need to be \nfrank about it.\n  Fiction No. 1: We have been told that the total cost of the \nlegislation is $871 billion. That is a lot of money, $871 billion. But \nwhat are the facts? When the new programs created by this bill are \nfully implemented, the bill will actually cost, over the first 10 years \nof full implementation, $2.5 trillion--three times as much.\n  Now, who is giving the best numbers here? Since we know most of the \nbenefits do not start until 5 years from now, they score the first 10 \nyears of the budget, the cost of the bill, and say it costs $871 \nbillion. But if you take it from the first 10 years of the bill, as we \nwould normally score a piece of legislation, it is $2.5 trillion--\n$2,500 billion. That is a stunning difference. It just shows what a \nmassive piece of legislation this bill is.\n  According to the bill, Medicaid will be expanded up to 133 percent of \nthe poverty level, but that will not happen until 2014. The insurance \nsubsidies funded by the bill do not begin until 2014. So this is how \nthey manipulated the numbers. So they say $871 billion. Not so. In \nfact, the managers' amendment increases Federal spending on health care \nto $200 billion rather than $160 billion projected under the original \nbill that came forward.\n  So we currently spend one-sixth of our GDP on health care. How much \nmore can we afford to pay? And wasn't the original intent to rein in \nhealth care spending, to reduce the percentage of GDP going to health \ncare?\n  Mr. President, how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The business community as well as many others are \nexpressing concern about the fact that this bill would not actually \nrein in health care spending. I thought the goal and I think most \nAmericans thought the goal of the legislation was to figure ways to \ncontain the growing cost of health care in America without reducing our \nquality and the magnificent care so many Americans receive. But it does \nnot do that. In fact, the numbers show, independent accounts show that \nthe percentage of our national wealth, our GDP, that will go to health \ncare once this bill is passed--if it is--will be greater than if it is \nnot passed. We should wrestle with those issues and do better.\n  What about another fiction? The President had promised--you have \nheard him--along with other leaders on this floor: This bill will not \nadd one dime to the Nation's surging debt. But by any fair analysis, \nthe bill increases both spending and debt.\n  First, I just have to say, when you pass 70 new government programs, \nexpand Medicaid, and create millions of dollars in new subsidies, how \ncan that not increase spending? But the bill is structured in a way so \nthat its spending is covered by its new $519 billion in taxes. Well, if \nyou raise taxes enough, you can make anything come out to a balance. \nThey call some of these taxes fees, but they are still taxes and \nincreased cost in the system. They include a $6 billion annual tax on \nthe insurance industry as a whole. For the people we want to reduce \npremiums, we raise taxes on them $6 billion. It includes a $2.3 billion \nannual tax on the pharmaceutical industry. We would like to see less \ncost for drugs, not more. It includes taxes on medical device \ncompanies, $28 billion on employers that do not provide enough coverage \naccording to the new standards and a 40-percent tax on plans that \nprovide too much coverage, and $43 billion in total taxes raised \nthrough penalties on employers and individual mandates. All in all, you \nare taxed if you sell insurance, taxed if you buy it at the wrong \nlevel, and taxed if you do not buy it at all. Yet, contrary to \npromises, the bill does not lower individual family premiums, and for \nmany, their out-of-pocket costs will increase. So this is not the kind \nof reform we were promised.\n\n  But one more thing. Always a part of health care reform was the \nacknowledged necessity to do something about the reductions in \npayments, reimbursements to doctors. This bill proposes cutting \nphysicians' pay 21 percent. That is what it does--they ignore a $250 \nbillion cost, and act as though they can use that money for the bill's \nnew programs. But doctors were promised from the beginning that their \npayment reimbursements would be fixed. They cannot sustain a 21-percent \nreduction in pay. Doctors will quit doing Medicare work all over the \ncountry if that occurs.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. So let me ask the Senator, from what I understand about \nthe so-called doctors fix, there is around a $250 billion cost to that. \nIn this bill, there is no fix to that, from what I understand. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. So the bill is either dishonest as far as the deficit is \nconcerned because if you put the doctors fix in there, this thing \nactually hurts the deficit, or we are actually seriously hurting \ndoctors because this bill will require a lot more doctors in the \ncountry to take care of those new people who will now have health \ninsurance in the country. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Exactly correct. What we are doing, I think you can say \nfairly--boil it down to this--we are raising taxes over $500 billion, \nwe are cutting Medicare nearly $500 billion--so, around $1 trillion \ntotal. And we are using none of that money to fix the doctor payment \ndeficit we know has to be fixed. Instead that money is going to new \nprograms. We cannot cut the doctors 21 percent. Congress has filled \nthat money in every year for nearly 10 years now, and we have to fill \nit in in the future. Any good health care reform would do what it \npromised to do from the beginning, which was to eliminate this cut.\n\n[[Page S13595]]\n\n  One proposal has been to do it simply by adding, throwing it to the \ndebt.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. So would the Senator describe this almost as a shell \ngame?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The doctors fix would be the pea. Where are they hiding \nthe pea? Because we know this is going to be fixed. It is always fixed. \nEvery year, we fix the doctors' pay. And yet, to hide the true costs of \nthe bill, then, the doctors' fix is really the pea in that little shell \ngame and they are just hiding it. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Exactly. The President looked the American people in \nthe eye and he said: This legislation will not add one dime to the \nnational debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This block of the minority's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if I could ask for 30 seconds to finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time did he ask for, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So the President promised to end the doctors coming to \nWashington every year to try to make sure they don't get cut 21 \npercent, but he has not done it. This bill's promises simply do not add \nup. This bill, when you assume the doctor fix, clearly adds to the \ndebt. It must be added as part of the reform. There are a number of \nreasons to oppose the legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand now the Democratic side has 1 hour, from \n6:30 to 7:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself the time from 6:30 to 7.\n  Mr. President, I was in my office a little bit ago, and I was \nwatching the comments made by the distinguished minority whip, the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl. He went on at some length about how this \nvote at 1 a.m. we are going to be taking is tough on some Members. He \nmentioned specifically our distinguished colleague, Senator Robert \nByrd, who is not up and about at those hours, and they would have to \ndrag him out of bed and bring him down here for this vote. Senator Kyl \nfelt very sorry for Senator Byrd that we would do that at 1 a.m.\n  He said the majority leader has the power to put this vote back. We \ncould do it at 9 a.m. in the morning. Well, he is absolutely right; we \ncould do it at 9 a.m. in the morning. But because of the intransigence \nof the Republican side, because they are not willing to let us have \nthese votes without expending the 30 hours under the rules--under the \nrules--the cloture motions have been filed and, of course, the \nRepublicans, which is their right, can burn up 30 hours.\n  Well, after the first vote at 1 a.m., the clock starts ticking on the \nnext 30 hours for the underlying substitute. And then after that 30 \nhours, there is the underlying bill itself, and that gets 30 hours. So \nif the Republicans really want, they can burn up 90 hours. I ask, to \nwhat end? To what end? We have the 60 votes. No one doubts that. There \nare 60 votes now to pass this bill. So to drag this out and to cause \npeople to come in at 1 a.m. in the morning is not on the Democratic \nside, it is on the Republican side.\n  So when I heard the distinguished Senator from Arizona pleading to \nput the vote off, I thought to myself: Well, if that is what the \nRepublicans would like to do, there is a simple way to do that. You \nsimply move the vote we are going to have at 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. tomorrow \nmorning, and then you have the intervening hours from 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. \ncount toward the 30 hours for the next vote. It is simple, very simple.\n  So I took that to heart, and I asked our staff to type up a unanimous \nconsent request, and we have given a copy to the other side. So that is \nwhat my unanimous consent will do. It will ask that the vote occur at 9 \na.m. tomorrow morning, but that the intervening hours from 1 to 9 would \ncount toward the 30 hours for the underlying substitute.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote \nscheduled to occur at 1 a.m. Monday, December 21, occur at 9 a.m. \nMonday, December 21; and that if cloture is invoked, the postcloture \ntime be considered to have begun at 1 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we are not \nthe party that spent 8 weeks putting this together to delay everything. \nWe are not the party that spent all the time putting this amendment \ntogether that we are trying to do without any input from the \nRepublicans. We are trying to have time to both review this and let \nAmerica know what is happening. We know the Democrats have kept people \nfrom going home now for 3 weeks so they wouldn't have to listen to the \nvoters at home who are really upset with this bill.\n  So we would agree to the request to set the vote at 9 a.m. if the \nSenator will modify and strike the retroactive cloture time. We want \nthe time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My initial request stands, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So, Mr. President, here we go again. There they go again. \nYou know, they want to delay, delay, delay, delay; obfuscate, \nobfuscate, obfuscate, and try to kill this bill by delaying it ad \ninfinitum. They would be happy to delay this through Christmas, through \nthe New Year, and January and February. Why? They would be happy to \ndelay this bill for 10 years or more because they don't want it to \nhappen. That is really what is going on.\n  I say to my good friend from Wyoming--and he is my good friend; he is \na great Senator--I thought--we did--in our committee, we got the bill \nthrough open and aboveboard. I think the reason we are here at this \ntime is because we Democrats bent over backwards to accommodate the \nminority. We did in our committee, and I can say that Senator Baucus \nwent the extra mile--no, he went the extra 10 miles. He went the extra \n100 miles on the Finance Committee to involve and to get the minority \nside involved. In the end, only one Republican would vote for it, and \nwe know who that was, the Senator from Maine.\n  We could have emulated the Republicans. We could have emulated what \nthey did when they were in the majority in 2001. I was here. I remember \nit well. When they came up with this crazy tax package that cut taxes \nfor the wealthiest in our country, stole the surplus we had built up \nunder President Clinton by the year 2000 where we were looking at \nsurpluses on into the future, and they came up with all of these big \ntax cuts for the wealthy, guess what they did. They didn't involve us \nat all. They did reconciliation where they only needed 51 votes. Under \nreconciliation, under the rules of the Senate, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, there is no filibuster. You cannot filibuster a reconciliation \nbill under the rules.\n  So if they had done their tax bill in 2001 like we are doing this, we \ncould have delayed. We could have had some input into that, but they \nsaid no. They just went right to reconciliation. We could have done \nthat with this bill. We could have done that with this bill.\n  I remember having discussions with members of our caucus and others \nsaying: No, no. And the President, President Obama, wanted to do this \nas bipartisanly as possible to involve the minority in a constructive \nprocess. So that is what we decided to do, to do it in a very \nconstructive, open process. What it has gotten us is total--total--\nobfuscation and delay and trying to kill the bill by the minority. But \nwe will persevere. We started this open process, and we are going to \nfinish this open process. The die is cast.\n  We have a vote at 1 a.m. I wish it could be 9 a.m., but you just \nheard the Republicans object to that because I just asked that the \nintervening hours be counted toward the next 30 hours, and they \nwouldn't even do that. So the reason we are here is not because of the \nDemocrats. We are here because the Republicans simply don't want this \nbill to pass.\n\n  That is really the reason.\n  So we are going to vote. We are going to vote at 1 a.m. On the face \nof it, it is\n\n[[Page S13596]]\n\nreally a technical, procedural vote, but it is something more than \nthat. With that vote at 1 a.m. on the managers' package, on cloture on \nthe managers' package, we will have reached a pivotal point at 1 a.m., \na pivotal point in a decade-long quest to pass comprehensive health \ncare reform. We have reached a crossroads, a kind of a point in time \njust as the Senate did in 1935 when we passed Social Security, or in \n1965 when we passed the Medicare bill. Each of those bills was a giant \nstep forward for the American people, but each was bitterly opposed in \nthis body by defenders of the status quo, the Republicans.\n  In each case, Senate opponents waged a strident campaign of fear, \nwarning that the passage of the legislation would lead to socialism. \nSenator Robert Taft from Ohio kept calling it socialism. We are going \nto ``Sovietize'' America. You can read it in our history books. But in \nthe end, a critical mass of Senators rose to the historic occasion. \nSenators ignored the dark warnings and the demagoguery. They voted \ntheir hopes and not their fears. As we know now, in retrospect they \npassed laws that transformed America in profoundly positive ways.\n  The Senate has arrived at another one of those rare historic moments. \nThis time, we are attempting to pass comprehensive health care reform, \na goal that has alluded Congresses and Presidents going back to the \nadministration of Roosevelt. People think I am talking about Franklin \nRoosevelt. No. I am talking about the administration of Theodore \nRoosevelt.\n  Once again, advocates of reform faced bitter opposition, including \nthe filibuster we are seeing now and that has been going on for weeks \nby defenders of intense interests in the status quo. Once again, each \nMember of this body must make a choice: fear or hope; stick with the \nbroken status quo or embrace bold change with all of its uncertainties.\n  The other side is saying what about this? What is going to happen \nhere? I keep talking about this bill we are passing. It is not like the \nTen Commandments carved in stone. It is a bill. It is a law. Laws \nchange as times and conditions change, as we get different information. \nSo there are uncertainties in the future. The future is uncertain. But \nwe can lay down a good start toward bringing people into a health \ninsurance system and stopping some of the most horrible practices of \nthe health insurance industry, moving us toward more of a health care \nsystem rather than a sick care system.\n  So, yes, there are uncertainties, but we know one thing: The \ncertainty of the status quo leads to too many people not having any \nkind of health care whatsoever. It leads to people dying younger than \nthey should because they don't go in for their checkups and their \nscreenings, children and others.\n  We know the other side made clear sometime ago they wanted to \nobstruct and delay and filibuster and kill this bill. As far as my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are concerned, this floor debate \nis not about offering amendments to improve the bill. It is really not \nabout allowing more time to fully read it and understand the bill. That \nis nonsense. It is not about playing a constructive role to pass a \nbetter bill. All the other side wants to do is kill this bill. Period.\n  All this yakking that is going on--I was home this afternoon and I \nturned on C-SPAN and I was listening to the debate. And I thought, you \nknow, people are at home. They are getting ready for Christmas. The \ntrees are up. People are feeling good. Here we are going back and \nforth, back and forth, back and forth, but people have tuned this out.\n  They really have. It is Christmastime and people have tuned this out. \nYet we are here.\n  We are here for a good reason. We are here because we are determined \nto pass meaningful health care reform for America, and we need to do it \nbefore Christmas.\n  Well, again, in the defense of the broken system and the status quo, \nthe Republicans joined at the hip with the health insurance companies. \nThey use the same talking points, the same distortions, the same bogus, \ncooked-up studies, the same outrageous stories about death panels and \npulling the plug on grandma. We have heard all that from the other \nside, week after week, month after month. Every step, as I said, we on \nthis side have acted in good faith. We did not go the reconciliation \nroute. In our futile quest for bipartisanship, we have repeatedly given \nthe Republicans more time.\n  In the Senate HELP Committee, under the great leadership of Senator \nDodd, we spent nearly 3 weeks marking up the bill. No amendments were \ndenied. Republicans could offer any amendment they wanted. It took 13 \ndays, a total of 54 hours of meetings. We went out of our way to \naccommodate our Republican colleagues. We accepted 161 of their \namendments, either by vote or just by accepting them. After all that \ntime, all that goodwill on our side, accepting 161 of their amendments, \nevery Republican on the committee voted against the bill.\n  Now, every time I have told this story in Iowa or wherever I have \nbeen, people shake their heads. They say: What? They offered 161 \namendments? Surely, they would have been kind of happy with that. They \nmight have voted for the bill. They don't understand that. Every single \nRepublican voted against it after all of those amendments.\n  In the Finance Committee, deliberation on the bill stretched out for \nmonths solely to accommodate the wishes of the Republican members of \nthe committee. Yet after all that time, despite the fact that Senator \nBaucus had bent over backwards to pursue bipartisanship and to \naccommodate the minority's requests--he acted in good faith at every \nstep of the way--all but one Republican on the committee voted against \nthe bill.\n  Now, today, Republican Senators say they are opposing the cloture \nmotion because they need more time. They say we are rushing things, \nrushing things, there is a big rush going on. Good grief. This bill has \nbeen on the Senate floor for 21 days. We have been deliberating about \nhealth care reform for almost the entire year. Congresses and \nPresidents, as I have said, have been trying to get this done since \nTheodore Roosevelt.\n  So Republican colleagues say: Slow down. You are moving too fast. \nWell, that is absurd and disingenuous. We have to ask ourselves: Are \nour Republican friends going to be more constructive, more willing to \nact in good faith after the Christmas or New Year's break? Of course \nnot. Their aim, understand, is not to improve the bill or to even \nunderstand it; it is to kill health care reform. Period. That is all it \nis. They just want to kill it.\n  Now, because they don't have enough votes to kill it outright, they \nhave opted for a course of delay and obstruction and filibustering. But \nlet's be clear. They are not only delaying and obstructing the Senate; \nthey are delaying and obstructing the millions of Americans who \ndesperately need the reforms in this bill. They are delaying and \nobstructing the 31 million Americans who will finally get health \ncoverage. They are delaying and obstructing the underinsured, millions \nof Americans who know they are just one serious illness away from \nbankruptcy and financial catastrophe. They are delaying and obstructing \nmillions of Americans with preexisting conditions who can't get \ninsurance. They are delaying and obstructing women in this country who \nface systematic discrimination by health insurance companies. They are \ndelaying and obstructing Americans who fear if they get cancer or heart \ndisease, their health insurance company will cancel their coverage.\n  Let's be clear. Again, Republicans are not only trying to kill health \ncare reform, in doing so they are killing the hope for millions of \nAmericans who are desperate for reform of the current broken system. \nToo many Americans are literally dying because they do not have health \ncoverage and proper access to a doctor.\n  All told, nearly 45,000 Americans die each year because they lack \nmeaningful health insurance. A Johns Hopkins study found that children \nwithout health insurance who are hospitalized are 60 percent more \nlikely to die than those with insurance. Why? It is obvious. Kids \nwithout health insurance are much less likely to get preventive care or \nto be taken to a doctor in the early stages of their illness--60 \npercent more. Think about that. Children without health insurance who \nare hospitalized are 60 percent more likely to die than children who \nhave health insurance. So that is the real cost of delay and \nobstruction on the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S13597]]\n\nThis is our job. We are here. We are going to finish this job. But it \nis a tragic human cost. And these victims can be found in every one of \nour cities, our farms, our rural communities.\n\n  I refuse to allow any obstacle to stand in the way of the Senate \naddressing the needs of these Americans. I have, along with my friends \non this side, opposed the Republicans' filibuster. Likewise, I have \nbeen willing to disappoint many whose views I respect by agreeing to \npainful compromises in order to keep this bill on track. I agreed to \nthose compromises not because I lacked passion or fight--I think my \ncolleagues who know me know well enough that I can fight--I did so \nbecause of the harsh but unavoidable reality that because of the \nRepublicans' obstructionism, we need 60 votes to pass this bill, and \nthe only path to securing 60 votes was by making necessary compromises. \nBut I add, that is also the way our predecessors in this body were able \nto get the votes to pass Social Security and Medicare, both of which \nhad big gaps in coverage when they were first enacted. What they did is \nthey passed bills that were sort of a half a loaf. Then they came back \nfor the remainder of the loaf in the following years.\n  Despite these compromises, make no mistake, this remains a profoundly \nprogressive bill. One analyst put it this way:\n\n       This legislation will be the most important social policy \n     achievement since the Great Society.\n\n  That is exactly why the rightwing in this country is pulling out the \nstops to kill it. This bill will usher in three huge reforms. First, \nthis bill will be the biggest expansion of health coverage since the \ncreation of Medicare. Some 31 million Americans who do not have \ncoverage now will get it, thanks to this bill. This is a monumental \nachievement. We do this by expanding Medicaid and by providing \nsubsidies to low-income, modest-income families.\n  In addition, if you are a small business owner, this bill will offer \ntax credits of 35 percent of employer contributions toward premiums in \norder to make it more affordable for small businesses and their \nemployees to have health insurance. That 35 percent will go up to 50 \npercent. But the 35 percent starts next year. That is why I have said \nmany times in my State of Iowa, and around it, that actually the \nbiggest winners under this bill, aside from the totally uninsured, are \nsmall businesses and the self-employed. Small businesses and the self-\nemployed are the big winners in this bill.\n  What is more, our bill will end the discriminatory practice of \njacking up premiums for businesses because an employee is older or has \na preexisting condition. They will not be able to do that anymore.\n  Through these new health insurance exchanges, small businesses and \npeople currently without access to affordable coverage will be able to \nshop and choose from a menu of quality health plans, much in the same \nway Members of Congress do.\n  This bill does much more than extend health coverage. The second \ngreat reform in this bill is an array of provisions cracking down on \npervasive, outrageous abuses by the health insurance companies, abuses \nthat currently leave most Americans just one serious illness away from \nfinancial catastrophe.\n  Right now, the health insurance industry in this country is \nextraordinarily profitable. But these profits come at a staggering \nhuman cost. Think about it. When Americans get a diagnosis, let's say, \nof cancer or some other grave illness, they fear two things: First, \nthey fear the illness and, second, they fear the health insurance \ncompany. They wonder, is my company going to authorize treatment and \npay the bills or will I have to go to war to prevent it from sticking \nme or rescinding my policy?\n  I always tell people: Look at your policy. Is there a rescission \nclause in there? I have had so many people say: What is a rescission \nclause? It is a little clause in there, probably in the fine print, and \nit says that when your policy is up for renewal, the insurance company \ncan terminate you. They do not have to renew your policy. This is what \nhappens. Someone gets a very serious long-term illness such as cancer \nor heart disease. When their policy is up for renewal, the insurance \ncompany says, no, they will not renew your policy. Now you are out in \nthe cold with a preexisting condition. Now you can't get insurance \nanywhere. This bill will end that practice.\n  Health insurance companies now employ whole armies of claim adjusters \njust to deny requests. In fact, the health insurance companies give \nbonuses--they reward people for denying claims, saying no to \npolicyholders. In the State of California, the largest insurers deny \none out of every five requests for medical claims, even when \nrecommended by the patient's doctor. One large insurer, PacifiCare, \ndenies medical claims nearly 40 percent of the time. Think about that. \nThat is almost one out of two. CIGNA denies claims 33 percent of the \ntime. So if you get a terrible illness and you are insured by \nPacifiCare, good luck in getting them to pay for your medical \ntreatment.\n  Republican Senators give us all the scare talk about a government \nbureaucrat standing between you and your doctor. Right now, we have \ncorporate bureaucrats standing between you and your doctor, and they \nearn good evaluations and bonuses and money for denying you coverage.\n  I can remember a town meeting I had in Mason City in August, one of \nthose famous town meetings. Toward the end of it--it was OK. There was \na lot of contention there, people voicing their concerns, as they ought \nto do, as they have a right to do. But at the end, there was a man \nsitting down in the front. I thought, this will be my last one. I \ncalled on him. He stood up and he said: You know, I have been a doctor \nhere for over 40 years in Mason City--40 years.\n  He said: I can say honestly during those 40 years, I have never once \nhad a government bureaucrat come between me and my patients on Medicare \nor Medicaid. He said: However, I can't tell you how many times during \nthose 40 years I have had insurance bureaucrats come between me and my \npatients.\n  This is a doctor, practicing for 40 years, and never once did he have \na government bureaucrat come between him and his patients.\n  Nearly 62 percent of bankruptcies in the United States are linked to \nmedical bills. And here is the kicker: Nearly 80 percent of those are \npeople who had health insurance.\n  When is the last time you ever heard of a health insurance executive \nclaiming bankruptcy? I would like to find one someplace.\n  The American people have lived in fear and under the heavy hand of \nthese health insurance companies long enough. But help is on the way.\n  Let me mention a few of the ways this bill immediately cracks down on \nabuses by the health insurance industry. First, if you are uninsured \nwith a preexisting condition, the bill would give you access to \naffordable coverage without discrimination. Our bill immediately bans \nthose rescissions I talked about where the insurance company can \nrescind your policy. We stop that right away.\n  We prohibit insurers from imposing lifetime limits on benefits, and \nwe impose and restrict the use of annual limits.\n  Our bill ends discrimination against women. As I said, currently they \npay as much as 48 percent more for the same coverage a man has.\n  Our bill requires insurers right away, next year, to let children \nstay on their family's policy until they are age 26. Those are a few of \nthe things.\n  But there is a third area in this bill I have championed for many \nyears, and in many ways I think it may be the most profound part of the \nbill, and that is a whole array of provisions promoting wellness and \nprevention, turning America into a general wellness society.\n  To this end, at the clinical level, the bill requires reimbursement \nfor proven, cost-effective preventive services such as cancer \nscreenings, nutrition counseling, and smoking cessation programs. This \nmeans health professionals will be able to offer these services to you \nbefore you get diabetes or cancer or emphysema.\n  For essential screenings and annual physicals, there are no copays, \nno deductibles. We encourage people to do this so they will not have to \npay a copay or deductible.\n  Our bill makes major new investments in community wellness and public \nhealth, and we help businesses both large and small create workplace \nwellness programs for their employees.\n\n[[Page S13598]]\n\n  One thing I do not think has been mentioned before, our bill requires \nlarge chain restaurants to post basic nutritional information right on \nthe menu so consumers, when they are going out to eat, can make healthy \nchoices.\n  What we are trying to do is change the paradigm from our current sick \ncare system to a true health care system--one that keeps people out of \nthe hospital in the first place. Our aim is to recreate America as a \nwellness society focused on healthful lifestyles, good nutrition, \nphysical activity, and preventing the chronic diseases that take such a \ntoll.\n  As a proud progressive, I make no bones about my enthusiasm for the \nthree great reforms in this bill--vastly expanding coverage, cracking \ndown on the abuses by the health insurance companies, and making robust \ninvestments in wellness and disease prevention.\n  Today we are closer than we have ever been to making Senator Ted \nKennedy's dream of universal health insurance a reality. This bill has \nmany authors. We have all been involved in it. But in a very real \nsense, this is Senator Kennedy's bill.\n  I urge Senators, when the vote occurs at 1 a.m., to vote their hopes, \nnot their fears. Seize the moment. Let's move ahead. Let's vote for \ncloture. At long last, let's give every American access to the quality, \naffordable health care they need and they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my friend from Iowa, the \ndistinguished Chair of the HELP Committee, leaves the floor, I thank \nhim for his wonderful leadership and friendship in so many capacities \nand passion for what we are doing now. We are all here together knowing \nthat in the process of legislating, you don't always get every idea you \nwant. But you come together and you work for something that is good for \nthe American people, and that is what we have done. I thank him very \nmuch for all of his leadership.\n  I wish to take a few moments to talk about how we actually got to \nthis point on a Sunday evening--we are voting at 1 o'clock in the \nmorning--and, frankly, what has been happening all year. I want to take \na few minutes to talk about what has happened this entire year, the \nfirst year of President Obama's presidency, our first year in the \nmajority, and then to speak a little bit as well about the very \nimportant legislation that is in front of us.\n  I do think it is important that we take a moment to recognize and \naddress a very unfortunate milestone, look back on the year on what we \nhave accomplished in spite of that milestone.\n  In April, the media celebrated President Obama's first 100 days in \noffice. But here in the Senate, we can measure our progress by \nsomething else--not 100 days, but 100 objections from the minority \nparty. Actually, 101 as of yesterday; objections, filibusters, delays, \nstalling tactics designed to stop us from helping the American people \nwho are hurting in these tough economic times. That is more true in my \nState than any other place in this country. Our people, the great \npeople of Michigan, have been hurting longer, have been hurting much \nmore deeply than other places in the country because of the major \neconomic transition, as well as the recession in which we are involved.\n  There is good news because while the Republicans were stalling and \nwasting time, we were working hard doing what the people of America \nsent us to do. I want to talk about what we have done in spite of the \nstalling. But I also want to take a brief moment to explain something \nhard to explain about Senate rules because people look at us and say: \nThey objected, but why does that matter? Why does that matter?\n  Mr. President, as you know, when there is an objection, in order to \novercome it--and it is called a filibuster--it involves invoking \nmotions called cloture and it takes time. It plain takes time. So 101 \ntimes we have not been able to move forward because of an objection or \nwe have had to go through this long process we are involved in right \nnow.\n  I think it is important to briefly explain it because when \nRepublicans object, as they are now, as they have been on so many \noccasions, our leader has to file what is called a cloture motion, and \nthen you wait 2 days. You cannot do other business for those 2 days. We \nhave done that over and over, wasting time while people in my State \nwant us to be focused on jobs, on lowering their health care costs, on \nmaking sure we are doing the things that matter to them every day. But \nwe stop and we wait 2 days. Then we vote on stopping the filibuster. \nThen we wait 30 hours, which is what we are doing right now. Then we \nvote on whether to proceed to the item. There are filibusters again. \nThen we file a cloture motion on the amendments or the bill. We wait 2 \nmore days. Then we vote on closing a filibuster, and then we wait 30 \nhours, and then we vote on the amendment, which we will do tonight, and \nthen we have to wait another 30 hours. In this case, another 30 hours.\n  It does matter when we say there have been 101 objections that have \neither stopped us or forced this process. It does matter. It matters \nbecause it has slowed down the ability to move to get things done.\n  The good news is that we have gotten things done anyway. We have \ngotten things done anyway because we are focused and committed to \ngetting things done. We know the American people have waited too long. \nThe last 8 years were about taking us in the wrong direction, with \nthings that did not help most people, that put us in a huge deficit \nhole, that did not address health care or health care costs or jobs, or \npolicies that made it worse.\n  We know that even though there have been 101 objections so far this \nyear--and there will be more; there will be more--we are going to get \nthings done for the American people.\n  It is amazing the stalling actually happened on the very first day of \nthe 111th Congress on January 6 when Republicans objected to moving \nforward with an important public lands bill, something we had been \ntrying to do for some time to protect and preserve our national parks, \nforests, and wilderness areas. But we passed that important bill anyway \nover their objections and three different filibusters, as the chart \nshowed. Three different times we had to wait, wait 2 days, wait 30 \nhours, wait 2 days, wait 30 hours. But we passed it.\n  Since then, nearly every single week we have been in session, every \nsingle week but 4 out of 41 weeks, we have had to go through this \nprocess or have had objections. They have found something to object to \nor something to filibuster.\n  As I said, yesterday they objected for the 101st time, this time with \na filibuster against providing affordable health insurance for over 30 \nmillion Americans. They have misused longstanding Senate rules and \ntraditions to stall everything that might give this President and this \nCongress a victory.\n  I think it hurts all of us when the Senate breaks down as it has. \nEverybody is hurt by that--to stall everything that would help get \nAmericans back to work or that would help 15.4 million Americans who \nare looking for work, and now to stop us, as I said, from extending \nhealth insurance coverage to over 30 million Americans. Their \nobjections are about policy. They are about politics.\n  Earlier this year, objection 74, they stalled the unemployment bill, \nand their delaying tactics caused nearly 200,000 Americans to lose \ntheir unemployment benefits a couple of months before Christmas. They \nobjected to the bill twice. They filibustered not once but three times \nbefore they voted unanimously. They voted unanimously for the bill. Why \nwould you filibuster something three times and then vote for it \nunanimously? Not because you are concerned about the policy. The only \nexplanation is that Republicans were trying to waste time--time that \ncost 200,000 Americans their unemployment benefits; the difference \nbetween paying the mortgage, keeping the heat on, putting food on the \ntable, and possibly trying to keep health care going with a COBRA \npayment or in some other fashion.\n  Objection 4 was the Republican filibuster of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Act to make sure women get equal pay for equal work. Republicans \nfilibustered and held up that bill, but we pushed forward. We passed \nit. We passed a very important equal pay for equal work bill in spite \nof it.\n  Objection 6 was to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which\n\n[[Page S13599]]\n\nhas been absolutely critical to creating jobs, keeping our economy out \nof a depression. They filibustered that bill three times as well. But \nwe overcame the objections, passed the Recovery Act, and made critical \ninvestments in transportation, in our schools, in our police officers, \nand in clean energy technology and manufacturing.\n  And, yes, we are seeing the difference in Michigan right now. Mr. \nPresident, $2 billion was part of the Recovery Act. I am pleased to say \nwe have received a large part of that in Michigan to develop new \nbattery technology manufacturing. We have at least six different firms \nthat have announced and begun to develop manufacturing facilities for \nadvanced battery development. Those manufacturing facilities are going \nto put thousands of people back to work. That was in the Recovery Act \nthat was filibustered three times.\n  Objection 20 was to Senator Kennedy's Serve America Act, which we \npassed despite their filibuster, to help young people give back to \ntheir country through voluntarism and community service.\n  Objection 24 was to the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act which cracked \ndown on predatory lending and abuses by banks and mortgage companies. \nThat bill was held up for nearly a month. But we passed it, giving real \nrelief to millions of American homeowners.\n  We passed the credit card bill, Republican objection 32.\n  We passed the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, Republican \nobjection 33.\n  We gave the FDA the authority, finally, to regulate tobacco to help \nkeep kids from smoking. That was Republican objection 38.\n  We passed the Travel Promotion Act which will help stimulate the \nsuffering tourism industry across the country. That was objection 45.\n  We passed a true funding bill to make sure our soldiers in Iraq and \nAfghanistan had the support they needed despite having to file cloture \nto stop a filibuster--objection 47.\n  We passed the Defense authorization bill that included a pay raise \nfor our troops and other help for our military and their families \ndespite repeated filibusters and objections. And these were objections \n54, 56, 57, and 58. Can you imagine? This was a Defense bill.\n  We passed the veterans health care bill, despite Republican stalling, \nto help caregivers of disabled veterans, women veterans, rural health \nimprovements for veterans, mental health care for veterans, and support \nfor homeless veterans. This was Republican objection 89.\n  Objection 98 was another filibuster against those pay raises for our \ntroops just 9 days before Christmas.\n  Despite all of those objections, 101, we have been doing what we were \nsent here to do. We have focused on actions to help create jobs and \nstrengthen our economy and focus on the things that families struggle \nwith and care about every day to make people's lives better, not just a \nfew, not just investment bankers on Wall Street, not just the wealthy \nfolks who got the tax cuts in the last 8 years, but middle-class \nfamilies every day who are trying to figure out: What about them? What \nabout us? That is what we have been focused on.\n  We passed an extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program to \nprovide health and dental care to nearly 10 million children. We passed \nlegislation to reform government contracting and protect taxpayer \ndollars. We passed legislation to invest in health care, energy, and \neducation. We passed the cash for clunkers bill, as you know, that I \nwas proud to lead in the Senate that moved over 650,000 fuel-efficient \ncars off dealer lots and brought thousands of laid-off manufacturing \nworkers back to work.\n  We passed legislation to support the growth of small businesses and \nto extend the first-time home buyers tax credit. And now, just a few \ndays before Christmas, we are working to pass this critical, historic \nhealth insurance reform legislation. We are committed to getting it \ndone.\n  Republican colleagues can object 100 times or 1,000 times, but we are \nnot wavering in our commitment to do the right thing. Even though \ninaccuracies abound, even though misinformation has been said over and \nover about what this bill would do, we are committed to overcoming what \nhas been the tidal wave of opposition from the special interests who \ncontrol the status quo, who like it the way it is right now. We are \ndetermined to get beyond that and do the right thing for American \nfamilies. Whether our Republican colleagues work with us or not--and we \nsincerely hope they do, and we have spent a tremendous amount of time \nthis year reaching out to get bipartisan support--whether they stall or \nobject, our job is to do everything we can to move America forward, and \nthat will continue to be our focus.\n\n  As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows because we both sit on \nthe Finance Committee, we have spent months reaching out with \ncommittees, with processes to get bipartisan support. But, as my dad \nused to say, it takes two to tango. It takes both sides to want to work \ntogether. Unfortunately, it appears the strategy that was put in place \nback at the beginning of the year, the very first day of session, with \nthe very first filibuster, was just to stop us from being able to move \nAmerica forward, to stop this great new President, to stop the majority \nin the Congress. But we have moved forward despite that.\n  I think often of what we could do if we hadn't had to deal with 101 \nfilibusters, what we could have done in creating a clean energy bill, \nwhich would create more jobs in my great State, or dealing with other \ncritical issues we need to deal with and we will deal with. As we slog \nthrough filibuster after filibuster in the coming year, we will do \nthat. But now we have the opportunity in front of us to pass historic \nhealth insurance reform that, frankly, people have talked about for 100 \nyears.\n  This legislation is not perfect, but nothing ever is when you start. \nIt is a great framework, however, for putting in place the value, the \nprinciple that every American should be able to have affordable health \ninsurance and that we are going to tackle the explosion of costs that \nhave hit businesses large and small, that have hit taxpayers, and to \nbring those costs down over time. That is what we are involved in right \nnow, and we are going to get it done.\n  We could have voted much earlier, rather than keeping our staff here \nuntil 1 a.m., and we will vote again after we run the next 30 hours, \nwhich will be, I believe, Tuesday morning. We could vote and be done \nwith the final passage at that point. We know where the votes are. We \nhave the votes to pass this. But it appears we will be here until \nChristmas Eve. Mr. President, I do not mind for myself. I, of course, \nwant to be home with my family, as I know you do. But I think about my \nbrother, who drives for UPS, and I know he will be working on Christmas \nEve, as a lot of Americans will be working on Christmas Eve. And if we \nneed to be here until Christmas Eve to do something that will \npositively affect every American, I am willing to do that. I am willing \nto do that if that is what we need to do.\n  Let me take a moment to talk about the bill in front of us. The bill \nin front of us literally saves lives, saves money, and saves Medicare, \nand I am very proud that in the managers' amendment, the amendment we \nwill be voting on at 1 a.m. today, we have made it even better.\n  I am very pleased to have helped to lead a section related to small \nbusiness tax cuts. Along with our chair of the Small Business \nCommittee, Senator Landrieu, and another strong advocate, Senator \nLincoln, we have been working on provisions that will make sure there \nare small business tax cuts that start immediately--next year--after \nthe bill passes, $40 billion in tax cuts in total to help small \nbusinesses afford health insurance for themselves and their workers.\n  In our amendment, we also provide even tougher insurance reforms.\n  In the underlying bill, we lay out a whole health care bill of \nrights. I remember coming here in the year 2000, and the Patients' Bill \nof Rights was the major thing we were trying to get done. We were in \nthe minority, the Democratic minority, but we were working hard to do \nthat. It was my first opportunity to work with Senator Kennedy. We \nbelieved strongly that we needed to take insurance company bureaucrats \nout of the middle--from between doctors and patients. That is in this \nbill. Those kinds of reforms are in this bill and only one of many \nthings that are in this bill.\n\n[[Page S13600]]\n\n  We have toughened it up so that if insurance companies, between now \nand when the new group insurance pool takes effect, are raising their \nrates too high, spending too much on profit and administration, then \ntaxpayers, ratepayers, will get a refund. And we hope that will put \npressure on them not to continue to raise rates or try to do what the \ncredit card companies have done before the bill takes effect--raise \ntheir rates. So we have put new protections in and other protections as \nwell to make sure that the majority--the vast majority--of every dollar \na family puts into premiums actually goes for their medical care rather \nthan for profits and administration.\n  In total, we have $430 billion in tax cuts to create affordability \nfor families and for individuals, to help them afford health insurance. \nWith that, overall, this is a tax reduction--this bill is--for the \nAmerican people, and it is a reduction for taxpayers because it lowers \nthe deficit in the first 10 years and on into the future.\n  I am going to take just a moment to give a sense of what is in the \nbill as it relates to new coverage and the benefits.\n  We know the majority of us have health insurance already. In \nMichigan, it is about 60 percent of the people, and in other places it \nis 50 or 55 percent. But we have what is called an employer-based \nhealth insurance system. So we have started from the basis that people \nshould be able to keep what they have, and we have built on that. The \nmajority of people have either employer-based insurance or they have \nMedicare or Medicaid or veterans services or other public services. So \nwe started from the basis that we want to make current health insurance \nmore secure, more stable. The insurance reforms we are putting in place \nfor those plans that take effect--or new plans after this takes \neffect--will include the elimination of preexisting conditions, the \nelimination of what is called rescissions--the ability to drop someone \nif they have gotten sick--and the elimination of discrimination.\n  One of the things I was surprised to learn about, in terms of how \nextensive it is, as we went through this process is that women are \npaying, on average, 50 percent more than men for the same coverage in \nthe individual insurance market or maybe even less coverage. Because a \nwoman is in her childbearing years or perhaps has been pregnant and may \nbe viewed as having a preexisting condition, some women might not be \nable to find health insurance.\n  So those who have insurance today, as they attempt to get new plans, \nwill be able to take advantage of all of the insurance protections--our \nhealth care insurance bill of rights--in the bill. And this is very \nimportant.\n  Also, people with insurance today will actually, over time--and it \nwill take some time for this to happen--but as others who do not have \ninsurance now are able to afford health insurance and become able to \nget health care, there will be fewer people using emergency rooms. \nThere will be fewer people needing other kinds of services that \nactually end up coming back, in terms of cost, to all of us who have \ninsurance today because when someone walks into the emergency room \nsicker than they otherwise would be if they had seen a doctor, they get \ntreated, as they should, but then the hospital has to make up the cost, \nso they put it on people who have insurance today. That is estimated to \nbe about $1,100 in hidden costs for individuals. So we are going to see \nthose kinds of costs come down and other changes and efficiencies and \nquality that will help people with insurance today. So coupled with the \ninsurance reforms, we will see more stability and more quality for \npeople who have insurance today.\n  The major area of new coverage is in what is called the insurance \nexchange. For the 15 to 20 percent of the people who can't find \naffordable insurance today--and most of them, as our Presiding Officer \nknows, are small businesses or people who are self-employed or people \nwho have lost their jobs and then lose their insurance--we set up a new \ngroup pool, which is a way for people to use the same leverage a big \nbusiness does or the Federal Government does, just as the insurance \npolicy for Members of Congress uses a pool. Then everyone can choose \nthe insurance coverage they want within that pool and get a better \ndeal. That is what we are setting up in the insurance exchange, with \nhelpful tax cuts for families and for businesses and individuals to \nhelp them afford health insurance.\n\n  We are also giving a choice to States. For lower income working \npeople, a State may choose to provide a basic health insurance plan \nrather than people getting a tax cut to go into the exchange. They can \nset up their own basic health insurance plan and bring down costs as \nwell through the State.\n  For young workers--and this is one of the things I wish had been \naround a couple of years ago--we will be allowing parents who have \ntheir children on their insurance policies--after the effective date of \nthe act, they will be able to keep their children on their insurance \npolicies until the age of 26. That will give young people a chance to \nget a start in that first job knowing they have insurance until they \nare 26. And there are a number of other provisions in the bill for \nyoung people as well.\n  We are making Medicaid a true safety net for low-income people up to \n133 percent of poverty. We are truly going to be able to say: If you \nlose your job, you won't have to lose your insurance. What an important \nthing to be able to say in terms of taking away that fear of losing \nyour job and having nowhere to turn.\n  Improving Medicare. We are going to stop what have been overpayments \nto for-profit insurance companies and put that money back into closing \nthe gap in prescription drug coverage under Medicare. It has been \ncalled the doughnut hole. We are going to close that. We are going to \nprovide preventive care for seniors without out-of-pocket costs and \nlengthen the Medicare trust fund so that it is stronger for a longer \nperiod of time.\n  I am very proud to have worked with Senator Kerry to develop a way to \nprovide support and help for companies that pay for the health \ninsurance of early retirees, to lower their costs so that, in fact, we \nwill be able to help those who have retired, voluntarily or \ninvoluntarily, so they will have the insurance they need until they can \nqualify for Medicare.\n  Let me close by saying this legislation is very much about saving \nlives. Forty-five thousand people lose their lives every year because \nthey can't find health insurance they can afford. That is 45,000 \nfamilies who will have one less person at the dinner table over the \nholidays because of lack of health insurance. Surely we can do better \nthan that in our great country.\n  We will be saving money for small businesses, for families, for \ntaxpayers, and bringing down the deficit--beginning to turn those costs \ndownward rather than keeping them going upward in such an \nuncontrollable way.\n  Saving Medicare. We will be making sure Medicare is stronger out into \nthe future and that our seniors have more help paying for their \nprescription drugs and preventative services as well.\n  When you get through all of it, we know it is hard to change the \nstatus quo because those who benefit from the current system don't want \nit changed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. But we do.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic block of time has expired.\n  The Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, after weeks of closed-door clandestine \nnegotiations, Senator Reid finally emerged with a 383 page manager's \namendment yesterday to the 2,074 page, $2.5 trillion tax-and-spend \nWashington takeover of our health care system.\n  Despite all the promises of ushering a new era of accountability and \ntransparency in Washington by the President and the Democratic Party, \nthe Reid amendment represents everything that Americans hate about \nWashington right now Chicago-style backroom buy-offs at the expense of \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  At yesterday's press conference, when Democrats were asked about the \nNebraska earmark for Medicaid funding, the majority leader simply \nreplied, ``A number of States are treated differently than other \nStates. That's what legislation is all about. That's compromise.''\n  So in addition to the Medicare Advantage deal to grandfather only \nFlorida's seniors and the $300 million give-\n\n[[Page S13601]]\n\naway known as the Louisiana Purchase, we now know what the Democrats' \nversion of compromise really looks like. In the Reid amendment, \nreleased yesterday, Vermont gets a 2.2-percent increase for 6 years in \nits Medicaid Federal match rate while Massachusetts gets a 0.5 percent \nincrease for 3 years for its entire program. But the deal for the State \nof Nebraska takes the cake. Now we all know that any one Congress can't \nbind future Congresses but somehow Nebraska will receive a special \ncarve out that would have the Federal Government pay for every dollar \nof its Medicaid expansion. The total cost of these Medicaid special \ndeals--$1.2 billion.\n  So the next logical question is pretty straightforward--who will pay \nfor these special deals? Well, the answer is simple. Every other State \nin the Union, including Utah, which are collectively facing $200 \nbillion in deficits and are cutting jobs and education services to \nsurvive; our States will now pay to support these special deals for \nNebraska, Massachusetts and Vermont.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Medicaid expansion \nin the Reid bill creates a $26 billion unfunded mandate on our cash-\nstrapped States. Coincidentally, only one State avoids this unfunded \nmandate--Nebraska.\n  Let me now focus my attention on over a $\\1/2\\ trillion worth of new \ntaxes, fees, and penalties on individuals, families, and businesses \nimposed by the Reid bill. The new fees begin in 2010, while the major \ncoverage provisions do not start until 2014. Almost $57 billion in new \ntaxes are collected before any American sees the major benefits of this \nbill, which are largely delayed until 2014. It is no wonder why this \nbudget gimmickry creates an illusion of this bill reducing our national \ndeficit.\n  Based on data from the Joint Committee on Taxation--the nonpartisan \ncongressional scorekeeper--this bill would break President Obama's \ncampaign promise by increasing taxes on 42 million individuals and \nfamilies making less than $250,000 a year. This is even after taking \ninto account the government subsidies provided to low- and certain \nmiddle-income individuals and families.\n  The Reid bill not only increases payroll taxes by nearly $87 billion \nbut also imposes $28 billion in new taxes on employers who do not \nprovide government approved health plans. These new taxes will \nultimately be paid by American workers in the form of reduced wages and \nlost jobs.\n  According to a recent study of similar proposals by the Heritage \nFoundation, these new job killing taxes will place approximately 5.2 \nmillion low income workers at risk of losing their jobs or having their \nhours reduced and an additional 10.2 million workers could see lower \nwages and reduced benefits.\n  So with nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts and more than $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in new taxes, does the Reid bill actually do anything to \ncontrol our Nation's skyrocketing health care costs? The answer, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, is no. In fact, it will \nactually increase our national health care spending. I quote: ``Under \nthe legislation, Federal outlays for health care would increase during \nthe 2010-2019 period, as would the Federal budgetary commitment to \nhealth care. The net increase would be about $200 billion over that 10-\nyear period.'' So what is the bottom-line? More taxes, more spending \nand bigger government.\n  Let me a take a moment to talk about the so-called abortion \ncompromise in this bill. The language to prevent taxpayer dollars from \nbeing used to fund elective abortions in the Reid amendment is \ncompletely unacceptable. The new abortion provisions are significantly \nweaker than the amendment I introduced with Senator Ben Nelson to \nensure that the Hyde amendment, which prohibits Federal dollars from \npaying for elective abortions, also applies to any new Federal health \nprograms created by Congress. The Hyde amendment has been public law \nsince 1976.\n  The Nelson-Hatch-Casey amendment, which is almost identical to the \nStupak amendment that was included in the House-passed health reform \nbill in early November by a vote of 240 to 194; it is important to note \nthat 64 of those Congressmen voting for the amendment were Democrats. \nLet me repeat that--the Stupak amendment was supported by 64 House \nDemocrats. And, despite that vote and the support of seven Senate \nDemocrats, the majority decided not to include this language in the \nReid bill or the Reid managers' amendment. I find that absolutely \noutrageous.\n  Moreover, the Reid conscience protections are much weaker than those \nincluded in the House passed health reform bill. The House bill \nincluded the Hyde-Weldon conscience protections that have been included \nin the HHS appropriations bills since 2004; the Reid health reform \nlegislation does not. The Hyde-Weldon language ensures that strong \nconscience protections are in place for medical providers who oppose \nabortion. These strong protections, which are currently Federal law, \nshould also apply to the new programs created through the Reid \nmanagers' package.\n  The so-called abortion compromise does not stop there. The Reid \namendment also creates a state opt-out charade. As noted by Cardinal \nDaniel DiNardo, the Archbishop of Galveston-Houston and the Chairman of \nthe U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops' Committee on Pro-Life \nActivities, allowing ``individuals to `opt-out' of abortion coverage \nactually underscores how radically the underlying Senate bill would \nchange abortion policy. Excluding elective abortions from overall \nhealth plans is not a privilege that individuals should have to seek as \nthe exception to the norm. In all other federal health programs, \nexcluding abortion is the norm. And numerous opinion polls should that \nthe great majority of Americans do not want abortion coverage.''\n  Additionally, this provision does nothing to prevent one State's tax \ndollars from being used to fund abortions in other States. In other \nwords, tax dollars from Nebraska or Utah could be paying for abortions \nin California or New York.\n  The Reid amendment also creates a new public option that will be run \nby the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which, for the first time, \ncreates a federally funded and managed plan that will cover elective \nabortions. Should this legislation be signed into law, the Federal \nGovernment will be funding elective abortions for the first time in \nover 30 years, against the will of the vast majority of Americans. For \nthese reasons, I believe that the Senate health reform legislation is \nfar inferior to the House passed bill when it comes to protecting the \nsanctity of life. It should come as no surprise to anyone that pro-life \norganizations from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to the \nNational Right to Life Committee and the Family Research Council have \nexpressed their strong opposition to this so-called compromise.\n  Finally, let me take a moment to talk about the individual mandate \ntax which has almost doubled from $8 billion to $15 billion in the Reid \namendment. I have long argued that forcing Americans to either buy a \nWashington-defined level of coverage or face a tax penalty collected \nthrough the Internal Revenue Service is unconstitutional. The \nConstitution empowers Congress to do many things for the American \npeople. Just as important, however, is that the Constitution also sets \nlimits on our power. We cannot take advantage of the power without \nrecognizing the limits.\n  We hear a lot about how Senators on this side of the aisle are \nsupposedly defending the big, evil insurance companies while those on \nthe other side of the aisle are the defenders of American families. \nThis insurance mandate exposes such partisan hypocrisy. Let me ask one \nsimple question: who would benefit the most from this unprecedented \nmandate to purchase insurance or face a penalty enforced by our friends \nat the Internal Revenue Service?\n  The answer is simple. There are two clear winners under this \ndraconian policy and neither is the American family. The first winner \nis the Federal Government, which could easily use this authority to \nincrease the penalty, or impose similar ones, to create new streams of \nrevenue to fund more out of control spending. Second, the insurance \ncompanies are the most direct winners under this insurance mandate \nbecause it would force millions of Americans who would not otherwise do \nso to become their customers. If you do\n\n[[Page S13602]]\n\nnot believe me, then just look at the stock prices of the insurance \ncompanies that have recently shot to their 52-week highs.\n  Right now, States are responsible for determining policies that best \nmeet the particular demographic needs and challenges of their own \nresidents. Massachusetts, for example, has decided to implement a \nhealth insurance mandate while Utah has decided not to do so. This bill \nwould eliminate this State flexibility so that the Federal Government \nmay impose yet another one-size-fits-all mandate on all 50 States and \non every American. I cannot think of anything more at odds with the \nsystem of federalism that America's founders established--a system \ndesigned to limit government and protect liberty.\n  As I have said all year long, ensuring access to affordable and \nquality care for Americans is not a Republican or Democrat issue--it is \nan American issue. Unfortunately, the majority's arrogance of power has \nforced us down a path where ideology has trumped policy and big \ngovernment has trumped American families.\n  Town hall after town hall and poll after poll tell us that Americans \nwant us to step back, start over and reform our healthcare system in a \nstep-by-step, fiscally responsible manner. This is a moment for courage \nand leadership. All we need is one Democrat to listen to a growing \nchorus of concerns from Americans across this great nation and stand up \nagainst this bill. I am going to do everything possible to make sure \nthat the voice of Utahns and Americans everywhere is heard loud and \nclear in this Senate Chamber.\n  A vote to move this bill forward will be one of the most important \nvotes this body has ever taken--a vote that is bigger than our parties \nor our ideologies; a vote that will fundamentally change the American \nlandscape for generations to come and restructure one-sixth of our \neconomy; a vote that will determine if we will give our future \ngenerations the same opportunities and the same sense of pride that has \nbeen our privilege. Make no mistake, our actions on this vote will not \nbe without consequences. History and our future generations will judge \nus on this vote.\n  Despite the harsh realities of skyrocketing deficits and an exploding \nnational debt, the majority's insatiable appetite to spend has not \nchanged. Last weekend was a perfect example. At a time when we are \nalready debating a $2.5 trillion tax-and-spend Washington takeover of \nour health care system, the majority jammed through a $1.1 trillion \nappropriations bill with a 12-percent year-over-year increase in \nFederal spending. But this is only the tip of the iceberg. There is \nalready talk of raising our Nation's debt limit by almost $2 trillion \nto accommodate Washington's out of control spending habits.\n  Enough is enough. It is time to stand up and do what is right and \nthere is no better time to do it than to vote against moving forward on \nthis health care bill. The time for courage is now.\n  The historic blizzard in Washington yesterday was a perfect symbol of \nanger and frustration brewing in the hearts of the American people \nagainst this bill. I urge the majority once again to listen to the \nvoices of the American people. My Republican colleagues and I are \nunited with the American people in our fight against this $2.5 trillion \ntax-and-spend bill. There is still time to step back and start over.\n  One last thing. When you have one-sixth of the American economy \ninvolved, it deserves a bipartisan vote. To be honest, almost every \nmajor reform we have ever passed--in fact, every one I can think of--\nhad a huge bipartisan vote. In this particular case, I don't know of \none Republican who is going to vote for this. If you can't get 75 to 80 \nvotes on something this important, this much of a reform, then we \nshould start over and do it the right way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been interested in the \nconversation that has gone on this afternoon and this evening. I have \nheard, once again, the statement made on the floor about the number of \npeople who die every year because they don't have insurance and how \nthat is an absolutely essential reason why we have to pass this bill \nand indeed pass it now; we have to pass it before Christmas; we have to \npass it immediately because there are tens of thousands of people who \nare dying because they don't have insurance; we have to pass this bill \nso it will provide insurance for them in January of 2014; we have to \npass this bill because people are dying right now, but we are not going \nto have any of the things that will take care of them available for 4 \nyears. So we can't take an extra week--we can't take an extra 10 days--\nbecause people are dying. But we can take an extra 4 years before we \ngive them anything. I have had a very hard time understanding that \nlogic. The mathematics do not add up for me. Delaying everything for 4 \nyears--why?\n  We know why. The reason they are delaying the implementation of this \nbill for 4 years has nothing whatever to do with people's health or the \nfact that some people are dying. The reason the implementation date of \nthis bill is delayed 4 years is entirely due to the computers in the \nCongressional Budget Office which say, if you started this program \nimmediately, it would bankrupt the United States. It would blow the \nbudget right out of the water. How do we make it look as if this bill \nis budget neutral? The way we make it look as if the bill is budget \nneutral is tell the computers--which cannot think, they can only add--\nwe will start the revenue in this bill, the taxes in this bill, the \nincreased premiums in this bill right away. But we don't start spending \non any of the things we are giving the people to save their lives for 4 \nyears. So the computers will say: All right, you will accumulate \nrevenue for 4 years and that will be a big pot of money. Then, in the \nremaining 6 years of the 10-year term, which is all the computers are \nallowed to look at, you will have enough money over a 10-year period to \npay for 6 years' worth of benefits. I will grant that. Actually, it \nisn't 6 years' worth of benefits because the money coming in will not \nbe enough. So in order to make it look even better, they will project. \nThe computers--which don't think, just add--say: Yes, this is right. We \nwill project taking roughly $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare and putting \nit into the same pot of money that is coming in, in the 4-year period, \nwhen nothing is going out.\n  But wait a minute. If we have 4 years of money coming in and nothing \ngoing out and we take $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare and put it in the \nsame pot of money, the unthinking computers can add that very well. \nThey can come up and say: You know, this is going to be revenue \nneutral. Anybody who thinks this is going to be revenue neutral does \nnot understand reality, certainly does not understand history.\n  Let's look at the CBO record of projecting health care costs. I \nremember when the Congress passed Medicare. There were very firm costs \nassociated with Medicare. It was going to cost so much. We look back on \nMedicare, it has cost 20 times what was projected. In the first year, \nit cost more than was projected. This is in constant dollars, not in \ninflation-adjusted dollars. In constant dollars, Medicare costs 20 \ntimes what we were told. I remember during the debate in 1994, Joe \nCalifano, the father of Medicare, the member of the White House staff \nwho wrote the bill, wrote an op-ed piece in the Washington Post. He \nsaid: Congress, pay attention to our experience with Medicare. He said: \nWe put Medicare together, but we got the cost projections. We put the \nwhole thing together. We knew within months after it had passed we were \nwrong. We knew within months the costs were going to go way out of \nsight. We went to the Congress and told them and at that point it was \ntoo late. This thing had taken root. It had its followers. It had \npeople who were solidly behind it. It was too late to fix it. It has \nended up costing us 20 times.\n  Let's look ahead and see what we are doing if we pass this bill. No. \n1, we are doing nothing for people who need coverage for 4 years. But \nwe are locking into the Federal budget situation a brandnew \nentitlement. That is a word we use in Washington. Many of my \nconstituents don't understand what it means. Let me do my very best to \ntry to help people understand. First, as the word implies, the people \nwho are receiving the money under an entitlement are entitled to it, \nwhether we have the money to give it to them or\n\n[[Page S13603]]\n\nnot. They are entitled to it whether they need it or not. They are \nentitled to it whether it makes any sense for them to get it or not. It \nis an entitlement that they will receive this money.\n  When Medicare was passed, the only entitlement we had was Social \nSecurity. Now we have Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Along \nwith the other entitlements built into the Federal budget, how much of \nthe Federal budget goes out in entitlements? If we look at the budget \nfor 2010, here is the cautionary lesson. The budget in 2010 on which we \nvoted--I didn't vote for it--listed the projections out of the \nCongressional Budget Office as to how much revenue the Federal \nGovernment was going to have in 2010. The answer was $2.2 trillion. \nThat is a lot of money. Then it said, next line, entitlement spending \nor mandatory spending, $2.2 trillion, which meant that in 2010, with \nthe economy on its back and the revenue coming down as a result, every \nsingle dime we received out of the economy in 2010 was already \ncommitted.\n  So people would say: Senator, why don't you balance the budget? I \nwould say: How am I going to balance the budget? How am I going to \nbalance the budget with every dime that is coming in already committed \nand going out as an entitlement and outside the appropriations process?\n  Vote against an earmark.\n  Pardon me. The entire government, all the Embassies overseas, the \nDefense Department, Transportation, Education, national parks, name it, \nwhatever it is, every dime to keep the government going had to be \nborrowed, not because we didn't have any revenue. We had $2.2 trillion \nworth of revenue which, by itself, would have covered the cost of \nkeeping the government open. But we couldn't touch a single dime of \nthat $2.2 trillion because all of it was tied up with entitlements. So \nwhat are we doing in the face of that experience? We are creating a new \nentitlement to add to those we already have.\n  The realities of Federal budgeting are these, and they are not unlike \nthe realities of running a business. I have run a business. I \nunderstand how the very best projections, the very best forecasts can \ngo awry. You have a new product. You think it is going to do well and \nyou forecast X millions of dollars in revenue from this new product. \nYou look at what the product is going to cost you and you forecast that \ncost and you put the two together and you say: All right, we will have \nX in revenue and we will have Y in costs. As a result, we are going to \nhave Z in profit. So you go out and you build the product. You commit \nfor the raw materials. You pay the people in your factory to produce \nit, and you put it on the shelves. Now you are at the mercy of the \ncustomer, because if the customer decides he doesn't like the product, \nyour projections of the amount of revenue will not save you from the \nenormous loss that will come.\n  Yes, you are right on the Y you are spending, but you were wrong on \nthe X you thought you would get in. Instead of having the Z you planned \nto have as profit, you have a huge loss on your hands. Conversely, I \nhave this happen, too. I have done my forecasting. I have laid down the \nplan for how much of the product we are going to produce. I have done \nmy forecasting of how many will sell, and the product went crazy. It \njumped off the shelves. All of a sudden, I was stuck with empty shelves \nand had to scramble to produce more and more and more in order to meet \ndemand.\n  In the Federal Government, we don't have a product but we have \nexpenses, just the same as doing a manufacturing operation. We don't \nhave sales, but we have taxes. Our taxes are dependent upon the \nviability of the economy. The one fundamental lesson we all should \nlearn is this: We can accurately predict the expenditures that are \ngoing out, just like in the business I could predict what it would cost \nme to produce the product, but we cannot accurately predict the revenue \nthat will come in, just like I can't accurately be sure what the sales \nwill be. We did a spending pattern based on revenue when the economy \nwas strong. Suddenly, the economy turned weak and the revenue dropped \noff to $2.2 trillion. We were stuck.\n  Does this make any sense in the face of that reality? We can \ndetermine the spending, but we can't determine the revenue. Does it \nmake any sense in the face of that reality to build in increased \nspending in the form of another entitlement in the hope that the \nrevenue will be there? The only way the majority leader is able to make \nthis bill look as if the revenue will be there is with a series of \nbudget gimmicks the likes of which I have never seen, some of which I \nhave already discussed.\n  The first budget gimmick is to say the revenue will be there because \nwe will have 10 years of it and only 6 years of expenditure. The \nrevenue will be there because we will be able to find $\\1/2\\ trillion \nworth of waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. I will stipulate there is \nprobably $\\1/2\\ trillion worth of waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare \nover the period of time we are discussing in this bill. We have been \nlooking for it for more than 10 years and have been unable to find it. \nThis bill, instead of trying to take a scalpel to Medicare and cut out \nthe areas of waste, fraud, and abuse, uses a sledgehammer to smash \nMedicare and say we are going to knock $\\1/2\\ trillion out of it and \nhope that in the process of doing so, we will hit the waste, fraud, and \nabuse without hitting anything else.\n  We have 4 years on the timetable laid down by the majority in which \nto get this right. The majority has decided that if, indeed, people are \ndying because they don't have health care, they can continue to die \nbecause they don't have health care for 4 more years. I think in the \nface of the smoke and mirrors we are seeing with respect to this \nbudget, we can afford, during that 4-year period, at the front end of \nthat 4-year period, to take a few more weeks to do this right. That is \nwhy I am here and that is why my Republican colleagues are here, not \nbecause we don't say there is a problem, not because we don't have any \nideas as to how to deal with the problem, not because we don't want to \njoin hands with our friends across the aisle to solve the problem but \nbecause we know this bill is the wrong solution. Our constituents are \npleading with us. They know this bill is the wrong solution. Every poll \nshows that. They are pleading with us: Don't let it happen. Don't let \nit happen. No matter what you have to do, don't let it happen.\n  It may well be that all our efforts are in vain. It may be we are \nwashed aside in a tide of 60 votes. But we will not be washed aside by \ncomplacency or the desire to get along because the stakes are too high.\n  I conclude with this one last analogy. There was another very large \norganization that handed out a large series of entitlements to people \nwith whom it was connected. These entitlements were not directly \ninvolved with the business of that organization, but they got bigger \nand bigger and bigger, and, ultimately, this organization suddenly \ndiscovered it could not function because of the financial drain of the \nentitlements it faced. The organization is now owned by the Federal \nGovernment. It is called General Motors. They discovered they could no \nlonger be a car company because they were buried by the kind of \nentitlements they had built into their own situation.\n  Let us take a lesson from General Motors. We do not want the Federal \nGovernment to go bankrupt the way that company did. If we do, there is \nno other organization to bail us out the way the U.S. Government \nultimately felt forced to bail out General Motors. It is a cautionary \ntale we all need to heed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I, too, rise to voice my very strong concerns about this latest \nversion of so-called comprehensive health care reform. I will speak of \nmy strong concerns starting with the process we are in the midst of \nbecause I am still digesting the particulars of this latest megabill.\n  As you know, it was divulged yesterday, a 383-page amendment to the \nunderlying bill. The amendment references another bill which is 286 \npages. The underlying bill is 2,074 pages. It makes for the seventh--\ncount them--the seventh version of so-called comprehensive health care \nreform, Obamacare for short, in a few weeks. That grand total would be \n2,733 pages. So, certainly, I am still digesting this latest version. \nMy staff is helping me,\n\n[[Page S13604]]\n\nbut I wish to rise to begin to express my concerns.\n  The first concern is what I just referenced, this process we are in \nthe midst of. When I went around Louisiana and when I continue to go \naround Louisiana--have townhall meetings--of course, health care comes \nup first and often. The themes I hear over and over are: This is too \nimportant to rush. This is too important to have some arbitrary \ndeadline, whether it was last summer or Christmas. We need to get it \nright, not have arbitrary deadlines, and we need to know what we are \nvoting for or against. That is what I hear about the right process to \nuse over and over and over.\n  Well, unfortunately, clearly, this process we are in the midst of \ndoes not honor those wishes of Louisiana citizens, of American \ncitizens. Before this latest megahealth care bill was unveiled \nyesterday, everyone it seems--including Members of the majority party \nwho, at least, were involved in the negotiations, unlike Republicans--\nwas in the dark.\n  Let me mention a few statements Democratic Senators made over the \nlast week or so before yesterday's unveiling.\n  Senator Durbin, in the leadership, said:\n\n       I would say to the Senator from Arizona, that I'm in the \n     dark almost as much as he is. And I'm in the leadership.\n\n  Senator Schumer of New York, also in the leadership:\n\n       I can't say what there is, because we're not allowed to \n     talk about what's submitted to CBO.\n\n  Senator Bayh of Indiana:\n\n       We're all being urged to vote for something and we don't \n     know the details of what's in it.\n\n  Senator Bill Nelson of Florida:\n\n       I don't know what the deal is.\n\n  My colleague, Senator Landrieu, of Louisiana:\n\n       There's no specific compromise. There were discussions. . . \n     . Until the package that was sent is scored, we really don't \n     even know what's in it.\n\n  Senator Casey of Pennsylvania:\n\n       Any big agreement is progress . . . even if we do not know \n     any of the details.\n\n  Senator Feinstein of California referred to a meeting on the majority \nside recently:\n\n       There was no explanation. It was sort of go team, go.\n\n  Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, talking about a similar majority \nmeeting:\n\n       General concepts, but nothing very specific at all.\n\n  Then, at least yesterday, this new megabill--this 383-page amendment, \nreferencing another 286-page bill, attached to an underlying 2,074-page \nbill--was unveiled. That finally happened yesterday morning.\n  Well, that is some progress. But I am afraid it is not progress \nenough. It is not time enough, considering we are set to vote on this \nnew megabill in just a few hours, starting at 1 a.m. tomorrow morning.\n  Listening to American citizens all over the country, several \nSenators, including myself, have advocated we need at least 72 hours of \nfinal bill text on the Internet before we take any votes about this \nsort of major legislation. We need at least 72 hours of the official \nCongressional Budget Office cost estimate being on the Internet before \nwe start any of those votes. I have certainly advocated that. Many of \nmy colleagues on the Republican side have advocated that, listening, \nresponding to American citizens who say: No arbitrary deadlines. Know \nwhat you are voting on. Get it right.\n  Perhaps even more importantly than my advocating it or other \nRepublicans advocating it, at least eight Democrats have specifically \ndemanded the same thing. In fact, on October 6 of this year, eight \nDemocrats wrote a very clear, strongly worded letter to the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, and they demanded exactly the same thing: 72 \nhours of final legislative language on the Internet before any vote on \nthe matter, a full Congressional Budget Office cost estimate on the \nInternet for at least 72 hours before any vote on the matter. I applaud \nthese Senators for demanding that: Senator Lincoln, Senator Landrieu, \nSenator McCaskill, Senator Pryor, Senator Bayh, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Ben Nelson, and Senator Webb.\n  But, again, this process we are in the midst of certainly does not \nhonor that minimal demand. We are set to vote on this in just a few \nhours. When we do, we will have only had the final legislative language \nfor about 40 hours. We will have only had the full Congressional Budget \nOffice cost estimate for about 37 hours. That is 56 percent or less of \nthis minimum timeframe that so many of us, including eight Democrats, \nhave demanded.\n  Again, this rush to judgment, this rush to beat an arbitrary \nChristmas deadline, is clearly ignoring the common sense of the \nAmerican people, the common sense I heard in my dozens of townhalls all \nacross Louisiana: no arbitrary deadlines. Know what you are voting on. \nGet it right. Do not rush to judgment.\n  I have strong concerns about this process. Where are the 72 hours? \nWhere is the opportunity for Members and the American people to know \nwhat is in this latest version of a megabill on so-called comprehensive \nhealth care reform? Where is the 72 hours' notice of a Congressional \nBudget Office cost estimate?\n  Given that rush to judgment and arbitrary timeline, I am rushing to \ndigest this latest version of the bill. But certainly, already, I have \nother very strong substantive concerns. I will be coming back to the \nfloor within the next few days to more precisely outline those concerns \nas I digest more of the details of this latest megabill. But let me \nmention at least six of the big Louisiana-based questions I am focused \non in terms of this latest megabill, this latest so-called \ncomprehensive health care reform or Obamacare.\n  No. 1 is the impact on the Louisiana State budget. There has been a \nlot of discussion about that because of the particular language \nincluded in the bill pertaining to Louisiana that apparently gives \nLouisiana a $300 million benefit. The problem, from the Louisiana \nperspective, is in the Medicaid system, and that $300 million is \ndirectly related to Medicaid. In Medicaid, there is a much greater \nadditional burden put on all States, including Louisiana. In \nLouisiana's case, apparently, that is going to far surpass $300 \nmillion.\n  So I am concerned about the overall, the net, impact on the Louisiana \nState budget, particularly because of the dramatic expansion of \nMedicaid. Medicaid is the health care program for the poor. It is \ndramatically expanded in the bill. Every State--except perhaps Nebraska \nbecause of special language put in for Nebraska--every State pays a \nmatch for both existing Medicaid and Medicaid expansion. That is going \nto put a big extra burden on the Louisiana State budget, and that big \nextra burden is apparently going to be much more than the $300 million \nof benefit that has been so widely talked about. I am looking, right \nnow, at the details of that.\n  My second big Louisiana-based concern has to do with the Louisiana \nseniors--Louisiana seniors who have paid into Medicare, the health care \nsystem for retirees, for years and have assumed it would be there for \nthem, as they paid in, as they followed the rules every step of the \nway. I know from the study I have done already that this new, latest \nversion of the megabill, so-called comprehensive health care reform, \ninvolves a $464.6 billion cut to Medicare. That is going to impact \nevery Louisiana senior, and it is going to impact tens of thousands of \nLouisiana seniors on Medicare Advantage particularly onerously.\n  My third big Louisiana-based concern is the Louisiana taxpayer \nbecause this bill contains massive tax increases to pay for all these \nnew entitlements. Apparently, the total figure of tax increases in the \nbill is $518 billion--over $\\1/2\\ trillion--more tax increases than in \nany of the six previous megabills, the six previous versions of \nObamacare. A lot of these taxes are clearly going on individuals who \nearn less than $200,000 per year, families who earn less than $250,000 \nper year. A lot of Louisiana taxpayers are going to be hit. That is a \nbig concern.\n  Fourth, I am concerned about Louisianians who have health care now \nand who pay premiums because those premiums, by all accounts, by all \nindependent estimates, are going to go up because of the taxes and fees \nand other burdens in this bill.\n  Fifth, what about Louisiana small businesses, businesses that are \nstruggling right now in a serious recession, the most serious recession \nsince the\n\n[[Page S13605]]\n\nGreat Depression? We are in the midst of an extremely serious \nrecession, and we are putting new mandates, new burdens, and new taxes \non Louisiana small business. By all accounts, that is going to cost \njobs, pure and simple, as we are in the midst of a very serious \nrecession. I am concerned about that impact on Louisiana small \nbusiness.\n  Sixth, and finally, Louisiana defenders of life. I am very proud to \nsay Louisiana is one of the most pro-life States in the Nation--very \nstrong values which hold up life and the defense of life in all its \nforms. Apparently--it is clear to me--this bill has taxpayer funding of \nabortion, the first time ever in Federal legislation, breaking \ntradition from the Hyde amendment, which has been the law since early \n1977.\n  I am very concerned about that radical, truly radical departure from \nthe past.\n  So in closing, let me say I hope we can adopt a different process, \none that reflects the common sense of the American people and \nLouisianans when they say no arbitrary deadlines, no rush to judgment, \nand know what you are voting on. Also, I hope we will adopt a different \napproach that doesn't involve all of the downside I have mentioned, \nthose six major categories.\n  I am still digesting this latest megabill. I will return to the \nSenate floor in the next few days to talk more and in more detail about \nthose concerns I have laid out. But I hope all of my colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans, look hard at those and similar concerns, \nlook hard at the process and resolve to not just do this quick, not \njust do it before Christmas by some arbitrary deadline, but to do it \nright and to honor the American people in our work.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I am new to this Chamber, and as I have \nsat here today and listened to my distinguished colleagues speak about \nthis bill, watching some of my other colleagues on television in my \noffice this evening, I can't help but think how fortunate I am to be \nhere, to be a part of this process. It makes me think back also to the \nFounders who put together this great constitutional system of democracy \nthat we have in this country, with the three branches of government, \nand here in the Senate, the sober and reflective legislative body that \nthinks through the great issues of the day to make sure we get them \nright for the American people.\n  In listening to this great debate, I wonder what they would think \nabout what we are doing here. Putting aside the substance, what would \nthey think of the procedure? Because I am new to this Chamber, I think \nI still have fresh eyes as to what is normal as compared to perhaps \nwhat is a little bit departed from normal. Would they think it was \nwithin their intentions as the Founders that we would be coming here to \nvote at 1 o'clock in the morning? Would they think it would be within \ntheir intention of how things would work in the Senate that we would \nget an amendment to the bill that is 400 pages long, we would get it \nyesterday and would have just a little time to consider it before we \ntry to vote on it? Would it be what they intended, that we would press \nthis vote up against Christmas, and we would try to get it done quickly \nwhile most of the people in our country are off with their families and \npreparing for the holidays? Would that be what they intended, the \nprocess of this great deliberative body, arguably, it is often said, \nthe greatest debating institution in the world? Is that the way they \nwould want us to achieve policy that is going to affect one-sixth of \nour economy? I don't think so. In fact, I don't think the American \npeople think so either.\n  That is why they are so bewildered as to what we are doing here in \nthe Senate and why we are, as my friend and colleague from Louisiana \nsaid, rushing to judgment; why we must get this done before Christmas. \nIf it is such a good bill, why do we have to get it done so quickly? If \nit is such a good bill, why can't we take some more time to evaluate \nit? If it is such a good bill, why can't we offer more amendments to \nit?\n  So I am sure the American people, if they are home watching this--and \nthey are probably watching Sunday night football--but if they are \nwatching this, they would say: Of course, my Senator from Florida or \nthe Senators from the other States can now offer amendments to try to \nimprove the bill. But that is not the case because the leader of the \nDemocratic Party, the majority leader, has done something called \nfilling the tree.\n  Now, look, I am new here, too, so this is all new to me, but it is a \nprocess by which no other amendments are allowed. So if we want to \nchange the bill, if we have ideas to improve it, that is not allowed. \nIs that what the American people want from us? Is that what our \nFounders intended? I don't think so.\n  So we have this new amendment. It is 400-some pages long. I guess it \nis the amendment to fix the problems that were in the bill, or at least \nto get 60 votes. And what do we know about this amendment? What does it \ndo, for example, to Medicare cuts? We know the previous bill before the \nSenate cut nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion out of health care for seniors. What \ndoes this amendment do? Well, it still cuts health care for seniors. It \nactually cuts a little bit more, but it is still around that same \nnumber: $\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  We know also that it raises taxes. Does it raise taxes $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion as the previous measure did? Yes, it does. In fact, it raises \ntaxes a little more. Now it is $518 billion.\n  Well, what about the question that is the most pressing on the minds \nof most Americans, the very reason we are here, according to the \nPresident of the United States, which is to impact the cost of health \ninsurance for most Americans. What does it do about that? Does the \namendment do something about that? We know the underlying bill does \nnothing to impact the cost of health insurance for most Americans. We \nare here about to change one-sixth of the U.S. economy, and this bill \ndoes nothing to impact the cost of health insurance for folks who \nalready have health insurance in this country. That is not me saying \nit; that is the Congressional Budget Office.\n  If you are one of the 170 million Americans who already have health \ninsurance, this bill is not going to lower your costs. In fact, for \nsome Americans, it is going to increase your costs over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Well, does this amendment fix it? No. So we are still in the same \nsituation--cutting $\\1/2\\ trillion out of health care for seniors, \nraising taxes by $\\1/2\\ trillion, with nothing in it for most Americans \nin terms of the cost of their health insurance.\n  How is this going to affect the American people? Well, if you have \nMedicare, if you are a senior who has been paying into it, it is going \nto affect you.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle will say: Look, the nearly \n$\\1/2\\ trillion that we are going to take out of Medicare is just \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. We will get that money out. Well, the \nCongressional Budget Office says the measures that are in the bill will \ntake out $1\\1/2\\ billion worth of waste, fraud, and abuse, not $500 \nbillion. So where is the rest going to come from? It is going to be \ndecreased benefits. It is going to be decreased access to doctors.\n  We know right now in Medicare, nearly 24 percent of medical health \ncare providers--your doctors, for example--will not take Medicare \nanymore, 24 percent, one in four of them. In Medicaid it is 40 percent.\n  What is going to happen when you reduce the amount of money you are \npaying into Medicare? You are going to reduce the amount of money that \nis being paid to providers, which means providers are not going to see \ntheir patients. If the doctor is not in, it is not health care reform.\n  This really impacts my State of Florida. We have the highest number \nof seniors per capita, 3 million seniors, on Medicare, and they are \ngoing to be impacted.\n  I wish to read from a letter that was sent to me by Mr. Richard \nMullaney. I received it at the end of November. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator LeMieux. I thought you might like to see this \n     letter I received from my cardiologist.\n\n  It attaches that letter from the Palm Beach Cardiovascular Clinic in \nJupiter, FL, down in southeast Florida.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S13606]]\n\n\n\n\n                             Palm Beach Cardiovascular Clinic,\n\n                                                      Jupiter, FL.\n       An Open Letter to our Patients: The 2010 Medicare Fee \n     Schedule mandates that on January 1, 2010 severe cuts in \n     cardiology physician fees will begin. This cut is being \n     phased in over four years because the government used flawed \n     data to make their calculations. In addition, there are \n     Congressionally mandated cuts of more than 20 percent to all \n     Medicare physician fees, regardless of specialty. The result \n     of these combined government policies are that our practice \n     is facing payment cuts ranging from 25 to almost 50 percent.\n       Such drastic reduction in fees are going to seriously \n     hamper our ability to continue to see you, our patients, as \n     we do today. We feel the need to warn you that these \n     reductions will translate into much longer waiting periods \n     for you to schedule an appointment or a procedure with your \n     doctor, longer telephone response times to you, and not \n     having the convenience of in-office Nuclear and Echo \n     diagnostic testing available to you. Making sure you have the \n     best quality of care will always be our number one priority. \n     Caring for people is why we all dedicated our lives to heart \n     patients. In the very near future--it is going to be a \n     difficult climate to operate in our current manner.\n       We have built our office facility and trained our staff to \n     best take care of each patient. We believe that the care you \n     receive is critical to your quality of life. Wish these cuts \n     we may not be able to provide some of the services that \n     patients have come to depend on and in the long run; if the \n     current policies are not changed, we may be forced to close \n     our doors.\n       As a cardiovascular patient we urge you to contact our \n     lawmakers (see attached for their information) about the \n     impact of our changing practice on you. The law is clear--we \n     face cuts unless Congress acts. In advance we thank you for \n     understanding our changing environment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gabriel E. Breuer.\n     Chauncey W. Crandall IV.\n     Augusto E. Villa.\n     Agustin A. Vargas.\n     Gonzalo J. Loveday.\n     Burton H. Greenberg.\n     Sidney M. Richman.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, it is an open letter to patients, and it \nis signed by some seven doctors who are in this cardiovascular clinic \npractice. I will read portions of it. It says:\n\n       Drastic reduction in fees are going to seriously hamper our \n     ability to continue to see you, our patients, as we do today. \n     We feel the need to warn you that these reductions will \n     translate into much longer waiting periods for you to \n     schedule an appointment or a procedure with your doctor, \n     longer telephone response times to you, and not having the \n     convenience of in-office Nuclear and Echo diagnostic testing \n     available to you.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       With these cuts we may not be able to provide some of the \n     services that patients have come to depend on and in the long \n     run, if the current policies are not changed, it may force us \n     to close our doors.\n\n  So these are doctors, real doctors, and this is a letter from their \nreal patient saying: If these cuts to reimbursements to doctors and \nproviders aren't addressed, then we are going to have an inability for \ndoctors to perform health care.\n  Those are real-world problems that are going to occur if this bill is \npassed.\n  So this is no great shakes for seniors. This isn't health care \nimprovement for seniors. Those that we already have on a government \nentitlement program, those who have already paid into the program are \ngoing to have a cut in their benefits. That is exactly what the Chief \nActuary, we found out last week from the Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, said. He said it is plausible, even probable, that \nthere will be shortages for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries because \nthere is not going to be doctors who are available to see them.\n  Let's talk about the taxes: $518 billion in tax increases. What is \nthat going to do to the cost of health care? We are going to tax \nmedicine. We are going to tax lifesaving devices. Those taxes, of \ncourse, will be passed along to you, the consumer. So for you, your \ncost of health care will go up, taxes on health insurance of almost $60 \nbillion; taxes on medical devices, $19 billion; taxes on medicine, $22 \nbillion. If you don't have health insurance now and you don't get it, \nyou will be taxed. If you are a small business and you don't provide \nhealth insurance to your employees, you will be taxed.\n  I had a telephone townhall meeting this week, and I talked to a \ngentleman from central Florida who had been laid off from his job at a \nrestaurant. He said to me: The reason I got laid off is because the \nrestaurant couldn't afford the health care benefits. So when health \ncare benefits went up, the restaurant raised its prices for its food, \npeople stopped coming to the restaurant, and the restaurant went out of \nbusiness. Then there wasn't health care for any of the employees.\n  You can't get blood from a stone. While the benefits of this plan as \nlaid out by my Democratic colleagues may sound great--33 million more \nAmericans who are going to have some kind of health insurance--you have \nto look at the details. How are you going to pay for it, and what is \nthe effect going to be? When you raid nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion out of \nMedicare, you are going to decline the quality of health care for our \nseniors. When you raise taxes by $\\1/2\\ trillion, you are going to pass \nthose costs along to consumers who already have health insurance, and \ntheir prices are going to go up. You are going to pass them along to \nsmall businesses that would not be able to afford them, that will let \npeople go.\n  We have 11.5 percent unemployment in Florida. When small businesses \ncan't afford this, they are going to let people go or, like that \nrestaurant, close their doors. That is not good for a country that is \nfighting through the worst recession since the Great Depression.\n  Now we find out there are a bunch of special deals in this bill. We \nfind out that the Senator from Nebraska has been able to get a special \nfix for his State.\n  See, another thing this bill does is it puts a big unfunded mandate \non the States. What do I mean by that? An unfunded mandate is a \nrequirement that the States must fulfill that they don't get paid for. \nThis time it comes in the form of Medicaid, which is health care for \nthe poor. Medicaid, under this proposal, is going to be increased. We \nare going to put 15 million more Americans into Medicaid.\n  If you think Medicare recipients are having a tough time finding a \ndoctor, in Medicaid, 40 percent of health care providers will not take \nit; 50 percent of specialists will not take it. Now we are going to put \n15 million more Americans into it.\n  What it does to the States, in a State such as Florida, it is going \nto cost us in 10 years nearly $1 billion to accept this unfunded \nmandate. The Senator from Nebraska apparently got a fix for this so his \nState would not have to pay the $1 billion. Well, Florida would like \nthat same fix. If it is good for Nebraska, it is good for Florida. I am \nsure Iowa would like that fix as well. I am sure all the States would.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside \nand it be in order to offer an amendment to extend to the State of \nFlorida the same benefits that provide 100 percent Federal funding to \nthe State of Nebraska for their expanded Medicaid Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Objection.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. For the folks who are watching at home, the reason my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa objected to this is because this deal \nwould not go through if they provide it for every State. So some States \nare going to get it better and some States are going to get less, and \nthat is not fair. But that is the process that has put this bill \ntogether, to cobble together 60 votes.\n  So at the end of the day--may I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. At the end of the day, I have 15 seconds left. I will be \nback to the floor to speak about this again. But this is not a good \nbill for America, and that is why my colleagues on this side of the \naisle have been debating and showing our objections so the American \npeople can understand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans' block of time has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise to, first, commend my distinguished \ncolleagues, Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Senators Ben Nelson \nof Nebraska, Barbara Boxer of California, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, \nand Chuck Schumer of New York for the principled and practical \ncompromise they reached on the difficult issue of abortion. Their work \nallows the U.S. Senate to now march with our House colleagues toward \nthe forward edge of history and the enactment of The Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act, and I congratulate them for that important \ncontribution.\n\n[[Page S13607]]\n\n  I would also like to commend my colleague, the assistant majority \nleader, Dick Durbin of Illinois, for bringing to the Senate's attention \nduring yesterday's debate an op-ed that appeared in the Washington Post \nthis morning written by our dear friend Victoria Reggie Kennedy \nentitled ``The Moment Ted Kennedy Would Not Want to Lose.''\n  Vicki Kennedy was Senator Kennedy's partner in all things, including \nhis final efforts to move health reform forward even as he valiantly \nfought his own battle with cancer.\n  In more than 17 years of marriage, Ted and Vicki were inseparable, \nbonded by the love of friends, family and most obviously by their love \nfor one another. Vicki displayed inspirational grace in leading us all \nin our grief and in the memorable celebration of his life on the \noccasion of Senator Kennedy's death.\n  And today, she continues as his partner paying tribute to Ted's \nlegacy by respectfully urging his colleagues to move forward on the \nhealth reform he would have wanted.\n  I feel certain that Vicki's voice and his will make us more \ndetermined than ever to complete Ted's work for the American people. We \nthank you, Vicki.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to respond to an argument made in \nanother op-ed in Thursday's Washington Post and in an interview on \n``Meet the Press'' this morning by my friend, and a former Democratic \nParty chairman, Howard Dean.\n  Chairman Dean said in his opinion piece: ``If I were a Senator, I \nwould not vote for the current health-care bill,'' because it does not \nbring ``real reform.''\n  With all due respect, before anyone swallows Howard's faulty \nprescription, as they say in the field of health care, ``It's time for \na second opinion!''\n  As a former national chairman of the Democratic Party myself, I'll \ntake my equal time to offer my opinion and say I am a U.S. Senator, and \nI will vote for the current health care bill precisely because it does \nbring ``real reform.''\n  Is it all the reform for which our friend and colleague Ted Kennedy, \n``the Father of Modern Health Care Reform'', fought so valiantly and \ntirelessly throughout his legislative career? No.\n  Is it all the reform for which I and many of my distinguished \ncolleagues advocated so passionately here on the floor of this Chamber \nthroughout this intense debate? No.\n  But, is it a quantum leap forward that will bring ``real reform'' to \na broken, discriminatory, bankrupting, deficit-busting health care \nsystem that will only get worse without immediate action and passage of \nthis legislation?\n  The answer is clearly: Yes.\n  One of the reasons history will record that Ted Kennedy was the \ngreatest legislator of our time was that he respected the need and the \nart of compromise.\n  And he would argue that a choice between a solid, sound, significant \nand long overdue start at ``real reform'' of our health care system and \nthe choice of leaving American families to continue to fall behind \nbecause we refused to seize the historic moment before us--is the \neasiest choice and, perhaps, the most historic vote we may ever cast as \nU.S. Senators.\n  Does anyone in this Chamber--or in Massachusetts--or anywhere else \nfor that matter, doubt Ted Kennedy's commitment to legitimate, \ncredible, real reform of our system in order to make affordable, \nquality health care accessible to the greatest number of Americans? The \nanswer is clearly: No.\n  Is this a bill of ``real reform'' that Ted Kennedy would champion and \nvote for? Absolutely, yes!\n  Ted Kennedy knew real reform when he saw it, and so do I.\n  Here are the real health care reform measures of this Senate bill, \nmany of which Senator Kennedy helped to craft. Think about this.\n\n  It will save money and save lives; expand coverage and bring over 30 \nmillion uninsured Americans into the community of the insured; It will \ncontrol costs and lower premiums; stimulate competitive choices so \nconsumers can choose the best policy at the most affordable price; \nrelieve the costly health care burden on the small businesses of \nAmerica through tax credits; provide a discount to countless seniors \nlike my own sister Maud, who are squeezed by the cost of prescription \ndrugs under Medicare D's so-called doughnut hole.\n  The real reforms in this bill will strengthen Medicare and Medicaid; \nreduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars; attack waste, \nfraud and abuses; eliminate lifetime limits on needed care; reward \nwellness and preventive practices; increase transparency and insurance \ncompany accountability; promote flexibility, innovation and best \nbusiness practices; reward the quality and value of care instead of the \nquantity and volume of procedures.\n  This bill will eliminate unjust discrimination against women or those \nafflicted with preexisting conditions; it will provide the elderly and \ndisabled a voluntary choice to self-fund a plan that will provide \nfinancial security to purchase long-term services when they are needed \nmost; it will require insurance companies to cover children and \ndependents up to age 26; and prohibit insurance companies from dropping \ncoverage for Americans who get sick--the very reason they buy health \ninsurance in the first place!\n  In these and many other ways, this Senate bill is real reform--for a \nsenior citizen who cannot afford the drugs she needs; for the 31 \nmillion people who will now have the health insurance they deserve; for \nfamilies who worry that hospital bills will wipe out their life \nsavings; and for a system that presently fails to serve the needs of \nthe American people, this is real reform.\n  For those well-meaning progressives who say they oppose this bill \nbecause it does not go far enough and to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who want to defeat this bill and start over, I say \nthey are both mistaken.\n  We need to win this fight now and we need to win this fight together! \nWill there be more to do after its enactment?\n  Mark my words. There will always be more to do. But this historic \npiece of legislation will be a giant step forward toward a health care \nsystem that truly begins to serve the needs of the American people.\n  President Kennedy offered two profound observations that have helped \nme keep things in perspective throughout my life, and they have \nparticular application at this moment in our time. He once said:\n\n       Wisdom requires the long view.\n\n  And on another occasion, he said:\n\n       Democracy is never a final achievement; it is a call to an \n     untiring effort.\n\n  John Kennedy's words apply so well to the work of health care reform \nbefore us this evening and to the legislation that will pass this \nSenate within the next several days.\n  We are all called upon to exercise our wisdom and to take the long \nview of history. We must understand that passage of this legislation \nwill not be a final achievement. It will be a compelling first call to \nan untiring effort to continue with our responsibility to do what the \nAmerican people deserve--provide affordable, accessible, quality health \ncare for them as a matter of right.\n  I am old enough to recall the Civil Rights Act of 1960, and the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. With the passage \nof each of those laws, there was always more to do. But each began the \nmarch of progress toward equality under our laws. And each created a \nresponsibility to assure that our country's laws more aptly reflected \nour national character and our principle of equal justice.\n  The same is true of this moment in our national history. The bill \nbefore this Senate is not perfect, nor will it be the final product. \nBut make no mistake, it is real reform, and it will provide enormous \nbenefits to America's workers, America's seniors, and America's \nfamilies.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues not to be held hostage by the raw and \ndivisive politics of the moment, not to be the captives of those who \nmay threaten with some meaningless political litmus-test score cards, \nbut to step back and to think about the positive difference these \nreforms will make in the lives of the millions of American families you \nrepresent--and, finally, to reflect wisely upon the long view of \nhistory and decide that this is the moment to join the majority of this \nU.S. Senate in moving toward history's enlightened edge by voting for \nthis landmark legislation.\n\n[[Page S13608]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me commend \nour colleague from Massachusetts, Paul Kirk, who has only been with us \na brief amount of time under circumstances he has said on numerous \noccasions over the last several weeks he would much prefer to have \navoided. I commend him.\n  Many of my colleagues know that Paul Kirk is no stranger to this \ninstitution, having worked as a member of the staff in Senator \nKennedy's office for many years. He has had a distinguished career in \nhis own right in Boston. We welcome him here under those very sad \ncircumstances. But his remarks this evening are evidence of the value \nhe has placed in coming to this Chamber and filling a gap here and \narticulating a view our colleague from Massachusetts would be \nexpressing were he here these days and tonight.\n  Said so well, if it has not been printed in the Record, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial piece \nwritten by Senator Kennedy's wife Vicki Kennedy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 20, 2009]\n\n             The Moment Ted Kennedy Would Not Want To Lose\n\n                      (By Victoria Reggie Kennedy)\n\n       My late husband, Ted Kennedy, was passionate about health-\n     care reform. It was the cause of his life. He believed that \n     health care for all our citizens was a fundamental right, not \n     a privilege, and that this year the stars--and competing \n     interests--were finally aligned to allow our nation to move \n     forward with fundamental reform. He believed that health-care \n     reform was essential to the financial stability of our \n     nation's working families and of our economy as a whole.\n       Still, Ted knew that accomplishing reform would be \n     difficult. If it were easy, he told me, it would have been \n     done a long time ago. He predicted that as the Senate got \n     closer to a vote, compromises would be necessary, coalitions \n     would falter and many ardent supporters of reform would want \n     to walk away. He hoped that they wouldn't do so. He knew from \n     experience, he told me, that this kind of opportunity to \n     enact health-care reform wouldn't arise again for a \n     generation.\n       In the early 1970s, Ted worked with the Nixon \n     administration to find consensus on health-care reform. Those \n     efforts broke down in part because the compromise wasn't \n     ideologically pure enough for some constituency groups. More \n     than 20 years passed before there was another real \n     opportunity for reform, years during which human suffering \n     only increased. Even with the committed leadership of then-\n     President Bill Clinton and his wife, reform was thwarted in \n     the 1990s. As Ted wrote in his memoir, he was deeply \n     disappointed that the Clinton health-care bill did not come \n     to a vote in the full Senate. He believed that senators \n     should have gone on the record, up or down.\n       Ted often said that we can't let the perfect be the enemy \n     of the good. He also said that it was better to get half a \n     loaf than no loaf at all, especially with so many lives at \n     stake. That's why, even as he never stopped fighting for \n     comprehensive health-care reform, he also championed \n     incremental but effective reforms such as a Patients' Bill of \n     Rights, the Children's Health Insurance Program and COBRA \n     continuation of health coverage.\n       The bill before the Senate, while imperfect, would achieve \n     many of the goals Ted fought for during the 40 years he \n     championed access to quality, affordable health care for all \n     Americans. If this bill passes:\n       Insurance protections like the ones Ted fought for his \n     entire life would become law.\n       Thirty million Americans who do not have coverage would \n     finally be able to afford it. Ninety-four percent of \n     Americans would be insured. Americans would finally be able \n     to live without fear that a single illness could send them \n     into financial ruin.\n       Insurance companies would no longer be able to deny people \n     the coverage they need because of a preexisting illness or \n     condition. They would not be able to drop coverage when \n     people get sick. And there would be a limit on how much they \n     can force Americans to pay out of their own pockets when they \n     do get sick.\n       Small-business owners would no longer have to fear being \n     forced to lay off workers or shut their doors because of \n     exorbitant insurance rates. Medicare would be strengthened \n     for the millions of seniors who count on it.\n       And by eliminating waste and inefficiency in our health-\n     care system, this bill would bring down the deficit over \n     time.\n       Health care would finally be a right, and not a privilege, \n     for the citizens of this country. While my husband believed \n     in a robust public option as an effective way to lower costs \n     and increase competition, he also believed in not losing \n     sight of the forest for the trees. As long as he wasn't \n     compromising his principles or values, he looked for a way \n     forward.\n       As President Obama noted to Congress this fall, for Ted, \n     health-care reform was not a matter of ideology or politics. \n     It was not about left or right, Democrat or Republican. It \n     was a passion born from the experience of his own life, the \n     experience of our family and the experiences of the millions \n     of Americans across this country who considered him their \n     senator, too.\n       The bill before Congress will finally deliver on the urgent \n     needs of all Americans. It would make their lives better and \n     do so much good for this country. That, in the end, must be \n     the test of reform. That was always the test for Ted Kennedy. \n     He's not here to urge us not to let this chance slip through \n     our fingers. So I humbly ask his colleagues to finish the \n     work of his life, the work of generations, to allow the vote \n     to go forward and to pass health-care reform now. As Ted \n     always said, when it's finally done, the people will wonder \n     what took so long.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, she said it very well, as Senator Kirk has, \nthat this is far from a perfect bill. We all know that. It is far from \na finished product in terms of health care. The Presiding Officer spent \na good part of his career as well working on this issue and would be \nthe first to acknowledge as well that we have a lot more work to be \ndone.\n  Congresses long after all of us who serve in this Chamber are gone \nwill be grappling with the issue of how we can better deliver health \ncare services, create greater access, and reduce the cost of health \ncare while extending quality of life for our fellow citizens and \nremoving the fear so many families feel when they discover that a loved \none--a child, particularly--is suffering from some illness or disease \nthat requires attention and yet to be informed that the costs of \nproviding that attention, that care is so prohibitive that they cannot \nafford to do it and wondering why they, because they lack the economic \ncircumstances, cannot take as good care of their children as someone \nwith access to greater economic power can.\n  That is what we are trying to achieve, to create that availability. I \ndon't know anybody who disagrees with the statement that health care in \nAmerica ought to be a right, not a privilege. And if it is a right--\nthen, just as other rights are extended to every citizen regardless of \ntheir economic circumstances, their ethnicity, their background, their \ngender, certainly this right ought to be no different in that regard \nand available to all of our fellow citizens regardless of their \nfinancial circumstances. That is what we are starting to do here. It \ndoes not achieve that goal perfectly, but it puts us on that path to \nachieving that equity, that ability for families and individuals to \ntake care of themselves and their families when afflicted by a medical \ncrisis or medical problem.\n  Having been deeply involved in this issue now for not quite a year \nbut almost a year, since it became very difficult for my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts to conduct the kind of daily and hourly \nefforts he would have been involved in but for his health condition, we \nhave come to a moment now to decide whether we go forward, whether we \naccept the responsibility as being Members of this body to do the best \nwe can when trying to design something written by 100 people, not to \nmention 435 in the other body, not to mention an administration and all \nof their interests, not to mention all of the stakeholders who are \ninvolved in health care, which is so voluminous that it would be \nimpossible, even in the time remaining this evening, to mention \neveryone who has a stake in the outcome of this discussion.\n  Taking all of those elements and trying to bring them together to \nfashion an ideal or set of ideas to go forward has defied, as I have \nsaid on so many occasions in this Chamber over the past number of \nmonths, has defied every administration and every Congress since this \nfirst challenge was posed by--well, going back to the days of Theodore \nRoosevelt but more recently since the time of Harry Truman. Every \nCongress, Republican and Democratic, every President, Democratic and \nRepublican, has at least thought about doing this. Some have actually \ntried. President Nixon actually tried. President Clinton actually tried \nto come forward. Those who remember those days, for a variety of \nreasons, some that seem more clear today than the hour they were being \ndebated, those efforts failed. We are now that third administration, \nthat third effort that has come this far, if you will.\n\n[[Page S13609]]\n\n  My hope is that this evening and in the ensuing few days, we will \ncomplete our task in this body and continue the effort by working with \nthe House of Representatives to fashion a final product for the \nsignature of the President of the United States to allow us to begin \nwhat will be a long journey to make sure that right of health care is \navailable to all of our citizens.\n  Many of us here may never see the benefits of that just because of \nlife expectancy, I suppose. But to know you are leaving a health care \nsystem in place for the coming generation where they can look back on \nthese wintry days in the Senate and be reminded that there was a \nCongress at the outset of the 21st century willing to face up to the \nchallenges, with all of the accusations, all of the barbs, all of the \nad hominem arguments hurled at people, and make an effort to correct a \nwrong, to right a wrong, to make a difference and improve the quality \nof life for all of our fellow citizens--that is something I hope coming \ngenerations will recognize as a result of the efforts we have made \nhere.\n  Let me take a few minutes to wrap up this part of the debate with my \nviews as to where we stand at this hour.\n  When this body began the process of writing health care reform over a \nyear ago, we knew it would represent a mammoth undertaking, and we knew \nit would get more difficult as we got closer to the goal line, as every \nmajor effort I have been involved in for three decades here has \ncertainly evidenced. As you get closer to the goal line of major \nundertakings, it gets harder and harder to cross that finish line.\n  This issue involves one-sixth of our economy, affects 100 percent of \nour fellow citizens, and has been the center of American public policy \ndebate since before many of us were even born.\n  Our path has been long and winding and has been difficult. It has \nbeen illuminated by a torch lit long ago in the days of Harry Truman \nand those who even preceded him and sustained for decades by very good \npeople--Democrats, Republicans, and others--who believe that in a \nnation founded on freedom and sustained by unimaginable prosperity, no \none--no one--in our country ought to have to go to sleep on a night \nsuch as this feeling that if they get sick or a loved one does, they \nwill go broke or, worse, be unable to afford the care they or that \nloved one needs to get well.\n  As I said so many times before, the person who carried this torch as \nlong and proudly as anyone since this debate began so many years ago is \nnot here with us tonight, but he is here in spirit and good conscience. \nI speak, of course, of our colleague from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy. \nHe never expected that he or we would cure all our ills in one fell \nswoop, in one massive bill that would, once and for all, right this \nproblem of health care. Progress, he would argue, is hard, and the \nsimple mathematics of the Senate make it harder all the time.\n  I know our Republican leadership has basically advised their fellow \nmembers of their caucus not to vote for this bill no matter what is in \nit. I regret that. I think it is a sad moment but one with which we \nhave to grapple. We cannot quit because of that political conclusion. \nWe have to move forward. In fact, they went so far as to write a \nplaybook for how to disrupt, delay, and obstruct progress on this \nissue. I know they do not like the bill and many parts of it. I also \nknow many of them like many parts of this bill, and they acknowledge \nthat when they talk about greater access, cost reductions, and the \nquality of health care. As one who conducted the hearings and the \nmarkup on health care over the last year, I heard over and over that \nmembers of that committee, Republicans and Democrats, speak of the very \nsame goals we all seek with health care reform. I know, as a matter of \nfact, that many of them wrote major provisions of this bill. This bill \nis not devoid of the involvement and participation of members of the \nminority party this evening as we come close to voting on a final \nchoice. But I regret it has come to that. I think our best efforts do \nemerge when we work together as citizens of this great country, \nregardless of the political labels we bear.\n  My hope will be in the coming days that those doors may open and \nparticipation may, in fact, flow and we will end up with a product \ncoming back from conference that is even stronger than the one we are \nbeing asked to make a decision on this evening.\n  Someday we will look back on this moment in our Nation's history, and \nmany of those not part of this decision will wish they stood in the \narena instead of lobbing rhetorical grenades and cheap shots at a bill \nthat deserves so much better. There is still time for my colleagues to \nstand and do what is right. I hope they will before the process is \nover.\n  As it is, our caucus had to work at finding compromise language we \ncould all stand behind, and we have tried to do that over these days. \nThe resulting bill is not one that any one of us would have written on \nour own given that opportunity. And that goes for me as well, as I know \nit does the Presiding Officer. We have fought for a strong public \noption in our committee. I fought to have it included in the bill the \nmajority leader brought to the floor, and I would have happily been \nfighting for it even today given that opportunity. But as I have said, \nit is always easier to envision the legislation you want than to pass \nthe legislation we can get.\n  Our country badly needs this legislation, even as imperfect as it may \nbe in some aspects. The preferred outcome of our Republican friends we \nhave in the Senate--deadlock within our caucus and a resulting failure \nto pass a reform bill--will result in more family bankruptcies, more \ndeficits, and, sadly, more deaths that could have been prevented if \neveryone had access to decent health care. We do not have to let that \nhappen. In fact, we will not let that happen. We have to be better than \nthat.\n  Yesterday, the majority leader offered a managers' amendment to the \noriginal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which we have been \ndebating since prior to Thanksgiving.\n  It toughens accountability policies for insurance companies, \nrequiring them to spend more on health care and less on administrative \ncosts and profits, holding them accountable for jacking up premiums, \nand prohibiting them from excluding coverage of preexisting conditions \nfor children, effective immediately.\n  It provides American families with more health care choices, \nguaranteeing that in addition to a variety of private sector options, \nfamilies can choose from at least two national plans similar to the \nones we receive right here in the Senate, one of which will be a not-\nfor-profit plan.\n  It strengthens affordability provisions in the bill, starting a tax \ncredit for small businesses in 2010, giving families more information \nto shop for better deals, and helping to spread cost-saving innovations \nacross the country.\n  It builds on the bill's protections for seniors, children, rural \ncommunities, and other vulnerable populations.\n  It preserves the bill's core commitments that no American should go \nbroke because they get sick and no American should die because they \ncannot afford the care they need to get well.\n  After more than a year of legislating and more than 60 years of hard \nwork on the part of advocates across the Nation, we have an \nunprecedented opportunity, both later this evening as well as the \nremaining days of this week. We are standing on the floor of the Senate \nwith a chance to pass legislation that puts our focus on preventing \ndisease, not just treating it, a bill that insures those 31 million of \nour fellow citizens who today lack any health insurance at all, a bill \nthat guarantees every American access to quality health care at a lower \ncost.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy always believed we would someday have this \nchance, and I think he knew this year might be the best and for our \ngeneration the last chance. These opportunities do not come around very \noften. We fought for reform in the 1970s and failed. We fought for \nhealth care reform in the 1990s and failed as well. If we fail this \ntime, if we let partisanship triumph over progress, if we lose sight of \nthe goal in the face of political gamesmanship, we who stand here today \nmay never get that other chance.\n  We came here to make this country a better place. I believe every \nperson who serves here believes they came to the Senate to make our \ncountry a stronger and a better place. We have before us a\n\n[[Page S13610]]\n\nbill that saves lives, lowers costs, and frees tens of millions of our \nfellow Americans from the fear that grips them, as I address this \nChamber on this evening. Let's do our jobs. Let's pass this bill. Let's \nmake America stronger and a better place because this Congress and this \nadministration rose to the challenge to grapple with a magnificent \nissue that deserves our attention and our support.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me first acknowledge the Senator from \nConnecticut, who played a critical role in not only the inspiration but \nthe preparation of this important landmark legislation. Senator Dodd \nhas been given some tough assignments in his career. He has been handed \nsome of the toughest, and this was one. His Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee met, I understand, 54 hours, if I am not \nmistaken. I think that is what he said earlier on the floor. It \nconsidered hundreds of amendments with the notion that we could create \na better, more effective health care system in America. I have yet to \nhear anyone criticize his chairing that committee. He was evenhanded \nand fair. He entertained and accepted some 150 or 160 Republican \namendments to this bill in an effort to try to build some bipartisan \nsupport for it. He went the extra mile with extra hearings. His \ncommittee was weary at the end, but he proved that his experience in \nthe Senate had taught him valuable lessons about what it took to be \nrespectful to the other side of an issue. He was not rewarded with a \nfinal vote in committee. Not a single Republican Senator would vote for \nthe bill. It was not for any lack of effort on the part of Senator \nDodd.\n  When this bill passes--and this bill will pass--he deserves special \ncredit for it, and I am going to be one of the first to applaud him. He \nincluded a provision in this bill near and dear to me on congenital \nheart research that will save lives and will spare suffering to \nfamilies across America. I will forever be indebted to him for it.\n  In just 4 hours, in the early morning hours of Monday, December 21, \n2009, one of the most significant votes in the history of the Senate \nwill take place. It is hard for us in the midst of this debate, after \nall that has come before us and all that is likely to follow, to \nproperly put this in historical context. For those of us who were \nhonored by the people of our State to be here at this moment in \nhistory, it is humbling to know we will be called on to cast a vote \nthat can change a nation.\n  It has happened here before but only rarely. It happened 75 years ago \nwhen other Senators, in a much different era, battling through the \nworst depression in our Nation's modern history, were called on by a \nPresident in a wheelchair to rally and stand for the elderly of \nAmerica. He asked to create Social Security, an insurance plan \nprimarily for widows. President Franklin Roosevelt came to this Senate \nin this Chamber asking each and every one of the Senators to be mindful \nof the plight of our parents and grandparents in that time.\n  I can recall, in my family, it was not uncommon for grandparents to \nend up living in the same home as their children because after they \nreached the point where they could no longer work for a variety of \nreasons--physical, retirement, whatever it happened to be--their \nsavings were meager and the chance of living independently was limited. \nSo their children took them in in that spare bedroom, made them part of \nthe family and welcomed, but understood that was the only way mom and \ndad were going to have the dignity they deserved in life.\n  Franklin Roosevelt had a different vision. He thought if workers \nthroughout their worklife paid a little bit of money each week into a \nfund, they could be ensured there would be a check waiting for them at \nretirement that would allow them independence and dignity. He \nprevailed, and Senators stood up in that era of the 1930s and gave him \nthe votes that were needed to change our Nation when it came to the way \nwe treat the elderly.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle--Republicans--were skeptical. \nThey were fearful of government; fearful of a new program. They argued \nwe were headed down a path we would regret--echoes of many arguments we \nare hearing today in opposition to health care reform. When their time \ncame later, even as recently as a few years ago, they tried to \ndramatically change and rewrite the Social Security Program. They \ncalled for privatizing it, saying we would be much better off if the \nSocial Security trust fund were actually in the stock market. Thank \ngoodness the wisdom of America rejected that idea. Within months of the \nsuggestion, it was proven to be totally false, as life savings were \nlost with the recession that we now are enduring.\n  It is an indication of the bravery of a President, the courage of a \nSenate, and the fact that they rejected the pleas of those who would \nsay: ``Do nothing. Don't touch it. Leave that problem alone.''\n  It was about 45 years ago when another great President had another \ngreat idea, and that idea was to create Medicare, and with the creation \nof Medicare to say to those same elderly: It isn't enough to give you a \ncheck to get by each month. We want to make sure you have access to \ndoctors and hospitals when you need it. Lyndon Baines Johnson, the \nmaster of the Senate, then President, managed to engineer the passage \nof that legislation against critics who once again said: It is too much \ngovernment. It is a program that will cost too much money. It is not \nneeded. We shouldn't do it.\n  Their counsel was rejected. Medicare was created. It wasn't the \nMedicare we know today. It didn't reach the disabled. It didn't provide \nsome of the basic services that many seniors now desperately need, and \nit didn't cover prescription drugs, but it was a start. It was a \ncritical decision made to move forward. The same Republican Party that \nobjected to the creation of Medicare has been critical of the program \never since. They have argued that it is wasteful, that it is doomed, \nthat it should be allowed to wither on the vine. That was actually a \nquote from a leading Republican not that long ago.\n  They suggested there was a better way--let's privatize Medicare. They \nlove the notion of privatizing. Get government out of the picture. They \ncame up with this theory, with the health insurance industry, of \nsomething called Medicare Advantage. This was where those flinty-eyed \nentrepreneurs would teach government a lesson. They would offer the \nbenefits of Medicare and show how to do it at a lower cost. Well, we \naccepted their challenge and gave them their opportunity, and what we \nfound was: They failed. Oh, some succeeded, but by and large when the \nfinal count took place, those private insurance companies couldn't help \nbut have the urge to maximize profits at the expense of Medicare. So \nnow we spend about $17 billion a year out of Medicare subsidizing \nprivate health insurance under the so-called Medicare Advantage \nProgram. The experiment has failed.\n  The basic idea of Medicare was proven right. It gave to our seniors \nsomething that we had promised and hoped we could deliver--longer \nhealthier lives. It also triggered the creation of a medical health \nestablishment across America--the building of hospitals and medical \nschools and more medical professionals than our Nation had ever seen--\nbecause of Medicare, because of a President, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and \nhis courage, and because of a Senate that could rise to the challenge \nof passing it, despite the critics.\n  Well, in the early hours of Monday, December 21, 2009, our generation \nof the United States Senate will face our rendezvous with destiny, our \nopportunity to change this Nation, to make such a significant change in \nthe way health care is delivered in America that we can say to future \ngenerations: We had our moment, and we seized it. To think that we \nwill--with the passage of this bill in perhaps just a few days in the \nSenate, and a few weeks on Capitol Hill--enlarge the percentage of \nAmericans with the security of health insurance from 83 percent to 94 \npercent--the highest percentage of Americans ever insured in the \nhistory of our Nation. Of 50 million uninsured Americans today, 30 \nmillion of those people will finally be able to rest at night knowing \nthey are covered; that they have health insurance.\n  It will be Judy, a worker in Marion, IL, at a hotel, making $8 an \nhour, working 30 hours a week, $12,000 in annual wages. She is a \ndiabetic. She has\n\n[[Page S13611]]\n\nnever had health insurance in her life. She goes to work every day. She \nis 60 years old. She will have health insurance because of this bill. \nShe will be covered by Medicaid, and she won't have to pay for it \nbecause Judy's wages are at the low end of workers in America.\n  I said to her: If you had health insurance, Judy, what would you do?\n  She said: Senator, I have a few lumps I have been worried about a \nlong time, and I can't afford to go to the doctor. I would go to the \ndoctor.\n  Thank God she can. Thank God for a lot of others--those who have lost \ntheir jobs, who are unemployed, who have exhausted their savings, who \nstand to lose their homes--who will at least have the peace of mind \nthey will have health insurance. That is going to come too.\n  If you have a child with a health problem, as many people do, \nsomething they call a preexisting condition, this bill will tell the \nhealth insurance companies immediately: You can no longer discriminate \nagainst that child. You can't turn down the family or that child for \ncoverage. As someone who has been through that experience, I can't tell \nyou what that means, to know that you have that kind of coverage; that \nyour child, with that health care challenge, can go to the doctor they \nneed to see and the hospital they need to be in.\n  When my wife and I were first married and had our first baby, I was \nin law school, and we had no health insurance. When our baby had a \nproblem, I had to go to Children's Hospital here in Washington and sit \nin a room filled with people who had no health insurance. I took a \nnumber, and we waited for a doctor. Every time we went, it was a \ndifferent one. I felt like I had let my family down. At a time when my \nfamily needed health insurance, I had not delivered. I know that \nfeeling personally, and I know what it must mean to 50 million \nAmericans who face it today. For 30 million of those Americans, this \nbill will give them the peace of mind that they have health insurance.\n  It also says to companies across America, we are going to change the \nterms of this relationship between health insurance companies and the \npeople they insure. We are going to finally step in on the side of the \nconsumers of America--the families of America, the ones that are so \noften turned down because of preexisting conditions, turned down \nbecause companies canceled their insurance when they started running \ninto high medical bills. For the first time, these people will have \nlegal rights created by this bill to stand up and be covered and to be \nconfident at the end of the day that they will have the coverage they \npaid for their whole life.\n  It is an amazing thing we are considering. In the middle of it, with \nall these speeches and all the press releases and all the charts and \nall the time, it is sometimes difficult to focus on the historical \nimpact of what we are about to do at 1 a.m. on December 21, 2009. But \nif we do this, and do it right; if 60 Senators step forward, as I think \nthey will--commitments have been made--we will make history. It will be \nreported across America that for the first time in memory, the United \nStates Senate has voted for comprehensive health care reform.\n  The critics will still be there, and they will say the same thing \nthey did about Social Security and the same thing they did about \nMedicare: It is too much government. It is not going to work. We \nshouldn't do it.\n\n  Thank God, that counsel was rejected in the 1930s and the 1960s, and \nit should be rejected on December 21, 2009. We need to stand together \nfor people who otherwise have no voice--the uninsured, many of whom \nhave low-wage jobs, or maybe no jobs at all, and their children, who \nreally can't afford the best lobbyist in Washington. It is time for us \nto lobby for them.\n  I know there are a lot of critics of this plan. We have heard them. \nThey have talked about Medicare and what this will do to this bill. But \nwe know what the professionals have told us. This comprehensive health \ncare reform legislation will add 9 or 10 years of solvency to Medicare, \nput Medicare on sound financial footing. And that is exactly what we \nshould do.\n  The bill has a bonus. The bonus is that, at a time when we are facing \ndeficits and debt, which have to be taken seriously, this bill charts a \npath for us to start retiring that debt. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says that over the first 10 years, $130 billion in debt will be \nrelieved by this bill; then in the second decade of this bill's \nexistence and changes, we are going to find up to $1.3 trillion in \ndeficit reduction.\n  There has never been a bill considered on the floor of the Senate \nthat has had that kind of impact on our Nation's debt. It is going to \nchange life not only for uninsured families but even those with \ninsurance. For some, it will give the luxury that we have as Members of \nCongress.\n  I think we are the luckiest people on Earth when it comes to health \ninsurance. We team up with 8 million Federal employees and their \nfamilies, and each year we have an open enrollment. If we don't like \nthe way we are treated by our health insurance company in the previous \nyear, we can go shopping, just like you would shop for a car or a \nrefrigerator, and pick the right one for your family. We pick the right \nhealth insurance for our families. Every American should have that \nluxury, and we move toward creating that in this legislation.\n  It was several years ago that I teamed up with Senator Blanche \nLincoln of Arkansas and Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine. We tried to \ncreate a program for small businesses in America called the SHOP Act. \nThis program would give those small businesses the same shopping \nopportunities for health insurance as Members of Congress and Federal \nemployees. I came up with an unlikely ally in the National Federation \nof Independent Businesses. They decided they wanted to join us.\n  When their lobbyist called and said he wanted to meet with me, I \nsaid: I can't wait to meet you. His organization had done everything in \ntheir power to defeat me in every election I had been in, and I wanted \nto see what he looked like.\n  He came in and sat down and said: We have to do something about \nhealth insurance for small business. We ended up creating an unlikely \nbut powerful alliance of the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, the realtors, the Service Employees International Union, \nFamilies USA--from both sides of the political spectrum--standing \nbehind the SHOP bill.\n  The SHOP bill, with some changes, is now part of health care reform. \nIt is an idea that has been endorsed, and it is one that I think is \ngoing to make a big difference for individuals. The bill also contains \nhelp for small businesses to pay for the premiums. Critics on the other \nside of the aisle say: Oh, the taxes go up, but the benefits don't \nstart for years. They have missed it because initially we are going to \nbe offering tax assistance to small businesses with 50 employees or \nfewer. Those who have an average payroll of $50,000 a worker are going \nto get a helping hand to buy health insurance not only for their \nworkers but for the owner of the company.\n  I have seen this in my own life. I have friends who run a small \nbusiness who have lost their health insurance because one employee's \nwife had a very sick baby. That is exactly what happened to my friend. \nThey went out shopping for insurance on the open market and it was \nbrutal. My friends were in their early sixties, and they couldn't buy \ninsurance. Everything they could buy was loaded with exclusions and \ndeductibles and copays.\n  Well, we are going to make sure that businesses have a helping hand \nwith a tax credit, and that helping hand is going to allow them to buy \ngood insurance that covers their employees.\n  Those on the other side talk about the tax increases in this bill. \nLet's be very blunt what they are. There is a .9 percent payroll tax \nincrease for individuals making over $200,000 a year and families \nmaking over $250,000 a year. What it means is this: Roughly $2,000 a \nyear for families making over $250,000 will have to be paid to make \nsure that Medicare is solvent and that this program is funded. That may \naffect some Members of Congress, with their spouses working. But I \ndon't think it is unfair. It is a tax we should be willing to pay to \nsolve major problems in this country.\n  There will be taxes on high-end health insurance policies, and it is \na very controversial provision with some of my friends in organized \nlabor. But I\n\n[[Page S13612]]\n\nhope we have hit the right number of $23,000 and I hope our escalator \nclause to try to keep up with inflation is a reasonable one. If it is \nnot, we will revisit it. The only law ever written that didn't need \namendment might have been the Ten Commandments, and I don't think this \nbill, as good as it is, will rise to that level. We are prepared to \nreturn to it if we need to, to make sure it works and works well, and \nwe have the time to do that.\n\n  This is critical. I also know this bill is going to change--you will \nbe able to see the change across America with the construction of \ncommunity health clinics. One of our great Senators here, Bernie \nSanders of Vermont, has been a clarion voice on behalf of community \nhealth clinics. He knows, as we all do, that these clinics, placed in \ncities and towns across America, are a lifeline to low-income people so \nthat they have primary care at a fraction of the cost of a visit to an \nemergency room--good care. I have seen it. I have visited the Erie \nClinic in Chicago, Alia Clinic in Chicago. These are good, clean, \nmodern clinics, with people dedicated to health care and dentistry who \nare helping these people.\n  We envision 10,000 more community health clinics as a result of this \nbill, at least, and thousands of primary care physicians to be there to \nhelp. That will mean we will be creating, across America, a network of \ncare and peace of mind for people who otherwise have few places, if \nany, to turn.\n  I think the day will come soon when this bill, after it is passed, \nwill become evident to America in terms of what we set out to do and \nwhat we achieved. If history serves, as it has in the past, many of \ntoday's critics will not dwell on the fact that they voted no, but \nrather say I had some problems with it. I guess it worked out OK. They \nmay be afraid to acknowledge that now. I think ultimately they will \nhave to.\n  This is clearly an idea whose time has come, and it has come because \nwe have a President with the courage, the political courage, to step up \nand make sure that we not back away. As Franklin Roosevelt did in \nSocial Security, as Lyndon Johnson did with Medicare, Barack Obama, \nwith health care reform, has challenged this Congress not to ignore a \nproblem that has haunted the Presidencies of seven great men who have \npreviously served in that office.\n  We need to do our historic duty in the early morning hours so that \nAmericans across this Nation can wake up to the stories on the news \nthat, finally, hope is on the way.\n  I said the other night when I was talking about this--Senator Dodd \nput Vicki Kennedy's Washington Post column in the Record, and I am glad \nhe did so--that this has been called many things. It has an official \nname. I am going to call it ``Kennedy Care.'' I hope some others will \ntoo, because we do it because of the inspiration of a great friend, a \ngreat Senator, and a great statesman, Edward Kennedy, who I am sorry \ncannot be here to enjoy this historic moment. But he led us to this \nmoment. As he said in one of his last columns he wrote about health \ncare: We are almost there. In four hours, we will be there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I commend Senator Durbin for his \ngreat leadership--he is our assistant majority leader--and for all of \nhis handiwork on this bill. He has been one of our strongest proponents \nfor making coverage more affordable for small businesses. He just spoke \nabout that.\n  In fact, under the managers' amendment, we have expanded, even more \nthan what we did in the original bill, credits for small businesses. \nThese credits now start in 2010. They start next year. They are \navailable to more small business firms than we had in the original \nbill--all of that, thanks to the hard work and intervention by Senator \nDurbin.\n  I might note we have a provision also in the managers' amendment \nrelating to cardiac care, congenital heart disease. I know Senator \nDurbin had a personal tragedy in his own family because of that. So we \nnow have a new program to track the epidemiology of congenital heart \ndisease; it is section 10411, in case anyone is taking notes. It \nexpands on research at NIH on congenital heart disease. We are grateful \nto Senator Durbin for including that.\n  Basically, of all the things we have for consumer protection, \nconsumers of America have no more dogged champion here in the Congress \nthan Senator Durbin of Illinois. No matter what it is we are passing \nhere, Senator Durbin always looks to see how consumers are affected. He \nhas done that also on this health care bill, by making sure that \nconsumers have better protections and health care is more affordable. I \npersonally thank Senator Durbin for all of his hard work on this bill.\n  As Senator Durbin said, and as our leader, Senator Dodd, said, in \nabout 4 hours--a little less than 4 hours now--the historic vote will \ntake place in the Senate. It will be the defining vote of my Senate \ncareer. That has been about 25 years, I guess, I have been here. It \nwill probably be the defining vote for all of us during our tenure here \nin the Senate. It will be the cloture vote on the managers' package. \nFrom that we move forward.\n  I hope after that cloture vote, and after we take that cloture vote, \nthe minority side would see fit, then, since we have the 60 votes, \nafter we have crossed that hurdle, that perhaps they would be willing \nto close up the debate a little bit sooner than ending on Christmas \nEve. But if that is their desire--I mean, they have the rules. We will \nabide by the rules. If the Republicans want to exercise every single \nright they have under the rules, they can keep us here until Christmas \nEve. There is no doubt about it. But to what end, I ask? To what end?\n  We are going to have the vote at 1 o'clock that is going to require \nthe 60 votes. Then why stay here until Christmas Eve to do what they \nknow we are going to do, and that is to have the 60 votes on the \nmanagers' amendment, on the substitute, and on the underlying bill? I \nhope our Republican leader and others on the other side would perhaps \nsee that it is not in the best interest of the Chamber, it is not in \nthe best interests of the country.\n  I know one of the Senators on the other side was talking about waste \ntoday. I am thinking, you know, this is kind of a waste, that we are \nhere yakking about this and doing it up until Christmas Eve, when we \ncould collapse all these votes and get it done tomorrow. We could \nactually be done here tomorrow with this whole bill if the Republicans \nwould see fit. Like I say, it is up to them. They can keep us here if \nthey want to. But the managers' amendment we are going to vote on at 1 \no'clock--again, I keep hearing all day today from the Republicans that \nthey have not had a chance to read it, we are rushing it, and it just \ncame out the other day. The Republicans had it read word for word. The \nfew times I came on the floor during the reading, I didn't see many \nRepublicans over there listening to it. You have to wonder, did they \nall go home and read it? They made the clerk read it. Why didn't they \nsit here and listen to it? They would have found out what was in it if \nthey were so interested.\n  Anyway, this is all gamesmanship around here right now. People of \nAmerica understand that, too. They know we are going to pass health \nreform, and the first vote is going to be at 1 a.m. this morning. I \nheard the Senator from Arizona earlier today talking about why should \nwe have it at 1? Why can't we have it at 9 a.m. in the morning? He said \nthe majority leader, Senator Reid, has the power. He could move it to 9 \na.m. in the morning and we would not have to bring people here at 1 \na.m. He referred to the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, by \nname--elderly, frail, but he shows up here to vote. But dragging him \nout of bed at 1 in the morning to come here? He said, Why don't we do \nit at 9 in the morning?\n  I thought that was a pretty good idea. When I got to the floor a \ncouple of hours ago, I asked unanimous consent at that time that we \nhave the vote at 9 a.m. but that the hours from 1 to 9 be counted for \npurposes of the 30 hours. The Republicans objected. So much for their \nconcern for the Senator from West Virginia.\n  We are on the cusp. We are going to expand small business credits. We \nare going to reduce administrative costs. We are requiring insurance \ncompanies to spend 80 to 85 percent of their income on health care--on \nhealth care, not fancy corporate offices, not high, expensive CEO \nsalaries of millions of dollars a year, not fancy jets, but 80 to\n\n[[Page S13613]]\n\n85 percent must be spent on health care and paying medical claims.\n  As Senator Durbin said, we make major investments in community health \ncenters--10,000 more community health centers in America. We are \ninvesting in the National Health Service Corps to get more young people \nto serve in the National Health Service Corps. We have new protections \nfor patients, access to a primary care provider of their choice, and an \nimportant provision championed by the Senator from Maryland--I think \nSenator Cardin--to provide access for women in their choice of an OB-\nGYN. In other words, they get to pick who their OB-GYN is, not their \nprimary care provider, not the health insurance company, not anyone \nelse. The individual woman can pick her own OB-GYN.\n  The amendment we have before us immediately allows children to stay \non their parents' health insurance until they are age 26. The managers' \namendment also prohibits insurance companies from imposing preexisting \nconditions on children up through the age of 18 right away, next year. \nThink about that. Think about what that means to a family who has a \nchild who maybe was born with a defect--something that is chronic. The \ninsurance companies tend to exclude them. Our bill says that beginning \nnext year they cannot do that anymore to children. That is a big deal \nfor so many families in this country who have kids who have been \nafflicted with a birth defect or maybe something happened, maybe they \nhad an accident, maybe they had an illness early in life that has \nturned chronic. This is a very big deal for those families.\n  Last, for someone like me who represents a lot of rural areas and \nsmall towns, we have increased, in the managers' amendment, more \nworkforce. We are going to have more people for rural and underserved \ncommunities. We will increase the funding in the training programs for \nrural health providers, so small towns and rural areas of the country \nhave a big boost in the managers' amendment.\n  We are going to put more money and more loan repayments for people \nwho want to serve in underserved areas, in rural areas, to make sure \nthey do not have to go someplace where they get a lot of money to pay \nback their debts for medical school. We are going to be providing some \nof those payments if they serve in a rural area, an underserved area.\n  I know we have now another hour to listen to the Republicans tell us \nwhy we ought to put this off for another century or so, I suppose. The \npeople of America know the time has come now. We are committed to this. \nAt 1 a.m., we will have the 60 votes, and we will get this passed \nbefore Christmas. It will be one of the best Christmas presents this \nCongress has ever given the American people.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the reason I wasn't on the floor for a large \npart of yesterday is I was wading through this amendment and also the \nCBO score and also the Joint Tax score. Then I had to talk to experts \nwho could interpret what is in there. The American people don't have \nthat privilege. They have to rely on the stuff they are hearing on the \nfloor. I can tell you, they are pretty upset. I get letters and calls \nfrom all over the country saying: Stop this bill any way you can. Make \nthem get it right. I have to tell you, some of those from other States, \nthey are saying: My Senator is not listening to me. I am counting on \nyou.\n  I rise to speak on the issue of the health care reform. I rise with a \ngreat sense of disappointment as I reflect on the debate that might \nhave been. From the very start, I have said we need to reform our \nhealth care system. Everyone agrees we need real changes that will \nallow every American to purchase high-quality, affordable health \ninsurance. Not a single one of my Senate colleagues on either side of \nthe aisle supports the status quo. The argument that Republicans \nsupport the status quo is simply false. We understand the current \nsystem fails too many Americans. We want to support reforms that will \nprovide real insurance options to all Americans and help lower the cost \nof that insurance. I have said from the start of this year--and, \nfrankly, throughout my 13 years in the Senate--that true reform should \nbe developed on a bipartisan basis so the legislation will incorporate \nthe best ideas from both sides and will have the broad support of the \nAmerican people. That should be a prerequisite to any proposal that \nwill affect nearly 20 percent of our Nation's economy and the health \ncare of every single American.\n  Unfortunately, that was not the process followed in developing this \nbill. Instead, we have the Reid bill, which was developed in secret \nwithout the input of a single Republican. This morning an adviser to \nPresident Obama was asked about the partisan nature of this bill and \nthe overwhelming opposition of the American people. His response spoke \nvolumes of what is wrong with Washington today. He essentially \nresponded that the American people don't understand what is in this \nbill and that once it is implemented, they will come to support it. In \nplain English, the White House is saying: Washington knows best. That \nattitude is part of the reason why support for Congress is at a \nhistoric low and why public support for this bill is so weak.\n  Instead of having a bill that will provide greater choices and reduce \ncosts, we have a bill that will do the opposite. The Reid bill will \ndeny consumers the ability to make choices and instead substitute the \njudgment of government bureaucrats who will decide what kinds of \ninsurance you will be allowed to purchase. The bill also fails to \naddress the most important issue for the majority of Americans. It \nfails to do anything to help reduce the cost of health care. President \nObama promised the American people that health care reform would reduce \nhealth care costs. Yet this bill fails to deliver on the President's \npromise.\n  According to the President's own independent Medicare Actuary, this \nbill will actually increase how much we spend on health care. According \nto Rick Foster, the person from the administration who keeps track of \nall Medicare and Medicaid spending, the bill increases health care \ncosts $234 billion more than if we did nothing. That is a huge cost.\n  In addition to increasing total costs, the Reid bill will increase \nour national debt and threaten the health care provided to millions of \nMedicare beneficiaries. Some of my Democratic colleagues are going to \ncome down to the floor and argue that the Reid bill will reduce the \ndeficit and extend the solvency of the Medicare Program. They have been \ndoing that for days. They will even cite the Congressional Budget \nOffice to support their arguments. I hope every American hears those \narguments and remembers a few inconvenient truths my Democratic \ncolleagues are going to forget to mention. The way my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle were able to force CBO to conclude that the \nReid bill will not increase the deficit was by requiring them to use \nbudget gimmicks and assumptions that would make Bernie Madoff blush.\n  Every time you hear one of my Democratic colleagues argue that the \nbill reduces the deficit, you should ask that Senator if he believes \nthat Medicare will cut physician payments by 21 percent in March. That \nis right. While the Reid bill cuts over $470 billion from the Medicare \nProgram, it will also require that every doctor treating Medicare \npatients have his or her payments cut by 21 percent in just 2 months. \nThat is what CBO had to assume when they did their estimate. If you \nbelieve Congress will never allow this to happen--and we never have--\nyou cannot believe this bill will actually reduce the deficit. The \ntruth is Congress has never allowed that level of cut. Senate \nDemocrats, however, chose to ignore this reality and relied on the \npromise of a cut to make their bill add up. You should also ask my \nDemocratic colleagues if they believe that Medicare payments to doctors \nwill be cut more than 45 percent over the next decade.\n  Again, that is what the Reid bill required CBO to assume. If you \ndon't think that will happen, then you cannot believe this bill reduces \nthe deficit.\n  You should also ask my Democratic colleagues if they think that \nwithin a decade one out of every five hospitals, nursing homes, and \nhome health agencies will be operating at a loss because of the \nunsustainable payment cuts in this bill. We just got a revised CBO \nestimate that says there was a little error there, and so there will be \nless savings by $600 billion. According to\n\n[[Page S13614]]\n\nthe administration's Actuary, Rick Foster, that is exactly what is \ngoing to happen if the Reid bill is enacted. He said if these policies \nhave to be modified, such changes would likely result in smaller actual \nsavings. This means this bill will not reduce the deficit.\n  Finally, you should ask anyone arguing that this bill reduces the \ndeficit whether they believe Medicare patients will not be able to get \nthe care they need. Again, the administration's own Actuary says \npayment cuts in the Reid bill could jeopardize access to care for \nbeneficiaries. I do not know if my colleagues believe these things will \nhappen. Taking note of these facts pushes up the total cost of the bill \nwell over $1 trillion and destroys any pretense of budget balance. \nUnless all the things CBO was required to assume actually happen, this \nbill will actually increase the deficit.\n  Health care reform has to be truly paid for. Why? Because the Federal \nGovernment has maxed out its credit cards. Our out-of-control spending \nis now even driving down the value of our money. As the government \nborrows more money to finance even more spending, the devalued dollar \nwill drive up the cost of goods. Oil is a good example. Take a country \nsuch as Saudi Arabia, which is already raising prices for their oil to \ncompensate for the lower value of our dollars. This means every \nAmerican will end up paying more for a gallon of gas because of our \nfailure to address growing deficits. If we are going to enact real \nhealth reform, we need to use honest accounting and not budget gimmicks \nand fake assumptions that we all know will not happen.\n  We should pay for expenses such as fixing doctors' Medicare payments, \nand we should not delay the start of spending 4 years after the start \nof the new taxes just to make the bill look good over 10 years.\n  The problem for the President and my Democratic colleagues is their \nbill is being sold on the strength of accounting tricks that make it \nappear that it will not add to the deficit. In case they have not \nnoticed, they are not fooling the American people. It showed up in \nAugust. It showed up every time since then. That is why we are not \ngetting to go home on weekends. We don't want the Democrats to hear \nfrom the people at home who are upset about this.\n  In a recent poll, 68 percent of Americans said they believe the \nDemocrats' health reform bill will increase the deficit. They are \nright. The American people understand that if the Reid bill is enacted, \ndeficits will increase. They are right. The same is true for the claims \nthat the Reid bill will extend the solvency of the Medicare Program or \nreduce beneficiary premiums. That can only happen if you make all the \nassumptions I previously described. If you don't believe those things \nwill actually happen, then this bill will do nothing to extend Medicare \nor lower premiums.\n\n  Besides driving up the deficit, the Reid bill will also eliminate \nmore than 1 million jobs. The mandate that employers offer health \ninsurance or pay a penalty will be a massive new job-killing tax. Our \nnational unemployment rate is at 10 percent. The majority leader is \nattempting to cut off debate on a bill and force its passage before \nChristmas, again, because he doesn't want the people to hear what is \nhappening, but we are going to see that that does happen--that will \nforce employers to eliminate jobs and reduce wages. Businesses do not \ndeny health care to their employees because they are cruel or mean-\nspirited. They do it because they can't afford it.\n  Most businesses that do not provide coverage do so because they \ncannot afford health insurance. They can't afford it for their \nemployees or for their own families. They have looked at the cost and \nfigured out they cannot pay for health care and still stay in business. \nThe Reid bill fails to do anything to actually lower the cost of health \ninsurance, which might mean these businesses could actually afford \nhealth insurance. Instead, it will place a new tax on these businesses, \nwhich the CBO has said will lead to these businesses reducing wages for \ntheir workers and eliminating jobs. That is why the National Federation \nof Independent Business, which represents small business across \nAmerica, estimated the Reid bill would cause 1.6 million jobs to be \neliminated. That is why they said the Reid bill will create a reality \nthat is worse than the status quo for small business.\n  The worst thing about the Reid bill is not how it will increase the \ndeficit or kill 1 million American jobs. The worst thing about the Reid \nbill is it will reduce the quality of health care we all receive. No \nlonger will you and your employer be able to choose the health \ninsurance that best meets your needs. The government will tell you what \nkind of insurance you have to buy, and if you don't, you are told the \ngovernment will place a fine on you. Under the Reid bill, the \ngovernment will tell your health plan which types of doctors they have \nto contract with, irrespective of whether that is a doctor you want or \nneed to see. The Reid bill also traps 15 million Americans in the worst \nhealth care program in America. Approximately half the people who get \nthe promised health care coverage under the Reid bill will get it \nthrough the broken Medicaid Program.\n  States already use price fixing to limit how much they have to pay \ndoctors under the Medicaid Program. That is why as many as 40 percent \nof all doctors will not see Medicaid patients. I have said, if you \ncan't see a doctor, you don't have health care. Yet that is exactly \nwhat the Reid bill will do: Promise 15 million people coverage but trap \nthem in a system where we know they will not be able to get the care \nthey need.\n  If anyone doubts what effect the Reid bill will have, they only need \nto look at Massachusetts. The Massachusetts plan was the model for many \nof the reforms in this bill. The problems they are encountering give us \na good indication of what will happen to us all if the Reid bill is \nenacted.\n  To make the Massachusetts reforms work, they now have a 10-member \ncommission trying to impose a global payment system. Under this system, \ndoctors and hospitals will be forced to join large networks and be paid \nat a set rate for each patient. This is the same kind of government \ncontrol we already see with Medicaid. The results of these changes are \nequally predictable. Fewer doctors will be willing to see people at the \nexact time when the number of people seeking care is increasing.\n  These are just some of the more serious problems with this bill. \nBecause many of my colleagues want to be able to discuss the problems \nwith this bill, I have limited my remarks for now. Because the bill was \ndrafted behind closed doors and thrust upon the American people without \ntime to consider all the ramifications, I am sure we will find more \nproblems with the legislation after this rushed vote.\n  Over the next few days, I plan to lay out specific and concrete \nalternatives to how we could do better. I have been doing that for a \nlong time, but they have not been accepted. Republicans have many ideas \non how to make this bill better, including several that have bipartisan \nsupport. However, if Senator Reid is successful in cutting off debate, \nwe will never get the chance to discuss any of these ideas.\n  Health care reform is too important for too many Americans to be \nrammed through the Senate with little or no debate on the weekend \nbefore Christmas. It appears my colleagues understand how deeply \nunpopular this bill is with the American people, and they want to force \nit through when they believe most Americans are not paying attention. I \nwish to assure my Democratic colleagues that the American people are \nwatching, and the voices of August will only grow louder. They will \nremember the vote to cut off debate on this bill for a long time \nbecause they understand what it will mean for their health care and the \nfuture of this country. The person with whom I served in the Wyoming \nLegislature sent me a little note and said: If it is broken, don't \nbreak it more. That is what we are doing.\n  I have some articles I wish to include in the Record. One is by \nHoward Dean that suggests this reform falls short. Of course, he is the \nformer chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Another is an \neditorial by Matthew Dowd, a political analyst for ABC News, who talks \nabout the danger of success and where the polls are on this and says:\n\n       If this legislation passes, Democrats will be held \n     accountable for any failures or problems in the system. So if \n     any Americans' insurance premiums rise, they will blame the \n     Democrats. If patients have to wait in line at\n\n[[Page S13615]]\n\n     emergency rooms, it will be seen as the Democrats' fault. If \n     health care costs don't drop, the Democrats will face the \n     wrath of the electorate.\n\n  I also have an editorial by E.J. Dionne, Jr., about Democratic \nfratricide and an article by George Will, where he says ``More talk, \nless support.'' The more we talk, the less support there is for this \nbill.\n  Finally, I have an editorial by David Broder, of December 18, 2009.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these articles printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 17, 2009]\n\n                        Reform That Falls Short\n\n                            (By Howard Dean)\n\n       If I were a senator, I would not vote for the current \n     health-care bill. Any measure that expands private insurers' \n     monopoly over health care and transfers millions of taxpayer \n     dollars to private corporations is not real health-care \n     reform. Real reform would insert competition into insurance \n     markets, force insurers to cut unnecessary administrative \n     expenses and spend health-care dollars caring for people. \n     Real reform would significantly lower costs, improve the \n     delivery of health care and give all Americans a meaningful \n     choice of coverage. The current Senate bill accomplishes none \n     of these.\n       Real health-care reform is supposed to eliminate \n     discrimination based on preexisting conditions. But the \n     legislation allows insurance companies to charge older \n     Americans up to three times as much as younger Americans, \n     pricing them out of coverage. The bill was supposed to give \n     Americans choices about what kind of system they wanted to \n     enroll in. Instead, it fines Americans if they do not sign up \n     with an insurance company, which may take up to 30 percent of \n     your premium dollars an spend it on CEO salaries--in the \n     range of $20 million a year--and on return on equity for the \n     company's shareholders. Few Americans will see any benefit \n     until 2014, by which time premiums are likely to have \n     doubled. In short, the winners in this bill are insurance \n     companies; the American taxpayer is about to be fleeced with \n     a bailout in a situation that dwarfs even what happened at \n     AIG.\n       From the very beginning of this debate, progressives have \n     argued that a public option or a Medicare buy-in would \n     restore competition and hold the private health insurance \n     industry accountable. Progressives understood that a public \n     plan would give Americans real choices about what kind of \n     system they wanted to be in and how they wanted to spend \n     their money. Yet Washington has decided, once again, that the \n     American people cannot be trusted to choose for themselves. \n     Your money goes to insurers, whether or not you want it to.\n       To be clear, I'm not giving up on health-care reform. The \n     legislation does have some good points, such as expanding \n     Medicaid and permanently increasing the federal government's \n     contribution to it. It invests critical dollars in public \n     health, wellness and prevention programs; extends the life of \n     the Medicare trust fund; and allows young Americans to stay \n     on their parents' health-care plans until they turn 27. Small \n     businesses struggling with rising healthcare costs will \n     receive a tax credit, and primary-care physicians will see \n     increases in their Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n       Improvements can still be made in the Senate, and I hope \n     that Senate Democrats will work on this bill as it moves to \n     conference. If lawmakers are interested in ensuring that \n     government affordability credits are spent on health-care \n     benefits rather than insurers' salaries, they need to require \n     state-based exchanges, which act as prudent purchasers and \n     select only the most efficient insurers. Sen. John Kerry (D-\n     Mass.) offered this amendment during the Finance Committee \n     markup, and Democrats should include it in the final \n     legislation. A stripped-down version of the current bill that \n     included these provisions would be worth passing.\n       In Washington, when major bills ear final passage, an \n     inside-the-Beltway mentality takes hold. Any bill becomes a \n     victory. Clear thinking is thrown out the window for \n     political calculus. In the heat of battle, decisions are \n     being made that set an irreversible course for how future \n     health reform is done. The result is legislation that has \n     been crafted to votes, not to reform health care.\n       I have worked for health-care reform all my political life. \n     In my home state of Vermont, we have accomplished universal \n     health care for children younger than 18 and real insurance \n     reform--which not only bans discrimination against \n     preexisting conditions but also prevents insurers from \n     charging outrageous sums for policies as away of keeping out \n     high-risk people. I know health reform when I see it, and \n     there isn't much left in the Senate bill. I reluctantly \n     conclude that, as it stands, this bill would do more harm \n     than good to the future of America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         The Danger of Success\n\n                           (By Matthew Dowd)\n\n       President Obama needs an exit strategy. I am not referring \n     to Afghanistan or Iraq (though there are quite a few \n     similarities be- tween the situation Obama is in on health-\n     care reform and the political difficulties President George \n     W. Bush faced on Iraq). Congressional Democrats and Obama are \n     headed toward a ``catastrophic success'' politically if they \n     pass health-care reform in its current legislative form. And \n     catastrophic success was a term then-President Bush used on \n     Iraq when he acknowledged the great initial victory but \n     didn't take into account the long-term calamity and costs.\n       I am not seeking to argue the substance of health care and \n     the merits or demerits of the bills, and will leave that to \n     experts in policy and its effects. I am talking about the \n     politics of the legislation and the effect it is likely to \n     have on Obama and Democrats in Congress.\n       Unlike many other pundits and political experts in both \n     parties, I think that passage of a bill by the Democrats at \n     this point will be politically damaging to both the president \n     and congressional Democrats. Conversely defeat of the \n     legislation is much more likely to hurt Republicans in \n     Congress.\n       The latest Post-ABC News poll shows the president's overall \n     approval rating at a new low of 50 percent--about the rating \n     President Bush had going into the November 2004 election, \n     when Democrats said Bush was ripe for defeat.\n       There are many reasons for this drop in support for Obama. \n     The stagnant economy is the biggest factor, but close behind \n     is the fact that the administration is pushing health-reform \n     efforts that have polarized the electorate, and that \n     independent and swing voters have moved against in large \n     measure.\n       As Wednesday's Post-ABC poll shows, a majority of Americans \n     believe that if this bill passes, their healthcare costs will \n     rise, the federal deficit will increase, the costs of the \n     overall health-care system will climb, and their own care \n     would be better if the system stays as is. Democrats \n     (including former president Bill Clinton) claim that they \n     need this bill to pass for political reasons. But let's \n     examine that. At present, a majority of Americans are against \n     the effort, the legislation lacks bipartisan support, the \n     costs of the reforms are upfront, and the benefits won't kick \n     in until after the 2012 elections. When has that ever been a \n     formula for political success?\n       If this legislation passes, Democrats will be held \n     accountable for any failures or problems in the system. So if \n     Americans' insurance premiums rise, they will blame the \n     Democrats. If patients have to wait in line at emergency \n     rooms, it will be seen as the Democrats' fault. If health-\n     care costs don't drop, the Democrats will face the wrath of \n     the electorate.\n       Many Democrats, including people in the administration, \n     blame poor marketing for their difficulties in passing health \n     reform. They say they haven't gotten the message out. But \n     advocates of reform have spent millions on advertising and \n     lobbying this year. And Obama, who many say is the best \n     orator ever to occupy the White House, has pushed for this \n     legislation constantly over the past six months. In that \n     time, support for Obama's handling of heath-care reform has \n     dropped by more than a net of 30 points.\n       Yet before Republicans cheer that they may defeat this \n     effort, they should beware what they wish for. A vast \n     majority of Americans still believes that we need fundamental \n     health-care reform. If the legislation fails, Democrats can \n     blame Republicans by saying reform was in sight and the GOP \n     blocked it without offering a real alternative to decrease \n     costs and increase access.\n       The dominant issues today are the economy and jobs, and the \n     public doesn't see either party making these a real priority. \n     Further, polls show trust in government handling of domestic \n     issues remains at historic lows. What most voters hear from \n     Washington these days is squabbling over health reform \n     involving a government role they don't trust and don't want.\n       My advice? Leaders in Washington ought to concentrate on \n     what matters to Americans, not on what they think should \n     matter to voters. Come up with a heath-care bill that draws \n     real bipartisan support. And before pushing a bigger role for \n     government, begin to restore trust in the government's \n     ability to do even small things. Democrats pushing so hard \n     for success on health care could find themselves in a \n     situation resembling President Bush's situation on Iraq. They \n     could topple the statue and win the day, but lose politically \n     over the coming months and years.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Democratic Fratricide\n\n                         (By E.J. Dionne, Jr.)\n\n       Here's what Democrats need to ponder: Can they prosper in \n     the absence of George W. Bush?\n       His presidency was a tonic for Democrats and led to a \n     blossoming of political creativity on the center-left not \n     seen since the 1930s. No tactic, no program, no leader ever \n     did more to catalyze the party than the rage Bush inspired.\n       The whole effort was summarized nicely by the party's \n     slogan in 2006, ``A New Direction for America.'' There was no \n     need to specify north or south, east or west, up or down. \n     Compared with Bush, any alternative destination seemed \n     appealing. And by becoming the apotheosis of the fresh and \n     the new, Barack Obama emerged as the most attractive guide to \n     this unknown promised land.\n       The consequence is that Democrats must govern in one of the \n     most difficult periods in American history while managing a \n     sprawling coalition and working though a political structure \n     near the point of breakdown--\n\n[[Page S13616]]\n\n     largely because of the dilapidated state of that \n     dysfunctional and undemocratic partisan hothouse, the United \n     States Senate.\n       Especially if you take into account the scope of the \n     problems confronted, Democrats could argue they are doing \n     pretty well. It's no small thing to save the economy from \n     collapse. Winding down two wars is no picnic.\n       But politically, the Democrats are in trouble. They are at \n     one another's throats over healthcare legislation that should \n     be seen as one of the party's greatest triumphs. They are \n     being held hostage by political narcissists and narrow \n     slivers of their coalition.\n       When Democrats make deals, they are accused of selling out. \n     When they fail to make deals, they are accused of not \n     reaching out. Moderates complain that their party has gone \n     too far left. Progressives chortle bitterly at this, asking: \n     What's left-wing about policies that shore up banks and \n     protect drug companies?\n       Rural-state centrists insist on more fiscal discipline--as \n     long as it doesn't affect farmers and small-town hospitals. \n     Progressives ask why debt should be the priority when so much \n     more needs to be done to relieve unemployment.\n       This is a recipe for political catastrophe. An increasingly \n     bitter and negative Republican Party may not be able to win \n     the midterm elections, but Democrats definitely can lose \n     them.\n       Their fractiousness is dispiriting to their supporters, \n     which set off this urgent warning bell in the latest Post-ABC \n     News poll: For the first time in his presidency, more \n     Americans strongly disapprove of Obama's performance in \n     office (33 percent) than strongly approve (31 percent).\n       Putting aside margins of error and the fact that the Dec. \n     10-13 poll showed a sudden bump in Republican identification, \n     that might be a statistical anomaly. The point is that the \n     trend is perilous. In June, strong approvers of Obama \n     outnumbered strong disapprovers 36 percent to 22 percent. \n     Ardor and energy are switching sides.\n       There are no instant cures, but there is one thing that \n     must be done fast: Democrats need to agree on a health bill \n     and sell it with enthusiasm and conviction. Their own turmoil \n     and back-stabbing are making what is a rather good plan look \n     like a failure while convincing political independents that \n     they are a feuding gang rather than a governing party.\n       They have to focus in 2010 on immediate job creation and \n     long-term economic mobility while explaining how aggressive \n     measures to boost the economy now go hand in hand with \n     eventual deficit reduction.\n       Congressional moderates must understand that their fate is \n     linked with the party's ability to govern, and grass-roots \n     progressives have to be less on a hair trigger to shout \n     betrayal. (I wish I knew what to do about Joe Lieberman.)\n       For his part, Obama has not appreciated until recently how \n     closely he has been tied to Wall Street and the banks. He has \n     been too reluctant to underscore how much of Washington's \n     dysfunction has been pushed to new levels by the Republican \n     Party's decision to grind the Senate to a halt. He has tried \n     to make clear the size of the mess he inherited from Bush, \n     but has not sold the country on the extent to which he has \n     begun to clean it up.\n       Americans may not be sold on anything until unemployment \n     starts dropping. Even then, Democrats will have a tough time \n     making the sale if the process that produced the health-care \n     bill comes to define the image of how they govern the \n     country. Democrats have every right to blame Bush for the fix \n     we're in. They can't blame him for the problems they're \n     creating for themselves.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        More Talk, Less Support\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Rushing to lock the nation into expensive health-care and \n     climate-change commitments, Democrats are in an \n     understandable frenzy because public enthusiasm for both \n     crusades has been inversely proportional to the time the \n     public has had to think about them. And the president pushing \n     this agenda has, with his incontinent hunger for attention, \n     seen his job approval vary inversely with his ubiquity. \n     Consider his busy December--so far.\n       His Dec. 1 Afghanistan speech to the nation was followed on \n     Dec. 3 by his televised ``jobs summit.'' His Dec. 8 televised \n     economics speech at the Brookings Institution was followed on \n     Dec. 10 by his televised Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, \n     which was remarkable for 38 uses of the pronoun ``I''\n       And for disavowing a competence no one suspected him of. \n     (``I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the \n     problems of war.'' Note the superfluous adjective) And for an \n     unnecessary notification. (``Evil does exist in the world.'') \n     And for delayed utopianism. (``We will not eradicate violent \n     conflict in our lifetimes.'' But in someone's.) And for \n     solemnly announcing something undisputed. (There can be a \n     just war.) And for intellectual applesauce that should get \n     speechwriters fired and editors hired. (``We do not have to \n     think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe \n     that the human condition can be perfected.'' If the human \n     ``condition'' can attain perfection anyway, human nature \n     cannot be significantly imperfect.)\n       Then on Dec. 13, he was on ``60 Minutes'' praising himself \n     with another denigration of his predecessor, a.k.a. ``the \n     last eight years.'' (Blighted by ``a triumphant sense about \n     war.'') When Attorney General Eric Holder announced last \n     month that five suspected terrorists would be tried in \n     federal courts, he said: ``After eight years of delay. . . \n     .'' When the US. Preventive Services Task Force made the \n     controversial recommendation that women should get fewer \n     mammograms, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen \n     Sebelius said: This panel was appointed by the prior \n     administration, by former President George Bush.'' In \n     congressional testimony, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner \n     almost deviated from the script. He said the Obama \n     administration began after ``almost a decade''--slight \n     pause--``certainly eight years of basic neglect.''\n       Abroad, the fruits of the president's policy of \n     ``engagement'' have been meager: Witness Iran continuing its \n     nuclear program and China being difficult about carbon \n     emissions. Here is a history lesson for an administration \n     that, considering itself the culmination of history, is \n     interested only in the past eight years of it:\n       At a Vienna summit in June 1961, President John Kennedy, \n     fresh from his Bay of Pigs fiasco, was unnerved by the brutal \n     disdain of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who considered \n     Kennedy callow. Britain's Prime Minister Harold Macmillan \n     astutely noted that Kennedy had ``met a man who was \n     impervious to his charm.''\n       A person can be a novelty only once, and only briefly, and \n     charm, like any commodity, when used uneconomically, becomes \n     a wasting asset. All this is pertinent to the Senate health-\n     care debate, now coming to a curious climax amid another glut \n     of careless grandiosity.\n       Supporters of the Senate bill say it will insure the \n     uninsured. The Congressional Budget Office says 24 million of \n     the 46.3 million uninsured will remain so. Supporters say it \n     will lower aggregate and individual health-care spending. The \n     government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says \n     the nation's health-care spending and insurance premium costs \n     will increase.\n       Today there are more independents than Democrats, more \n     independents than Republicans, and according to a recent \n     Gallup poll, independents approval of the Democratic-\n     controlled Congress (14 percent) is lower than Republicans' \n     approval (17 percent). This is partly a function of the \n     majority party's health-care monomania. Consider what \n     happened recently in Kentucky.\n       There a Republican candidate succeeded in nationalizing a \n     state Senate race. Hugely outspent in a district in which \n     Democrats have a lopsided registration advantage, the \n     Republican, by 12 points, won a seat in Frankfort by running \n     against Washington--against Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and \n     their health-care legislation.\n       A CNN poll shows 36 percent of the public in favor of what \n     the Democratic Senate is trying to do to health care, 61 \n     percent opposed. It is clear what the public wants Congress \n     to do: Take a mulligan and start over.\n       So Republicans can win in 2009 by stopping the bill or in \n     2010 by saying: Unpopular health-care legislation passed \n     because of a 60-40 party-line decision to bring it to a \n     Senate vote. Therefore each incumbent Democrat is responsible \n     for everything in the law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Dishing Out Some Shock on Debt\n\n                           (By David Broder)\n\n       The 34 names are familiar to anyone who has followed \n     economic policy in Washington for the past generation, one-\n     third of them former chairmen or members of key committees of \n     Congress, seven of them former comptroller generals of the \n     United States, seven of them former directors of the \n     Congressional Budget Office and one of them--Paul Volcker--\n     the former chairman of the Federal Reserve System and now an \n     adviser to President Barack Obama.\n       Both political parties are well represented in their \n     number. But they came together this week as signatories of a \n     nonpartisan manifesto, essentially a stark warning to the \n     president and Congress and a plea for action on behalf of the \n     next generation.\n       The United States, they unanimously said, is facing ``a \n     debt-driven crisis--something previously viewed as almost \n     unfathomable in the world's largest economy.''\n       Under the impact of the worst economic calamity since the \n     Great Depression, the federal government ran a deficit of \n     $1.4 trillion this past year. The rescue effort was \n     necessary, but in 2009 alone, the public debt grew 31 percent \n     from $5.8 trillion to $7.6 trillion, rising from 41 percent \n     to 53 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).\n       Unless strong remedial steps are taken, the debt is \n     projected to rise to 85 percent of GDP by 2018 and 100 \n     percent four years later. Barely a dozen years from now. \n     these deeply experienced folks say, the American economy will \n     likely be in ruins.\n       All of us have become accustomed to hearing lamentations \n     about the changes in the annual budget deficits, the gap \n     between federal revenues and spending in a particular year. \n     But this commission deliberately shifted its focus from the \n     deficit to the underlying debt.\n       The reason was explained to me by Alice Rivlin, formerly a \n     director of both the Congressional Budget Office and the \n     Office of Management and Budget. ``Previously, when we were \n     worried about deficits, we could take comfort in the fact \n     that the debt was not very high relative to the economy,'' \n     she said. ``But now that debt has shot up. The cushion has \n     gone. If the same thing (a severe recession) happened again, \n     we wouldn't be able to borrow to deal with it.''\n\n[[Page S13617]]\n\n       In addition to robbing us of the flexibility to deal with \n     future crises, the rapidly rising debt level could push up \n     interest rates, threatening economic recovery, slow the \n     growth of wages, depress living standards, make the United \n     States even more dependent on foreign lenders and leave us \n     vulnerable to a shock wave if those lenders lose confidence \n     in our ability to repay the loans.\n       These experts--writing under the auspices of the Peter G. \n     Peterson Foundation, The Pew Charitable Trusts and The \n     Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget--suggest a series \n     of steps.\n       First, they want Obama in his State of the Union address to \n     urge Congress to join in a pledge to stabilize the debt, at \n     no higher than 60 percent of GDP, by 2018. This would require \n     actions by both Congress and the administration to start \n     reducing the projected annual deficits, which add to the \n     debt, That would make debt-management an economic priority \n     once the effects of the current severe recession have eased. \n     To assure the pledge is kept, those who signed this report \n     would ask Congress and the president to set up an enforcement \n     mechanism that would automatically reduce spending or \n     increase taxes when the debt target is missed in any year \n     between 2012 and 2018.\n       This is stiff medicine, but the message of this report is \n     that temporizing on this issue poses such perils to the \n     nation's future that the risk is unacceptable.\n       When Congress this week ducked its responsibility again by \n     deciding to enact a temporary, two-month increase in the debt \n     ceiling, the need for a shock treatment like this report \n     could not be plainer.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nimportant leadership. He is absolutely right. As much as we would all \nlike to be home with our families, especially at this time of year, \nthis battle to inform the American people about what is about to happen \nto them is too important for us to simply give up or acquiesce to what \nthe Senator from Iowa seems to think is inevitable.\n  There is nothing inevitable about this. The only thing I think \ninevitable about it is, in light of the unpopularity of what is being \njammed down the throats of the American people, there will be a day of \naccounting. We do not know when that day of accounting will be. Perhaps \none of the first days of accounting will be election day 2010. I do not \nunderstand how people who are elected to represent their constituents \ncan try to impose something that is so obviously unpopular with their \nconstituents and expect somehow to be patted on the back and told: \nWell, you are right, you are smarter than we are. You do know better \nthan we do what is better for our families and what we ought to be \nlimited to when it comes to health care choices.\n  I think that is an upside down way of looking at the world. Maybe \nthat is the reason why we have such disparate views of what we are \nengaged in here. Clearly, on the other side of the aisle, they believe \nthat government is the answer. They believe government can do a lot \nbetter than the private sector in providing choices and providing cost \ncontrols. Well, the only way government can do that, of course, is by \nprice controls, which we have seen happen in Medicare and Medicaid, \nwhich have not worked very well. Here we are 5 days before Christmas, \nand we are going to be having a vote tonight at 1 a.m. on a 2,733-page \nhealth care bill that we got yesterday morning. We do not know what is \nin the bill. We are still reading, and apparently the Congressional \nBudget Office is still trying to figure out the impact of the bill. \nThey have already had to correct one mistake because they are being \nasked to rush to judgment on this bill that will affect one-sixth of \nour economy and all 300 million Americans.\n  But we do know this: We do know it will cut Medicare by $470 billion. \nMedicare is paid for by employers and the workers into a trust fund, \nand that trust fund is going to be pilfered, robbed, in order to create \na brandnew entitlement program that the beneficiaries of that \nentitlement program never paid for as did the beneficiaries of \nMedicare. That is one part of this. We also know it is going to \nincrease taxes by $518 billion.\n  We already know President Obama's promise as to people making less \nthan $250,000 a year will not be kept under this bill, and that this \nbill, according to the National Federation of Independent Business, \nwill impact small businesses and their ability to create jobs and \nretain workers during one of the worst recessions we have had in this \ncountry.\n  Then, of course, we know this bill--without the phony accounting \ngimmicks, such as implementing a bill 4 years into a 10-year budget \nwindow--will actually fail in universal coverage. It will leave 23 \nmillion people uninsured, and it will cost roughly $2.5 trillion, and \nit will increase the cost of premiums for people who already have \ninsurance.\n  What is so disgusting about this process is, this exactly confirms \nthe most cynical view that the American people have about Congress and \nWashington, DC. Rather than a change in that process--one that is more \ntransparent, one in which everybody's views are considered, and where \nwe try to come together in a bipartisan consensus for a solution--this \nis going to be passed strictly along party lines by a political party \nand by their leadership who apparently care more about chalking up a \nvictory, albeit a Pyrrhic victory, rather than listening to their \nconstituents. The American people want Washington to start over again. \nFifty-six percent of voters in this most recent poll said they want us \nto stop this bill and start over.\n  We know this process is a product of deals struck behind closed doors \nwith special interest groups and their lobbyists. The pharmaceutical \nindustry got 24 Democrats to switch their votes on reimportation. What \nis that all about? To preserve a special deal cut behind closed doors? \nThe insurance industry will get $476 billion of tax money from this \nbill. Then other parts of the health care community are going to be \nexempted from cuts by the payment advisory board because they cut their \ndeal behind closed doors. We know this bill is being attempted to be \njammed through when most people are spending time with their families \nbecause of the Christmas season.\n  Even the distinguished majority whip, last week, said: I am in the \ndark almost as much as other Senators are. He said: I am in leadership. \nSo this bill has been written with a small group of people behind \nclosed doors, including the Senator from Nebraska, who spent 13 hours--\n13 hours--on Friday behind closed doors with Democratic leadership and \nWhite House officials. In the meantime, we are left completely in the \ndark as to what is in this bill other than what we could glean in the \nlimited time we have been given.\n  After the ill-fated stimulus bill passed in the first part of the \nyear, I remember we got that bill about late Thursday night, and then \nwe were asked to vote on it less than 24 hours later--less than 24 \nhours later. We--like that--spent $1.1 trillion, including the \ninterest, in this stimulus bill that was supposed to keep unemployment \nbelow 8 percent. Well, we know how well that worked with unemployment \ngoing as high as 10.2 percent and now at 10 percent. One thing the \nAmerican people told us after that is, they want us--well, I almost \nhate to say it, it seems so simple and straightforward--they want us to \nread the bill. They want us to understand the bill. They want to be \nable to read it and understand it before they give their consent to our \nvoting for it. They want to know what the impact is going to be on \ntheir coverage. Is it going to raise their taxes? Is it going to raise \ntheir premiums? Is it going to cut into their Medicare benefits? If you \nare a Medicare Advantage beneficiary, we know it will for 11 million \nAmericans, including half a million in Texas.\n  Then there was this discussion, and I guess this is all for show too. \nThis was not, obviously, a sincere effort where we had eight Democrats \nwho wrote a letter on October 6 to the majority leader and said they \nwant the bill 72 hours before the first vote. Well, guess what. This \nhistoric vote we are going to have at 1 in the morning will occur 40 \nhours, roughly, after we got the bill. So much for 72 hours. We know \nthe CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, score, the cost, their \nestimate, even with the phony assumptions that are included in this \nbill, will only be available for 37 hours.\n  Then we find out there are other sweetheart deals which makes this \nbegin to stink to high heaven--things such as special legislative \nlanguage saying the State of Nebraska--the State of Nebraska--gets a \nspecial pass from new Medicaid mandates. Vermont and Massachusetts have \nspecial deals. Then there is a $100 million earmark\n\n[[Page S13618]]\n\nfor an unknown hospital. Boy, I cannot wait to find out what that is \nabout. Those are just some of the sweetheart deals we know are in these \nbills, and I am sure there are more we will find out about.\n  This process has gone too fast and gone too far off track. It reminds \nme of what Rahm Emanuel, the President's Chief of Staff, said when they \njammed through the stimulus bill earlier this year. He said: A crisis \nis a terrible thing to waste.\n  It is one thing if we were acting in response to a crisis in a \nresponsible manner, but what this is going to do is make it even worse, \nas the Senator from Wyoming pointed out.\n  I think people listening--the 56 percent and growing number of \nAmericans who are concerned about this deal--are wondering: Are the \npoliticians in Washington more interested in jamming this through or \ngetting it right?\n  Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine, a member of the Finance Committee--\nthe one Republican to vote for the Finance Committee bill--said she \nwill not vote for cloture on this bill at 1 this morning because this \nis simply an arbitrary deadline. Oh--and guess what--most of the \nprovisions do not kick in for 4 years. So why are we doing this \nliterally in the dead of night on a phony timetable?\n  We know according to experts, such as the dean of the Harvard Medical \nSchool--he said:\n\n       In discussions with dozens of health-care leaders and \n     economists, I find near unanimity of opinion that, whatever \n     its shape, the final legislation that will emerge from \n     Congress will markedly accelerate national health-care \n     spending rather than restrain it.\n\n  You do not have to go to Harvard to figure that out. Just go to \nHouston, TX. A small business owner in Houston wrote to me and said:\n\n       The proposed Health Care bill is going to have a negative \n     impact on my business because the cost of employee health \n     insurance will go up.\n       . . . I don't believe what some are saying that costs will \n     go down. . . . This bill does not make economic common \n     sense.\n\n  Those are true words from a small business owner in Houston, TX, who \nI suspect has a greater understanding of what this bill will be than \nsome of the so-called experts here inside the Beltway.\n  We know from the Congressional Budget Office, though, that the \npremiums for an average American family under this bill will go up \n$2,100 a year for those purchasing insurance on their own in the so-\ncalled individual market.\n  An independent study talked about premiums in Texas specifically and \nsaid premiums in Texas, for those who purchase insurance on their own, \nwill go up for 61 percent--61 percent--of Texans purchasing insurance \non their own, that their premiums will go up under this bill. What in \nthe world are we doing? Under the Reid bill, a family of four in \nHouston would see their premiums more than double to $1,352 a month.\n  I find it supremely ironic that perhaps the next vote we will have \nhere on the Senate floor, after this health care bill, is going to be a \nvote to increase the statutory debt limit because Congress has maxed \nout its credit card. Currently our credit limit is $12 trillion, and \nnow that is not enough because of unwise and reckless spending such as \nthat reflected here in this bill. I find that supremely ironic. But I \nsuspect there are a lot of Americans who find it very sad and even \nscary.\n  We know in a time when people are struggling to keep their job, when \nbusinesses are struggling to keep their employees rather than have to \nlay them off and make the unemployment statistics even worse, when \npeople are losing their home because they no longer have a job, this \nbill will be a job killer.\n  The only way this is going to be paid for--the pay-or-play mandates \nput on businesses--is for businesses to take some of the money they \nwould have used to hire new employees and pay this new punitive tax \nbeing imposed by the Federal Government.\n  Businesses in Texas know this is true. The Lubbock Chamber of \nCommerce said:\n\n       An employer mandate would be a ``job killer'', raising the \n     costs of maintaining a workforce. . . .\n       . . . small businesses and our consumers will be the ones \n     who suffer. . . .\n\n  Then there is this Medicaid expansion that Senator Enzi from Wyoming \ntalked about. There is an unfunded mandate here because Texas did not \nget the sweetheart deal that Louisiana or Nebraska or Vermont or \nMassachusetts got--an unfunded mandate of $21 billion over 10 years. So \nnot only are people's Federal taxes going to go up, they are going to \nwreck the State budget too by pushing aside other priorities such as \npublic education and the like--totally irresponsible.\n  Then there is a so-called Nelson amendment on abortion that was \nsupposed to strike a ``compromise.'' Well, one of my other \nconstituents, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, who leads Texas' largest \narchdiocese and is chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' \nCommittee on Pro-Life Activities, said this:\n\n       [T]he legislation will be morally unacceptable ``unless and \n     until'' it complies with longstanding current laws on \n     abortion funding such as the Hyde amendment. . . .\n       . . . .This legislation should not move forward in its \n     current form. It should be opposed unless and until such \n     serious concerns have been addressed.\n\n  I am staggered at what we are about to witness here, at the sheer \nirresponsibility of the way this is being done, with artificial \ndeadlines, votes in the dead of night, bills cooked up behind closed \ndoors as special deals jammed down the throats of the American people \nwho do not want it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom Texas, and my colleague from Wyoming prior to that. Many have come \ndown here, as our colleagues on our side have, day after day, time \nafter time, and continue to point out what we believe is wrong with the \napproach that is being taken by the majority, and also pointing out \nwhere we would do things differently.\n  Remember, this is the first bill: 2,100 pages long; $1.2 billion per \npage; $6.8 million actually per word. Then yesterday, we got the \nmanagers' amendment: another 400 pages. You add yet another amendment \nthat is going to go on this stack, and you are talking about 2,700 \npages of bill language.\n  What I think is interesting--and I see a pattern emerging here almost \nevery single day--it is like deja vu all over again. The other side \ncomes down here and talks about the need for health care reform, which \nwe all concede. We all believe we need to reform health care in this \ncountry. We all hear from our small businesses. We all hear from \nindividuals and families who are having a difficult time keeping up \nwith the high cost of health care. So that is something on which there \nis broad agreement on both sides. Yet that seems to be sort of the MO \nfor the other side, to come down here and talk about how we need to do \nhealth care reform. We agree with that.\n\n  The other strategy is to come down here and attack Republicans for \nnot having their own ideas. We have been trying to offer amendments to \nthis bill forever. We had several amendments offered today. We asked \nconsent to bring up amendments, to get them pending, to get them voted \non. They were blocked by the other side. We have full alternatives to \nthe current bill. Senator Burr and Senator Coburn have an alternative, \na comprehensive alternative they would like to offer, being blocked by \nthe other side.\n  So the recurring pattern that has emerged day after day in the debate \nin the Senate is Democrats come down here and talk about how bad the \ncurrent system is and point out examples of those who are falling \nthrough the cracks in the current system. Exactly. We agree with that. \nWe have acknowledged there is a problem. They come down here and attack \nRepublicans for not having alternatives. In fact, the Senator from \nRhode Island this afternoon essentially said that Republicans have been \ncoming down here and telling lies.\n  What the Republicans have been doing day after day after day is \ncoming down and talking about the bill and the impact the bill would \nhave on health care delivery, the impact the bill would have on the \neconomy, the impact the bill would have on small businesses and their \nability to create jobs. We have been talking about the Congressional \nBudget Office report that describes the cost of the bill and goes into \ngreat detail about how it will impact individual families as well as \nthe overall cost of health care in this\n\n[[Page S13619]]\n\ncountry. We have come down here day after day to talk about the CMS \nActuary's report, the Center for Medicare Services, about the cost of \nthe bill and how it would impact the cost of health care in this \ncountry. So we continue to come down here and talk about the bill.\n  The other side--the one thing they don't do is they don't come down \nhere and talk about the bill. I don't hear Democrats coming down here \nand offering full-throated defenses for this bill, because the bill is \nindefensible. It is 2,700 pages, and it doesn't do anything to lower \nthe cost of health care, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  So we come down here day after day and talk about the Congressional \nBudget Office report, come down here and talk about the CMS Actuary's \nreport. They come down and talk about how bad the current system is, \nsay this is going to fix it, but then when they are challenged on the \nCMS Actuary's report and the Congressional Budget Office report, they \ncan't defend that.\n  What they should be doing instead of accusing the Republicans of \ntelling lies and attacking Republicans is accusing the CMS Actuary and \nthe Congressional Budget Office. They ought to be coming down and \nattacking them because all we are doing is pointing out the facts as \nthey pertain to the current bill that is before the Senate, this 2,700 \npages right here.\n  What I would like to point out are some of the promises that have \nbeen made by the President and by Democrats with regard to this bill.\n  The President made it very clear, when he was running for President:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge: Under my plan, no family making \n     less than $250,000 will see their taxes increase--not your \n     income taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains \n     taxes, not any of your taxes.\n\n  Yet the Joint Committee on Taxation analysis--by the way, that is \nanother report, and maybe they ought to be coming down here and \nattacking that report rather than attacking Republicans who are quoting \nfrom the report. The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis shows those \npeople earning less than $200,000 a year will see a tax increase under \nthe Reid bill. Even after you account for taxpayers who are going to \nreceive the premium tax credit, 24 percent of tax returns under \n$200,000 will, on average, see their taxes go up. There are 42 million \nAmericans who are going to see higher taxes who make less than 200,000 \na year. So the no tax increase for the middle class we would have to \nsay is a broken promise.\n  The second thing they say is that it will lower health care costs. We \nall know--and the President said this as recently as June 23:\n\n       And I've said very clearly: If any bill arrives from \n     Congress that is not controlling costs, that's not a bill I \n     can support. It's going to have to control costs. It's going \n     to have to be paid for.\n\n  So the Democrats have shifted the benchmarks about what that means \nand what impact it is going to have on America's health care premiums.\n  The President's first promise, going back to the campaign, was that \nthe typical family's premiums would go down by $2,500 per year--a \n$2,500-per-year reduction, according to the President when he was \ncampaigning--and that everybody would be covered. Well, we all know \nthat even this bill, which is touted as expanding coverage--well, it \ndoes expand coverage. It puts 15 million more people on Medicaid; that \nis one way it expands coverage. But under this bill, there are still 23 \nmillion Americans who don't get health insurance coverage. So the \nPresident's promise that he was going to cover everybody, that he was \ngoing to lower health care costs, again, you would have to say it is a \nbroken promise.\n  I want to show my colleagues how this would impact a typical family's \ninsurance costs. If you are a family who is paying $13,300 today and \nyou are getting your insurance in the large employer market--in other \nwords, if you work for a large employer, you get it in the large group \nmarket--and you are looking at the year 2016, you are going to be \npaying over $20,000 a year for insurance. That doesn't lower health \ncare costs; that increases health care costs.\n  What they will say is: Well, this is better than it would have been \nif we had done nothing. The honest truth is that if we do nothing, we \nstill would have 5 percent to 6 percent increases year over year in the \ncost of health insurance for most Americans whether you get your \ninsurance in the large group market or the small group market. You are \nstill going to have a 5- to 6-percent increase in the cost of your \nhealth insurance if this bill is passed. You don't see any improvement. \nThe best you can hope for is the status quo, which is year-over-year \nincreases that are twice the rate of inflation. That is the impact on \nan average family. So the whole notion that this is going to lower \nhealth care costs just doesn't pass the truth test, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  The next promise that was made is that it would bend the cost curve \ndown. What is interesting about that--and, of course, this was the \nPresident in the joint session of Congress on September 9 of this year:\n\n       The plan I am announcing tonight . . . will slow the growth \n     of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and \n     our government.\n\n  Well, according to the Congressional Budget Office, again--and if my \ncolleagues want to attack us, let's have them attack the Congressional \nBudget Office, the CMS Actuary, the Joint Tax Committee, because \neverything I am saying tonight I am quoting from those reports. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Reid \namendment, the cost curve bends up, not down. In fact, in the first 10 \nyears, the net increase would be about $200 billion a year in overall \nhealth care costs.\n  This is an outdated chart, I have to say, because this is the chart \nwe used before this amendment was added. This is the managers' \namendment, the 400-page amendment I alluded to earlier that was just \nadded to the 2,100 page bill. In the 2,100 page bill, the Congressional \nBudget Office said the cost of health care in this country is going to \ngo up, not down, by $160 billion.\n  So what is the cost of doing nothing? The blue line represents the \ncost of doing nothing. That is Federal health care spending today and \nwhat it is projected to be into the future if we do nothing. The red \nline, according to the Congressional Budget Office, represents what \nhealth care costs would do if the Reid bill passes. The ironic thing is \nthat with the 400-page amendment that was added yesterday, this number \ngets bigger, not smaller.\n\n  I said this is an outdated chart. This only represents a $160 billion \nincrease in the cost of health care. According to CBO's analysis on the \namendment, it increases the cost of health care by $200 billion. The \nCMS Actuary came to a slightly different conclusion. They said health \ncare costs would go up in the next 10 years by $234 billion. So you \nhave all the experts--the Congressional Budget Office, the CMS \nActuary--all coming to the same conclusion; that is, health care costs \ngo up, not down. So we would have to say that is yet another broken \npromise.\n  The other thing that has been said throughout the course of this \ndebate is that you could keep the insurance you have. In his joint \nsession of Congress address on September 9, the President said:\n\n       Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.\n\n  Well, interestingly enough, according, again, to the Congressional \nBudget Office, between 9 million and 10 million people who would be \ncovered by an employment-based plan under current law would not have an \noffer of such coverage under the proposal, the Reid proposal. So we \nhave 10 million people, according to CBO, who are going to lose their \nemployer-based coverage, and you also have the 11 million people who \nget Medicare Advantage which is being cut. They aren't going to be able \nto keep what they have. You can argue that maybe their benefits are too \nrich today. That has been the argument made by the other side. But you \ncan't say they are going to be able to keep what they have. If you are \ngoing to cut $118 billion out of Medicare Advantage, the 11 million \npeople in this country who get Medicare Advantage are going to see \ntheir benefits cut. They are not going to be able to keep what they \nhave.\n  In fact, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey, said recently on \nthese Medicare Advantage cuts:\n\n       We are not going to be able to say if you like what you \n     have you can keep it, and that basic commitment that a lot of \n     us around here have made will be called into question.\n\n  Eleven million people who get Medicare Advantage aren't going to be \nable\n\n[[Page S13620]]\n\nto keep what they have, nor are the 10 million people, according to the \nCBO, who are going to lose their employer-based coverage if this plan \npasses--another broken promise.\n  No cuts to Medicare--we all know about that. We talked about that for \nabout a week here and offered amendments to get rid of the Medicare \ncuts.\n  The President said when he was running for office:\n\n       I want to assure [you] we're not talking about cutting \n     Medicare benefits.\n\n  He reiterated that in his State of the Union Address.\n  This bill, as we know, cuts $470 billion out of Medicare in the first \n10 years, and when it is fully implemented, it cuts over $1 trillion \nout of Medicare. In the first 10 years, $135 billion out of hospitals; \n$120 billion, as I said earlier, out of Medicare Advantage; $15 billion \nout of nursing homes; $40 billion out of home health care; and $7 \nbillion out of hospice care--these are all Medicare cuts. These are all \ngoing to affect people in a very real way whether you get Medicare \nAdvantage or whether you are a provider.\n  These are just the facts of this legislation. I am talking about the \nbill. I am talking about the bill, and I am talking about what the \nexperts have said about the bill. So we would have to say, another \nbroken promise.\n  The first of the last two here: open and transparent process.\n  We all know that when the President campaigned, he said:\n\n       We'll have the negotiations televised on C-SPAN so that \n     people can see who is making arguments on behalf of their \n     constituents and who is making arguments on behalf of the \n     drug companies or the insurance companies. And so that \n     approach I think is what is going to allow people to stay \n     involved in this process.\n\n  That was what the President said when he was campaigning.\n  We all know this bill, almost in its entirety, has been written \nbehind closed doors. We just saw this 400-page amendment yesterday. It \nwas interesting; earlier--it was last week, I guess--in a discussion on \nthe floor between Senator McCain and Senator Durbin, Senator Durbin, \nthe No. 2 Democrat in the leadership on the Democratic side, said:\n\n       I would say to the Senator from Arizona that I am in the \n     dark almost as much as he is and I am in the leadership.\n\n  Even some of the leaders on the other side--there are only three \npeople, four people sitting in a room writing this bill, and what is \nthe most offensive thing about this came out yesterday when we found \nout that the Senator from Nebraska had carved out a special sweetheart \ndeal with a goody for his State that all the rest of the States get to \npay for. He gets his Medicaid for his State paid for entirely by the \nFederal taxpayers, and no other State gets that particular arrangement. \nSo the Federal taxpayers in every other State, in my State of South \nDakota--Nebraska borders South Dakota. I think the people in our part \nof the country are going to say this really smells. This is the way \nthey are doing business in Washington, DC? This is business as usual.\n  The final thing I will say is this: The argument was that it won't \nadd a dime to the deficit. Well, here I give the Democrats a little bit \nof credit because they did raise taxes enough and cut Medicare enough \nthat they could actually raise quite a bit of revenue. But saying it \nwon't add a dime to the deficit assumes there isn't going to be any \npayment to physicians. The physicians' fee fix, which takes about $250 \nbillion, was completely cut out of here. They are going to have to fix \nthat at some point. So we are not counting that.\n  We are counting $72 billion from a program called the CLASS Act which \nthe chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, the Democrat from North \nDakota, Kent Conrad, called a ``Ponzi scheme of the first order,'' \nsomething Bernie Madoff would be proud of. The CBO says of the CLASS \nAct:\n\n       The program would add to future budget deficits in large \n     and growing fashion.\n\n  Even the Washington Post has editorialized about this, and they came \nto the same conclusion:\n\n       The CLASS Act is a gimmick designed to pretend that health \n     care is fully paid for.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The money that flows in during the 10-year budget window \n     will flow back out again. These are not savings that can \n     honestly be counted on the budget sheet of reform.\n\n  Then we all know we have 10 years of revenue coming in, with only 6 \nyears of spending in the first 10 years. Phony budgeting, gimmicks--all \nof these things are used to mask the true size of the cost of this \nprogram: $2.5 trillion over 10 years when it is fully implemented.\n  So if you do not use the gimmicks, if you do not use the CLASS Act, \nif you discount the doc fix and don't count that in there, sure, you \ncan make it look like it doesn't add to the deficit, but the American \npeople know better, and they have come to the conclusion this is going \nto add to the deficit. Even David Broder, who is the Pulitzer Prize \nwinner for his commentary, said:\n\n       While the CBO said that both the House-passed bill and the \n     one Reid has drafted meet the test by being budget-neutral, \n     every expert I have talked to says that the public has it \n     right. These bills, as they stand, are budget-busters.\n\n  This is going to add to the deficit. These are all broken promises. \nThat is why this bill needs to be voted down. We need to vote it down \ntonight. I am hoping there is a courageous Democrat or two who will \njoin us and defeat this bad legislation and move forward to something \nwe can pass that will meaningfully lower health care costs for the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to hear my \ncolleague from South Dakota speak and talk about the bill. Statements \nhe has made I am in agreement with. This is a huge bill the American \npublic doesn't want. Gallup polling finds 61 percent of the American \npublic oppose the Senate Democratic health care bill. In Kansas, I find \nwidespread opposition--much higher than that. You can look at these \nnumbers and quickly see why. Just one of the pieces of it--the Medicare \ncuts--will hurt Kansas. There is a 63.7-percent cut in Medicare \nAdvantage. The benefits will affect more than 1 in 10 of Kansas \nMedicare beneficiaries. Those cuts are to the point that the program \nwill no longer exist.\n  There is $1.5 billion in cuts to Kansas hospitals--many of our rural \nhospitals operating on the margins, on the edge. They get cuts. There \nis $239.8 million in cuts to home health agencies. This is going to put \nover 60 percent of them out of business in a 10-year timeframe. They \ndon't like this. Great Christmas present.\n  There is an 11.8-percent cut in hospice payments. Hospice? Of all \nthings to cut. It is a program that has been helpful to so many people \nlate in life, and it is being cut. There is $124.2 million in cuts to \nskilled nursing facilities. All of those are things being cut directly \nto Kansans, directly to people who benefit under current programs, and \nthis is all to start a new entitlement program--cuts Medicare and \nraises taxes, neither of which we can afford. Medicare is already \nscheduled to go bankrupt, as we well know, so this is like writing a \nbig fat check on an overdrawn bank account and saying we will come up \nwith the money. It is not going to work. It is going to take money from \nMedicare. It is going to raise taxes in a weak economy. It is going to \nhurt overall.\n  One of the issues that has come down to be one of the final pieces of \nthis that the Democrats have put forward is the issue of funding of \nabortion. We have had 30 years of agreement in this body and in this \nCapitol that the Federal Government would not fund abortions other than \nin cases of rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother. That was \nit.\n  Thirty years ago, the Hyde amendment was put in place. It said we \nwould not fund abortions. There was a big debate in the country about \nabortion, but there has been no debate about funding of abortion. We \nsaid we are not going to fund it. Taxpayers should not be funding \nabortions. If people want to do that, that is their choice on elective \nabortion. We are not going to fund it.\n  In this bill, we are going to break that amendment for the first time \nin 30 years.\n  What the President said in the joint session of Congress is no longer \ntrue. This will not be true if this passes in this bill. What the \nPresident said in the joint session of Congress:\n\n       One more misunderstanding I want to clear up.\n\n  I was listening.\n\n\n[[Page S13621]]\n\n\n       Under our plan no Federal dollars will be used to fund \n     abortions, and Federal conscience laws will remain in place.\n\n  I point out that he said ``no Federal dollars'' and ``Federal \nconscience laws will remain in place.'' He said he wanted to clear up \nthe misunderstanding. This is not the case.\n  We just got the managers' amendment recently, so this has been \nfeverishly where we have had to go through what is actually in the \nmanagers' amendment. What you will find is that all the major pro-life \ngroups are opposed to the managers' amendment because it does fund \nabortion. I will go through the specifics.\n  Bart Stupak a Democratic Member on the House side. He has been the \nlead guy on the House side to say we should continue with the Hyde \nlanguage. There are disputes about abortions. There is not a dispute \nabout the funding of it by taxpayer money. So Bart Stupak has led a \ngroup of Democratic Members on the issue overall and said we are going \nto pull it out. It is not in the House bill, but now it is in the \nSenate bill. He says:\n\n       Not acceptable . . . a dramatic shift in Federal policy \n     that would allow the Federal Government to subsidize \n     insurance policies with abortion coverage.\n\n  That is what Bart Stupak says about it. What do some of the other \npro-life groups say about what is in the managers' amendment. These \ngroups track this stuff. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which \nwants a health care bill--I think they are a pretty fair reviewer of \nthis because they want a health care bill to go through, but they are \ncommitted to life. They do not want taxpayer money to go to end a \nchild's life. They are opposed to that--completely opposed to that on \nmoral grounds, saying this is the highest moral order that has to be \nprotected. Human life has to be protected, and they say, of this \nlegislation, the managers' amendment:\n\n       This legislation should not move forward in its current \n     form. It should be opposed, unless and until such serious \n     concerns have been addressed.\n\n  This is on the abortion language. Now let's look at the National \nRight to Life Committee. The National Right to Life Committee--they are \nthe gold standard of review. They have been looking at this issue and \ntracking it since Roe v. Wade was passed. They are committed to life at \nall stages, in all places, believing that life is sacred; it is unique; \nit is beautiful; and it should be protected. What do they say about the \nmanagers' amendment? They say:\n\n       Light years removed from the Stupak-Pitts amendment that \n     was approved in the House of Representatives on November 8 by \n     a bipartisan vote of 240-194.\n       The new abortion language solves none of the fundamental \n     abortion-related problems with the Senate bill, and it \n     actually creates some new abortion-related problems.\n\n  Let's go through the specifics, because I think what we should do is \ngo through the specifics of this bill and look at what are the specific \nareas of concern. Many of the abortion changes that Senator Reid \nsmuggled into his managers' bill behind closed doors make the bill \nworse than ever before. It violates the Hyde amendment and Hyde \nprinciples set in precedent through all other Federal administered \nhealth programs like Medicare and Medicaid. It preempts State laws and \nconflicts with some existing laws on abortion.\n  Third is the so-called firewall. There is a firewall provision \nbetween Federal and private funds. That is inconsistent with the Hyde \nand Stupak-Pitts amendment. The firewall language is not very \nfireproof. It is a mere accounting gimmick, where they put the money in \none pocket and pay for abortions from the other. It is still money that \ngoes through the Federal Government to the Federal Government to pay \nfor abortions.\n  Fourth, it departs from the way the Federal Employee Health Benefit \nProgram is governed with respect to private plans covering abortion, so \nit changes that.\n  Fifth, it allows executive branch officials to require private health \nplans to cover abortions simply by defining them as ``preventive \ncare.''\n  We have debated this piece calling abortions preventive care in \ncommittee and on the Senate floor. Both times we have tried to take \nthat out and say preventive care does not include abortions, and we \nhave not been able to get that definition to the point where abortion \ncan still be called preventive care. This is the Mikulski amendment, \nwhich mandates that all plans cover abortion by defining abortion as a \npreventive service. If you just define it as a preventive service, you \ncan pay for it. But it is still being paid for then, and that is in \nthis bill.\n  No. 6, it inserts text of the Indian health reauthorization bill. \nThat passed last year and didn't get signed into law. It passed this \nbody. That does not contain the Senate-passed Vitter amendment to \npermanently prohibit coverage of elective abortions in the federally \nfunded Indian health programs.\n  And, No. 7, basic conscience protections, like the Weldon language, \nare not included in the Senate version. There are other problems, but \nthese are just seven of the most egregious. I can't imagine that people \nacross the country--certainly people across my State and other places, \nsuch as Virginia, Missouri, California, Wisconsin, or anyplace else \nwould agree that the Federal Government should break with longstanding \npolicy against federally funded abortions, but that is exactly what has \nhappened and what is in this bill.\n  Abortion is not health care. Why is it even in this bill at all? The \nPresident himself said that at the joint session of Congress.\n\n  At the end of the day, the vote for cloture is an affirmative vote \nfor the Federal funding of abortion. There is no way around that fact. \nSome people on the Democratic side, particularly Senator Nelson of \nNebraska, with whom I have been working closely on this issue, want to \nkeep abortion out of this bill. I believe there are huge flaws still in \nit. He has been fighting to keep abortion out of it. He said this:\n\n       Taxpayers shouldn't be required to pay for abortions.\n\n  That is his statement on the issue. He says it should not be in \nthere. He worked to try to get this out. I think there are still \nenormous flaws and holes in this.\n  If we start the funding of abortions, the last time we did fund them, \nover 300,000 were paid for by the Federal Government in a 1-year period \nof time through Medicaid Programs; 300,000 annually were funded from \n1973 to 1976. How many are we looking at now if we start down this \nroad?\n  We need one Democrat in the Senate who will stand and say this is not \ntaking care of the unborn. This is breaking the Hyde language that many \non the other side have supported for years, saying they are pro-choice, \nbut they don't think the Federal Government should fund abortions. This \nbreaks the Hyde language in the six ways I mentioned and, seven, it \ndoes not provide for conscious clause protection so someone, maybe they \nare in a Catholic hospital and they do not agree with providing \nabortion services. They would be required to do things in certain \ncircumstances--maybe that is not one of them--but certain circumstances \nto which they would not agree.\n  This is a big part of this debate, and it has certainly elevated it \nhere. The American public does not want the abortion language in the \nbill. Mr. President, 6 in 10, in a CNN survey, say they do not want it \nin this bill. In fact, one-quarter of House Democrats voted for the \nStupak-Pitts amendment. That is the compromise that continued on the \nHyde principle and said we will not fund this.\n  National Right to Life, I mentioned earlier, goes through some of the \nspecifics on this language.\n  I will just say, where we are right now all seems so odd to me. We \nare in the final days of Advent season. We are here when we should be \nhome with our families. I am missing a lot of the celebration of the \nChristmas season. This is the final days of Advent. Advent is the \nseason of anticipating the birth of a child. It is a season of joy, a \nseason of happiness. You are looking forward to the day of the birth of \nChrist, December 25. That is the season we are in right now. It is a \nseason of joy. How sad we might see the end of lives of children in \nthis bill, in this season of joy. It does not have to be that way. It \nshould not be that way.\n  But now this is, I believe, the central issue in this health care \ndebate. If this body passes this bill--and I do not think it should--it \ngoes back to the House of Representatives, where Congressman Stupak and \na group of others\n\n[[Page S13622]]\n\nhave said they will not support the language if it has the abortion \nlanguage.\n  The issue of funding abortion has now become a central issue in the \nhealth care debate. It should not be there. It is wrong. It is opposed \nby the American public. I ask my colleagues on the other side, please, \nplease, please take this out. It does not belong here. It is not the \nthing to do. It is harmful. It is hurtful to the country, and it does \nnot belong anywhere near the health care bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, much has been spoken about the need for \nAmericans to access safe and affordable drugs and therapies. We know \nthat the pharmaceutical industry has cut numerous deals to protect \ntheir interests and line their pockets at the expense of the taxpayers, \nincluding seniors and the uninsured. I don't think it is a secret that \nPhRMA cut a deal with the White House to block legislation allowing for \nthe importation of safe and affordable prescription drugs from Canada \nand other approved countries. And it seems that PhRMA cut a deal to \nline their pockets by locking in more expensive brand drugs in the \nMedicare Part D doughnut hole. Finally, it appears that PhRMA made sure \nthat their profitable biologic medicines are protected for 12 years \nfrom competition from FDA-licensed safe and affordable biosimilars.\n  This legislation has so many sweetheart deals that we probably \nhaven't even found them all yet.\n  Today, I am filing an amendment that improves the biologic pathway in \nthe bill. It creates a fair pathway for competitive biologics that \nbalances incentives for innovation with patient access to safe and \naffordable biosimilar medicines.\n  It is a fact that the cost to discover biologic therapies can be \nastronomical. That, unfortunately, leads to some patients being unable \nto afford the needed therapies. Patients benefit from continued \ninnovation but they also benefit from safe and affordable competitive \nbiologics that may not occur under the proposal in the Reid bill. My \namendment ensures that incentives to innovate remain in the law.\n  It is accepted that biologic therapies are different than chemical \nmedicines. That is why there needs to be a unique structure for the \napproval and licensure of biosimilar medicines.\n  In creating a pathway to competitive biologics we need to strike a \nbalance that provides patients greater access to more affordable, safe \nbiologic therapies and ensures innovation continues to thrive.\n  Today, biologics have a monopoly for years and years. I am worried \nthat the underlying legislation would allow biologics to game the \nsystem and block competition beyond the 12 years provided in the bill. \nSome have argued that brand biologic companies will be able to stack \n12-year periods of exclusivity on top of each other. My amendment \naddresses this issue.\n  My amendment also addresses patient safety issues. FDA has very \nspecific recommendations that I wanted to recognize in this pathway. \nAccess to safe, competitive biologics is only as good as the therapies \nare safe. My amendment seeks to ensure the pathway for generic biologic \ntherapies is as safe and effective as the original product.\n  Highlights of my amendment include 10 years of initial data \nexclusivity for the original product--a decade is enough. Reid--Hatch/\nEnzi/Hagan, has 12 years of data exclusivity. It also includes two \nextra years of data exclusivity if the manufacturer conducts additional \nresearch and finds new indications for the original medicine. My \namendment also incentivizes additional innovation and encourages second \ngeneration therapies to come to market as soon as possible rather than \ncompanies waiting until the end of the initial exclusivity period to \nintroduce new versions. Additionally, prescribing physician must \nauthorize therapeutic appropriateness for a biosimilar and finally, the \ncompetitive biologic manufacturer is required to ensure the biosimilar \nmedicine is safe and effective through clinical studies.\n  My goal in introducing this amendment is to ensure patient access to \nsafe and competitive biosimilar medicines, to guarantee innovation \nthrives and to bring down cost while ensuring safety and innovation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in a few hours, we in the Senate by our \nvotes will be able to clear the way for the United States at long last \nto join every other industrial nation in the world and declare that \nhealth care is a right.\n  I thank our leader, Senator Reid, for his extraordinary courage and \nleadership during these many weeks as we have been able to bring \ntogether the necessary votes to move this legislation forward.\n  I thank Senator Baucus, Senator Dodd, and many of my colleagues who \nhave worked on so many provisions that are in the managers' amendment \nand are in the underlying bill.\n  For 23 years, I have been in Congress, and for 23 years I have been \nsupporting universal coverage. I believe every American should have \naccess to affordable, quality health insurance and health care. By our \nvotes later on this evening, we will have a chance to take a giant step \nforward in accomplishing that goal.\n  As I pointed out, the United States, although we spend more than any \nother nation in the world by far on health care, whether you want to do \nit in absolute dollars or on a per capita basis, we spend more than any \nother nation. Yet we are the only industrialized nation in the world \nthat does not provide universal insurance and universal care.\n  Americans have to make a difficult choice. If someone happens to be \nwalking on the ice tonight and does not have health insurance and they \nfall and hurt themselves, they have to make a decision whether their \narm or leg hurts badly enough to go see a doctor or perhaps to have an \nx-ray to see whether a bone has been broken because they do not have \nthe money to pay for that type of care.\n  Many people go without checkups because they cannot afford the cost \nof seeing a doctor today. They do not have insurance or their insurance \ndoes not cover what they need.\n  Many people who are on medications have to decide whether they can \nsplit their pills to make their dollars last a little bit longer \nbecause they literally are choosing between taking their medicines or \nhaving food on the table in the United States of America in 2009, the \nwealthiest nation in the world.\n  We have a chance to change that situation. One can argue this issue \non many grounds, and I have. One can argue we need to bring down the \ngrowth rate of health care costs, and I certainly believe that or one \ncan argue that we need to provide more people with health insurance or \nwe need to take on the health insurance industry. But I think the most \npersuasive argument for passing this legislation is the moral argument. \nIt is the right thing to do. It is what America stands for.\n  I met with some students this week, and we were talking about the \nbill. These were high school students. They said it is the right thing \nto do, and they are right. This is the right thing for our Nation to \ndo, to make sure everybody has access to affordable health care.\n  In Maryland, this takes on a special note because I know my \ncolleagues have heard me talk frequently about Deamonte Driver, a 12-\nyear-old who lived in Prince George's County, MD, just 7 miles from \nhere. His mom tried to get him to a dentist because he had a toothache. \nThey did not have insurance. No dentist would see him. After many \nefforts to try to get him to a dentist, he ultimately went to an \nemergency room. They operated on him because the tooth had become \nabscessed because of the delay in getting care. He needed emergency \nsurgery. It went into his brain, and he lost his life because in the \nUnited States of America, we could not provide someone who was poor \naccess to see a dentist. Tonight we can change that by our votes on \nthis bill.\n  At long last, we have a chance to do something about that. In the \nlast Congress, I introduced a bill that provided universal care by \nsaying each of us has a personal responsibility to make sure we have \nhealth insurance. I did that because I think the first thing we need to \ndo as a prerequisite to health care reform is to be sure everyone is \ncovered, everyone is in the system.\n  This bill and the managers' amendment not only provides for universal \ncoverage but makes it affordable for every person in this country.\n\n[[Page S13623]]\n\n  We use the Congressional Budget Office as the objective scorekeeper. \nEverybody agrees to that--Democrats and Republicans. They are the \nprofessionals who tell us whether our numbers add up. The Congressional \nBudget Office tells us the bill with the managers' amendment will mean \n3l million more Americans will have health coverage as a result of the \nenactment of this legislation. That will take our under 65 group from \n83 percent coverage to 94 percent coverage, and for all Americans we \nwill attain 98 percent. Sure, we want to get to 100 percent, but we are \nmaking a giant step forward for universal coverage.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us that for the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans, they will either see no increase in their health \ninsurance premiums from what it would otherwise be or they will see a \ndecrease, a decline, a reduction in the cost of the health insurance \npremiums they would otherwise have to pay. For all Americans, they are \ngoing to have a better insurance product that is going to cover more. \nThey are going to have less out-of-pocket costs than they would \notherwise have. That is what the Congressional Budget Office tells us. \nWhy is that true? The legislation provides for prevention and wellness. \nIt provides that preventive services will be required to be covered in \nyour insurance plan.\n  We even do that for our government programs by providing an enhanced \nmatch for States that expand the Medicaid program for our poor to cover \nthe preventive services. It covers oral health for our children as a \nrequired part of a required essential coverage package and provides \nadditional help to help people through education and demonstration \nprograms.\n  I could give many examples, but let me give one example from the \npoint of view of trying to expand preventive services, and that is \ncolon cancer. We know that if you have colon screenings, you actually \ncan discover a polyp before it becomes cancerous. You can avoid cancer. \nThe test costs a couple hundred dollars. If you do not have a test and \nyou have cancer and need an operation, that costs tens of thousands of \ndollars.\n  Prevention and wellness works. It brings down the growth rate of \nhealth care costs. It saves us money. This bill invests billions in \nprevention and wellness directly and through required coverage in our \nprivate and public insurance programs.\n  We bring down the growth rate of health care costs by managing \ncomplex diseases. We know we spend most of our health care dollars \nbecause of major diseases. This bill helps us manage those diseases so \npeople can get the care they need in a more cost-effective way.\n  The legislation invests in health information technology so we can \nreduce the administrative costs of health care. I was surprised to find \nthat Maryland, similar to most States, if you go into an emergency \nroom, it is very unlikely they will have your medical records. If they \ndo not have your medical records because their information technology \nis not sophisticated enough to get those records, then surely they are \ngoing to do tests they would not otherwise have to do, which ends up \ncosting us all more money.\n  By using health information technology, we can not only take better \ncare of you, we can do it in a less costly way. By reducing the number \nof uninsured dramatically, we save money. How? Because someone who is \nuninsured who should see a doctor or go to a clinic instead goes to an \nemergency room which is much more expensive. By the way, they sometimes \ndo not pay their bills.\n  Each of our families, if you live in Maryland and you have insurance, \nyou pay an extra $1,100 a year on your health insurance because you are \npaying for people who do not have health insurance and they access the \nsystem in a more costly way. This bill brings down the cost. You bring \ndown the cost of health care because of competition. We believe in \ncompetition, market forces. That is what made America great.\n  If you live in Maryland and you have private insurance, 71 percent of \nMarylanders are insured by two companies. That is not competitive. I \nhave talked with more and more business owners who tell me they have no \nchoice. There is one plan they can get. If they do not like that plan, \nthere is no insurance they can get. That is not competition.\n\n  This bill brings competition by the exchanges that will invite more \ninsurance companies to participate in our States and by the program \nthat is in the managers' package that allows us, for the first time, to \nhave plans available across State lines. That will be particularly \nhelpful for a State such as Maryland, where many of our employers \nemploy people who not only live in Maryland but live in Virginia, live \nin Pennsylvania, live in Delaware, live in West Virginia. That will \ncertainly help us.\n  This legislation also reduces our Federal budget deficit. That is a \nchallenge. Let me tell you why it is a challenge. There are two \ndifferent issues. Reducing health care cost growth and reducing Federal \nspending are two different issues because to get everybody insured, \nwhich will help us bring down health care costs, we need to provide \nsubsidies so people can afford their health insurance and provide \nbusinesses some help.\n  As more and more people become insured, they can use our tax \nadvantages and pay less income taxes by using before-tax dollars rather \nthan aftertax dollars. All that costs revenue to the Federal Treasury, \nso it is a challenge to bring this in without adding to the deficit, \nbut we knew we had to do that. The Congressional Budget Office, again \nour objective scorekeeper, tells us that in the 10-year budget window, \nit will reduce the Federal budget by $131 billion, but in the next 10 \nyears, which all of us will admit is difficult to predict, they tell us \nwe can reduce Federal spending by one-half percent of our GDP, which \ncan translate to over $1 trillion.\n  My point is, we are reducing the deficit while we are reducing the \ngrowth rate of health care costs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office does not score us for a lot of the \nresults from our prevention programs. They cannot assume less people \nwill get cancer and, therefore, the preventive services will save us \nmoney. I am convinced the dollar savings will be a lot greater than \nthat for health care costs, for our economy, and for the taxpayers of \nthis country.\n  This legislation protects consumers. That is why the consumer union \nsupports moving this bill forward. The insurance reform that is in the \nunderlying bill is well known. I tell you, the people of Maryland want \nthat. I am sure the people of Massachusetts also do.\n  The insurance reform says: Look, let's get rid of preexisting \nconditions. Let's not let insurance companies pick and choose whom they \nwant to insure. They should insure everyone. The managers' package \nmakes that available immediately for our children. We eliminate the \nlifetime caps, put restrictions on the annual caps. We make immediately \navailable coverage for children under the age of 26 and provide a \nreinsurance program for those between 55 and 64.\n  We provide for an independent appeal from an insurance company's \ndecision on coverage. Too many insurance companies have an internal \nmechanism to determine coverage which is stacked against the \npolicyholder.\n  The managers' amendment provides for loss ratios. Loss ratios mean a \ncertain amount of the insurance dollar must go back to pay benefits. We \nknow a large amount is spent on advertising, spent on salaries, spent \non profits. For the first time, the consumers will know how much of \nthat is actually going to their benefits, and we start to put into law \nthat a certain amount must be returned to the policyholders in benefits \nand important consumer protection information.\n  I am particularly pleased the Patients' Bill of Rights, an amendment \nI offered, is included in the managers' package. I thank the leader for \nincluding that.\n  In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a provision that I authored \nincluded a lot of the Patients' Bill of Rights in the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs. President Clinton, in 1998, by executive order, \nextended it to all the government programs.\n  We passed that bill in the House and it passed in the Senate, but we \nnever passed it in both bodies and sent it to the President the basic \nBill of Rights for patients. We are making a giant\n\n[[Page S13624]]\n\nstep forward in the managers' package to cover those Bill of Rights. \nLet me give an example. Access to emergency care that I authored is now \nin this bill. There are insurance companies today that tell you, you \nhave to get preauthorization before you can go to an emergency room. \nThink about that. You are having chest pains and sweating and you try \nto find your insurance card to call your insurance company? That is not \nwhat a doctor tells you to do. You go to an emergency room.\n  Suppose the closest emergency room is not in your network. Does that \nmean you will not get full coverage? Some insurance companies say that \nis the case. We put in the prudent layperson standard: If it is prudent \nto go to the emergency room to get care, the insurance company must \ncover your bill.\n  I cannot tell you the people I talked with on both sides--I had chest \npains, sweating, et cetera; I went to the emergency room, found out I \ndid not have a heart attack and almost had one when my insurance \ncompany refused to pay the bill. I did what the doctor told me to do, \nand now they are not covering it. This provision will make sure that \nperson's bill is covered.\n  Frankly, we have had people who delayed treatment who should have \ngone to an emergency room whose circumstances became much worse and \nsome actually died. We cover access to emergency care in the managers' \npackage, an important consumer protection.\n\n  We also allow you, as the subscriber, to determine whom you want your \nprimary care provider to be. We give you protection as you make your \ndecision as to whom your primary care provider will be. If you have a \nchild, the pediatrician can be the primary care provider. If you are a \nwoman, the OB-GYN can be your primary care provider. Many insurance \ncompanies deny you that today. That protection is in this bill for \neveryone.\n  I am also pleased to have joined Senator Brown in a matter I worked \nvery closely on when I was in the House for clinical trials. A lot of \ninsurance companies today will not cover the cost of clinical trials, \neven though it might be the best care option available for an \nindividual and, by the way, sometimes compromises the integrity of the \nclinical trial if they can't get a representative group to participate. \nWell, we provide protection in this bill to cover you for clinical \ntrials that your insurance company has to cover.\n  So there is a lot in this bill for consumer protection--the bill of \nrights. Mr. President, there is a long list of organizations that \nsupport the patients' rights amendment that I offered, from the AARP, \nto the Consumers Union, Families USA, National Women's Law Center--all \nthe different specialists. It is an important amendment, and I am glad \nto see it is in the managers' amendment.\n  I am proud of a major new effort that has been included in the \nmanagers' amendment. I want to talk about minority health for one \nmoment, and I particularly want to thank a member of my staff, \nPriscilla Ross, who has been working on this issue for many years. She \nhas pointed out to me the vulnerability of minority populations in \nAmerica. Let me give a couple of examples.\n  The life expectancy for an African American is 5.3 years less than \nsomeone who is White. Minorities are two times more likely to have \ndiabetes. African Americans have 33 percent higher death rates for \nheart disease than the White population. And the list goes on and on.\n  Access to care in the minority communities is much less than in the \ngeneral communities at large. So we needed to do something about this, \nand the amendment I offered, which is included in the managers' \npackage, elevates minority health in our government agencies. It \nprovides statutory authority for the Office of Minority Health at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. It codifies the network of \nminority health offices located within the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the \nFood and Drug Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration, and the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration.\n  Mr. President, it elevates the Office of Minority Health at the \nNational Institutes of Health from a center to an institute. That is \nmaking a commitment to attack this disparity that currently exists in \nhealth care in America.\n  Let me talk about one other issue in this bill that I am proud to \nwork with Senator Sanders on which involves the community health \ncenters and primary care. Senator Sanders was able to get $10 billion \nin the managers' package so that we could dramatically expand access to \ncare. You see, if you are a Latino in America, there is a 35-percent \nchance you have no dependable source of health care, compared to 15 \npercent in the White community. We need more federally qualified health \ncenters. You can have universal health coverage, but if you don't have \nfacilities, it will be difficult to get access to care. The community \nhealth center expansion will provide access in underserved areas. \nMaryland needs this help, and there is substantial investment in \nprimary care in this legislation.\n  This bill will help. It will help those who have good insurance \ncoverage today by protecting that coverage and making sure it is \navailable tomorrow and stopping the erosion that is taking place today \nwith insurance companies cutting back on what is covered and employers \nputting more of the cost on the employee. This legislation will help. \nIt will help small business owners who today have very little choice as \nto what insurance plan they can get. They are paying 20 percent more, \non average, than a large company pays for the same insurance \nprotection. This will offer choice.\n  We also offer tax credits to help small businesses in order to make \nit easier for small businesses--which are the economic engine of \nAmerica--to be able to provide health benefits for their employees. It \nwill help individuals who cannot find insurance today by having large \npools they can enter without being discriminated against by the way the \nactuaries work and will provide subsidies for low-wage workers so they \ncan afford the coverage.\n  The bill will help our Medicare population by starting to close the \ndoughnut hole on prescription drugs, making prescription medicines much \nmore affordable for our seniors, and providing preventative services, \nsuch as annual physicals so that seniors can stay healthy. And it \nprovides sustainability to the Medicare Program.\n  Most importantly, this legislation reflects the values of our \nNation--affordable, quality health care for all Americans. I am proud \nto support this legislation, the managers' package, and the underlying \nbill, and I urge my colleagues to be on the right side of history. I \nsupport moving forward with health care reform.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to be here \nthis evening. I thank Senator Cardin for a great presentation on the \nreal facts behind this bill.\n  You know, being from Alaska, we see a lot of storms. We saw a great \nblizzard here which brought a lot of snow. I see a lot of blizzards and \nstorms in Alaska. But I have to be honest with you, I have never seen \nanything like the blizzard of misinformation I have seen in Washington \nregarding this bill.\n  Over the course of the next few minutes, I want to talk about the \ngeneral bill and what it means for all Americans, including Alaskans, \nand then specifically about the effect on Alaska.\n  First, I want to walk through a couple of large issues. I know people \nwatching are hearing this over and over while we are on this bill, and \nthe details of it, but I think it is important that we repeat it enough \nfor people to be reminded of the positive impacts the bill will have on \nAmerica and my State of Alaska. It is not a perfect bill. There are \npieces I would like to have improved, and I am sure everyone in this \nChamber feels the same. But it is a step in the right direction--a \nsignificant step.\n  On the financial end, in the first 10 years, the bill reduces our \ndeficit by $130 billion. In the next 10 years, with the improvements in \nthe managers' amendment and what it did for the deficit reduction, it \nis now $1.2 trillion--a significant impact on the national debt.\n  People call my office and say: How does it reduce the debt? I remind \nthem that between Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, Indian Health Services, \nand many\n\n[[Page S13625]]\n\nother health care programs that we deliver, anything we do to improve \nthe system will mean taxpayers will save money. So, again, $130 billion \nin the first 10 years, and the next 10 years, $1.2 trillion in deficit \nreduction.\n  The other issue--and again these are broad sweeps--is stronger \nmedical loss ratios. This is important because this starts now, 2010, \nonce this bill is passed, a few months after implementation. Health \ninsurers will be required to spend more of their premiums--which really \nare your premiums--on clinical services and quality activities, with \nless going to administration--advertising, profits, excessive pay \npackages. If they do not adhere to the new limits, they will have to \npay rebates to the policyholders. These stricter limits will continue \neven after the exchange starts in 2011 and apply to all plans, \nincluding grandfathered plans. That is a significant benefit to the \nindividual--the person who has to pay the premium.\n  Accountability for excess rate increases: The health insurer's \nparticipation in the exchange will depend on its performance. Insurers \nthat jack up their premiums before the exchange begins will be \nexcluded--a powerful incentive to keep premiums affordable.\n  There is an immediate ban on preexisting conditions for children \nunder the age of 18. This is in the managers' package. To me, this is \nunbelievable. Many families struggle, and sometimes the parents will \nforego their health care in order to make sure their child is as \nhealthy as possible. But when a child has a preexisting condition, just \nto get coverage for them is sometimes almost impossible. So this makes \nsure that no insurance company can ban or deny them access to health \ncare with preexisting conditions.\n\n  Ensuring the needy have access to care: The use of annual limits on \nbenefits will be tightly restricted, ensuring access to needed care. \nAnd those limits will be prohibited completely by 2014. Starting in \n2010, new policies will eliminate the lifetime caps.\n  Also, on the broader scheme, there will be innovation. Medicare will \nbe able to test new models. I can't tell you the number of times I have \nhad a public hearing or a public meeting in Alaska, or I have had phone \ncalls come in from people who have asked me: Can we do something \ndifferent? How can we improve Medicare? This creates some new \nincentives to move forward on innovation within our Medicare system.\n  When you look at the small business end of it, the package improves, \nincluding starting the health insurance tax credit in 2010, with almost \n$40 billion of tax credits. Tax savings to small business will be \navailable.\n  Transparency: New requirements will ensure that insurers and health \ncare providers report on their performance, allowing patients to make \nthe best possible choice.\n  The next issue--multistate options. This is something during my \ncampaign I talked a lot about--a program we all have in Congress, and \nso do almost 4 million Federal employees and their dependents. How do \nwe replicate that to give a benefit to the taxpayers of this country, \nif they want to access something similar? Well, now we have the \nmultistate option. Health insurance carriers will offer plans under the \nsupervision of the Office of Personnel Management, the same entity that \noversees the health plans of Members of Congress and for Federal \nemployees. At least one plan must be a nonprofit, and the plans will be \navailable nationwide. This will truly promote competition and choice \nfor individuals.\n  Another new idea, which Senator Wyden had sponsored for many months \nand talked a lot about, is free choice vouchers, giving more choices to \nindividuals with their money.\n  As mentioned earlier, the community health centers: It is estimated \nthis bill will now be able to put in place almost 10,000 community \nhealth centers throughout this country, providing easy and affordable \naccess for folks.\n  On the small business end, I want to again just broadly sweep on \nthis. The credits will be available on a sliding scale to small \nbusinesses, those small businesses with fewer than 25 employees, and \naverage annual wages of less than $50,000. All small businesses will \ntruly benefit, but if you are a small business with 50 or less \nemployees, you will be exempt. If you want to provide insurance to your \nemployees, and you are in a small group of 25 employees or under, there \nwill be credits available for you.\n  The bill also clarifies part-time because we have so many part-time \nemployees who work within the seasonal businesses in Alaska--retail, \nfishing, tourism. It makes sure that small businesses are not hampered \nby this legislation but enhanced. Again, 96 percent of the small \nbusinesses will be exempt from this law, unless they decide to provide \nhealth care, and then they can get some benefits through tax credits--\nup to $40 billion available.\n  I am a member of a group of freshmen who came to Washington this \ncycle. We came with all kinds of ideas on how we wanted to change \nWashington in short order. We sat down with this bill in mind, and as a \ngroup of freshmen, we put together a cost containment package with many \nideas--very technical in a lot of ways, but just in the broader sense, \nit creates administration simplification. It helps ensure we go after \nhealth care fraud. With regard to Medicare system upgrades, we make \nsure that as we develop new systems for Medicare and for the providers, \nwe do some pay-for-performance testing, which will save individuals, \nsave Medicare, and save the Medicare system over time.\n  The freshmen spent many weeks on the cost containment package we put \ntogether, and I want to give credit to Senator Warner for leading the \ncharge, though everyone participated to try to make a difference and \nbring cost containment to the issue of health care.\n  I want to go through a quick list on this broader perspective of the \nlegislation and what happens now, because we hear always from the other \nside that so many things are delayed way out; that they will not happen \nright away. Let me walk through several items that happen right away.\n  The Senate bill will make it illegal for insurance companies to drop \ncoverage for Americans who are sick--basically, they call them \nrescissions--beginning 6 months after the date of enactment. Insurance \ncompanies will be barred from limiting the total benefits Americans can \nuse over the course of a year--otherwise known as lifetime caps--\nbeginning 6 months after the date of enactment. Affordable insurance \ncoverage options will be made available for high-risk pools of \nAmericans who have been uninsured and have been denied coverage because \nthey have preexisting conditions, effective 90 days after enactment.\n  Early retirees between 55 and 64: I hear from a lot of them who are \ntrying to figure out, as they are now retired and still have some \ncoverage from their former employer, but it is expensive. What this \ndoes is set up a new program, and access to a program that will reduce \ntheir premiums beginning 90 days after enactment. Insurance companies \nwill be required to start posting their overhead costs on a public Web \nsite so consumers can better compare the deal they are getting \neffective July 1, 2010.\n  Insurance companies will have to start providing external review \nprocesses beginning 6 months after the date of enactment. Dependents \nwill be able to receive coverage up to the age of 26 on their parents' \npolicy, beginning 6 months after the date of enactment.\n  This is one again I hear so much when I am back home and from e-mails \nand letters, people wanting to keep their kids on their policy. Again, \ncoverage up to the age of 26.\n  The insurance companies will be required to begin covering preventive \nservices and immunization without copays on payments beginning 6 months \nafter the date of enactment. Seniors will have access to dramatic \ndiscounts in the purchase of name brand prescription drugs in the \nMedicare Part D Program beginning July 1.\n  As I said earlier, children under age 18 cannot be denied for \npreexisting coverage.\n  There will be free preventive services for seniors--$500 reduction in \nthe doughnut hole for seniors.\n  Again, the issue with Medicare, I want to say, when we started this \neffort to reform health care, Medicare was in trouble and could be in \nserious trouble by 2017. This legislation adds 10 more years to \nMedicare.\n  To be specific to Alaska--and I will be brief on this but I think it \nis important--many of these issues I laid out\n\n[[Page S13626]]\n\nare important to Alaska, but there are quite a few very specific. \nFirst, I remind folks what the impact is currently in Alaska--133,000 \nAlaskans do not currently have insurance; 27,000 residents who now buy \nexpensive individual premiums will now get affordable coverage. We \ndouble enrollment in Alaska's Kid Care, what we call here in Washington \nSCHIP, to more than 15,000 young people, ending the hidden tax on \nfamilies. About $119 million is spent on uncompensated care, averaging \nabout $1,900 per year. By creating a larger program as we are doing \nhere, we can eliminate that cost.\n  I have heard over and over about Medicare Advantage. Let me tell you \nhow that works for Alaskans. What we will be doing, we have 60,000 \nMedicare beneficiaries paying a price for excessive overpayments in \nhigher premiums, even though 99 percent of our Alaskan seniors do not \nparticipate in Medicare Advantage.\n  What you hear when you hear about Medicare Advantage--and those who \nhave it I am sure enjoy it--but in my State we are subsidizing that \neven though 99 percent of Alaska seniors do not take that program. So \nwe pay an extra approximately $90 to subsidize that program for those \nextra things they claim they have. The reality is that was supposed to \nbe run by the private sector, saving money to Medicare. It is now \ncosting us more, it is costing my State $90 per Medicare family.\n  About 10,600 Alaskans hit the doughnut hole in Alaska through the \nMedicare drug coverage, which can cost some of our seniors up to $4,000 \nadditional a year. They will see a 50-percent reduction.\n  As I mentioned under early retirees on the national program, 7,300 \nAlaskans will be affected in a positive way; 8,600 Alaska small \nbusinesses could be helped by the small business tax credit. Again, \nAlaska is benefiting a great deal from this legislation.\n  Even more specific--and these are items I added specifically in the \nbill to focus on Alaska's specific issues. I thank Senator Harkin on \nthis next one, which is important. It is providing more primary care \nproviders. It is a loan repayment program. I know he has been an \nadvocate of getting more primary providers within the system--\nphysicians, nurse practitioners, physicians assistants--from $3,500 to \n$5,000 for the National Health Service Corps in this country. It serves \nhealth professional shortage areas, including 77 in Alaska.\n  In part, because of this, and due to other major expansion, the \nSenate HELP Committee has estimated the bill will attract 24,000 new \nprimary care providers. If you want to make a difference to the health \ncare system, this is one critical piece. Again, Senator Harkin, I know, \nhas been an advocate for this for many years. To see us get to this \nstate and be able to move this forward is significant. It will have a \npositive impact.\n  Another one which is a program that is a great benefit for hospitals \nin Soldotna, Juneau, and Sitka, is an amendment which reauthorizes a \nMedicare project supporting hospitals in rural communities in smaller \nStates, extending that for an additional 5 years, moving it from 10 \nStates to 20 States and creating another 15 hospitals that can \nparticipate.\n  Alaska health care task force--specifically in this legislation, to \ndeal with our Medicare provider issue in Alaska but also our TRICARE, \nmaking sure we deliver the right kind of hospital and medical care to \nour veterans.\n  More physicians assistants--we inserted specific language to make \nsure we allow loan repayments for physician assistant teaching faculty, \nto be also included in loan forgiveness. Last year we had 375 PAs who \nhandled 1.2 million office visits in Alaska.\n  After 21 years, the Indian Health Service is now in this bill to be \nreauthorized. For 21 years it has not been reauthorized.\n  There are many great things in this legislation, from a broader \nperspective, as I mentioned earlier in my comments, but also very \nspecific to Alaska.\n  Could it be better? Absolutely. But do we think we have a piece of \nlegislation that is going to make an impact on people's lives? Yes, we \ndo. If we want to keep it the same old business as usual, I guarantee, \nin 5 years or 10 years from now we will be in this hall, trying to \nfigure out what to do at a bigger crisis.\n  This is the right decision. It will be an honor for me later this \nevening to make a vote in the affirmative to move past the cloture \nvote, getting on to voting for this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from Alaska for \nall of his hard work on this bill. I think it is fair to say the \nSenator from Alaska, a new Member of the Senate, I might add, has been \nvery much involved in this bill and his focus has been on rural health \nand better health care for native Alaskans. As the Senator knows, the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act, which also covers Native Alaskans, \nis included in this bill. I thank the Senator from Alaska for insisting \non that and for being a strong supporter of making sure we do help \nprimary care practitioners, both doctors but also nurse practitioners, \nphysicians assistants, other health care and primary health care people \nwho are going to serve in our small towns and rural communities. The \nSenator from Alaska has been one of our best leaders on making sure \nthat we have this in the bill. I thank him for that very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have been listening on C-SPAN \n2, in addition to having the privilege of being over here on the floor, \nto this debate that has been going on. The debate has been going on \never since the summer when we in the committee were fashioning this \nlegislation. I must say that to hear one side of this debate, I would \nnot recognize all of those hearings we had last summer and all the \nmarkup we did in the Finance Committee last September because what has \nbeen presented to the Senate, and what has been presented to the public \nthrough press conferences by the opposition to this bill in most cases \nsimply is not correct.\n  I want to give a couple of examples here this evening. In attacking \nthis, saying what dastardly things this is going to do for the country \nand how this is going to increase costs and raise taxes--each one of \nthese things can be refuted. But it is a typical tactic that, when you \nwant to attack something and tear it down, you go after a specific item \ninstead in order to obfuscate, which then misses the point of the whole \npiece of legislation.\n  The point of the whole piece of legislation is to make health care \navailable and affordable, in most cases through health insurance, in \nother cases through Medicare and Medicaid, and making it available, \nefficient, and affordable.\n  I want to give one specific example. It is a technical term in the \ninsurance industry called the ``medical loss ratio.'' It is the ratio \nin what an insurance company actually pays out in medical claims as \nopposed to what it pays for administrative expenses such as marketing, \ninsurance agent commissions, underwriting, and an insurance company's \nprofit. It is interesting that the term medical loss ratio tells you a \nlot about the insurance industry, because if you look at it only from \ntheir perspective, this percentage is their loss but in fact the \npercentage is the amount of the premium dollar that goes to actual \nmedical care. What this amendment, this managers' amendment we are \ngoing to vote on in less than 2 hours right now says, is it causes a \nspecific ratio so you are getting a high amount of return on the \ninsurance premium dollar.\n  Let me give an example. This is an example of the medical loss ratio \nof a number of small employers--small employers, that is group \npolicies--as well as policies in the individual market. This is where \nyou have an employer who pays for your health insurance but it is a \nsmall employer, usually under 50 employees.\n  This is where you have policies that are given to individuals. The \npremiums usually are much higher if you are an individual buying \ninsurance than if you are buying it in a group, by an employer-\nsponsored group.\n  These are specific examples in a particular year of the loss ratio. \nInterestingly, for Aetna, here, at 82 percent--that is not actually a \nloss to Aetna. It is interesting they call it a loss. That is actually \n82 cents of premium dollar,\n\n[[Page S13627]]\n\nan insured policyholder's premium dollar, that actually goes to medical \ncoverage. That is good.\n  United Health: 79; Humana, down at 77--77 cents of that $1 are going \nto health care.\n  And the balance, 23 cents, is going to things such as administrative \nexpenses, paying for insurance agents, commissions, paying for their \nprofit. What does the bill do? The bill brings that up to 80 percent. \nAnd that is all policies, not just the new policies on the health \ninsurance exchange. That is not just the policies insurance companies \nare going to write new for the small group. It is all those policies \nthat are in existence.\n  Look at the individual. The experience isn't quite as good. As a \nmatter of fact, here is a company, Coventry, that was only paying 66 \ncents on every premium dollar that was actually going to health care, \nand the rest of that, 34 cents, was going to profit and administrative \nexpenses and executive salaries and bonuses and so forth. And lo and \nbehold, what we are going to vote on tonight in less than 2 hours is \ngoing to have to be 80 cents on every dollar. If they don't make that \n80 cents on every dollar, they are going to get penalized. We are \nputting some real teeth in this on insurance companies for the first \ntime.\n  Look at the large group, the employer-sponsored insurance, the large \ngroup. These are five of the larger insurance companies. You can see \nthey have a pretty good record thus far: WellPoint, 85, Humana, 82 \ncents on every dollar. They have a better record because they have a \nlot more individual lives over which they can spread the insurance \nrisk, and so they can pay out more in health insurance for health care \nand take out less for administrative expenses. But in this bill \ntonight, in an hour and 45 minutes, we are going to raise that to 85 \npercent, 85 cents on every dollar.\n  Before I came to the Senate--and I have had the good fortune of \nserving the public for now going on over 35 years--I had the privilege \nof being elected to one of the toughest jobs I have ever had in a \nlifetime of public service, and that was the elected insurance \ncommissioner of Florida. It is also the elected treasurer. That \nposition has morphed into what is called the chief financial officer. \nIt is a member of the Florida cabinet. For 6 years, I got to see what \ninsurance companies will do. I can tell you, instead of 85 percent and \n80 percent that we are going to require in this bill of every insurance \npremium dollar they pay out in medical care, I can tell you that some \nof the insurance companies I regulated back in the State of Florida \nwere down in the sixties. A lot of that was going into big-time \nadministrative offices, all kinds of jets, all kinds of padded expense \naccounts. You can see what we are trying to do here with this bill \ntonight.\n  Let's ask, why do we have to have a ratio such as this and why is it \nimportant? It certainly is getting more medical care to the individual \npolicyholder. But listen to this: A study that was done by the Senate \nCommerce Committee shows that the ratios are often below what is \nconsidered to be fair. Our Commerce Committee found that in the small \nbusiness market, those with fewer than 50 employees, insurers spend \nonly 79 cents out of every dollar on health care. That is in the \nCommerce Committee study. In the individual market, it is even worse. \nIt is 74 cents. In the individual market, the insurer keeps more than a \nquarter of every individual premium dollar for overhead and profit.\n  We need to ensure that the policyholder's premiums and the Federal \nsubsidies that are going into the purchase of private health insurance \non the exchange are used for actual medical care and not for wasteful \nadministrative spending and marketing and profits. If we don't do this \nkind of thing, regulating insurance companies, then they are going to \ntake advantage. They are going to take the advantage of making more \nmoney at the expense of patient care.\n  I want to give an example. In spite of this recession, this economic \nrecession we are in and the increasing unemployment over the past year, \nwhat has happened to the big insurance companies? They are posting big \nprofits. They seem to be making more money by insuring fewer people. \nThe only way you make more money with fewer customers is you get rid of \nyour less profitable customers--in other words, the sick ones. That is \ncalled cherry-picking. You pick the good risks, which are the healthy \nones, and you try to get rid of the sick ones.\n  Let me give some examples. In the second quarter of this year, 2009, \nthe largest health insurance company, UnitedHealth Group, announced a \n3-month profit of $859 million in one quarter, and it more than doubled \nthe profits from the previous year. UnitedHealth earned these record \nprofits in spite of the fact that it was insuring 600,000 fewer people \nthan it did a year ago.\n  Let me give another example. In the second quarter of this year, \nanother large insurer, CIGNA, saw its profits jump 60 percent to $435 \nmillion. CIGNA earned these healthy profits in spite of the fact that \nit is insuring 200,000 fewer people than a year ago.\n  Another example: In the second quarter of 2009, Humana saw its \nprofits rise 34 percent to $282 million. Humana earned those healthy \nprofits in spite of the fact that it was insuring 100,000 fewer people \nthan a year ago.\n  At the same time they are dropping beneficiaries, insurance companies \nare paying their CEOs record salaries. In 2008, Aetna's CEO earned over \n$24 million. That is the equivalent of more than $66,000 per day. If \nyou want to know where some of that administrative padding that is not \ncoming back to the policyholder in health care is going, there is a \ngood example. Aetna's CEO earned over $24 million in that 1 year, 2008.\n  This medical loss ratio we are building into this bill on which we \nwill vote shortly builds on other insurance provisions in this \nlegislation which include guaranteed issue, which include prohibiting \ncancellations, banning preexisting conditions so that they can't \nterminate you or not insure you because they cook up some excuse, some \nflimsy excuse. I am not sure this has been brought out in this debate, \nbut I think it is worthy of consideration by the Senate.\n  In my closing minutes, I want to now step back and look at the \noverall package. Why is this a good deal for America, and why is it \ngoing to pass with an extraordinary threshold of 60 votes tonight? \nBecause we are not going to allow in this legislation excessive rate \nincreases in the health insurance exchange that is created new, that is \ngoing to insure 31 million new people. A lot of those people are people \nwho don't have insurance now. A company will be banned from that health \ninsurance exchange if it starts jacking up its rates excessively. You \ntalk about an insurance commissioner's dream, a regulator's dream--\noften your hands are tied and you are put into a straitjacket by the \ninsurance laws of your State and you can't crack the whip on them. We \nare cracking the whip on them in this legislation.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the program on Medicare other than \nMedicare fee-for-service called Medicare Advantage and how it is going \nto be whacked. I can tell you, for my State of Florida, there are \n950,000 senior citizens on Medicare Advantage, and it is not going to \nbe whacked. There have been a lot of statements out here by people \nattributing it to Florida, that it was going to be cut. In this bill we \nare voting on tonight and whenever we go to final passage, it is not.\n  By the way, there was a statement made here and something that was \nentered into the Record, a letter from a cardiologist from Jupiter, FL, \nwho was complaining about how cardiologists' fees are being squeezed \nand they may not be able in the future to take care of Medicare \nrecipients. I happen to know about this. I have been trying to help the \ncardiologists. But it was stated out here on the floor of the Senate \nthat it is this bill that is doing that. That has nothing to do with \nthis legislation. That has to do with the administrative functions of \ngovernment in existing law, CMS, that, in my opinion, has used \nincomplete data to cut cardiologists, particularly that are needed in a \nState such as Florida where, in fact, so many senior citizens are \nneeding the service in Medicare of cardiologists.\n  Here is another major thing in this bill. We are setting up a \nnationwide insurance plan that will be sold on these health insurance \nexchanges, and it will be operated by the Office of Personnel\n\n[[Page S13628]]\n\nManagement, the same office that governs the health insurance of \nFederal employees and Members of Congress.\n  There is a part in this bill on tort reform. It sets up State grants \nto test alternatives to litigation.\n  In my remaining minute, let's don't forget the 31 million more people \nwho are going to come in insured and how this, over time, is going to \nbring down the cost of Medicare. It is not going to cut Medicare. It is \ngoing to save Medicare. It is going to do that with efficiencies such \nas electronic records and accountable care organizations and emphasis \non primary care physicians.\n  To conclude, what else does the bill do? It lowers the deficit over \nthe next 10 years by $132 billion. In the second 10-year period, it is \ngoing to lower it by up to $1.3 trillion. That is serious deficit \nreduction.\n  On that happy note, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me thank Senator Nelson for his strong commitment to \nMedicare. I know of no Senator who fights harder for Medicare and for \nmaking prescription drugs more affordable to seniors than the Senator \nfrom Florida. He has contributed his great expertise as a former \ninsurance commissioner to the provisions we have in this bill on \ncracking down on insurance company abuses, and he just went through \nsome of them there. I thank my good friend Senator Nelson from Florida \nfor all of his great input into this bill.\n  In a few minutes, the Senate will close its doors for a brief recess. \nWhen those doors reopen just after midnight, the Senate will reconvene \nfor a historic purpose: to bring the promise of quality, affordable \nhealth care to millions of Americans. When those doors reopen, we who \nhave the privilege of serving in this body will have the opportunity to \nvote for hope and opportunity and new help for working families who \nworry every day that their illness will cause them to go bankrupt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/20/senate-section/article/S13628-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3284.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on women's access to health services.--Congress \n     finds that--\n       (A) the current civil justice system is eroding women's \n     access to obstetrical and gynecological services;\n       (B) the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG) has identified nearly half of the States as having a \n     medical liability insurance crisis that is threatening access \n     to high-quality obstetrical and gynecological services;\n       (C) because of the high cost of medical liability insurance \n     and the risk of being sued, one in seven obstetricians and \n     gynecologists have stopped practicing obstetrics and one in \n     five has decreased their number of high-risk obstetrics \n     patients; and\n       (D) because of the lack of availability of obstetrical \n     services, women--\n       (i) must travel longer distances and cross State lines to \n     find a doctor;\n       (ii) have longer waiting periods (in some cases months) for \n     appointments;\n       (iii) have shorter visits with their physicians once they \n     get appointments;\n       (iv) have less access to maternal-fetal medicine \n     specialists, physicians with the most experience and training \n     in the care of women with high-risk pregnancies; and\n       (v) have fewer hospitals with maternity wards where they \n     can deliver their child, potentially endangering the lives \n     and health of the woman and her unborn child.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. _03.

A court may allow a claimant to file an amended \n     pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the \n     claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of \n     supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after \n     weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a \n     substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the \n     claim for punitive damages.\n       (3) Separate proceeding.--At the request of any party in a \n     health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a \n     separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (4) Limitation where no compensatory damages are awarded.--\n     In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory \n     damages is rendered against a person, no punitive damages may \n     be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit against \n     such person.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     consider only the following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n     in a health care lawsuit may not exceed an amount equal to \n     two times the amount of economic damages awarded in the \n     lawsuit or $250,000, whichever is greater. The jury shall not \n     be informed of the limitation under the preceding sentence.\n\n[[Page S13631]]\n\n       (c) Liability of Health Care Providers.--\n       (1) In general.--A health care provider who prescribes, or \n     who dispenses pursuant to a prescription, a drug, biological \n     product, or medical device approved by the Food and Drug \n     Administration, for an approved indication of the drug, \n     biological product, or medical device, shall not be named as \n     a party to a product liability lawsuit invoking such drug, \n     biological product, or medical device and shall not be liable \n     to a claimant in a class action lawsuit against the \n     manufacturer, distributor, or product seller of such drug, \n     biological product, or medical device.\n       (2) Medical product.--The term ``medical product'' means a \n     drug or device intended for humans. The terms ``drug'' and \n     ``device'' have the meanings given such terms in sections \n     201(g)(1) and 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic \n     Act (21 U.S.C. 321), respectively, including any component or \n     raw material used therein, but excluding health care \n     services.\n\n     SEC. _09. AUTHORIZATION OF PAYMENT OF FUTURE DAMAGES TO \n                   CLAIMANTS IN HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any health care lawsuit, if an award of \n     future damages, without reduction to present value, equaling \n     or exceeding $50,000 is made against a party with sufficient \n     insurance or other assets to fund a periodic payment of such \n     a judgment, the court shall, at the request of any party, \n     enter a judgment ordering that the future damages be paid by \n     periodic payments. In any health care lawsuit, the court may \n     be guided by the Uniform Periodic Payment of Judgments Act \n     promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on \n     Uniform State Laws.\n       (b) Applicability.--This section applies to all actions \n     which have not been first set for trial or retrial before the \n     effective date of this title.\n\n     SEC. _10. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\n\n       (a) General Vaccine Injury.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent that title XXI of the Public \n     Health Service Act establishes a Federal rule of law \n     applicable to a civil action brought for a vaccine-related \n     injury or death--\n       (A) this title shall not affect the application of the rule \n     of law to such an action; and\n       (B) any rule of law prescribed by this title in conflict \n     with a rule of law of such title XXI shall not apply to such \n     action.\n       (2) Exception.--If there is an aspect of a civil action \n     brought for a vaccine-related injury or death to which a \n     Federal rule of law under title XXI of the Public Health \n     Service Act does not apply, then this title or otherwise \n     applicable law (as determined under this title) will apply to \n     such aspect of such action.\n       (b) Smallpox Vaccine Injury.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent that part C of title II of \n     the Public Health Service Act establishes a Federal rule of \n     law applicable to a civil action brought for a smallpox \n     vaccine-related injury or death--\n       (A) this title shall not affect the application of the rule \n     of law to such an action; and\n       (B) any rule of law prescribed by this title in conflict \n     with a rule of law of such part C shall not apply to such \n     action.\n       (2) Exception.--If there is an aspect of a civil action \n     brought for a smallpox vaccine-related injury or death to \n     which a Federal rule of law under part C of title II of the \n     Public Health Service Act does not apply, then this title or \n     otherwise applicable law (as determined under this title) \n     will apply to such aspect of such action.\n       (c) Other Federal Law.--Except as provided in this section, \n     nothing in this title shall be deemed to affect any defense \n     available, or any limitation on liability that applies to, a \n     defendant in a health care lawsuit or action under any other \n     provision of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. _11.
