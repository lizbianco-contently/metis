Mr. President, over the past year and a half, I have \ntried to highlight some of the things the Democratic health spending \nbill does to undermine the health care system in this country. But one \nof the things the American people might not realize is that the \nconsequences of this bill reach far beyond health care.\n  As a way of helping fund their health spending bill, Democrats \ninserted a backdoor tax known as a 1099 mandate that forces small \nbusinesses to bear the burden of their plan. It mandates that every \nbusiness and charity in the country submit 1099 forms for transactions \ntotaling $600 or more, including routine business expenses such as \nphones, office products, and shipping costs. It could increase \nbusinesses' reporting requirement by as much as 2,000 percent.\n  Even the White House now admits they went too far and that their \nhealth spending bill hurts small businesses. Predictably, however, \ntheir remedy is to raise taxes. This is one more way Democrats are \nholding back the economic recovery--by socking businesses with another \nmandate that costs them thousands of dollars a year in the middle of a \nrecession.\n  Ironically, the IRS says they will not even be able to handle the \npaperwork this mandate would generate. They also say it is likely they \nwill improperly assess penalties they will have to abate later.\n  The Democratic Senator from Florida has put forth an amendment we \nwill be voting on later today that aims to help small businesses get \naround this reporting requirement. The problem is the Nelson amendment \nonly covers some small businesses and fails to address the root of the \nproblem.\n  Under this amendment, for example, businesses with 26 or more \nemployees would still be subject to mandates for transactions totaling \n$5,000 or more. Not only would hundreds of thousands of businesses \nstill have to deal with this costly and burdensome new mandate, many \nothers would presumably stop hiring once they reach the magic number of \n26 employees in order to avoid paying the new expense. Moreover, the \nNelson amendment does nothing to alleviate the paperwork nightmare, and \nit is paid for with yet another major tax increase.\n  Senator Johanns has proposed a better approach. Unlike the Nelson \namendment, the Johanns amendment fully repeals the 1099 mandate and \nwould halt the Democrats' backdoor attempt to further place the costs \nof their health care plan on the backs of small businesses. It \neliminates the paperwork for all businesses instead of picking winners \nand losers.\n  The Johanns amendment also has broad support. It has been endorsed by \nthe Coalition for Fairness in Tax Compliance, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, the American \nFarm Bureau Federation, and the Americans for Tax Reform. It has \nbipartisan support in the Senate as well.\n  This is a strong amendment that will actually help small businesses \nwithout\n\n[[Page S7052]]\n\nhurting others. I will be voting for the Johanns amendment and against \nthe continuing costs and mandates of the Nelson amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7052-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, following any leader remarks, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of H.R. 5297, which is, as the leader has \nindicated, the small business jobs bill, with the time until 11 a.m. \nequally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees. At 11 a.m., there will be three votes relating to this bill: \ncloture on the Johanns amendment relating to 1099 forms. This is a \ncommitment I made--that we would have a vote on his amendment. I think \nit is appropriate we do that. That will be a cloture vote, a 60-vote \nmargin. We also have a vote that will occur on the Nelson of Florida \namendment also relating to 1099 forms. It has changes that affect a \nnumber of people, but it is also something that I think is widely \nsupported. I do not support the Johanns amendment, even though I have \nhad conversations with him. He is the one who brought this to the \nattention of the Senate. I appreciate that. I think the Nelson \namendment is better for the reasons Senator Nelson and others have \ntalked about. It is an amendment that certainly gets to the heart of \nthis issue as to who has to report.\n  Finally, we will have a cloture vote on the substitute amendment to \nH.R. 5297, which is the small business jobs bill.\n  This is one of the most important things we have done in recent \nmonths. I know we have been away for a month. There were some efforts \nto get to that before we left, but time constraints would not allow us \nto do that.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It is going to infuse \ncommunity banks with money. The problem we have in America today is the \nbig banks are doing great. We saw what happened in the stock market \nyesterday, and all reasons indicate the reason the stock market jumped \nlike it did is because the big financial institutions are doing so \nwell. They are doing well. They are loaning to big businesses. That is \ngood. I am very happy they are doing that.\n\n  Eighty percent of the jobs we lost because of this recession were \nsmall business jobs. That is where we have to get the jobs back, and we \nare not giving small businesses the opportunity to borrow money. That \nis why this bill is so important.\n  People are estimating this will create from 500,000 to 700,000 new \njobs because small business is the engine that drives our economy, and \nthey need help. During this recess period, I was all over Nevada, of \ncourse. I went to a number of other States. It does not matter where \nyou go. You see these little strip malls with ``For Lease'' signs. The \nreason is that small businesses that could continue their businesses if \nthey could borrow the bucks for the inventory have not been able to do \nthat. This bill will allow that to take place.\n  Not only does it do that, but it gives other tax incentives to small \nbusinesses. For example, they will be able to write off purchases they \nmake for equipment--not depreciate it but write it off. It is extremely \nimportant they are able to do that.\n  We also have other tax breaks that allow some of these small \nbusinesses to do exporting, which they are anxious to do, and they get \ntax benefits for doing that.\n  The Small Business Administration will be revitalized. They have \nprograms that are working well, but their resources are gone. I have \nspoken with the head of the Small Business Administration. She is so \nanxious for this to pass. She has people waiting in her offices around \nthe country to apply for these loans to get their businesses started or \nreenergized. This is an important piece of legislation.\n  Following the vote on that substitute amendment, we will recess from \n12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to allow for our weekly caucus meetings.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the filing deadline for second-\ndegree amendments be at 12 noon today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7052-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 3772 AND S. 3773\n\n  Mr. REID.

That is the Small Business Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Am I correct in saying the time is equally divided before \nthe votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see my colleague. I have a statement to \nmake on the bill.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I defer to the Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Book of Ecclesiastes teaches: ``The \nend of a matter is better than its beginning.''\n  In other words, getting something done is better than starting \nsomething new. That is what a lot of folks are telling us these days. \nThey are telling us to get some things done. They are telling us to do \nsomething to create jobs. They are telling us to enact legislation such \nas the small business jobs bill before us today.\n\n  In America, the private sector creates the vast majority of jobs, and \nin the private sector, small businesses are the principal engine of job \ncreation. Over the past 15 years, small businesses generated two-thirds \nof new jobs. That is about 12 million new jobs. That is even more true \nin my home State of Montana. In Montana, we have the largest share of \nworkers employed by small businesses of any State in the Nation. Nearly \n4 out of 5 employees in Montana work in businesses with fewer than 10 \nworkers, and 3 out of 5 employees in Montana work in businesses with \nfewer than 5 workers.\n  The great recession has hit small businesses hard. Over the course of \nthe recession, small firms have incurred two-thirds of the net job \nlosses. We need to focus on small businesses as we seek to create jobs. \nWhen we help small businesses, we help get Americans back to work, and \nthat is exactly what this small business jobs bill would do. This bill \nwould help small businesses get capital. This bill would make it easier \nfor small businesses to invest. This bill would promote \nentrepreneurship. This bill would improve equity in the law. This is \nexactly the kind of targeted job-creating legislation folks are telling \nus to enact, and we ought to get it done. But before we can pass this \nbill, we have to address the pending Johanns and Nelson amendments on \ninformation reporting.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Johanns amendment and support the \nNelson amendment, and let me explain why. The Johanns amendment would \nrepeal a tax-reporting provision enacted in the new health care law. No \nmatter what you think of the reporting requirement in the new health \ncare law, the offset in the Johanns amendment is a killer.\n  The Johanns amendment would go in the wrong direction. It would \nexpand the exemption from the responsibility to buy health insurance. \nFewer people would be responsible to buy health insurance. The \namendment would raise revenue because it would thus decrease the number \nof people who receive Federal tax credits. Fewer Americans would get \ninsurance and fewer people would get tax credits to buy the insurance.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Johanns \namendment would increase premiums by up to 4 percent in the individual \nmarket; that is, in the market for those who individually buy health \ninsurance. Their premiums would go up 4 percent, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, under the Johanns amendment.\n  The Johanns amendment would increase the number of uninsured by 2 \nmillion people--increase by 2 million the number of people who are \nuninsured. Under the Johanns amendment, much of the cost of caring for \nthe uninsured would therefore continue to be shifted to people with \ninsurance, as it is today, and the premiums would continue to go up for \nall the rest of us to pay for that.\n  By reducing the requirement for folks to buy insurance, the Johanns \namendment would make it so that the share of folks who buy insurance \nwho are sick would also increase, and that would make insurance \npremiums go up as well.\n  We need to resist misguided efforts such as these to weaken the new \nhealth care law. What is more, the amendment would also cut money set \naside for prevention in the new health care law, and that is a bad \nidea. The Johanns amendment is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It is \ndressed up as an attempt to help small businesses, but in reality it is \njust another partisan effort to undermine the new health care law.\n  Let me take a few moments to address the information reporting \nrequirement which the Johanns amendment purports to address. Current \nlaw, even before health care reform, requires all businesses to send a \nform 1099 information return to all unincorporated service providers to \nwhom businesses pay $600 or more during the year. This information also \ngoes to the IRS. That is current law. That is before the health care \nreform law. The new health care law expands this requirement to include \npayments to corporations--not just service providers but to \nunincorporated companies--as well as payments for goods and property \nbeginning in 2012. So this goes into effect, the provision in the \nhealth care law, in 2012--not this year, not next year, but 2012. I \nknow it takes time and money for small businesses to comply with \ninformation reporting requirements. I am very sympathetic to the \nrecord-keeping burdens of small businesses. But the research \ndemonstrates that voluntary compliance doubles when information \nreporting is in place. The rate rises from 46 percent compliance to 98 \npercent compliance. Information reporting does not increase taxes. Let \nme say that again. It does not increase taxes. Rather, it keeps tax \nrates lower. Why? Because more people pay the taxes they already owe.\n  Both the Bush administration and the Obama administration included \ncorporate information reporting among their tax compliance proposals. \nBut we do need to address this requirement, and the Nelson amendment is \nan excellent start. The Nelson amendment directly addresses the \nconcerns small businesses are raising. First, the Nelson amendment \nwould completely exempt businesses with 25 or fewer employees from the \nnew reporting requirements for goods and property--a complete exemption \nfor a small business that has 25 or fewer employees. For businesses \nwith more than 25 employees, the Nelson amendment would raise the \nthreshold to report purchases of goods and property from $600 to \n$5,000. The Nelson amendment would also take other steps to reduce the \nburdens on small businesses.\n  The bottom line is this: We have heard the concerns of small \nbusinesses. We hear it. I hear it. During the last month, I heard it \ntwo or three times, and on this particular provision. But when I asked \nabout the Nelson solution, the people I talked to, the small \nbusinessmen I talked to, and the accountants I talked to at home said: \nWell, gee, maybe that might be OK.\n  We intend to work diligently to address and mitigate the concerns of \nsmall businesses, and we are doing so with the Nelson amendment. The \nNelson amendment is the first step in that process. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Nelson amendment in response to the concerns \nof small businesses. Those concerns are real, and the Nelson amendment \naddresses them. But the offset in the Johanns amendment is a killer. \nThe Johanns amendment would raise health insurance premiums--raise \nthem. The Johanns amendment would result in fewer people having health \ninsurance--fewer. And the Johanns amendment would cut funding for \nprevention--cut it. Those are results no one should want. I therefore \nurge that the Johanns amendment be opposed, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote against it.\n  Let's address these amendments and get something done, as \nEcclesiastes, in the Scriptures, suggests to us, let's do something to \ncreate jobs, and let's enact this small business jobs bill today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \namendment I offer, which is called the Johanns amendment. I think and \nvery respectfully I say that the Senator from Montana has really joined \nthe issues here. On one hand, we have this 1099 requirement, which no \nbusiness in America supports--none. We have this 1099 requirement that \nevery business association in America opposes. On the other hand, we \nhave a health care bill--passed on Christmas Eve, put together with no \nbipartisan support--for which the President is demanding absolute \nloyalty of his Members. He doesn't want anything changed. And that is \nhow the issue is joined today.\n  But I believe today that we in the Senate have an opportunity to take \na very clear and very decisive action that shows we mean what we say. A \nvote to repeal the 1099 paperwork mandate fulfills the promise to clear \nFederal roadblocks that are stopping small\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\nbusinesses from expanding and putting Americans to work.\n  There have been a lot of promises from this administration and even \nfrom this Congress to support small businesses, but America is coming \nto the conclusion that the promises are empty. And this 1099 mandate in \nthe health care bill is a perfect example of why they are giving up \nhope. You see, our small business owners, our medium-sized business \nowners, and our large business owners are frustrated with nice speeches \nthat are followed by strangling regulation, new taxes, and really \nabsurd paperwork mandates. Small businesses want to expand, they want \nto hire workers, and they want more customers. They do not like going \nto a long-term employee and saying: I have to lay you off. I have had \nemployers talk to me about that literally with tears in their eyes. Yet \nthis tax paperwork mandate--hidden in the health care law, of all \nthings, in section 9006, page 700-something--requires businesses to \nfile a mountain of additional 1099 tax forms. It will consume resources \nthat could otherwise be spent on wages for new employees. It is an \nundeniable example of the relentless hostility this administration has \ntoward the business community.\n  The Washington Post accurately summarized it this way:\n\n       As small businesses try to plot their recovery, attention \n     is turning to what many owners consider burdensome policies--\n     higher taxes, new accounting procedures and health-care \n     mandates.\n\n  That quote goes on to say:\n\n       Even as the government tries to help with an array of small \n     business initiatives, many owners say the intervention is as \n     much a hindrance to hiring as is the faltering economy.\n\n  You see, this type of uncertainty and fear only leads to a paralyzed \njob market and, of course, anemic growth. Just look at what we have \npiled on the backs of businesses in the last 18 months. Is it any \nwonder they are sitting on capital? A so-called economic stimulus that \ncost taxpayers $862 billion but failed to deliver on the promise of \nkeeping unemployment below 8 percent. Passage of a $2.6 trillion health \ncare bill that, when honestly scored, imposes an employer mandate--an \nemployer mandate--during one of the toughest economic times since the \nGreat Depression. It increases taxes in areas completely unrelated to \nhealth care. A financial overhaul that increases small business burdens \nand cost of compliance. Threats of card check, which the Chamber of \nCommerce recently estimated will result in 600,000 lost jobs. And, of \ncourse, the endless threat of an energy tax. A cap-and-trade proposal \nthat would result in increased production costs, harming America's \ncompetitiveness in a global marketplace--shipping jobs to India and \nChina. To make matters worse, the uncertainty about the looming tax \nincreases--the largest in history--only compounds the worries \nbusinesses are facing.\n  All of us traveled during the August break. I traveled across my home \nState of Nebraska in August, and I heard from hundreds, thousands of \nconstituents. The message was plain and simple. In 14 townhalls across \nthe State, people said over and over again: Mike, go back there and \nfight for us. And do you know what they were asking me to do? Protect \ntheir businesses from Washington. Protect their businesses from \nWashington.\n\n  We have an opportunity to do just that today by fully repealing the \n1099 filing requirements. Our job creators will be able to focus their \ntime and energy on hiring and expanding, not dealing with mounds of \npaperwork.\n  As the president of the Nebraska Federation of Independent Business \nput it, and I am quoting from the chart:\n\n       You can't operate and grow your business if you are \n     spending all your time filling out IRS forms and haggling \n     with auditors.\n\n  In fact, there has been an outpouring of support from business owners \nwho are hoping that common sense will rule the day. The steady stream \nof support letters and key vote letters Senate offices have received is \nabsolutely compelling evidence that our job creators feel very strongly \nabout repealing this nonsensical mandate. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nNational Federation of Independent Business, and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers all support full repeal, to name a few. \nBut I could go on and on--the Farm Bureau, the National Restaurant \nAssociation, the Public Accountants Association, veterinarians, \nflorists. There is no stopping here.\n  I think it is time Washington listen to the concerns of constituents \nand businesses. They sure did not do that with the health care bill. \nHere is a sampling of what businesses are saying. From the American \nRental Association:\n\n       The reporting requirement substantially and \n     disproportionately increases compliance burdens on all types \n     of small businesses.\n\n  Citizens Against Government Waste says:\n\n       With a ballooning $13.4 trillion federal debt and a \n     national unemployment rate that is around 10 percent, \n     lawmakers should be focused on providing relief to America's \n     businesses, encouraging job creation, and spurring economic \n     growth. The 1099 mandate is a major roadblock, discouraging \n     them from expanding and hiring.\n\n  The National Restaurant Association says this:\n\n       This new requirement will impose a significant burden on \n     restaurants across the country.\n\n  The International Franchise Association says:\n\n       The paperwork filing burden associated with this provision \n     will be too great for many small businesses to comply and \n     could lead to inaccurate filings that may trigger audits and \n     penalties.\n\n  Finally, the Coalition for Fairness in Tax Compliance says:\n\n       The Johanns amendment is the only solution that fully \n     protects small businesses.\n\n  They go on to speak to the Nelson amendment, and I am quoting again:\n\n       The Nelson amendment does not remove the paperwork and \n     administrative burden that is created by this new law. \n     Instead, the Nelson alternative further complicates \n     compliance responsibilities . . . rather than clarify. The \n     Nelson amendment actually creates even greater complexity for \n     those who comply with the law.\n\n  Businesses could not be more clear. Today are we going to turn our \ndeaf ear to the job creators in America? Are we going to stand with the \nPresident, who does not want anybody fiddling with his health care \nreform, or are we going to stand with small businesses?\n  This is a vote to put Americans back to work by freeing up our small \nbusinesses to expand and hire. It is as simple as that. Let's not force \nour job creators to fight the greatest battle they are fighting, which \nis the battle against Washington and its endless appetite for \nregulation and spending.\n  We have talked about support for our small businesses. Let's stand \nbehind them. I want to remind my colleagues that, according to analysis \nby one business group, this mandate is likely to increase the 1099s \nthat businesses file by a whopping 2000 percent. Let's listen to the \nloud voices of an endless line of businesses pleading with us to repeal \nthis job-killing mandate.\n  I hope my colleagues across the aisle will reject the arm twisting \nthat is going on by the White House to preserve at all costs the health \ncare law and every word of it, every dotted i and every crossed t, even \nat the expense of American jobs. I ask you to vote in favor of the only \nbipartisan amendment you will vote on today, the Johanns-Lincoln \namendment, a bipartisan approach, the only real fix to a 1099 nightmare \ncreated by the health care law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will yield 8 minutes to my good friend \nfrom Florida, who has come up with a very good idea to resolve this \nquestion.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 4595, As Modified, and Amendment No. 4596, As Modified\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If it is OK with the chairman of the \ncommittee, we have a unanimous consent that has been agreed to on both \nsides.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments, \nNo. 4595 and No. 4596, be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \ntake a moment to analyze what the Senator has proposed.\n  We have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Hearing no objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendments, as modified, are as follows:\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\n                    amendment no. 4595, as modified\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title II, add the following:\n\n                     PART V--ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. ___.

Mr. President, we are down now to passing what \nwe have tried to pass so many times, this small business assistance \nbill, which is going to create a $30 billion lending facility that will \nwork through community banks. The small business lending fund will \ngenerate $300 billion of loans that will specifically be targeted to \nsmall businesses to help get our country moving again economically. \nThis is huge. But right now we are stuck on this issue of whether \nbusinesses are going to have to file these 1099 forms anytime they make \npurchases of goods.\n  The Senator from Nebraska wants to eliminate all of the new \ninformation reporting rules. That is a salutary result. But how does he \npropose to do it? He has to come up with a way to pay for it. The \nunderling law raises about $17 billion, so he has to come up with a \npay-for if he is going to repeal it. Where does he get it? He basically \ngoes directly at the health care bill, the reform bill, and he starts \nto gut the health care reform bill.\n  This Senator does not think that is a very good idea, particularly \nsince what the Senator from Nebraska is gutting is the subsidies that \nallow people to purchase health insurance who presently are uninsured. \nThe amendment of the Senator would reduce the number of people that \npurchase coverage through the health insurance exchange. These are \nuninsured people whom we want to have private health insurance, 2 \nmillion of them in this country who otherwise would go into their State \nhealth insurance exchange and be able to purchase health insurance with \nsome assistance because of their income level.\n  The amendment of the Senator involves a complicated formula. It \nactually gets at a provision in the current health reform law that says \nif your health premiums are going to be above 8 percent of your annual \nincome, you do not have a responsibility to purchase health insurance. \nThe Senator from Nebraska drops that to 5 percent, which means that 2 \nmillion people in\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\nthis country are not going to go into these health insurance exchanges \nand purchase health insurance.\n  By the way, what is going to happen? They are still going to get \nhealth care if they do not have health insurance. Where are they going \nto get it? They are going to get it at the most expensive place at the \nmost expensive time; that is, when they get sick they are going to go \nto the emergency room. If they do not have health insurance, guess who \nis going to pay. All the rest of us are going to pay, which was part of \nthe reason for the health reform bill in the first place. It was to get \n32 million people in this country who are not insured into the health \ninsurance system so that you spread that health risk over more people. \nThat is 32 million people who are going to come into the health \ninsurance system and pay for their care, instead of just those who \ncurrently have health insurance.\n  The whole idea was to get more people into the system--more people \npaying insurance, more people with health insurance so they receive \npreventive care and so they do not wait around until the sniffles have \nturned into pneumonia and they have to go to the emergency room. If \nthey don't have health insurance, everybody else pays for them.\n  What the Senator from Nebraska is doing is he is driving a stake into \nthe heart of the health insurance reform bill by taking 2 million \npeople out of that pool, people who are uninsured, who otherwise would \nbe getting health insurance. That is the essence of this; otherwise, \nthe Senator from Nebraska and I agree. We want to stop this nonsense of \nthe harassment of every time you make a purchase of a good, some \nequipment, et cetera, that you have to file a 1099 because the other \nguy on the other end who is selling you that good is not going to \nreport the income. We would both prefer to eliminate all of that.\n  The amendment of this Senator says, first of all, if you are a small \nbusiness, if you are 25 employees or less, you are not going to have to \nworry about that requirement at all. Second, this Senator says that if \nyou have 26 or more employees, you are not going to have to file that \n1099 form when you purchase equipment unless it is over $5,000 of \nvalue. Third, if it is a credit or debit card transaction, no \ninformation reporting by the business would be required, period.\n  Is that too much to ask in order to help get people to pay the income \ntax that they owe, people who are now getting out of it to the tune of \n$17 billion? If somebody is not paying their income tax, is that fair? \nNo, it is not. So in tightening up the law we are going to get people \nto pay their income tax, but we are going to do it in a way that is not \nharassing any business, and particularly small businesses, because we \nare going to exempt them if there are 25 employees or less.\n  The long and short of it is if the amendment of the Senator from \nNebraska, which is going to be voted on first, is not agreed to, then \nwe come to the amendment of this Senator. You may want to eliminate \neverything. But if his amendment----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Oh, goodness. I will conclude by saying if his \namendment does not pass, then you have a viable alternative with the \nNelson amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. May I inquire how much time on this side is left?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska has 11 \nminutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I will defer to the Senator from Wyoming for 3 minutes, \nand yield 3 minutes of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I just heard the discussion about this bill. \nI know in the health care bill we hired 16,000 more IRS agents. If we \nhired 16,000 more IRS agents, we should not need a whole bunch more \npaperwork for small businesses to do, to see if they are being honest.\n  This is going to cost a fortune for small business, even if you go to \nthe $5,000 level, because you have to keep track of how much you buy \nfrom every supplier. You have to see if you hit the $600 or $5,000 \nmark. That is a cost to business with no benefit. I do not think it is \ngoing to wind up with the kind of benefit they are talking about in \nraising revenue to finance health care.\n  As far as the mandate to buy insurance, I am not in favor of the \nmandate to begin with. But it mandates that they spend 8 percent of \ntheir income on health insurance. This reduces it to 5 percent of their \nhealth care. I think that is a pretty big mandate all in itself.\n  But during the last month, my wife and I traveled around Wyoming. We \nvisited small businesses. We looked to see what their problems were. I \ndo that to get a sense of what Federal legislation is going to do to \nhelp or hinder them. I want to see firsthand the struggles they deal \nwith. Every business looks simple until you have to make the decisions \nthat deal with that business.\n  The last thing we want to do in Washington is hurt those businesses \nby passing legislation that takes resources away from growing \nbusinesses and puts it into more paperwork. We also should not be \npassing legislation using regulation that stymies new jobs and causes \nuncertainty about what will come out in the near future.\n  Unfortunately, I think that is exactly what happened in the health \ncare reform law that was enacted earlier this year. Today, we have a \nchance to fix it. Although the health care reform battle may be in the \nrearview mirror for some of you, it is the small businesspeople in our \nhometowns who continue to bleed from it.\n  The provision I am referring to will require business owners to \nsubmit onerous and duplicative 1099 forms for every single business-to-\nbusiness transaction over $600. Even $5,000 does not solve the problem. \nThis includes anything from utilities, office supplies, construction \nmaterials. There are ways to audit that anyway. This is just trying to \ndo an easy thing and putting a whole burden on businesses. So everybody \non Main Street will have to do 200 to 2,000 of these 1099s depending on \nwhich one of these forms you go with. Repealing it is the best way to \ndo it.\n  Something else that is not mentioned is they have to get the \ntaxpayer's ID number. If you are a small businessman, a really small \nbusinessman, your taxpayer ID is your Social Security number. How \nwilling are you going to be to give your Social Security number to some \nkid that bought $600 worth of gas so he could mow lawns over the \nsummer? If he does not get the taxpayer number, he is supposed to \nwithhold 28 percent of the payment.\n  Most businesses don't have personal accountants on hand to file these \nforms so they will need to hire someone just to file paperwork. This is \nthe kind of onerous paperwork burden that will distract small \nbusinesses from doing day-to-day business, providing much-needed jobs \nand stimulating the economy.\n  Many of my colleagues have joined me in co-sponsoring the Small \nBusiness Paperwork Mandate Eliminate Act to fix this problem, and today \nI urge them to join me in supporting Senator Johanns' amendment. The \nJohanns amendment eliminates the onerous section of the law and pays \nfor it in a responsible way. While I appreciate the Senator from \nFlorida would like to exempt businesses with under 25 employees, this \nexemption actually encourages businesses to stop growing so they aren't \nburdened with onerous bureaucratic regulations, and the method he uses \nto offset his amendment will lead to increased energy prices and fewer \nAmerican energy jobs. My biggest surprise over the August recess was \nthe number of businesses that have heard of this requirement. They know \nand they are mad. One more requirement that doesn't bring in a single \ndollar and has a huge cost!\n  I urge all Senators to help the businesses in their State and make \nsure this section is repealed by supporting the Johanns amendment. You \ndon't have to be a Republican and you don't have to be a Democrat to \nknow that this is something we need to do. To know that, you just have \nto ask the business people you represent in your home State.\n  Let's take a sandbag off the backs of the small business people. We \nknow repeal will be better for them, our States and our country. Surely \nwe can find a way together to do this one small thing\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\nthat will make such a huge positive impact on those we serve.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator from \nWyoming has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I think we can see what a terrible error it is to have this \nin the bill at all. I hope we will repeal it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Johanns \namendment to repeal an onerous mandate included in the health reform \nbill that would require millions of businesses to send billions of new \ninformation reporting forms to the IRS and other businesses. If Senator \nJohanns' amendment is not adopted here in the Senate, every business in \nAmerica, starting in 2012, must report to the IRS on business purchases \nthat exceed a threshold of only $600 per vendor or supplier--for \npurchases of supplies and equipment, and also services ranging from \ncell phone coverage to window washing to utilities.\n  This new mandate was imposed in the health reform law, yet it has \nabsolutely nothing to do with health insurance reform. What it does is \nmake the Federal Government a more intrusive and burdensome presence in \nevery aspect of American business--which is the very last thing \nAmerican business needs during these tumultuous economic times. What \nsmall firms are clamoring for is certainty. They need the Federal \nGovernment to help foster an entrepreneurial environment under which \nthey can do what they do best--create new jobs--and not saddle them \nwith an incessant and unnecessary paperwork burden like this new 1099 \nfiling requirement.\n  Most Americans recognize forms 1099 as the statements they get from a \nfinancial institution when they earn interest on savings or from their \nmortgage lender for the deductible interest the borrower pays to a bank \nor credit union for their home mortgage. The purpose of these 1099s is \nto accurately report income or deductions for a particular tax year so \nthat income is appropriately taxed that year.\n  However this new system of 1099s does not have anything to do with a \ndirect tax liability in a given year--instead, this reporting regime \nwill allow the IRS to track business purchases that exceed $600. \nBusinesses typically have an intense focus on carefully tracking their \nsales to customers with marketing professionals. Rather than tracking \nsales to customers, this new government mandate will force a change in \nbusiness focus to a detailed accounting of purchases from suppliers. \nWhile controlling costs is clearly a vital component of business \nprofitability, this new government mandate on cost accounting and \nreporting to the IRS is an inordinate shift of priorities that will \nharm competitiveness and profitability because it will shift focus and \nresources away from customers.\n  A separate dimension of this new cost accounting mandate is that \npurchases will also have to be separately tracked by type of payment \nbecause only payments made by check and cash would be reported on a \n1099 but payments by credit card would be excluded from this mandate \nand misreporting transactions by including credit card purchases might \nbe subject to penalties. So for each supplier from which aggregate \npurchase might exceed $600 per year, purchases would have to be tracked \nby payment method. For instance, a construction contractor would have \nto make sure that employees know to use only a credit card at Home \nDepot but at the local lumber yard to only pay by check or invoice.\n  The intent of this 1099 provision may have been to track the cash \nflow of businesses that operate in a cash economy in order to root out \nthose that do not pay taxes. Ensuring that tax cheats pay their taxes \nis an admirable and necessary function of government. However, instead \nit has become clear that this provision could simply further expand the \ncash economy. The very businesses that currently evade taxation are not \nlikely to become compliant with this new burdensome reporting regime. \nIn fact, a predominantly cash-based business will likely further \nretrench and thrive absent both tax liability and the new reporting \nregime while tax compliant businesses either muddle through or fail \nunder this new burden. For instance, a small plumbing business or a \nroofing business would likely thrive by simply working in an all-cash \nsystem for residential customers and evading both income taxes and \ninformation reporting while a similar business attempting to comply \nwith tax liability and compliance would struggle.\n  For the small businesses that attempt to comply with this tax \nreporting mandate, this paperwork burden will be imposed with a \ncrushing effect. New tracking systems will have to be implemented for \npurchases in order to ensure that aggregated purchases exceeding $600 \nare reported to the IRS. In fact, according to an NFIB Small Business \nSurvey, at $74 an hour, tax paperwork is the most expensive paperwork \nburden placed on small businesses by the Federal Government. The Small \nBusiness Administration has found that the cost of tax compliance is \nalready 67 percent higher in small firms than in large firms. Because \nthis new 1099 reporting burden would be so ubiquitous for firms \nattempting to be compliant--by requiring new processes of making \nbusiness purchases and tracking of business purchases--this compliance \ncost statistic is likely to be woefully outdated and more onerous.\n  I fully expect the new Chief Counsel for Advocacy at the Small \nBusiness Administration, Winslow Sargeant, who President Obama recently \nrecess appointed, to assess this new paperwork mandate and have his \noffice recalibrate that statistic on cost of tax compliance which was \nlast updated in 2005. Dr. Sargeant will also have the opportunity to \nfully use his office--the independent, ``regulatory watchdog'' for \nsmall business--to comment, by September 29, to a Treasury Department \nand IRS request for information on these expanded 1099 filing \nrequirements. I want to quote from the SBA web site about the mission \nof the Office of Advocacy:\n\n       In 1976, the U.S. Congress created the Office of Advocacy \n     within the U.S Small Business Administration to protect, \n     strengthen and effectively represent the nation's small \n     businesses within the federal government's legislative and \n     rule-making processes. The Office of Advocacy works to reduce \n     the burdens that federal policies impose on small firms and \n     maximize the benefits small businesses receive from the \n     government. Advocacy's mission, simply stated, is to \n     encourage policies that support the development and growth of \n     American small business.\n\n  I expect Dr. Sargeant to fulfill his duties as the Chief Counsel for \nAdvocacy by serving as a strong voice in this IRS rulemaking. In \nvoicing the concerns of small businesses, Dr. Sargeant would be \nstanding shoulder to shoulder with the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate, \nNina Olson, who has stated that the administrative costs to small \nbusinesses of this provision are so high that it ``may turn out to be \ndisproportionate as compared with any resulting improvement in tax \ncompliance.''\n  Separate from the burden of compliance, I fear the onerous and \npervasive nature of this mandate, for it will surely change business \npurchasing decisions and disadvantage small businesses. Should the \nJohanns amendment to repeal this provision not be adopted, it would \nincentivize centralized purchasing from large integrated companies and \naway from smaller specialized ones. Rather than a roofing company \nputting out a bid to different suppliers for materials, this new \ngovernment mandate would be another reason to consolidate purchasing in \norder to ease paperwork burdens of the 1099 process. With fewer \nbusinesses willing to put out bids to a wide variety of suppliers, a \nconstricting spiral will take effect resulting in fewer and fewer \nspecialty suppliers. While large big-box retailers serve a critical \nrole, they don't need to have the heavy hand of government pushing \ncustomers through their doors instead of through the local building \nsupply business or local office supply businesses. This further \nconsolidation of suppliers is bad for innovation, bad for price \ncompetition, and bad for small business.\n  No wonder a broad coalition of businesses has come together to form \nthe Coalition for Fairness in Tax Compliance. This group includes \ndozens and dozens of business organizations including Washington \nmainstays such as the National Federation of Independent Business, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the Associated Builders and \nContractors, the National Restaurant Association, and the US Chamber of \nCommerce, to groups as varied\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\nas the Electronic Security Association, the Independent Community \nBankers of America and the American Road & Transportation Builders \nAssociation.\n  Finally, I want to turn to an aspect of this issue that has not been \ndiscussed widely. The process of tracking business-to-business \npurchases, aggregating information on purchase prices and then \nreporting this information to the IRS on those purchases would largely \nput in place the infrastructure for a value added tax--or VAT--tax \nsystem. A typical value added tax is a credit-invoice method system \nwhere one business tracks the purchases it makes from others and then \nwhen it sells goods, it remits a tax for the increase in value of those \ngoods. The increase in value is through either a manufacturing process \nor by adding value through a retail sale of goods.\n  A VAT depends upon reporting the price of goods purchased and sold. \nImposing a system whereby virtually every business-to-business sale of \ngoods or services is aggregated and reported to the IRS certainly puts \nin place all of the infrastructure of a VAT. This provision would be \nimplemented and become effective in 2012. It would certainly take a \nyear to two for taxpayers and the IRS to work through all of the \nadministrative hassles associated with its implementation. By 2014, \nwhen the health benefit subsidies become effective, all of the \nmachinery necessary for a VAT would be functioning and the machine \nwould simply have to be turned on to start generating the money \nnecessary to pay for these benefits at a time when our national \ndeficits are likely to continue at atrocious levels.\n  Early in the debate for health reform, Obama advisers were proponents \nof a VAT to fund health reform, but were quickly publicly disavowed. \nEven in the Senate, last April, I joined 84 colleagues on the floor in \nApril to repudiate the concept of a VAT. Putting in place the machinery \nof a VAT to not expect that machinery to be switched on is a test of \nfaith that millions of small businesses across America are not willing \nto take.\n  We cannot tinker with this 1099 provision. We cannot amend this \nprovision. We cannot leave a vestige of it to sprout in the future. We \nmust repeal it. Now. I urge my colleagues to support the Johanns \namendment and oppose the Nelson amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for repealing the 1099 tax form requirement enacted in the \nAffordable Care Act. This requirement is burdensome for businesses in \nMaryland, especially small businesses. The 1099 tax provision requires \nbusinesses to report information on anyone they pay $600 or more to for \ngoods in a year. Businesses will also have to send copies of the form \nto their vendors, suppliers and contractors. This requirement is costly \nand burdensome to businesses.\n  Although I agree that we must ease the hassle faced by businesses, we \nmust be careful about how we pay for this. The Johanns amendment to the \nSmall Business Jobs and Credit Act repeals the new 1099 tax reporting \nrequirement, yet could end up increasing health care costs and cost \nsmall businesses even more as a result of higher health expenditures. \nThe Johanns amendment eliminates funding for prevention programs such \nas providing immunizations and screenings for diseases like cancer, \nheart disease, and diabetes. By catching diseases earlier and reducing \nthe incidence of chronic disease, prevention programs lead to cost \nsavings which lower the cost of health insurance for small businesses.\n  That is why I support the Nelson amendment which provides a more \naffordable alternative. The Nelson amendment reduces the burden faced \nby businesses by eliminating the 1099 reporting requirement all \ntogether for businesses with 25 employees or less. It also raises the \nreporting threshold to anyone paid $5,000 or more for purchased goods \nin a year in a way that is affordable. This will help over 85 percent \nof businesses in Maryland.\n  I am also a cosponsor of Senator Landrieu's Information Reporting \nModernization Act. Senator Landrieu chairs the Small Business Committee \nand her bill would simplify and modernize 1099 reporting requirements \nso that nothing paid for with credit or debit cards would need to be \nreported and the $5,000 threshold amount for reporting established in \nthe bill could be adjusted and increased every year for inflation. I \nwill continue to support lessening the burdens faced by small \nbusinesses and help lower their costs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to vote for the motion to \ninvoke cloture on Senator Bill Nelson's amendment to ease reporting \nrequirements on small businesses, which are the engine of our economy. \nUnlike Senator Nelson's commonsense amendment, which was paid for by \ntaking away a tax break from big oil, Senator Johanns's alternative \nproposal would deny health insurance for roughly 2 million Americans \nand raise insurance premiums for many more. We can and should help \nsmall businesses without making health insurance more expensive and \nless accessible.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 minutes 45 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes 45 seconds to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Montana for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. President, the Johanns amendment would kill--would kill--the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund that we have established for our \nAmerican citizens. Chronic diseases are one of the main reasons health \ncare costs have increased so dramatically over the past several \ndecades.\n  This chart shows it. In 2005 we spent $2 trillion on health care. For \nevery dollar spent, we spent 75 cents treating people who had a chronic \ndisease. But we spent four pennies on prevention--four pennies on \nprevention--and 75 cents out of the dollar treating them.\n  This second chart shows what has happened from 1987 to now: a $314 \nbillion increase in spending on all health care. Two-thirds of the \nincrease went to take care of people who had chronic illnesses.\n  Most of this is preventable. That is why we know, and we have good \ndata to show, that for every dollar we spend on prevention and wellness \nwe get a great return. For every dollar spent on childhood \nimmunization, we get a $16.50 return. For every smoking cessation \nprogram for pregnant women, $6; chronic disease prevention overall, \n$5.60. Even tuberculosis screening, for every dollar we spend we get \nmore money back in savings because we are not treating people with \nchronic illnesses.\n  So, again, why would we want to gut this program? But that is what \nthe Johanns amendment does. It says the Prevention and Public Health \nFund that we established in health care, which had support from both \nsides of the aisle--I think regardless of how anyone felt about the \nfinal version of the health care reform bill, I found no one who wanted \nto go after the Prevention and Public Health Fund because we all \nrecognized this is the path to our future: keeping people healthy in \nthe first place.\n  So we have this established. We have the fund established. The \nJohanns amendment guts it. It says no money; no money for prevention, \nno money for wellness until 2018. Well, we will just let people \ncontinue to get chronic illnesses, chronic diseases, and we will take \ncare of them later.\n  Remember what Benjamin Franklin said: An ounce of prevention is worth \na pound of cure. Our mothers were right when they told us that. We \nfinally have realized that in our society. Ask the medical community. \nAsk the nurses. Ask anyone. They will tell you we need to put more \nmoney into prevention and wellness programs across the board.\n  That is what we designed. That is what we put in the health care \nbill. It was broadly supported on both sides of the aisle. Yet \nregardless of whatever benefits the Johanns amendment may have--and, \nquite frankly, I tend to sympathize with the problems that were raised \nabout paperwork on small businesses--this is not the place to rob the \nmoney. This is the worst place from which to take the money. I do not \nknow why my friend from Nebraska saw fit to take money out of something \nthat is going to save us money, save lives, and cut down on needless \nhuman suffering in the future. Think of all of the people who will be \ncut off of smoking, people who will have wellness programs, screening \nprograms for the elderly that will start now. Every senior\n\n[[Page S7059]]\n\ncitizen can go in and get on Medicare, get an annual free checkup, and \na personalized medical plan to keep them healthy. Free mammograms, \nchildhood screenings--all part of getting ahead of the curve rather \nthan just treating people after they get sick.\n  I have looked at that amendment. I have looked at the Nelson \namendment. It seems to me the Nelson amendment does basically do the \nsame thing in terms of helping our small businesses. So I think the \nNelson amendment is the way to go because it does eliminate any \nreporting burden on the great majority of small businesses, those with \nless than 25 employees at any point in the year. But, most importantly, \nit does not take money out of the Prevention and Public Health Fund. It \ndoes not gut it.\n  So, as I say, regardless of whatever benefits you may think the \nJohanns amendment has, it is the wrong place to get the money, \nabsolutely the wrong place. So I ask my colleagues, if you really want \nto help small businesses and not gut the one thing in health care that \nis going to bend the cost curve, bend the cost curve, keep people \nhealthy, cut down on all of this money we are spending to take care of \npeople when they get sick, the best way to do that is to support the \nNelson amendment which does both: keeps the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund intact, and yet helps our small businesses. To me, that is \nthe right process to take.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 7 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. \nThune.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, when the health care reform bill passed, \nthe Speaker of the House famously said: We have to pass this bill so we \ncan figure out what is in it.\n  Well, what more and more Americans are finding when they look at what \nis in it are things they do not like. This is becoming increasingly \nless popular over time, and one of the most egregious provisions in \nthis bill is this 1099 provision.\n  The Senator from Iowa is worried about making sure more people have \naccess to health care. We all are. Well, the best way for most \nAmericans to get access to health care, because most Americans still \nget their health care coverage through their employers, the best way to \nget health care coverage is to get a job. This provision kills jobs.\n  This is directly targeted at small businesses, the economic engine, \nthe job creators in America today. So what the Senator from Nebraska is \ntrying to do is to correct this by repealing this onerous compliance \nburden that we are placing on the small businesses of this country. It \nis not the tax delinquents who get hurt by this, it is the hard-working \nsmall businesses. It is the charities. It is the government agencies \nwho have to deal with this burdensome paperwork.\n  That, I think, is why we have so many organizations. We have \nagricultural organizations such as the American Farm Bureau, the Corn \nGrowers, the Soybean Growers, the Cattlemen, and go right down the \nlist. We have small business organizations such as the Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the National Association of Home \nBuilders, the International Food Service Distributors, the Restaurant \nAssociation, and the Associated General Contractors that support repeal \nbecause it would hurt both their employees and their bottom line.\n  We even have government organizations such as the National \nAssociation of Towns and Townships, which represents local governments. \nThey support repeal because it would force cities and communities to \nkeep track of every purchase they make whether it be cement, snowplows, \nor pencils. This is a ridiculous requirement that we are imposing, in \nmany cases, on small businesses, on small charities, on small \norganizations, and local governments.\n  I can tell you from personal experience, in my State this is \nsomething they cannot comply with and cannot deal with. So if we are \nworried about job creation in this country, if we are worried about \neconomic growth, this is absolutely the wrong way to go about promoting \nit.\n  What the Johanns amendment does is repeal this provision. It does it \nin a fiscally responsible way. It is offset, it is paid for, and it \nmakes sense. I hope my colleagues will vote for this commonsense \namendment because whether this was an intended consequence or an \nunintended consequence, this is absolutely disastrous for small \nbusinesses across this country, and it is essential that we get this \npart of the health care reform bill repealed.\n  There are many others I think we are probably going to be talking \nabout before this is all said and done because, as I said, the more \npeople read the fine print in this legislation, the more they come to \nthe realization of how bad this is for small businesses and for job \ncreation in this country.\n  So I would urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Johanns \namendment and to repeal this onerous provision.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Montana, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, earlier this morning said small \nbusinesses are the engine that drives jobs in the economy. I agree with \nhim. I agree.\n  As the former chairman of the Small Business Committee, I know how \nimportant small businesses are. I traveled around the State during the \npast breaks to find out, meeting with small businesses, why they are \nnot creating jobs. We, frankly, have cut off the fuel supply, the \nprofits that drive these jobs.\n  I asked a group of small businesses: Why is it that you are not \ncreating jobs? Is it because of the uncertainty people are talking \nabout? I was immediately corrected.\n  They said: It is the certainty. We know what you have done in the \nhealth care law, putting unbelievable burdens on us.\n  They did not even know about this 1099 requirement at the time. But \nthe health care costs are burdening small businesses, and it is making \nit impossible and unwise for them to try to hire. I talked to a small \nbusinessman today, and I asked him about it. I told him what the \nrequirements were. He said: That is nuts. What do you think they are \ntalking about? We are going to have to hire more bookkeepers.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to \nlisten to small businesses in passing this bill. They put burdens on \nthem that are unbelievable. The new health care bill passed and signed \ninto law is a boondoggle that will bury small businesses in higher \ntaxes, new mandates, and more paperwork.\n  This particular job-killing mandate of the 1099 we are debating today \nwill drown small businesses in paperwork by requiring a small business \nowner to file two forms, one with the vendor and one with the IRS, for \nevery business-to-business transaction over $600.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal this morning, this means more \nthan 30 million small businesses will be hit by the new paperwork \nmandate beginning in 2013. That is not the worst of it. Even the \nNational Taxpayer Advocate at the Treasury Department, Nina Olson, said \nthe cost of this measure is ``disproportionate as compared with any \nresulting improvements in tax compliance.''\n  That is the problem. That is the problem, and the Johanns amendment \nis the only solution. We have to correct this job-killing mandate as \nurged by the NFIB, the Chamber of Commerce, and the National Small \nBusiness Association. Democrats are trying to sell a pig in a poke.\n  The Nelson alternative would leave the same bad provision in place, \nonly making it more complicated for small business owners to comply. It \nwould only exempt small businesses with 25 employees or less. So, in \nother words, we are telling small businesses not to hire the 26th \nworker while we are having unemployment up around 10 percent.\n  If you have small businesses in your State, you better listen to \nthem. They are wanting a repeal, the full repeal of this burdensome \nmandate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S7060]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article \nfrom today's Wall Street Journal editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 14, 2010]\n\n                            Review & Outlook\n\n\n                         The 1099 Insurrection\n\n       The White House fights an effort to ease a burden on small \n     business. You might not have seen it reported, but the Senate \n     will vote this morning on whether to repeal part of ObamaCare \n     that it passed only months ago. The White House is opposed, \n     but this fight is likely to be the first of many as Americans \n     discover--as Nancy Pelosi once famously predicted--what's in \n     the bill.\n       The Senate will vote on amendments to the White House small \n     business bill that would rescind an ObamaCare mandate that \n     companies track and submit to the IRS all business-to-\n     business transactions over $600 annually. Democrats tucked \n     the 1099 reporting footnote into the bill to raise an \n     estimated $17.1 billion, part of the effort to claim that \n     ObamaCare reduces the deficit by $100 billion or so.\n       But this ``tax gap'' of unreported business income is \n     largely a Beltway myth, and no less than the Treasury \n     Department's National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson says the \n     costs will be ``disproportionate as compared with any \n     resulting improvements in tax compliance.''\n       Meanwhile, small businesses are staring in horror toward \n     2013, when the 1099 mandate will hit more than 30 million of \n     them. Currently businesses only have to tell the IRS the \n     value of services they purchase from vendors and the like. \n     Under the new rules, they'll have to report the value of \n     goods and merchandise they purchase as well, adding vast \n     accounting and paperwork costs.\n       Think about a midsized trucking company. The back office \n     would have to collect hundreds of thousands of receipts from \n     every gas station where its drivers filled up and figure out \n     where it spent more than $600 that year. Then it would also \n     need to match those payments to the stations' corporate \n     parents.\n       Most Democrats now claim they were blindsided and didn't \n     understand the implications of the 1099 provision--which is \n     typical of the slapdash, destructive way the bill was written \n     and passed. As the critics claimed, most Members had no idea \n     what they were voting on. Some 239 House Democrats voted to \n     dump the 1099 provision in August, and the repeal would have \n     passed except Speaker Pelosi rigged the vote procedurally so \n     it needed a two-thirds majority. She thus gave Democrats the \n     cover of a repeal vote without actually repealing it.\n       In the Senate today, Nebraska Republican Mike Johanns will \n     offer his amendment to scrap the new 1099 rules altogether. \n     But the White House is opposing this because it fears it \n     would set a precedent for repealing the larger health bill. \n     Over the weekend the Treasury Department pronounced the \n     Johanns amendment ``not acceptable in its current form.''\n       Yesterday the White House endorsed a competing proposal \n     from Florida Democrat Bill Nelson that would increase the \n     1099 threshold to $5,000 and exempt businesses with fewer \n     than 25 workers. Yet this is little more than a rearguard \n     action in favor of the status quo; the Nelson amendment \n     leaves the basic architecture unchanged while making the \n     problem more complex.\n       Businesses would still have to track all purchases, not \n     knowing in advance which contractors will exceed $5,000 at \n     the end of the year. It also creates a marginal barrier to \n     job creation--for a smaller firm, hiring a 26th employee \n     would be extremely costly. The Nelson amendment also includes \n     new taxes on domestic oil production, as every Democratic \n     bill now seems to do.\n       As of yesterday, no one was sure if either amendment would \n     get 60 votes, though Democrat Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas is \n     cosponsoring the Johanns version. Enough Democrats may bend \n     to White House wishes and produce a stalemate, but this issue \n     won't go away. The President's opposition to a clean repeal \n     shows the hollowness of his alleged support for small \n     business, which he expresses at every campaign stop but is \n     less a priority than preserving his health-care legacy.\n       The larger political story here is that ObamaCare is \n     already under bipartisan siege--and in the same Congress that \n     passed it. The 1099 provision is only one plank, but \n     repealing the law plank by plank may be the right strategy. \n     Sooner or later the whole thing becomes unworkable. Voters \n     should watch this vote to see who's really on the side of \n     small business.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, how much time is on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Let me wrap up with something. If the Nelson amendment \npasses, this is the effect: These are businesses, real people who are \ngoing to be hurt because they are left out. In the State of Iowa, 3,334 \nbusinesses are left out; in the State of California, 18,960. Over \n40,000 businesses, employing 93 million people, are left out.\n  This talk about gutting the health care reform bill; are you kidding \nme? The President himself used $250 million of the $500 million this \nyear for purposes other than what was intended by this health care \nbill.\n  This is simply a choice between standing with our small businesses or \nstanding with the President on the health care bill against small \nbusinesses. I ask my colleagues to vote yes on the Johanns amendment \nand stand with small businesses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nsigned by 228 different organizations in the United States opposing the \nJohanns amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 1, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate considers the Small Business \n     Jobs and Credit Act (H.R. 5297), the 228 undersigned \n     organizations listed below strongly urge you to oppose the \n     use of the Prevention and Public Health Fund from the \n     Affordable Care Act (ACA) as an offset for an amendment \n     offered by Senator Johanns (No. 4596). Such an action would \n     virtually eliminate the Fund, and mark a severe blow to this \n     monumental commitment to prevention and public health under \n     the Act. We will also oppose any other such efforts to use \n     the Fund as an offset.\n       ACA included historic reforms that have the potential to \n     transform our health system. For too long, we have focused \n     spending on treating people once they are sick rather than \n     preventing illness in the first place. The Prevention and \n     Public Health Fund (Fund) is urgently needed to address the \n     many emerging health threats our country faces and the \n     persistent chronic disease rates that we must begin to \n     control. The Fund is intended to ensure a coordinated, \n     comprehensive, sustainable, and accountable approach to \n     improving our country's health outcomes through the most \n     effective prevention and public health programs.\n       ACA clearly states That the money be used ``for programs \n     authorized by the Public Health Service Act, for prevention, \n     wellness, and public health activities.'' The money would be \n     strategically used to support disease prevention by promoting \n     access to vaccines, building the public health workforce, and \n     investing in community-based prevention. Furthermore, the Act \n     specifically states that community-based prevention funding \n     must only support evidence-based prevention programs which \n     have been shown through scientific research to reduce chronic \n     disease, including behavioral health conditions, and address \n     health disparities. Research has shown that effective \n     community level prevention activities focusing on nutrition, \n     physical activity and smoking cessation can reduce chronic \n     disease rates and have a significant return on investment.\n       Already in Fiscal Year 2010, we have seen these funds \n     invested for programs to promote tobacco control and \n     implement tobacco cessation services and campaigns, as well \n     as obesity prevention, better nutrition and physical \n     activity. The fund has been invested to support state, local \n     and tribal public health efforts to advance health promotion \n     and disease prevention, and to build state and local capacity \n     to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease \n     outbreaks. The funds are also being used to support the \n     training of current and next generation public health \n     professionals.\n       The Fund is a unique opportunity to truly bend the cost \n     curve on health care spending. Seventy-five percent of all \n     health care costs in our country are spent on the treatment \n     of chronic diseases, many of which could be prevented. \n     Further, in a public opinion survey conducted just prior to \n     the passage of the Act, Trust for America's Health and the \n     Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) found that 71 percent \n     of Americans favored an increased investment in disease \n     prevention and that disease prevention was one of the most \n     popular components of health reform.\n       We must ensure that we capitalize on the unprecedented \n     opportunity to transform our public health system by \n     investing in prevention and public health. We urge you to \n     vote NO on the prevention fund offset within the Johanns \n     amendment, or on any other such legislative vehicles.\n           Sincerely,\n       AARP; ACCESS Women's Health Justice;

On this vote, the yeas are 61, the nays are \n37. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we hope we can finish this very quickly. The \nvotes are in. There are a number of technical things that could be done \nby those who oppose this legislation, but it would just waste a lot of \nthe Senate's time, which we do not have a lot of, so I hope we can move \nthrough this very expeditiously.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It is the most significant \nthing we have done since the stimulus bill was passed to create jobs. \nIt is estimated this will create from 500,000 to 700,000 jobs. It will \ngive community banks the ability now to compete with the big banks and \nloan money to small businesses.\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\n  As I said this morning, big banks are doing great. The stock market \njumped up yesterday because they looked at the financials of the big \nbanks and they are doing terrific. Big business is doing just fine. But \nin this recession we have the jobs that have been lost in the small \nbusiness sector. Eighty percent of the jobs lost are from small \nbusinesses. This legislation will allow community banks to start \nloaning money.\n  As you drive across the country, you see these strip malls with ``For \nLease'' signs up. That will be ending in the near future. People will \nbe able to borrow money to keep inventory for these little businesses \nthat create thousands and thousands of jobs. It will allow Karen Mills \nat the SBA, who has begged us for this legislation, to have the SBA \npart of stimulating our economy. There are programs there that are \nunder-resourced. This will allow her to have the resources to do good \nthings. There are tax incentives the Finance Committee has come up with \nthat will give tax breaks to small businesses. The chairman of the \ncommittee will talk about that at a subsequent time.\n  I want to acknowledge the hard work of many people. Of course, the \nperson who has been out front has been the chairman of the Small \nBusiness Committee, Senator Landrieu. She has done a remarkably good \njob. She has been diligent, persistent, and she never gives up. I am \nvery grateful to her for what she has done for the American people with \nthis legislation. She has had some help. The ability to give these tax \nbreaks to small businesses came from the Finance Committee, which is \nchaired by Senator Baucus of Montana. That is significant, for small \nbusinesses to get billions and billions of dollars of tax cuts.\n  Remember, everything in this bill is paid for. There is not a penny \nthat is deficit spending. In fact, we have a little extra money on this \nbill.\n  I would also say the breakthrough we had came with a seasoned \npolitician, someone who will go down in the history of Ohio as one of \nits great statespersons, the mayor of a big city, Governor of a State, \nand a Senator who has decided not to run for reelection, which is \nunfortunate in the minds of many. Senator George Voinovich in effect \nsaid: We have had enough of posturing on both sides, and I am going to \nvote for this bill because it is going to help the economy of Ohio and \nthe people of this country.\n  I admire and respect George Voinovich for what he has done, not only \non this legislation but what he has done in the past. This is not the \nfirst time he has decided that party is not as important as the \nAmerican people. I will always be an admirer of George Voinovich. There \nis no one more studious in the entire Senate than George Voinovich. He \nis known for studying legislation. He is someone who is very concerned \nand has been from the day he came here about the deficits this country \nhas. So I am not going to belabor the point other than to say I am very \ngrateful to George Voinovich for, in fact, breaking the logjam and \nsaying: I am going to vote for this legislation. He didn't do it \nsecretly, and he came out publicly and said what he was going to do.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to George LeMieux, who has \nbeen working on this legislation with Senator Landrieu for several \nmonths now. I appreciate his willingness to work with us in this \nregard.\n  On the Democratic side, Senator Landrieu, of course, and Senator \nBaucus led the charge. But we have had Boxer, Merkley, Cantwell, \nStabenow, Warner, Lincoln--a number of Senators who have worked very \nhard.\n  I spread across the record, this is not a victory for the Democratic \nParty. This is not a loss for the Republican Party. This is a win for \nthe American people. This is going to help small business, which has \nalways been the driver of jobs in our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture having been invoked, the motion to \ncommit falls.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his kind words, \nbut the fact is we would not have gotten to this point this morning \nwhere 61 Senators raised their hands or their voices to vote yes for \nthis important and substantial piece of legislation had it not been for \nthe leadership of Harry Reid.\n  The majority leader knows not only what Nevada needs but what America \nneeds. What America and Nevada both need right now is to get back to \nwork. The entities that are going to put Americans back to work are not \nfound on Wall Street; they are found on Main Street. They are not big \nbusinesses; they are small businesses. They are not the businesses that \nhave been around for 50 or 100 or 200 years; they are the businesses \nthat started up last year or that want to start up today.\n  Majority Leader Reid knows and understands that. We would not be here \nthis morning without his leadership. He is right to acknowledge \nChairman Baucus. I said he is a long-suffering chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and has also the patience of Job to put up with all he puts \nup with. Trying to pay for every idea that comes from all 100 of these \ndesks ends up on his desk. They say: You have a great idea, Senator; \nnow we need to pay for it. That is what Max Baucus does every day. I \nhope people appreciate it, not only in Montana but around the country. \nHe found a way not only to pay for this bill but for it to generate for \nthe taxpayer earnings of $1.1 billion. That is good work. It does not \nhappen here every day, and it would not have happened without Senator \nBaucus and the many cosponsors Senator Reid pointed out: Senator Boxer, \nSenator Merkley, Senator Cantwell, Senator Warner, Senator Levin, \nSenator Lincoln--particularly helpful and supportive.\n  I also want to say this vote today to end debate was the vote on this \nbill. Make no mistake about it, if 60 or 61 Senators had not said yes \nthis morning, this bill would have gone into this trash can right here \nnot to be seen again. The $12 billion in tax cuts would not be a \nreality. The substantial improvement of the core small business \nprograms would not be a reality, and the $30 billion lending fund that \nis going to leverage $300 billion in lending would not be a reality. It \nwould be in the trash can right now. But it is not. It is alive. It is \na living bill we are going to pass later today because 61 Senators in \nthis Chamber said yes to the country and no to party politics.\n  Particularly, I wish to point out Senator Voinovich. His statement \nwas so poignant in the paper today or yesterday when he said, or it was \nreported: I have run across small businesspeople in Ohio who went to 40 \nbanks to try to get a loan, he said, and were turned down every time.\n  This is happening all over America today. Senator Voinovich is a \nSenator who governs with his heart as well as his head, and he is not \nled around by the nose like some people here, by their party politics. \nHe said: No, the debate has to come to an end. If you want to debate \nthe George Bush tax cuts, do it on somebody else's back, not on the \nbacks of small businesses in Ohio or Louisiana or Virginia. They have \ntaken too much weight.\n  When Wall Street collapsed because of the their greed and their \nrecklessness and because of our failure to regulate them, do you know \nwho got hurt? Small businesses that did not have anything to do with \nderivatives or international investment. All these people do every day \nis wake up before the Sun comes up and they stay up when it is dark and \nthey work hard, sometimes by themselves once they send their workers \nhome, and keep that business going. They did nothing and they deserve \nhelp and they are getting it this morning.\n\n  One more word before I turn it over to my colleague from Virginia. \nThis whole debate this morning was a joke on Johanns. I want to talk \nabout that. If the Republicans were serious about repealing something \nthat needs to be repealed, they would have put an offset on this floor \nthat we could vote for. They knew very few Democrats would vote for a \nprovision that would harm one of the underlying principles of health \ncare reform. So that was all theater--all theater. I have had about \nenough of it, and I think many Americans have had enough of it as well.\n  Senator Johanns is right that the 1099 section needs to be repealed. \nHe is absolutely correct. It was the wrong thing to do. Even our side \nacknowledges that.\n  I am going to file a bill right now to take care of it. We are going \nto repeal\n\n[[Page S7064]]\n\n1099. We are not only going to repeal the portion that was put in by \nhealth care--which was not done intentionally, but there are sometimes \nunintended consequences. Anybody around here who thinks they can write \nperfect pieces of legislation--they cannot. When you do something \nwrong, you should correct it. We are going to correct it.\n  But in addition, my bill that I am going to file right now is going \nto repeal the $600 requirement that has been in the law for 62 years, \nand we are going to raise that threshold to $5,000, clean up the way \nsmall businesses have to report, and do something good for small \nbusiness in America.\n  It is going to be a Landrieu bill. Lots of other people have \nindicated an interest in the past. It is not theater, it is real. We \nare going to find a way to pay for it that both sides can agree to.\n  I want to tell the Chamber of Commerce that I know is listening right \nnow: We have heard you. I have heard the NFIB. I have heard small \nbusinesses in my State, and I know we made a mistake on this 1099 and \nwe are going to fix it. But it does not have to be fixed this morning. \nIt doesn't even go into effect for a year and a half.\n  Hear me, it doesn't go into effect for a year and a half. We have \ntime to fix 1099. But we don't have 1 minute to wait to send money to \nsmall businesses that are putting ``Closed'' signs on their businesses \nthis morning. If the Republican Party thinks they can keep saying no to \nsmall business and keep saying no to Main Street and keep saying no to \nthe middle class--they cannot. I hope when we vote on final passage \nthere will be a few more yeses.\n  We have a year and a half to fix 1099. We don't have any more time to \nhelp small businesses.\n  I yield the floor for the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I commend my friend and colleague, \nthe Senator from Louisiana, who I know the Senate has heard repeatedly \nover the last few weeks, relentlessly over the last few weeks, come \nback time and again and again on this issue around small business. I \nthink many Americans are getting a chance to see what those of us who \nhave the privilege of serving with Mary Landrieu see regularly: This is \nsomebody who does not take no. This is someone I know we sometimes need \nto prod to come out of her shell. But this is someone who is so \npassionate about the people of Louisiana and, in her role as Chair of \nthe Small Business Committee, has been a tireless voice for small \nbusinesses, not just in Louisiana but in Virginia, New Mexico, all \nacross the country. I want to join the majority leader and others in \ncommending her for her ``stick-to-it-iveness'' on this critical piece \nof legislation.\n  I want to add a couple of other comments. I concur as well with the \nSenator from Louisiana on the issue of 1099s. We do need to have an \naccurate way to ensure that the standing law that has been the law of \nthe land for 62 years is enforced. But this process of filing a 1099 at \na $600 threshold at this moment in time is way overburdensome. I, like \nthe Senator from Louisiana, and I think most Members, heard that loudly \nand clearly, and we do need to fix that.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Landrieu. I know Senator \nBegich and others have been involved in those efforts. I look forward \nto joining them in this effort.\n  I want to take a moment or two--our time is about up before we break \nfor our caucus lunches--I think it is important that the pieces of this \nbill have been emphasized time and again, the lending facility, small \nbusinesses that can take capital in if they increase their percentage \nof lending, this is particularly helpful to small banks that might be \nin challenging financial times at this point.\n  The SBA, the replenishment of funding for the SBA, the one message I \nbrought out everywhere across Virginia over the last month and a half \nwas that the SBA today is not your grandfather's or even your daddy's \nSBA. It is not even 5 years ago's SBA. The SBA, under Administrator \nKaren Mills, is much less bureaucratic, much more streamlined.\n  With the work the Small Business Committee has done in terms of \nupping the guarantees, the SBA's role and the type of businesses the \nSBA has served during this crisis has expanded dramatically. Look at \nthe number of banks that participate now with the SBA today versus 18 \nmonths ago. That remarkably successful effort ground to an immediate \nhalt in June when funding ran out. Why in the heck it has taken us this \nlong simply to replenish that proven program that does not add to the \ndeficit is one of the things that gets a lot of folks in Virginia, \nLouisiana, and New Mexico scratching their heads.\n  There is another piece of this bill, one that the chairman was kind \nenough to work with me and others on, that builds upon an existing \ninitiative in the private sector and I believe in about 26 States, a \nCapital Access Program, that helps those marginal small business loans \nbecome more bankable. I hear the same concerns the Chair of the Small \nBusiness Committee hears: A small business cannot get their loans, \nalthough I have got to say it is not only the bankers' fault, because, \nlet's face it, a lot of small businesses today are not as financially \nhealthy as they were 2 years ago. If they have real estate as \ncollateral, it has decreased in value. If they are lending on cashflow, \nthat has decreased as well. So how do we take that otherwise healthy \nsmall business, in good times and in normal recessions, and not let it \nfall off the cliff in this deepest recession since the Great \nDepression?\n  The Capital Access Program is one place where a borrower will be \ncharged a couple of extra points, we will go in from the government and \nmatch those points, and we can create a first-dollar loss, a separate \nloss reserve pool, for a whole series of loans; another $30- to $60 \nbillion of capacity in that aspect. Finally, what is not to like about \nthe series of small business tax credits that have also been built into \nthis legislation? So I commend the chairperson of the Small Business \nCommittee. I am glad the Senate has come to its senses on this issue. \nCandidly, I wish we would have passed this legislation last spring, but \nbetter late than never.\n  I want to add two other points that I think are important. One other \npiece of legislation, a bipartisan piece of legislation that we passed \nrecently--and I would be curious to hear the response of the Chair of \nthe Small Business Committee on this with the financial reform bill, a \nvery important piece of legislation. We set, appropriately, in that \nfinancial reform bill the requirement for banks to set higher capital \nstandards. The challenge we have right now is starting to implement \nthose higher capital standards in the trough of the recession. That \nsends a very mixed message to our bankers and to our regulators. I hope \nthe Chair of the Small Business Committee and I and others can think \nabout how we work with our regulators at the FDIC and the OCC and the \nFed to ensure that while we want to build up the capital reserves and \nmake our banks healthier, that some level of forbearance for those \nsmall business performing loans that may not meet every covenant in \ntheir loan document, because their real estate has depreciated in \nvalue, somehow we have to have some flex. Because what we are doing by \nhaving the regulators come down so hard on the banks at this point is \nwe are, in many ways, even with this very good program that Senator \nLandrieu has put out, strangling that recovery because of this mixed \nmessage.\n  The final point I want to make is, with this piece of small business \nlegislation, I think it may be--again, it is not going to be a single \nsilver bullet, but one piece of good news that I do not think we have \ncome back to enough in these discussions is that not only have large \nbanks recovered nicely since the decline, but large cap companies, the \nFortune 1,0000 companies, their balance sheets are healthier today than \nthey have ever been. There is north of $2 trillion in cash sitting on \nFortune 1,000 balance sheets. One of the things I am looking forward to \nworking with my colleagues on is how we get that cash off the sidelines \nand invested back in the market. When they invest in the market, and \nthe large companies go to their supply chains, which is the small \nbusinesses, those small businesses have to get the credit as well to \nkeep functioning. So this piece of legislation is important not only to \nsmall businesses, but as\n\n[[Page S7065]]\n\nlarge cap companies start to spend out as well, it is important to the \noverall economic recovery.\n  I would ask my friend and my colleague, the leader on this important \npiece of legislation, if she might have some ideas as well about how we \nmeet that appropriate long-term financial goal of making our financial \nstandards appropriate, but not send this mixed message to regulators so \nthat those small business loans that are still performing have the \nappropriate forbearance to get through this trough in the recession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia is absolutely \ncorrect. He has put his finger on two pending and very serious \nproblems. One is the regulation direction being driven by some of the \nnew legislation we have passed. Of course, he would know this, because \nas a member of the Banking Committee, he has been such a strong \nadvocate for commonsense regulation and supporting community banks. So \nhe is absolutely correct. And you do have my commitment, through the \nSmall Business Committee, to keep this issue alive and in view so that \nwe can find some appropriate solution. I think the Senator raises an \nabsolutely very key point.\n  The second point the Senator from Virginia has put his finger on is \nthe $2 trillion in capital sitting there. One thing that makes further \ninterest is the zero capital gains rate in this bill, should they take \nsome of that $2 trillion in capital and invest in some small businesses \nthat have a capitalization level below $50 million. That is one thing \nthat could help encourage them. They will pay no tax, none, on the \nmoney they earn through that investment, which should be an incentive.\n  But there are some additional things I think we can do. I want to \nwork with the Senator from Virginia because his leadership is very much \nneeded at this time, with his particular background as a successful \nbusiness person, as a Governor. So the Senator is right, this bill is \nnot a silver bullet. It is a good first step. But there are some other \nthings we need to do as quickly as we can. I look forward to working \nwith the Senator on those two and others in the weeks to come.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again I will close my comments and thank \nthe chairman of the Small Business Committee for her leadership on this \nbill. We would not be here today but for her relentlessness on this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation has had more hurdles, many of them false hurdles, \nput in its face, and Senator Landrieu does not know how to say no when \nit affects the well-being of small businesses, which are the lifeblood \nof job creation coming out of a recession.\n  I thank her for her leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time in \nrecess for the caucus luncheons count postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Don't Ask, Don't Tell\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, with all the talk about the small business \nbill and about the fact that we have an administration, with a majority \nin the House and the Senate, that has amassed unbelievable debts, \nraising it up to $13 trillion, and a deficit of $1.4 trillion in just 1 \nyear, the first year, people have forgotten other things that are going \non.\n  I am very much concerned, being the second-ranking member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, about the national defense \nauthorization bill, which we have passed every year in all the years I \nhave been here. Generally speaking, it is one we can bring out on the \nfloor, Members can offer amendments, and normally it takes 2, 3, \nsometimes 4 weeks, and longer, to pass it. But certainly, particularly \nduring times of war, it is the most important piece of legislation we \nhave.\n  I do not know what the majority is going to do. I just keep hearing \nrumors that they may very well not be wanting to bring it up or may \nbring it up by ``filling the tree,'' a little technical term, so \nRepublicans would not be able to have amendments on the bill.\n  Well, this is very much a concern of mine. I think it puts them in a \nposition where they can say: Oh, Republicans certainly are going to \nvote for the Defense authorization bill. In times of war, we have to do \nit. Well, we do. But there is a limit as to what they can put in there \nthat is purely right down party lines.\n  There are a couple issues I wish to talk about in the Defense \nauthorization bill that ended up being right down party lines. One is \nthe issue of don't ask, don't tell. But before doing that, I would like \nto suggest that in May, in the final meeting we had of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, we passed this out, and two amendments were added \non the very last day by the Democrats, and they were passed virtually \nby all the Democrats right down party lines. One was opening our \nmilitary hospitals for abortions, and that is something we need to talk \nabout, but the other one was one we need to talk about more right now \nbecause this is the issue that so many people are not aware of. That is \nthe repeal of don't ask, don't tell.\n  I remember back in 1994, I was in the House, running for the Senate, \nand one of the three issues that was very prominent in that race, which \nI won, concerned gays in the military. At that time, there were some \nefforts saying: Well, we want to acknowledge gays in the military so \nthey can be open in their practices and all that. Well, a compromise \nwas reached that I did not think at the time was all that good of an \nidea. But that was 1993, I guess, the latter part of 1993. It has \nworked for--what--17 years. It was called don't ask, don't tell; that \nis, if someone wants to serve who is a gay person, a man or a woman, in \nthe military, that person can do it if that person is not out in the \nopen. The whole idea of this thing was so they could not use the \nmilitary as a forum to advance very liberal causes.\n  I am a veteran. I can remember when I was in the U.S. Army, and \nanyone who is a veteran knows the problems that would be associated \nwith the practice of repealing don't ask, don't tell so people are \nopenly gay in the military. You are going to have all kinds of \nbilleting and other problems.\n  So I think when the discussion came up that we were considering doing \nthis, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, did the right thing on \nFebruary 2 of 2010. He said: Let's go ahead and have a study. Let's \nhave an independent study as to how unit cohesion and readiness would \nbe impacted if we repealed don't ask, don't tell.\n  In addition to the study, this is also going to conduct a survey of \nmilitary members, people who are out there, in asking: Well, what is \nyour feeling? You are out there in the fields, in many cases, out in \nthe foxholes. What is your feeling about having open gays in the \nmilitary?\n  So they were all getting ready to respond to this when a surprise \ntook place, when the Democrats, almost straight down party lines, came \nout and said: Well, we are going to go ahead and repeal it anyway. They \nworded it in such a way that we will repeal it, but, of course, that \nwill not take place until after the study is complete. The study was to \nbe completed in December of this year. It was going to be a 12-month \nstudy. All the Members of the military were going to participate in \nthat.\n  I can remember as recently as April 28 Secretary Gates and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, said--and this \nis a joint statement:\n\n\n[[Page S7066]]\n\n\n       [We] believe in the strongest possible terms that the \n     Department must, prior to any legislative action, be allowed \n     the opportunity to conduct a thorough, objective, and \n     systematic assessment of the impact of such a policy change.\n\n  Well, I was all for that. They were right, along with all the rest of \nthe chiefs of the military and all the troops in the field. Of course, \nthey obviously changed their minds. But if you want to know the effect, \nyou need to go and talk to the troops in the field, and then you need \nto talk also to the chiefs of the military.\n  I am going to go ahead and quote, so I can get it in the Record now, \nexactly the feelings of those Chiefs of the four services and what they \nare recommending. I am so sick and tired of having the administration \nmake those decisions without any consultation of the people in uniform. \nWe are going through that right now in some of the things that are \ngoing on in Iraq and Afghanistan. The policy should be: The people in \nuniform know what to do. Quit trying to dictate their behavior.\n  Well, anyway, General Casey, the Chief of the U.S. Army, said:\n\n       I remain convinced that it is critically important to get a \n     better understanding of where our Soldiers and Families are \n     on this issue, and what the impacts on readiness and unit \n     cohesion might be. . . .\n\n  He said:\n\n       I also believe that repealing the law before the completion \n     of the review--\n\n  That is the one that is supposed to be completed in December--\n\n     will be seen by the men and women of the Army as a reversal \n     of our commitment to hear their views before moving forward.\n\n  That is exactly what we are saying. We are saying: All right. We \nwanted your views, but we are not going to listen to your views now.\n  Admiral Roughead of the U.S. Navy said:\n\n       We need this review to fully assess our force and carefully \n     examine potential impacts of a change in the law. My concern \n     is that legislative changes at this point, regardless of the \n     precise language used, may cause confusion on the status of \n     the law in the Fleet and disrupt the review process itself by \n     leading Sailors to question whether their input matters.\n\n  Obviously, their input does not matter now because they have already \nmade that decision.\n  General Conway, of the U.S. Marine Corps--he is the Commandant--said:\n\n       I encourage Congress to let the process the Secretary of \n     Defense created run its course. Collectively, we must make \n     logical and pragmatic decisions about the long-term policies \n     of our Armed Forces--which so effectively defend this great \n     nation.\n\n  General Schwartz, of the U.S. Air Force, said:\n\n       I believe it is important, a matter of keeping faith with \n     those currently serving in the Armed Forces, that the \n     Secretary of Defense commissioned review be completed before \n     there is any legislation to repeal the don't ask, don't tell \n     law. Such action allows me to provide the best military \n     advice to the President, and sends an important signal to our \n     Airmen and their families that their opinion matters. To do \n     otherwise, in my view, would be presumptive and would reflect \n     an intent to act before all relevant factors are assessed. . \n     . .\n\n  Well, I agree with all that. These are the guys in the field. They \nare the ones who are making this decision. Yet, on May 27, both Gates \nand Mullen, who had already stated they should wait until after this \nstudy is completed--that would be in December--on May 27, they had what \nthey called a compromise. Basically, the compromise is saying: Well, we \nare going to go ahead and repeal it. That was the motion that was in \nthe last day before we passed the Defense authorization bill out of the \nHouse, and the same thing, the Defense authorization bill of the \nSenate.\n  Why did they change? Why did Gates and Mullen change? Gates and \nMullen answered to the President. The President, I truly believe--and I \nhate to throw this into it--but, obviously, this is something the vast \nmajority of people in America would like to see happen the way we had \nsaid it was going to happen, so we could evaluate the effect on \nreadiness and the effect on our troops in the field, the effect on the \nwar that is taking place right now. Yet they went ahead and reversed \nthat, and, again, that was right down party lines.\n  There are so many other things having to do with this that are \ncritical. Obviously, current chaplains are not able to be heard. But we \nhave a letter from 41 of the retired chaplains stating that \n``normalizing homosexual behavior in the armed forces will pose a \nsignificant threat to chaplains' and Servicemembers' religious \nliberty.''\n  So we have this that is taking place right now.\n  I know a lot of people are concerned, as I am concerned, with a \nruling that came from a district court out in California. This ruling \ncame out and said: We think it is a violation of the first amendment \nrights of homosexuals not to be able to express their preferences in \nany way they want.\n  However, the military is different. It is my understanding--and I am \nnot a lawyer--this ruling may not have any effect. In fact, there is an \narticle. It was on FOX News this morning: ``Pentagon: No Plans To \nChange `Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Policy After Court Ruling.'' Well, that \nwas good news to me because I thought maybe it was all over once the \ncourts ruled.\n  But the only thing they would go through now with the compromise, \nthey call it, that they passed, is that you would have to have Admiral \nMullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense \nGates, and President Obama making the statement as to what they prefer. \nThat is why I say this is over and done with, unless we have an \nopportunity to bring out the Defense authorization bill and to offer \namendments on the Defense authorization bill. I have to tell you, there \nare several Democrats now who have joined Republicans in wanting to \nstop the repeal of don't ask, don't tell or at least to wait until this \nstudy is completed.\n  But if you do not think the three I just mentioned have already made \nup their minds, I will go ahead and read their statements.\n  President Obama:\n\n       This year, I will work with Congress and our military to \n     finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to \n     serve the country they love because of who they are.\n\n  Secretary Gates:\n\n       I fully support the president's decision. The question \n     before us is not whether the military prepares to make this \n     change, but how we best prepare for it.\n\n  Admiral Mullen:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, speaking for myself . . . it is my personal \n     belief that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would \n     be the right thing to do.\n\n  So you have to ask the question, Why? What was wrong with waiting \nuntil December? I will tell you what is wrong: because there is an \nelection that is taking place November 2 and the gay lobby is a huge \nlobby. I think we all know that. All these people who think they have \nnot been liberal enough, I cannot imagine there is anyone in America \ntoday who thinks this administration has not been liberal enough. But \nthese individuals are the ones who want to have this done before the \nNovember 2 elections. I can think of no reason at all that they would \ntake this stand other than the political reason.\n  So here is what I believe. I think we are going to have to make a \ndecision. I would certainly hope the majority leader and the Democrats \nwho have this policy will allow this to come up and come up as soon as \npossible and allow a full and open debate, as we have always had. There \nis not a time in the history of this country that we have brought up a \nDefense authorization bill, particularly in time of war, without \nallowing everybody to get in there and to offer amendments. Perhaps it \ncould be argued this is the most important bill of the year.\n  So I am hoping people start talking about it. That is why I am \nbringing it up today. The fear I have is this is going to be shoved \ndown our throats by the majority, and we cannot let this happen.\n  Right now, we have a lot of men and women over in the various areas \nof combat. I have had the honor of being over there many times. I have \nworked with these individuals. We have more than our share in my State \nof Oklahoma. Our 45th is going to be going back over there. I would \nlike to make sure these guys and gals know we are listening to them.\n\n  A lot of people criticize me and others for spending so much time \nover there, but there are so many things we find out when we are over \nthere--things we can't get in hearings back here. I am talking about \nfinding out, as we did over there, about the need for\n\n[[Page S7067]]\n\nthe MRAP and some of the other capabilities we need to have so we can \ncome back and make sure our kids who are over there fighting have \neverything they want. The very least we can do is keep our word, when \nwe promised them that we are not going to do anything until we hear \nback from our military, our soldiers in the field, as to what they feel \nabout the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. It is a very significant \nissue and it is one we are going to have to talk about this week.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, we are in the process of debating the \nsmall business bill. I am so grateful to the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana who has fought so hard to get this bill through the process \nof cloture, including an amendment attached to that piece of \nlegislation which makes available $30 billion for the community banks \nto help out small businesses. I hate that it has taken so much time to \nget these important pieces of legislation through this body and out \nwhere it will benefit those needing it. Based on that, I am hoping we \nwill bring this piece of legislation to a very speedy and expeditious \nclose and that we will not continue to find political maneuverings to \nhamper the passage of this small business bill.\n  For the last 2 years, this country has been held in the grips of an \nunprecedented economic crisis. The housing market collapsed. The bottom \ndropped out of Wall Street. For the first time in generations, many \nAmericans felt their hard-earned economic security begin to slip away. \nToo often, the focus of legislation has been on Wall Street rather than \non Main Street. We have made some significant progress since the onset \nof our current crisis, but we still have a very long way to go, \nespecially in creating new and sustainable jobs.\n  But this is an election year, and that means partisan bickering is on \nthe rise.\n  So I believe my colleagues and I have a decision to make. We must \nmake a decision. We can focus on winning the next news cycle, pitting \nRepublicans against Democrats and falling into the same tired political \nbattles that usually consume election years in Washington or we can \nreach for something better. We can tune out the partisan fights, reject \nthe failed policies that got us into this mess, and prove to the \nAmerican people that we have the will to make tough decisions to get \nour collective economy on the move again.\n  Our recovery is far from complete. We need to create more jobs. We \nneed to bring American families more relief. Government can put people \nto work, but only the private sector--especially the small business \nsector--can create real and lasting employment. I believe that if we \nfail to continue the bold policies that pulled us back from the brink \nof disaster--if we shrink away from the difficult decisions that will \nmove this recovery forward--then we place our economy at risk by \nslipping back into a recession.\n  This is a time for bold action, not pointless ideological battles. \nThe Small Business Lending Act will move this economy forward in real \nand tangible ways. That is what the American people want and need, and \nthey are asking us to get about the business of doing it.\n  The bill before us gives small businesses $12 billion in tax cuts. It \nhelps small businesses create 500,000 new jobs. It incentivizes and \nincreases small business lending. It helps small business owners access \nprivate capital to finance expansion and to hire new workers. That is \nwhere the jobs are going to be created, is with these small businesses \nwe are now seeking to help. It rewards entrepreneurs for investing in \nnew small businesses. It helps Main Street businesses compete with \nlarge corporations.\n  Just this past Friday, I hosted a small business forum in Chicago at \nChicago State University and I spent the day talking with business \nowners from all walks of life from all over my State and from a wide \nrange of industries. Everyone I spoke with said the same thing: We need \nhelp now. Pass the legislation. That is what they were telling me.\n  Tomorrow I will host a small business forum in partnership with my \ngood friends over in the other Chamber, in the House of \nRepresentatives, including Congressman Lacy Clay of Missouri and \nCongresswoman Yvette Clark. Together, we hope to work directly with \nthese small business owners to get capital flowing again.\n  These entrepreneurs are not asking for a handout from this \ngovernment; they are asking for the tools and resources to grow \nthemselves, to work and to build within their communities, and to \ncreate jobs for hard-working Americans. That is what they are asking \nfor. Everyone I spoke with reminds me that there are many ways each of \nus can act to advance the interests of each of those small businesses \nin our own States. But together, by acting collectively and by \nsupporting this bill, we can take a major step forward in strengthening \nour American economy.\n  As I have reminded this Chamber before, long before I entered public \nservice, I was a banker. As a matter of fact, I was the vice president \nof the largest bank in my State. It no longer exists now, but it was \nContinental Illinois Bank and Trust Company. We were the seventh \nlargest bank in America at that time. I ran a division that loaned \nmoney to small businesses. So I have firsthand knowledge and \ninformation of what it takes to finance and to run these businesses, \nbecause if I loaned you the bank's money, you were going to pay me \nback. It was not my money, it was the depositors' money, and I had to \nbe the custodian of that money. Guess what. Just last Friday in \nChicago, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of a company called Central \nCity Productions--the largest black-owned production business in \nAmerica--that produces TV programs and other marketing and competitive \nprograms for the communities. They have been in business for 40 years. \nI loaned that young man in those days $50,000. Of course, that was \n1970, and $50,000 went a long way then. It probably would take about $1 \nmillion to do what we did with $50,000 then, in today's market. So that \nis the knowledge I bring before this body and to this legislation we \nhave on the floor: Knowing what small businesses take; knowing what we \nneed to do to help those companies get the resources they need so they \ncan get their inventory, so they can get their line of credit, so they \ncan then put their people to work and sell their goods and services to \ntheir respective customers.\n  There is no greater investment we can make if we are serious about \nsustainable job creation and growth and to encourage investment and \nloaning to small businesses.\n  So I call upon my colleagues in this great body to seize this \nopportunity. Let's keep America on the road to recovery and restore the \nhard-earned security of ordinary folks who have suffered because of bad \ndecisions on Wall Street. It will not be easy, but it is our \nresponsibility, and it is the right thing to do. We have that \nresponsibility. We have no other alternative than to, as the old saying \ngoes, do the right thing. We must make sure this legislation is passed. \nWe should start by increasing our support right now for this \nlegislation for small businesses. These companies foster progress and \nthey foster innovation. They have the power to create jobs and direct \ninvestment to local communities, where it can have the most and \ngreatest impact and make a difference in our economic status.\n  Small businesses form the backbone of our economy, but in many ways \nthey have suffered the most as a result of this economic crisis. That \nis why this sector should be targeted for our strongest support. There \nshould be no debate about this. It should not be Republican or \nDemocrat. This should be about helping America create jobs. We have \noutsourced all our jobs already to the foreign markets, which have \nshipped the manufacturing jobs out to other markets. We have to get \nback to manufacturing. Our small innovative companies should come back \nin so they can then create manufacturing jobs, so we can have value-\nadded products and continue the workstream for people to be employed.\n  I ask my colleagues to reject the tired politics that got us into \nthis mess and embrace the spirit of bipartisanship that can lead us out \nof this mess.\n  On behalf of small businesses, I call upon this body to take action. \nOur economic future may be uncertain, but with the Small Business \nLending Act, we have the rare opportunity to influence that future. So \nlet's pass this measure and guarantee some degree of\n\n[[Page S7068]]\n\nrelief for the people who continue to suffer the most. Let's renew our \ninvestment in America's small businesses and rely on them to drive our \neconomic recovery. Let's do it now. Let's do it today. Let's don't even \ndo it tomorrow.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor as much time as I may consume and ask that the time be counted \nagainst the postcloture time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             American Jobs\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this country, as all of us know, faces \nvery significant challenges these days. We have roughly 20 million \npeople who woke up in America today without a job, who probably are out \ntoday looking for work and haven't found it yet. It is a pretty tough \nthing in a severe economic downturn--the worst since the Great \nDepression of the 1930s--to find that you lost your job, and in some \ncases your home, and you have lost hope and you wonder what is next for \nyou and your family.\n  I suppose it is in keeping with our politics these days that, at a \ntime when we face the most significant economic challenges since the \nGreat Depression, if you stop and watch and listen and hear the sounds \nof democracy, which sound a little like fingernails on a blackboard \nsometimes, what you hear on the news is something about someone's \ndysfunctional behavior somewhere. Someone does something absolutely \ngoofy, just a nutty activity, and all of a sudden, it is on the 24/7 \nnews.\n  In the last couple weeks, I have been traveling and hearing on the \ntelevision, radio, and in print about some nut from Florida--apparently \na minister with a church of 50 people--who decides he is going to burn \nthe Koran. We heard about it every day, all day. There is some \nsuggestion that if you give this a lot of publicity and hold it up to \nthe light and say, ``Isn't it ugly?'' you would say, ``Yes, but it is \nnot America; it is just some nut.'' You find someone's dysfunctional \nbehavior and say, ``Isn't this awful?'' Sure, it is awful, but that is \nnot the backbone of this country or what this country is about.\n  We have to begin talking about what really matters to put this \ncountry back on track and to give people some hope for the future, that \nthey are going to see more opportunity, that they are going to see \nexpansion of hope and opportunity for themselves, their families, and \ntheir children.\n  I think it is true that of all of the issues that matter most at this \npoint, it is, how can you put people back to work? There is no social \nprogram that we debate in Congress that is more important than a good \njob that pays well. That makes almost everything else possible. If you \nhave a good job that pays well, with job security and benefits, it \nallows you to take care of your family and do the other things that \nexpand your opportunities in this great country.\n  I have watched and observed what is happening, and I participate in \nthe debates in the Congress about what is happening in our country. I \nam very worried about this issue of trying to turn the faucet on to \ncreate new jobs in America at the very time the drain is open, with \njobs moving outside of this country very quickly.\n  I have spoken about this and have offered 4 amendments over 9 or 10 \nyears, and I have gotten anywhere from 40 to 47 votes on an amendment \nthat says: Let's decide to stand up for employment in America, stand up \nfor jobs here. Let's shut down the insidious, perverse tax incentives \nthat tell American businesses that if you shut down your business in \nAmerica, fire your workers here at home, and you move it to China or \nMexico, we will give you a big fat tax break. That is true. We have a \ntax incentive to say: Get rid of your American enterprise, ship it \noverseas, move it to Mexico, and we will give you a tax cut. I have \ntried four times in votes on the floor of the Senate to shut that down, \nand I lost all four times. But we need to try it again. We need to do \nthis, especially when you have the deep economic abyss into which we \nhave fallen. We now need to say to people that we are going to stand up \nfor employers, those who run the manufacturing plants in this country, \nthose who hire American workers, those who produce products that say \n``Made in America'' on the label. We are going to stand up for them, \nand we are not going to continue to give tax breaks to those who decide \nto do exactly the opposite and move their jobs overseas.\n  I am going to talk about a few of those circumstances. I have done it \nmany times, and sometimes people roll their eyes when I do. But it is \nimportant, it seems to me, to continue to talk about this failure in \nour economic system.\n  The American Prospect--a magazine I was reading a while back--\nestimates that since 2001, there are 42,400 American factories that \nhave closed their doors. Roughly three-fourths of those employed over \n500 people. Why is that happening? Why is it that American factories \nare closing? Does it matter? Do we believe America will long remain a \nworld economic power if it doesn't have world-class manufacturing? I \ndon't. It will not be a world economic power without world-class \nmanufacturing capability, and very quickly, it is dissipating. We are \nlosing jobs and economic strength in the manufacturing sector. We see \nadditional evidence of it every day.\n  Here is a June New York Times piece:\n\n       In Indiana, Centerpiece for a City Closes Shop.\n       Whirlpool plans to close a plant on Friday and move the \n     operation to Mexico, eliminating 1,100 jobs here [in \n     Indiana]. Many in this city in southern Indiana are seething \n     and sad--sad about losing what was long the city's economic \n     centerpiece and a ticket to the middle class for one \n     generation after another.\n\n  That is Whirlpool--1,100 jobs.\n  Last week, I was in Pennsylvania with Congressman Sestak, in \nPhiladelphia. I told a story that I have known pretty well about \nsomething that happened in Pennsylvania. I told it on the floor many \ntimes. It is about something called Pennsylvania House Furniture, which \nis upper end, fine furniture, made by craftsmen. It is very good \nfurniture. They worked for over 100 years, using Pennsylvania wood, to \ncreate Pennsylvania House furniture. Then one day the company was \nbought by La-Z-Boy, and La-Z-Boy decided: You know what, we are going \nto get rid of those craftsmen who work in Pennsylvania and ship these \njobs to China. What we will do is continue to use Pennsylvania wood, \nbut we will just ship the wood to China and have the Chinese fashion it \ninto furniture and then send it back to sell in the United States and \ncall it Pennsylvania House furniture.\n  What most people from Pennsylvania and across the country probably \ndon't know is that on the last day of work, when those workers lost \ntheir jobs, after a century of making fine furniture in Pennsylvania, \nthe last piece of furniture came down the line completed, and they \nturned it over and all of the craftsmen at Pennsylvania House furniture \nautographed it. Someone in America has an autographed piece of \nfurniture by the craftsmen who cared so much about their jobs and had \nsuch pride in making the best furniture they could make. And then the \njobs were gone. All the wood was sent to China and the furniture is \nsent back, and you have nearly 500 people out of work. So much for the \nstory of Pennsylvania House furniture. Does it matter that we don't \nmake Pennsylvania House furniture in this country? Well, it sure \nmatters to the 500 or so people for whom it was their career, a job \nthat made a difference for their families. It made a difference to them \nbecause they were out of work.\n  I just mentioned Whirlpool deciding to get rid of 1,100 jobs. Well, \nit is interesting, here is a story in the Indiana Economic Digest. It \nsays:\n\n       U.S. based manufacturers are shipping jobs overseas.\n\n  That is a familiar story.\n\n       Whirlpool is just one local example of a story that has \n     played out across the nation for decades.\n       The appliance-maker is in the process of shutting down its \n     Evansville refrigerator plant. March 26 was the last day for \n     455 [people in that plant.]\n\n\n[[Page S7069]]\n\n\n  Those jobs will go to Mexico in late June.\n  But then it says something different. It says:\n\n       But not all local manufacturers are interested in moving \n     overseas.\n       HMC manufactures and refurbishes large precision gears and \n     other machinery components. . . . The company has 75 \n     employees. It has never laid off an employee.\n       Robert J. Smith III, the company's president and chief \n     executive officer, is dead-set against ever moving production \n     overseas.\n       ``We wouldn't consider it in a 100 years.''\n\n  His grandfather and grandmother started the company in 1921. \n``Offshoring in search of higher profits is a mistake,'' Smith said, \n``because it ignores manufacturing's larger purpose in U.S. society.'' \nAnd here is what he says finally:\n\n       It's my belief that every American citizen, not only me, \n     should feel strongly about maintaining one of the most \n     important cultures we have, and that is manufacturing.\n\n  I have used examples previously--and I will again--because I think \nrepetition is important. The peppermint pattie called York--it is a \ntiny little peppermint pattie in a silver encasing. It is made by \nHershey's Chocolate, by the way. It says: ``The cool refreshing taste \nof mint dipped in dark chocolate will take you miles away.'' It sure \ndid that. It took it all the way to Mexico. They decided to fire those \nAmerican workers, and that mint chocolate went to Mexico to be \nproduced.\n  The list is actually pretty endless. I just described Whirlpool, \n1,100 jobs. They received millions in Recovery Act funds, and yet \nannounced 1,100 job cuts--by the way, this is the long walk on the last \nday of work at a manufacturing plant. You go there to make it a career \nand then all of a sudden you discover the job is not there. Some \nforeign country has that job because America has decided to reward \nthose who leave as opposed to those who stay.\n  If you wear a Reebok NFL jersey--and a whole lot of folks wear these \njerseys--this is made in a Chinese-owned sweatshop in El Salvador. How \ndo we get to the point where it is not just made in El Salvador but it \nis made in a Chinese sweatshop in El Salvador? This has to do with \nvarious trade agreements we have made where we incentivize the \nproduction of these being made in the lowest common denominator \nsweatshop wage area in the world. This Reebok jersey is made in El \nSalvador by a working man who lives in this so-called house. That \nworking man makes less than $1 for an $80 Reebok jersey.\n  I have spoken on the floor of the Senate at great length about \nunderwear--Fruit of the Loom underwear. I have said--and I know it is \nnot chic to do so--I said I understand losing one's shirt, but Fruit of \nthe Loom left the country with all of its underwear. It used to make \nunderwear in America, and people appreciated those jobs. Fruit of the \nLoom left.\n  As we know, Fruit of the Loom was advertising with dancing grapes. \nThey put men and women in fruit uniforms. I do not know where one gets \na grape uniform, but they march them down a road and put it on \ntelevision and they all sing and sound happy--happy for reasons I do \nnot understand because all those Fruit of the Loom jobs, all that \nunderwear is made elsewhere.\n  One might say: Who cares where underwear is made. I suppose the \npeople who made underwear in the United States care because they had \njobs at Fruit of the Loom, but it is gone.\n  I have spoken at great length about Huffy bicycle and shall not speak \nat great length today except to say this. Anyone who purchased a Huffy \nbicycle at Wal-Mart or K Mart was purchasing a bicycle made in Ohio, \nmade by wonderful workers who had a career making Huffy bicycles. They \nmade Huffy bicycles for many decades. They made $11 an hour plus \nbenefits to make these bicycles. Now the bicycles are gone. Now they \nare made in China.\n  This is actually a trifecta. Everything that could have gone wrong \nwent wrong. The company decided to fire American workers and build the \nbicycles in China. Then they declared bankruptcy and left American \nworkers with no pension program so that the pension would have to be \npaid by the taxpayers out of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. \nAnd now China owns the brand. They got the company, the brand, make the \nbicycles, the workers got fired, and the American taxpayer got to pick \nup the pensions. It is unbelievable when you think about it.\n  Is this fair trade? I do not think so. It is a decision by a lot of \npeople to decide we are going to move our manufacturing overseas.\n  Every young child has ridden in a Radio Flyer wagon, a little red \nwagon. They made those for 100 years in Chicago, IL. They do not \nanymore. They are all made in China as well.\n  I know where these are made. I know where Huffy bicycles are made. I \nknow they are made by people who make 50 cents an hour and work 12 to \n14 hours a day, 7 days a week with never a Sunday off. Is that with \nwhat we want the American people to compete--a lower standard of \nliving? Is it probably something we would like to do to help lift \nothers in the world, or is it we want Americans to compete with the \nlowest common denominator, lowest wages, the workplace with the worst \nsafety record? Is that what we want?\n  Those are other issues. The issue I came to talk about is the issue \nof what about the fact the company that makes the little red wagon and \nthe Huffy bicycle and the York mint pattie and, yes, Fig Newton \ncookies--by the way, if you are wondering about Fig Newton cookies, \nthey went to Mexico. They were made in New Jersey. Apparently when you \nmake Fig Newton cookies, there is someone who shovels fig paste. You \ncan get someone shoveling fig paste a lot less expensively by hiring \nthem in Mexico rather than New Jersey. If somebody says, Let's get \nMexican food, just buy Fig Newton cookies. They escaped to Mexico. The \njobs are gone, and somebody down south is shoveling fig paste because \nyou can pay cents on the hour to get that kind of labor.\n  The question is: Does it matter? Does anybody care? Does it matter \nthat we do not produce Fruit of the Loom shorts and t-shirts, that we \ndo not produce little red wagons, Radio Flyer, that we do not produce \nHuffy bicycles, that we do not produce Pennsylvania House furniture, \nthat Whirlpool refrigerators are made in Mexico, that product after \nproduct has gone to China?\n  The fact is, people on this floor in this Congress and in other \nCongresses have voted affirmatively to say: We want to reward those who \nleave our country. We want to give you a tax break. Four separate times \nwe have had votes on these issues, and four separate times the majority \nof the people in the Senate have said: We believe in giving tax breaks \nto those who ship American jobs overseas.\n  The reason I raise this issue today is this: We have about 20 million \npeople who are out of work today. They want to find work. They want a \njob and cannot find one. Everybody talks about restarting this American \neconomy. How about trying to find a sparkplug that will lift the \nAmerican economy? What is that? If you are going to keep the drain \nopen, how are you going to fill the tub? You can work with the faucet \non all day long, but if you have the drain open, Whirlpool decides one \nday, We are moving 1,100 jobs out of this country--and the list goes on \nand on--where are the jobs going to be? Who is going to incentivize the \ncreation of new jobs? We have to do this. It is our responsibility. It \nis not our responsibility to provide economic recovery for the Chinese \neconomy or the Mexican economy. It is our responsibility to try to see \nif we cannot restart this economic engine at home. It seems to me \nimplausible that at least a majority of the Members of the Senate would \nnot understand that we need to stand up for American jobs.\n  I understand, because I have been involved in many trade debates and \nI subsequently wrote a book about it, that when you start talking about \nstanding up for American jobs, there are a bunch of pointy-headed folks \nwith thick glasses who call you a xenophobic isolationist stooge. You \njust don't get it; it is a world economy, Mr. Dorgan; you don't have \nthe foggiest idea what you are talking about. Oh, really?\n  All those people who say that wear dark suits, take showers in the \nmorning, and have never been unemployed. Isn't that a great thing? How \nabout people who require taking a shower after work because they worked \nhard, and find out they lost a job because pointy-headed folks describe \na world economy that reduces all the standards we built up over a \ncentury?\n\n[[Page S7070]]\n\n  Think of the problems we went through to try to create the \ncircumstances that built an expansion of the middle class in this \ncountry. Just think of it. In my book, I describe James Fyler, and I \nprobably should not have. I said he died of lead poisoning. He was shot \n54 times. Why was James Fyler shot in the early part of the last \ncentury 54 times? Why did he give his life?\n  Here is the radical proposition that James Fyler felt: He felt that \npeople who went underground to dig for coal in this country ought to \nhave an understanding that they are working in a workplace that is safe \nand ought to be paid a fair wage. For that he gave his life because \nthat was unbelievably radical: insisting on behalf of workers that they \nwork in a safe workplace and be paid a decent wage.\n\n  We went through all of that and finally said: A safe workplace is \nimportant. We have to protect workers. A fair wage, a minimum wage, is \nimportant--all of these things that we went through to lift up America \nand expand opportunity and put people to work. We have been through \nthat and at great struggle, at really great struggle.\n  Yet now in the last decade and a half, the question is: Isn't that \nall old-fashioned? It is a world economy. Why can you not compete with \na Chinese sweatshop in El Salvador making Reebok football jerseys? Why \ncan you not compete with a worker in Shenzhen, China, willing to work \nfor 50 cents an hour, working 7 days a week, 12-to-14-hour days? I say \nto you, the people at Huffy bicycle would have said: We cannot compete \nwith that. We cannot live on those wages. And the people who employed \nthem said: We don't care. Your jobs are gone.\n  The last day of work at Huffy bicycle in Ohio, when they were all \nfired and all those jobs moved to China to make those bicycles, those \nworkers left in the space where their cars parked at the plant, in the \nempty space they left a pair of shoes. That parking lot was filled with \nempty shoes, not cars. It was a plaintive way for those workers to say \nto those companies that fired them: You can fire us and get rid of our \njobs but you will never replace us. You will never replace us.\n  It seems to me if people in this country are wondering about where \nwill the jobs come from, who is going to stand up for the economic \ninterests of this country--no, not cut us off from the rest of the \nworld, not suggest we are not part of the global economy, but rather \nsuggest we will attempt to lift the rest of the world by saying: Here \nare the conditions under which we will involve ourselves in the global \neconomy.\n  We are a country with a huge trade deficit with the country of China. \nThis year I suspect it will be between a $200 billion and $250 billion \ntrade deficit with the country of China. Our trade deficit this year \ngenerally will probably be around $600 billion, perhaps a little less. \nLast month it was a $50 billion trade deficit. No country can continue \nwith this. It is not sustainable. You cannot sustain a country by \nhollowing out the manufacturing base and deciding manufacturing does \nnot matter, yet we want to remain a world economic power. You cannot \nsustain a country that says we are going to do $50 billion a month in \ntrade deficits and that doesn't matter either. A trade deficit \nultimately is going to be repaid with a lower standard of living in \nthis country.\n  We have a responsibility, and that responsibility now is to find a \nway to begin stopping the hemorrhaging of jobs overseas and decide to \nreward those companies that decide they are going to keep jobs in this \ncountry.\n  I just read this today about HMC manufacturers and Robert Smith III, \nthe company's president and chief executive. Good for him. He said: We \nwouldn't consider moving our jobs overseas, not in a hundred years. \n``Outshoring jobs in search of higher profits is a mistake,'' he said, \n``because it ignores our manufacturing's larger purpose in America.'' \nGood for him.\n  How about doing something in this Chamber that says to people who are \nemploying the manufacturing workers: Good for you. We stand with you. \nWe want to incentivize you to continue, and then say to those who are \nshipping their jobs overseas: You know what, you want some help from \nthis government? Go take a hike. Make something in America. And, by the \nway, you are not going to get tax help. We are not going to give you a \ntax break, as has been done for far too long when you ship your jobs \noverseas. It is not going to happen.\n  Unfortunately, it has been happening. I said it is not going to \nhappen four times. We have had four votes, and I have lost on all four \noccasions. I hope at long last when we go through the deepest recession \nsince the Great Depression, there might be enough of an urgency for \npeople who come out here and bloviate and thumb their suspenders, cast \nthe shine of their shoes on the magnificence of this great place that \nmaybe that magnificence might spread to casting the right vote on \nsomething that stands up for this country's best economic interest.\n  Mr. President, the list of challenges are very significant. I have \nbeen talking at length about one, and that is jobs because it makes \neverything else possible. If we can get the American engine working \nonce again, put people to work once again, this country will do just \nfine. But it doesn't do just fine when it is in a very deep recession \nand we have incentives that say jobs don't matter.\n  I grew up in a very small town, less than 300 people, and I knew \nevery day that I was a kid--just because I understood it--that this \ncountry, this America, was the biggest, the best, the strongest, and \nthat we could beat anybody in trade or economic issues with one hand \ntied behind our backs. That is how good this country was. We were good \nat almost everything. We invented, we created, you name it. We decided \nto split the atom. We spliced genes. We invented radar, the silicon \nchip, the telephone, the computer, the television. We cured smallpox \nand polio. We built airplanes and learned to fly them. Hundreds of \nattempts were made, and finally on December 3, 1917, they flew an \nairplane--the Wright brothers. Then we built rockets and walked on the \nMoon and planted an American flag. Nobody has done that, but we have \ndone it. This is a great country.\n  Yet somehow, in the shadow of this very deep recession--that, in my \njudgment, was not some natural thing to have happened to our country. \nThis was something that was caused by unbelievable avarice and greed \nand things that went on particularly in the largest financial firms in \nthis country that had nothing to do with investment, that had nothing \nto do with savings or real banking but had everything to do with \nbuilding a casino society so people could buy what they wouldn't get \nfrom people who never had it. They were all making money, but it was a \nhouse of cards.\n  I offered an amendment on something called naked credit default \nswaps. You know what. It sounds like a foreign language. Nobody even \nknew what a credit default swap was. We had tens of trillions of \ndollars of credit default swaps, and a fair amount of them were naked. \nWhat does that mean? It doesn't mean they didn't have clothes. It meant \nthere was no insurable interest on either side. It was simply a wager, \nsimply a bet, not on investment. I lost that amendment.\n  I probably should talk about something I won. But the fact is, on the \nbig issues in this country, in most cases the big interests are well \norganized to make certain their interests carry the day in the \nCongress. It just seems to me that as we tackle these issues of jobs \nand Federal budget deficits, which is a very significant issue, and the \nissue of taxes--who pays them and how much--energy policy--how we \nremove our addiction to foreign oil--the trade issues I have just \ndescribed in great detail, we have to do better. The American people \ndeserve better and expect better. Instead of getting the worst of what \nboth parties offer, we need to get the best of what each has. Both \nparties can contribute something significant to our country, in my \njudgment.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot, it seems to me, at stake. We can \ncontinue to see anemic economic growth--and as I say that, let me point \nout this President inherited a circumstance where just prior to his \ncoming to office we were losing 700,000 jobs a month. That is what he \ninherited. I know some people come and say: Well, how dare you talk \nabout the economy this President inherited. What else would you talk \nabout? Would you create a fiction about it?\n\n[[Page S7071]]\n\n  This economy was nearly in a free fall and, like it or not, this \nPresident took action. Like it or not, this President made proposals \nthat began to put some capability under this economy to avoid a total \ncollapse.\n  Now the economy is growing, but slowly, and too slowly. The President \nknows that and says that. This growth is good. We didn't suffer a \ncomplete collapse. We caught it. This President's policies have worked. \nThose, by the way, who come to the floor of the Senate and say the \neconomic recovery act didn't create any jobs know better than that. \nLook at the studies that have been done: 3 million jobs at least have \nbeen saved as a result of taking the action that had to be taken. Would \nthey suggest we sit and watch and be simple observers?\n  Now we come to this discussion about the economy and we are deep in \ndebt and we have to get out of this. So the question is tax cuts. Who \ngets tax cuts? Well, 9 years ago, on the floor of this Senate, \nPresident George W. Bush said: Let's provide very substantial tax cuts. \nThe bulk of them will go to the wealthy, but nonetheless everyone will \nget a tax cut. Why? Because for the first time in 30 years we had a \nbudget surplus that year under President Clinton. The first time in 30 \nyears we had a budget surplus.\n  So President Bush came to office and said: Well, it looks like we are \ngoing to have budget surpluses for the next 10 years, so let's provide \nvery large tax cuts.\n  I voted against them. I said: You are talking about projections. We \ndon't have the tax surpluses yet. When we get them, let's figure out \nwhat we do with them, but they do not exist yet. They are simply \nprojections. President Bush said: Well, Katey, bar the door. He and Mr. \nGreenspan and others said we need to do this. Mr. Greenspan said he \ncouldn't even sleep he was so worried that we were going to have such \nbig surpluses that it would ruin the economy and we would pay down the \ndebt too fast. I hope he didn't lose a lot of sleep over that.\n  So the Congress passed, without my vote, very large tax cuts for 9 \nyears after which they would expire. So they expire at the end of this \nyear. Now the question is, What do we do with them? The debate is, \nShould they be extended?\n  The President says let's extend them for the middle class. We are \nstill in the middle of slow economic progress, so let's extend them for \nthe middle class. The Republicans and others say: Well, let's make sure \nwe extend them for everybody, including the wealthy.\n  Well, it just seems to me this: We decided--without my vote--to \nprovide very large tax cuts because we needed to give back a surplus \nwhich then didn't exist in the subsequent years. A surplus didn't \nexist. Then what happened? Within a couple of months after passing the \ntax cuts 9 years ago, we discovered we were in a recession. Not a deep \none, but a recession. That, of course, enhanced instead of surpluses \nFederal budget deficits.\n  Then what happened? We were hit on 9/11 with a terrorist attack and \nwe went to war in Afghanistan and then we went to war in Iraq and not a \npenny of it was ever paid. In spite of the fact I and others came to \nthe floor of the Senate and said: If you are going to ask our young men \nand women to go to war and to get up in the morning and strap on \nceramic body armor, to be in harm's way and potentially lose their \nlives, the very least we can do in this Chamber is pay for the cost of \nthe war. But, no, we couldn't do that. We have fought a war for 9 years \nand haven't paid for one penny of it. That is fundamentally \nirresponsible.\n  Now, the question is, In the middle of a very serious economic \nsituation, who is going to get the tax cuts extended? Some say: Well, \nyou have to extend them for the upper income folks, the wealthiest \nAmericans, because their philosophy is that things trickle down. Put \nthings in the top and ultimately they trickle down. Others, my \nphilosophy, is things percolate up. Give the American family a little \nsomething to work with and get the engine working again and things will \npercolate up to help everybody.\n  I do think this: The tax rates that were paid by the upper income \npeople in the 1990s, when we had the most robust economic growth in our \ncountry, are tax rates that I think should continue to exist for upper \nincome people. I think that is fair. Plus, that $800 billion that it \nwould cost for the next 10 years to do those tax cuts for upper income \nAmericans will be added right to the Federal budget deficit, and that \ndoesn't make any sense to me at all. How would that give confidence to \nthe American people; that at last--at long, long last--this Senate, \nthis Congress was willing to tackle these destructive budget deficits? \nThat is not much consolation to people who watch what is happening in \nthis country.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me finish by saying I have talked about a \nnumber of things, and things we need to correct. I remain hopeful about \nthis country's future. I know we have a chattering class that spends \nall day and all night on the radio dial and television talking about \nwhat is wrong with America. I know there are plenty of challenges ahead \nof us. But I also believe there are a lot of people who, for two \ncenturies, have bet against this country's future and lost. I think it \nwould take a fool to decide this country would not get through this \nperiod.\n\n  But this country deserves good leadership from Republicans and \nDemocrats. It deserves a President who is aggressive, and I believe \nthis President is aggressive, in tackling these problems. It deserves a \nCongress that is willing to work together. If ever we needed an \noutbreak of some minimum amount of bipartisanship, some minimum \ncooperation, it is now. I have just watched all of this year \ncircumstances where every single thing is objected to, everything is \nblocked. It doesn't take much in this Chamber. The two most powerful \nwords are ``I object.'' One person saying ``I object'' grinds this \nmachinery to a halt.\n  The fact is, I have seen circumstances in this Chamber this year \nwhere objections were raised and filibusters ensued on motions to \nproceed to noncontroversial items that ultimately got 96 or 98 votes, \nbut it took a week to get through because of blocking and objections. I \nmean, if someone would have brought up a Mother's Day resolution, it \nwould have been filibustered, I assume. Block everything, stop \neverything, make sure nothing gets done. That is not in the interest of \nthis country. This country deserves better and expects more.\n  I hope in the coming several weeks--we don't have a lot of time--the \nthings I have just described, the issue of jobs moving overseas, the \nissue of an unbelievably ignorant tax provision that says if you get \nrid of your American workers, you lock your factory doors and ship \nthose jobs overseas, tell you what we will do. We will give you a big \nold fat tax break. I hope finally, at last, at long, long last, enough \nMembers of this Senate will agree that has to stop; that we would pass \nlegislation to shut it down and at the same time say to those who are \nmoving their jobs overseas: You are off the public dole. But you know \nwhat. We are going to stand up for those who keep their jobs here. We \nare going to say: If you are running a manufacturing plant in this \ncountry, good for you. We want to do the things that help you continue, \nthat help you hire people and help you be a good employer. Good for \nyou. You are the ones we stand up for because you are the ones who will \nrebuild opportunity in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue that is \ntimely and controversial; it is the issue of immigration. There has \nbeen a heated debate for over a year about the immigration law passed \nby the State of Arizona. This debate highlighted the need for Congress \nto fix our broken immigration system.\n  Here is how the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police put it:\n\n       We strongly urge the U.S. Congress to immediately initiate \n     the necessary steps to\n\n[[Page S7072]]\n\n     begin the process of comprehensively addressing the \n     immigration issue to provide solutions that are fair, logical \n     and equitable.\n\n  I agree with the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police. Congress \nhas an obligation to the American people to fix our broken immigration \nsystem. This broken system harms our national security, it hurts our \nworkers, and it falls short of the most basic standards of justice.\n  First, we must secure our borders, strengthen enforcement of our \nimmigration laws, and address the situation of approximately 11 million \nundocumented immigrants who live and work in our country. \nUnfortunately, the reality is that Congress is not likely to consider \ncomprehensive immigration reform this year. I have supported every \neffort toward that end during the time I have served in the Senate.\n  I recall not that long ago, just a few years ago, an amazing, \nbipartisan group of Senators which included, at that time, the two men \nwho just ran for President of the United States, Senator McCain and \nthen-Senator Barack Obama. It was an incredible effort, and it had the \ninvested political capital of President George W. Bush, who was \ngenuinely committed to immigration reform. I can recall the President \nsaying in meetings and saying to me personally how much he wanted to \nsee that done. I still salute him for his leadership on what was a \ntough issue then and still is.\n  The reality is that we did not pass comprehensive immigration reform \ndespite our best efforts. But that should not prevent us from moving \nforward with reforms so our broken immigration system is repaired and \nis improved over what we currently have.\n  Let's take one example. In recent years, we have made dramatic \nprogress in securing the border and reducing illegal immigration. The \nnumber of Border Patrol agents serving our country and protecting our \nborders has doubled from 10,000 in 2004 to 20,000 today. According to \nthe Department of Homeland Security: ``Today the Border Patrol in \nAmerica is better staffed than any time in its 86-year history.''\n  The Department of Homeland Security has completed 646 miles of border \nfencing out of the 652 miles authorized by Congress. The remaining 6 \nmiles will be completed before the end of the year. In the first 9 \nmonths of fiscal year 2010, the Department of Homeland Security has \ndeported approximately 280,000 illegal immigrants. That is a 10-percent \nincrease in the number of deportations over the same period in fiscal \nyear 2008, which was the last year of the Bush administration.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has focused on deporting illegal \nimmigrants who have committed crimes. As a result, more than 136,000 \ncriminal aliens have been deported so far in this fiscal year. That is \na 60-percent increase over the number of criminal aliens deported \nduring the same period in fiscal year 2008, and it is the most criminal \naliens ever deported during a single year.\n  What is the result of all these efforts? Earlier this month, the Pew \nHispanic Center released a new report on illegal immigration with two \nstriking findings. First, the number of illegal immigrants entering the \nUnited States annually has decreased by two-thirds in the past decade, \nfrom 850,000 per year to 300,000 per year.\n  Second, the total number of illegal immigrants living in the United \nStates is down by 8 percent in just the last 2 years. The Pew Center \nsaid: ``The decrease represents the first significant reversal in the \ngrowth of the illegal immigrant population in America in 20 years.''\n  Let me repeat that. The number of illegal immigrants entering our \ncountry has decreased by two-thirds, and for the first time in 20 years \nthere has been a significant decline in the number of illegal \nimmigrants living in America. So we are making remarkable progress in \nour fight against illegal immigration.\n  Our efforts will not end there. Last month, Congress passed the 2010 \nemergency border security supplemental appropriations bill, legislation \nauthored by my colleague from New York and the chairman of the \nImmigration Subcommittee, Senator Schumer, cosponsored by Senators \nMcCain and Kyl of Arizona. That bill provided $600 million more \nadditional funding to enhance border security.\n  Let me tell you how we will spend it: $176 million for 1,000 more \nadditional Border Patrol agents, $68 million for 520 Customs and Border \nProtection officers, $80 million for 250 new Immigration and Customs \nenforcement personnel, and $32 million for 2 unmanned aerial vehicles \nto monitor the border.\n  We have taken this challenge seriously. We are investing the \nresources on a bipartisan basis, and we can see the results. When I sat \ndown with Senator Jon Kyl, my Republican counterpart, and talked about \nthis issue, he showed me a map of Arizona, and he pointed to a section \nof the border which has had a dramatically positive change when it \ncomes to illegal immigration. He then pointed to another section which \nhe said needed improvement. But he conceded, and most do, that we have \nmade a commitment. We have dedicated the resources, and the Obama \nadministration has joined with Republicans in Congress to produce real \nresults when it comes to illegal immigration.\n  We are making great progress in securing the border and reducing \nillegal immigration, but let's be clear. Border security alone will not \nfix our broken immigration system. There are other critical reforms we \ncan make right now. One important step Congress should immediately take \nup is passing the DREAM Act. This is bipartisan legislation I have \nintroduced with Republican Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana.\n  Let me say a word of thanks to Senator Lugar for stepping out on this \nimportant issue and joining me in this effort. The DREAM Act is a bill \nwhich I introduced 10 years ago. If you have been around the Senate, \nthat is considered a brief period of time. But I cannot imagine I am \nstanding here 10 years later still arguing for this bill. I think it is \nworth recounting how I happened to introduce it.\n  About 85 percent of all of the case work, constituent work we receive \nin our Chicago office relates to immigration. Chicago is a great city, \na diverse city, with people from all over the world. It is no surprise \nmany of them come to our office with immigration issues. So 10 years \nago we received a phone call. It was from a Korean-American lady, a \nsingle mom who ran a dry cleaners.\n  As I have mentioned in previous debates, in our great city of \nChicago, about 85 percent of the dry cleaners are owned by Koreans. It \nis one of their commitments in entrepreneurial skill, and they work \nhard, with long days.\n  Well, she called to tell me about her little girl who was now \ngraduating high school. It turns out, her little girl was an amazing \npianist, an amazing musician, and had been accepted by the highly \nacclaimed Juilliard School of Music in New York. Her mom was so \nexcited. But as her daughter filled out the application form to go to \nJuilliard, there was a little box there that said ``nationality,'' and \nshe turned to her mom and said: I know I was born in Korea, but what am \nI?\n  Her mom said: I don't know. We brought you here at the age of 2, but \nwe never filed any papers. We better call Durbin. So they called our \noffice, and we checked into it. We learned, through the Immigration \nService, that she had an option. They said it was her only option, and \nit was very clear.\n  We said: What is it?\n  They said: She can go back to Korea--back to Korea, to a place where \nshe did not speak the language, where she had no memory of ever living, \na place she had not even visited in 16 or 17 years.\n  This woman also married in the United States and had other children \nwho were American citizens, but this one daughter, brought over on a \nplane from Seoul, Korea, was living in Chicago, thinking everything was \njust fine and normal, and now, at the age of 18 or 19, learned she was \nabout to be deported to a place where she did not even speak the \nlanguage.\n  It seemed to me fundamentally unfair. If you arrest someone for \nspeeding and they have an infant in the car seat behind them, you do \nnot charge the infant with speeding, do you? It would not make sense. \nThere is no blame there, no liability, no culpability. So why in this \ncase, if this mother came to the country and did not file the papers, \nwould this girl, this young woman, be denied an opportunity to become \nlegal in the United States?\n  So I wrote a bill called the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act says basically\n\n[[Page S7073]]\n\nthis: If you came to the United States under the age of 16, if you have \nlived in this country for at least 5 years, if you have no criminal \nrecord, if you graduate from high school, we will give you two chances \nto become legal in our system. The first opportunity: We will allow you \nto serve in our Armed Forces. If you will enlist for 2 years of Active \nDuty, we will allow you to become legal in the United States. If you \nare willing to risk your life for our Nation, we are prepared to give \nyou legal status. Secondly, if you complete 2 years of college, we will \nalso give you that same option.\n  That is it. That is the DREAM Act. It gives to these young people who \nhave no country and literally no future because they have no \ncitizenship, an opportunity.\n  Well, that is what I introduced 10 years ago. I still think it is \nvalid. The DREAM Act will give a select group of immigrant students the \nchance to earn legal status if they grew up in the United States, have \ngood moral character, attend college, or enlist in our military.\n  Today, in America, there are tens of thousands of immigrant students \nwho were brought to the United States when they were too young to \nunderstand the consequences of their parents' decisions. It was not \ntheir decision to come to this country. They came along for the ride, \nand many of them were infants. They grew up here. They became part of \nour country. It is the only home they have ever known, and now they are \nwithout a country.\n  These young people are the presidents of student councils, \nvaledictorians, junior ROTC leaders, and star athletes. They are \ntomorrow's scientists, doctors, teachers, engineers, and soldiers. They \nwill be our leaders.\n  The fundamental premise of the DREAM Act is that we should not punish \nthe children for the decisions of their parents. It is not the American \nway. Instead, the DREAM Act says to these students: We will give you a \nchance, a chance to prove yourself, and a chance to improve America.\n  Here is how former Republican Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee \nexplained it. Mike, as you know, was a former Governor of the State of \nArkansas. Here is what he said:\n\n       A kid comes to this country, and he's four years old and he \n     had no choice in it--his parents came illegally. . . .That \n     kid is in our school from kindergarten through the 12th \n     grade. He graduates as valedictorian because he's a smart \n     kid.\n\n  Governor Huckabee said:\n\n       The question is: Is he better off going to college and \n     becoming a neurosurgeon or a banker or whatever he might \n     become, and becoming a taxpayer, and in the process having to \n     apply for and achieve citizenship, or should we make him pick \n     tomatoes? I think it's better if he goes to college and \n     becomes a citizen.\n\n  That is what Governor Huckabee said.\n  The DREAM Act has broad bipartisan support. The last time the Senate \nconsidered it on the Senate floor a few years back, it received 52 \nvotes, including 11 Republicans. Since then, support for the DREAM Act \nhas grown. The bill now has 40 cosponsors, and the DREAM Act is the \nonly immigration bill--the only one--this President, his \nadministration, has endorsed.\n  The DREAM Act is also supported by a broad coalition of education, \nbusiness, labor, civil rights, and religious leaders, including, just \nto name a few, the American Jewish Committee, the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights, the National PTA, the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies such as Microsoft and \nPfizer, the AFL-CIO, and dozens upon dozens of colleges and \nuniversities across the country, including Arizona State, Penn State, \nthe University of Utah, and the University of Florida.\n  It also has broad support from the American people. According to a \nrecent poll by Opinion Research Corporation, 70 percent of likely \nvoters favor the DREAM Act, including 60 percent of Republicans.\n  The DREAM Act is not just the right thing to do, it would be good for \nAmerica. Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, knows something \nabout economic development. He sent me a letter supporting the DREAM \nAct, and here is what he said:\n\n       Why shouldn't our economy benefit from the skills these \n     young people have obtained here? It is senseless for us to \n     chase out the home-grown talent that has the potential to \n     contribute so significantly to our society. They're the ones \n     who are going to start companies, invest in new technologies, \n     pioneer medical advances.\n\n  Our country would also benefit from thousands of highly qualified, \nwell-educated young people who are eager to serve in the Armed Forces \nduring a time of war. Since the Bush administration, we have worked \nclosely with the Defense Department on the DREAM Act. Defense \nDepartment officials have said the DREAM Act is ``very appealing'' \nbecause it would apply to the ``cream of the crop'' of students and be \n``good for military readiness.''\n  Military experts agree. LTC Margaret Stock, a professor at the U.S. \nMilitary Academy at West Point, wrote an article supporting the DREAM \nAct. She concluded:\n\n       Passage of the DREAM Act would be highly beneficial to the \n     United States military. The DREAM Act promises to enlarge \n     dramatically the pool of highly qualified recruits for the \n     U.S. Armed Forces.\n\n  The Army says high school graduation is ``the best single predictor'' \nof success in the military. However, in recent years, the Army has \naccepted more applicants who are high school dropouts, have low scores \non the military's aptitude test, and some who have had criminal \nbackgrounds. In contrast, under the DREAM Act, all recruits would be \nwell qualified high school graduates with no criminal record and good \nmoral character.\n  Many DREAM Act students come from a demographic group that is already \npredisposed toward military service. The RAND Corporation found that \n``Hispanic youth are more likely than other groups to express a \npositive attitude toward the military'' and ``Hispanics consistently \nhave higher retention and faster promotion speeds than their white \ncounterparts.''\n  Immigrants have an outstanding tradition in America's military. More \nthan 65,000 immigrants are currently on Active Duty in the United \nStates. The Center for Naval Analyses has concluded ``non-citizens have \nhigh rates of success while serving--they are far more likely, for \nexample, to fulfill their enlistment obligations than their U.S.-born \ncounterparts.''\n  The DREAM Act is not a free pass to citizenship. It is designed to \nassist only a select group of young people who would be required to \nearn their way to legal status. Here is how it works. A student would \nhave the chance to qualify only if he or she meets these requirements: \ncame to the United States as a child, has lived here for more than 5 \nyears, has good moral character, has not engaged in criminal activity, \ndoes not pose any threat to national security, passes a thorough \nbackground check, and graduates from an American high school.\n  If a student fulfills each and every one of these requirements, they \ncan receive temporary legal status. Next, they can serve in the \nmilitary or attend college for at least 2 years.\n  Then, after 6 years, if--and only if--this requirement is completed, \nthe student could apply for permanent legal status. If this requirement \nis not completed, the student would lose his legal status and be \nsubject to deportation.\n  These requirements are fair, but they are tough. Only a select group \nof students would be able to earn legal status under the DREAM Act. In \nfact, according to a recent study by the Migration Policy Institute, \nonly 38 percent of those who are potentially eligible for the DREAM Act \nwould ultimately obtain legal status.\n  The DREAM Act also includes other important restrictions to ensure it \nis not abused. I will mention a few: Students who obtain conditional \nlegal status under the DREAM Act would not be eligible for Pell grants. \nOf course, that is up to $5,000 or more each year to go to college. \nResidents of the United States, American citizens, who qualify can \nreceive that help. These students, in the process of going to college, \ncould not receive them. Students who apply for the DREAM Act would be \nsubject to tough criminal penalties for fraud. The DREAM Act would not \nallow what is known as ``chain migration.'' In fact, DREAM Act students \nwould have very limited ability to sponsor their family members for \nlegal status.\n  I first introduced this bill 10 years ago. Since that time, I have \nmet a lot of young people who would at least be eligible to be \nconsidered for this legislation. They have been waiting a long time for \nthis opportunity. Every\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\nweek--every week without fail--when I go back home, I meet young \nstudents, receive calls, e-mails, and letters. I want to mention just a \nfew of them here. I want to put a face on this issue so you can \nunderstand the lives that would be affected.\n  Here is the first one, as shown in this photograph I have in the \nChamber. This is Benita Veliz. She was brought to the United States by \nher parents in 1993, when Benita was 8 years old. She graduated as the \nvaledictorian of her high school class at the age of 16. She received a \nfull scholarship to St. Mary's University. She graduated from the \nhonor's program with a double major in biology and sociology. Benita's \nhonors thesis was on the DREAM Act. She sent me a letter, and here is \nwhat she said:\n\n       I can't wait to be able to give back to the community that \n     has given me so much. I was recently asked to sing the \n     National Anthem for both the U.S. and Mexico at a Cinco de \n     Mayo community assembly. Without missing a beat, I quickly \n     belted out The Star-Spangled Banner. I then realized that I \n     had no idea how to sing the Mexican national anthem.\n\n  She writes:\n\n       I am American. My dream is American. It's time to make our \n     dreams a reality. It's time to pass the DREAM Act.\n\n  This is Minchul Suk. Minchul was brought to the United States from \nSouth Korea by his parents in 1991 at the age of 9. Minchul graduated \nfrom high school with a 4.2 GPA. He graduated from UCLA with a degree \nin microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics. With support from \nthe Korean-American community, Minchul was able to graduate from dental \nschool. He has passed the national boards and licensing exam to become \na dentist, but he can't obtain a license because he does not have legal \nstatus. Minchul is a person without a country. He sent me a letter \nrecently, and here is what he wrote:\n\n       After spending the majority of my life here, with all my \n     friends and family here, I could not simply pack my things \n     and go to a country I barely remember. I am willing to accept \n     whatever punishment is deemed fitting for that crime; let me \n     just stay and pay for it. . . . I am begging for a chance to \n     prove to everyone that I am not a waste of a human being, \n     that I am not a criminal set on leeching off taxpayers' \n     money. Please give me the chance to serve my community as a \n     dentist.\n\n  Without the DREAM Act, Minchul won't be able to serve his community \nas a dentist.\n  This is my Mayra Garcia. Mayra was brought to the United States by \nher parents when she was 2 years old. Mayra, who is now 18, is the \npresident of Cottonwood Youth Advisory Commission in her hometown of \nCottonwood, AZ. She is a member of the National Honor Society. She \ngraduated from high school last spring with a 3.98 GPA. Mayra just \nstarted her freshman year at a prestigious university in California. In \nan essay about the DREAM Act, Mayra wrote:\n\n       From the time I was capable of understanding its \n     significance, my dream was to be the first college graduate \n     in my immediate and extended family. . . . College means more \n     to me than just a 4-year degree. It means the breaking of a \n     family cycle. It means progression and fulfillment of an \n     obligation.\n\n  Here is what she told me about growing up in the United States:\n\n       According to my mother, I cried every day in preschool \n     because of the language barrier. By kindergarten, though, I \n     was fluent in English. . . . English became my way of \n     understanding the world and myself.\n\n  Mayra Garcia, like all DREAM Act students, grew up in this country. \nAmerica is her home. English is her language. As one of these students \nonce said to me, ``I dream in English.''\n  The next person I wish my colleagues to meet is Cesar Vargas. Cesar \nwas brought to the United States when he was 5 years old. He is \ncurrently a student at the City University of New York School of Law, \nwhere he has a 3.8 GPA. Cesar founded the Prosecutor Law Students \nAssociation. His dream is to serve our country as a military lawyer, \nbut without the DREAM Act, Cesar cannot even volunteer to enlist in the \nmilitary, despite the fact that he is in law school.\n  The last person's story I wish to share is Eric Balderas. This is an \namazing story. Eric's mother brought him to the United States from \nMexico in 1994 when he was 4 years old. Eric was valedictorian and \nstudent council president at his high school in San Antonio, TX. Eric \njust began his sophomore year at Harvard University, where he is \nmajoring in molecular and cellular biology. His goal in life is to \nbecome a cancer researcher, but he can't reach that goal because he has \nno country. He has no citizenship. He needs the DREAM Act.\n  Wouldn't America be a stronger country if someone such as Eric \nBalderas could become a cancer researcher? Wouldn't our military be a \nbetter place with Cesar Vargas, who wants nothing more than to serve as \na lawyer in the Judge Advocate General's Corps? Wouldn't we be better \noff if these talented young immigrants were able to contribute more \nfully to this country they love? The DREAM Act would give immigrants \nsuch as Eric Balderas and Cesar Vargas a chance to earn their way to \nlegal status--earn their way to legal status--by contributing their \ntalents to America. This is the choice the DREAM Act presents to us. We \ncan allow a generation of immigrant students with great potential and \nambitions to contribute more fully to our society and our national \nsecurity or we can relegate them to a future in the shadows, which \nwould be a loss for us all.\n  I am going to conclude. I see my colleague waiting patiently over \nthere. I wish to conclude by saying this: I stand here today as a \nSenator from the great State of Illinois. I feel blessed in so many \nways to have been given this opportunity to serve, but I also feel \nblessed because my mother was an immigrant to this country. She was \nbrought by her mother at the age of 2 in 1911. As they came down the \ngangplank off the boat in Baltimore, my grandmother had my mom in her \narms and my aunt and uncle by her side. Somehow, they made it from \nBaltimore, MD, to East Saint Louis, IL, to join my grandfather, who was \nan immigrant and who worked in the most basic immigrant jobs. My \ngrandmother and grandfather never spoke much English--just enough to \nget by. My mom spoke Lithuanian and English, and I speak English only. \nIt is kind of the story of America, I guess.\n  My mom didn't become a naturalized citizen until after she was \nmarried and had my two older brothers. I went to her later in her life, \njust a few months before she passed away, and said: Mom, I have never \nseen your naturalization certificate. Do you still have it?\n  She said: Sure.\n  She got up.\n  I said: No, you don't have to.\n  She said: No, I am going to go get it.\n  So she went in the other room, wasn't gone a minute, and came back \nwith the naturalization certificate. Then a little piece of paper \nfloated to the floor. I picked it up and I said: What is this?\n  She said: That is the receipt for the $2.50 filing fee that I paid \nwhen I became a naturalized citizen back in the 1930s.\n  My mom was tighter than the bark on a tree, and she was going to have \nproof if any government bureaucrat ever came around to challenge her if \nshe ever paid her fee. She was also a proud American and proud of her \nthree sons and family, and I am glad she got to see me sworn in to the \nU.S. Senate before she passed away.\n  I stand here today as a Senator in this great body and the proud son \nof an immigrant mother. If my mother and grandmother had entered this \ncountry illegally and my mother had been somehow denied an opportunity \nfor citizenship, I don't know where I would be today. But I have tried \nto make a contribution to this country, and that is all these young \npeople are asking for--a chance to make a contribution to this country.\n  Let's not get caught up in the emotional and angry rhetoric about \nimmigrants and immigration, but let's give these young people a chance. \nLet's try to gather on a bipartisan basis to put enough votes on the \nboard to give them a chance to serve our country in the military or to \nserve our Nation with their great talents. That is their dream, it \nshould be our dream, and that is why we should pass the DREAM Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as the Senate \nreturns to give a doctor's second opinion of the health care law. As \nthe Presiding Officer knows because he has\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\nbeen here for so many of these speeches every week since this bill was \nsigned into law, I have come to the Senate floor as a physician, an \northopedic surgeon, as someone who has taken care of families in the \nState of Wyoming since 1983, to give a doctor's second opinion of the \nnew health care law and what I view is the impact it is going to have \non health care in this country.\n  The Presiding Officer knows that during the debate and discussions at \nthe time of the health bill and now the health care law, I had many \nreservations. My concern was that it was going to be bad for patients, \nbad for providers--the nurses and doctors who take care of those \npatients--and bad for payers, the people paying their health care \ncosts, as well as the taxpayers of this country.\n  When the health care bill was signed into law, Democrats were \nextremely proud of it, and they were actually eager at that time to \ntell all of America about their vote. As a matter of fact, the Senate \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, said:\n\n       This is a happy day. We are going to hear an earful, but it \n     is going to be an earful of wonderment and happiness that \n     people waited for a long time.\n\n  Here we are just 6 months later, but the new law is not greeted with \nhappiness. It is not greeted with wonderment. Now the Democrats of this \ncountry are singing a very different tune. In fact, 56 percent of \nAmericans want the law repealed. Each week, as I have given my second \nopinion, I have said it is time to repeal and replace this health care \nlaw. Now Democrats are completely changing their message about the new \nlaw. Now they no longer say the law will lower costs. They no longer \nsay it will improve care. Instead, they now admit the law has some \nshortfalls, and they are talking about how they are working to improve \nit. This law needs to be repealed and replaced.\n  I think that now the people of America know what Nancy Pelosi meant \nwhen she said, ``First we have to pass the law before you get to find \nout what is in it.'' That is what she said. Well, now the people of \nthis country have found out what is in it, and they recognize that it \nis not good for the country.\n  There was an interesting article in the Wall Street Journal last \nFriday. Kimberly Strassel talked about the health care law, and she \nsaid:\n\n       A total of 279 House and Senate Democrats voted for \n     ObamaCare. Now not one is running an ad touting that vote. \n     How can they, given the headlines?\n\n  But she does quote a number of Democrats who are running for election \nthis year, and those Democrats are talking about why they voted \nagainst--against--the bill that the President claimed would be good for \nthe country. These are Democrats voting against what they call \n``massive government health care.'' That was one Member of the House. \nAnother said she voted against the ``trillion-dollar health care \nplan.'' A former Governor of Georgia, a Democrat, said:\n\n       Not only is ObamaCare ``financially devastating,'' it is \n     ``the greatest failure, modern failure, of political \n     leadership in my lifetime.''\n\n  While Congress was out of session in August, Politico ran a story \nentitled ``Dems Retreat on Health Care Cost Pitch.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent to have that article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From POLITICO, Aug. 19, 2010]\n\n                 DEMs Retreat on Health Care Cost Pitch\n\n                             (By Ben Smith)\n\n       Key White House allies are dramatically shifting their \n     attempts to defend health care legislation, abandoning claims \n     that it will reduce costs and the deficit and instead \n     stressing a promise to ``improve it.''\n       The messaging shift was circulated this afternoon on a \n     conference call and PowerPoint presentation organized by \n     FamiliesUSA--one of the central groups in the push for the \n     initial legislation. The call was led by a staffer for the \n     Herndon Alliance, which includes leading labor groups and \n     other health care allies. It was based on polling from three \n     top Democratic pollsters, John Anzalone, Celinda Lake and \n     Stan Greenberg.\n       The confidential presentation, available in full here and \n     provided to POLITICO by a source on the call, suggests that \n     Democrats are acknowledging the failure of their predictions \n     that the health care legislation would grow more popular \n     after its passage, as its benefits became clear and rhetoric \n     cooled. Instead, the presentation is designed to win over a \n     skeptical public and to defend the legislation--in \n     particular, the individual mandate--from a push for repeal.\n       The presentation concedes that groups typically supportive \n     of Democratic causes--people under 40, non-college-educated \n     women and Hispanic voters--have not been won over by the \n     plan. Indeed, it stresses repeatedly, many are unaware that \n     the legislation has passed, an astonishing shortcoming in the \n     White House's all-out communications effort.\n       ``Straightforward `policy' defenses fail to [move] voters' \n     opinions about the law,'' says one slide. ``Women in \n     particular are concerned that health care law will mean less \n     provider availability--scarcity an issue.''\n       The presentation also concedes that the fiscal and economic \n     arguments that were the White House's first and most \n     aggressive sales pitch have essentially failed.\n       ``Many don't believe health care reform will help the \n     economy,'' says one slide.\n       The presentation's final page of ``Don'ts'' counsels \n     against claiming ``the law will reduce costs and [the] \n     deficit.''\n       The presentation advises, instead, sales pitches that play \n     on personal narratives and promises to change the \n     legislation.\n       ``People can be moved from initial skepticism and support \n     for repeal of the law to favorable feelings and resisting \n     repeal,'' it says. ``Use personal stories--coupled with \n     clear, simple descriptions of how the law benefits people at \n     the individual level--to convey critical benefits of \n     reform.''\n       The presentation also counsels against the kind of grand \n     claims of change that accompanied the legislation's passage.\n       ``Keep claims small and credible; don't overpromise or \n     `spin' what the law delivers,'' it says, suggesting \n     supporters say, ``The law is not perfect, but it does good \n     things and helps many people. Now we'll work to improve it.''\n       The Herndon Alliance, which presented the research, is a \n     low-profile group that coordinated liberal messaging in favor \n     of the public option in health care. Its ``partners'' include \n     health care legislation's heavyweight supporters: AARP, AFL-\n     CIO, SEIU, Health Care for America Now, MoveOn and La Raza, \n     among many others.\n       Today's presentation cites three private research projects \n     by top Democratic pollsters: eight focus groups by Lake, \n     Anzalone's 1,000-person national survey and an online survey \n     of 2,000 people by Greenberg's firm.\n       ``If we are to preserve the gains made by the law and build \n     on this foundation, the American public must understand what \n     the law means for them,'' says Herndon's website. ``We must \n     overcome fear and mistrust, and we must once again use our \n     collective voice to connect with the public on the values we \n     share as Americans.''\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I thought it was so important that more \nAmericans should know about this. The article explains that:\n\n       Key White House allies are dramatically shifting their \n     attempts to defend health care legislation, abandoning claims \n     that it will reduce costs and the deficit and instead \n     stressing a promise to ``improve it.''\n\n  Well, this new Democratic message strategy on health care was \ndeveloped by key Democratic strategists and pollsters, and it was \ndetailed in a 24-slide PowerPoint presentation. The language in the \npresentation is remarkable, and it is radically different from what \nPresident Obama and the Democrats on this floor promised during the \ndebate about health care. This new Democratic spin demonstrates that \npeople who voted for this bad law now recognize how unpopular it is \nwith the people of this country and how it will never live up to the \ngrand promises. That is why people all around the country were saying, \n``Don't vote for this'' as people in this body were cramming this \nbill--and now law--down the throats of the American people.\n  Well, rather than walk through all 24 slides, I wish to hit some of \nthe highlights of the new Democratic health care message.\n  Let's take a look at what they call ``Challenging Environment.'' They \nsay:\n\n       Straightforward policy defenses fail to be moving voters' \n     opinions about the law.\n\n  They say:\n\n       The public is disappointed, anxious, and depressed by the \n     current direction of the country--not trusting.\n       Voters are concerned about rising health care costs and \n     believe costs will continue to rise.\n\n  That is in spite of promises made on this floor that it wouldn't \nhappen.\n  They say:\n\n       Women in particular are concerned that the health care law \n     will mean less provider availability--scarcity an issue.\n\n  They say:\n\n       Many don't believe health reform will help the economy.\n\n  Well, there is a reason people don't trust Washington. There is a \nreason the policy defenses in the new law fail\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\nto move voter opinions, and it is because the new law is not good for \npatients; the new law is not good for providers--the nurses, the \ndoctors, the hospitals, the home health aides, hospice care; and the \nnew health care law is not good for the people who are going to be \npaying the bill.\n  Let's take the next slide and make it personal. It says:\n\n       Use personal stories coupled with clear, simple \n     descriptions of how the law benefits people at the individual \n     level to convey critical benefits of reform.\n\n  Well, there are a lot of personal stories they won't tell you, and \nthose are the personal stories including the small business owners all \nacross this country who are being strangled by the redtape in this law, \nstrangled by rules and regulations and expense. That is why we are \nlooking at 9.6 percent unemployment in this country--because of the \nlack of certainty for small businesses and the increased expenses they \nare having to deal with as a result of this law.\n  They won't tell you the stories about patients with preexisting \nconditions who did have insurance but now have been penalized by the \nnew law because they played by the rules.\n  Let's look at another slide. It says ``improve the law.'' The \nrecommendation of the pollsters to the Democrats is ``use transition or \nbridge language to meet public where they are and relax their \ndefenses.'' The American people know what they are talking about. Then \nthey say:\n\n       The law is not perfect, but it does good things and helps \n     many people. Now we'll work to improve it.\n\n  The question is, does this new law help you, the American citizen, at \nhome? That is the question. That is what people ask themselves. What is \nthe impact of this going to be on my own health care? Is the new law \nhelping you? Is the new law helping small businesses that can't seem to \nqualify for the tax credit the administration and the congressional \nDemocrats promised, in spite of the fact that 4 million postcards were \nsent out to small businesses, and only a very small percentage of those \ncould qualify for any of these tax opportunities? Were those people \nwilling to cut the salaries of the employed and lay off others? That is \nwhy we voted against this bill.\n  Is this new law helping individuals who, thanks to the new \nadministration grandfathering rules and regulations, will lose their \nemployer-sponsored health insurance plan? Is the new law helping \nseniors, who will see more than $500 billion robbed from Medicare--\nseniors on Medicare Advantage, a program they signed up for \nintentionally because they know there is an advantage to being on that \nprogram, because it works with preventive care and it coordinates care? \nThat is all gone.\n  Is the new law helping the 18 million people who will find themselves \nlocked into the Medicaid Program? Is the new law helping the millions \nof Americans who will see their health insurance premiums go up next \nyear to comply with benefit mandates in the law?\n  Instead of working to improve the law now, those on the other side of \nthe aisle should have improved it before it was passed. Members of my \nparty repeatedly wanted to work with Democrats to improve this \nlegislation. Unfortunately, we were shut out of the process.\n  Let's look at the next chart. It says ``blunt'' the mandate. Part of \nthe new Democratic spin is to blunt the mandate. It says:\n\n       Tap into the individual responsibility to blunt opposition \n     to the mandate to have health insurance.\n\n  Mandate? What is this mandate? It is a mandate that everybody in \nAmerica has to have insurance. All individuals have to have it. All \nemployers have to offer it. People either must buy insurance or \nemployers must provide insurance. There is a mandate. Currently, 20 \nStates are suing the Federal Government about the mandate. It also \nsays:\n\n       Those who choose not to have insurance and use the \n     emergency room for routine care are increasing costs for the \n     rest of us who have insurance.\n\n  Well, let's look at a report from the Centers for Disease Control, \nwhich came out in May. It confirms that, as opposed to what this slide \nsays, the uninsured don't visit the emergency room more often. Do you \nknow who does? It is Medicaid patients. It shows that more than 30 \npercent of Medicaid patients under the age of 65 visited emergency \nrooms in this country at least once in 2007. This health care law locks \n18 million more Americans into Medicaid, forcing them into the \nemergency rooms, because doctors frequently cannot afford to see them \nin their offices. So the question is: Will these 18 million more \nAmericans who have been locked into Medicaid be able to find a \nphysician to treat them? If not, how will the emergency rooms of this \ncountry cope when these patients use the ER as their primary care \nprovider?\n  We all know that the health care law was modeled after the \nMassachusetts State health reform plan. The Boston Globe reported on \nJuly 4 of this year that recent State data proved emergency room visits \nrose in Massachusetts by 9 percent, from 2004 to 2008--about 3 million \nvisits a year. According to the Massachusetts Division of Health Care \nFinance and their policy plan, providing insurance coverage may have \nactually contributed to the ER visit increase. But the goal was to \nlower the number of visits to the emergency room.\n  Let's look at another chart that talks about what health care \ncoverage Members of Congress have. It says:\n\n       Supporters of the law and those campaigning need to \n     highlight that Members of Congress will participate in the \n     same plan.\n\n  It is important to remember that the only reason Members of Congress \nare on the same plan is because Senators Coburn and Grassley fought for \nthis. It is also important to remember that members of the \ncongressional leadership, their staffs, White House employees, and \nother Federal employees will not be on the plan. Then let's look at the \nnew head of Medicare and Medicaid, Dr. Berwick, who is someone named to \nthat post in a recess appointment. His name didn't surface during the \nentire debate of the health care bill. Nobody was in charge of Medicare \nand Medicaid during the health care debate. Why? Because the President \nchose to not even name someone. When he finally named someone, this is \nsomeone who is in love with the British health care system. He made a \nnumber of quotes about rationing of care and ways that he envisioned \nthe British health care system to be so much better than the U.S. \nhealth care system.\n  Yet, Dr. Berwick has, as a result of his contract, from the group he \nworked with in Boston before taking this new job--a job that the \nPresident made a recess appointment for--somebody who never came to \nCongress to testify, never presented himself to the American people--I \ndon't know what he is hiding. He doesn't have to live under the plan \nforced down the throats of the American people because his contract, \nwhen he left Boston, said that he will get care under them for life. So \nwill his wife. So he is making rules and regulations that apply to the \nrest of the country but not to him.\n  Let's look at another slide having to do with Medicare cuts. The new \nDemocratic spin says:\n\n       It is critical to reassure seniors that Medicare will not \n     be cut.\n\n  Then it says:\n\n       Free preventive care.\n\n  This is absolutely absurd and untrue. It is clear that the new law \ncuts $500 billion from our seniors on Medicare. It is not to save \nMedicare. It doesn't just start a whole new government program for \nsomeone else, but when I talk to seniors--and I have done this all over \nthe last month, traveling around the State of Wyoming, visiting \nparades, picnics, fairs, and rodeos--the seniors say: If you want to \nchange Medicare to save Medicare, we can deal with that, but not to \nstart a whole new government program for someone else.\n  The final slide I think is most telling. It is a slide that is a list \nof the don'ts. The new Democratic spin says:\n\n       Don't assume that the public knows the health reform law \n     passed, or if they know it passed, understand how it will \n     affect them; don't list benefits outside of any personal \n     context; don't barrage voters with a long list of benefits; \n     don't use complex language or insider jargon; don't use \n     heated political rhetoric or congratulatory language.\n\n  And believe it or not, it also says on the slide the Democrats' \npollsters put out:\n\n       Don't say the law will reduce costs and deficit.\n\n  Well, let's take a look at some of the quotes we heard leading up to \npassage of the law--promises by the President of the United States, by \nHouse Speaker\n\n[[Page S7077]]\n\nPelosi, and by Majority Leader Reid. The President met with Senate \nDemocrats in December of 2009, before a vote in the Senate. He said:\n\n       We agree on reforms that will finally reduce the costs of \n     health care.\n\n  He says:\n\n       Families will save on their premiums.\n\n  He said:\n\n       This will be the largest deficit reduction plan in over a \n     decade.\n\n  Now the Democrats are being told:\n\n       Don't say the law will reduce costs and the deficit.\n\n  Isn't that what the President said to the Democrats in December of \n2009?\n  The American people have been misled. They can see through this. That \nis why they were screaming: Do not pass this law. Yet what the \nPresident said and now what the American people know to be the truth is \nthe exact opposite.\n  Let's look at what House Speaker Pelosi said. In March of this year \nshe said:\n\n       This is a triumph for the American people in terms of \n     deficit reduction.\n\n  This isn't going to reduce the deficit. Now, finally 6 months after \nit has been passed into law, the Democrats are admitting that this is \nnot a triumph for the American people in terms of deficit reduction.\n  Then Senator Reid, from that desk on the Senate floor, in November of \nlast year, said:\n\n       One of the major goals of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act is to lower Federal health care costs and \n     reduce the deficit.\n\n  He then said:\n\n       Our bill does that.\n\n  The bill signed into law does not do that. And now even the \nDemocrats, with their new spin, are saying that we better not keep \nsaying it because the American people don't believe it. That is why 56 \npercent of the American people want this law repealed and replaced.\n  The American people are sick of the spin. They deserve the truth \nabout the new law and how it will impact their lives. It is clear that \nthis law is not good for patients, it is not good for providers--the \nnurses and doctors who take care of the patients--and it is not good \nfor the payers--the taxpayers of this country and the people who pay \ntheir own health care costs. We need to repeal and replace this new law \nwith a plan that will actually help our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                Tax Cuts\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, just yesterday the Republican minority \nleader indicated that every Republican in the Senate would join him in \nfilibustering legislation that would provide middle-class tax relief to \nover 97 percent of American workers and their families unless the Bush \ntax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent were extended as well.\n  In my view, what we have to do is stand up to that filibuster no \nmatter how long it takes. If it means being in here 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week, that is what we have to do. Senate Republicans should not \nbe allowed to hold middle-class tax cuts hostage in order to give even \nbigger tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires at a time when this \nNation has a $13 trillion national debt and a widening gap between the \nvery rich and everyone else.\n  In fact, we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income \nof any major country on Earth. The dumbest thing we could probably do \nat this moment is to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax \nbreaks to some of the wealthiest people in this country. That would be \ntotally absurd.\n  Today, the top 1 percent earns more income than the bottom 50 \npercent. The top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent, \nand the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider. \nWe have the dubious distinction--not a good distinction--of having, by \nfar, the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major \ncountry on Earth.\n  In 2007, the wealthiest 1 percent took in 23\\1/2\\ percent of all \nincome earned in the United States. That is not an issue we talk about \nin the Senate. Apparently, in polite organizations, polite groups, we \nare not allowed to talk about that. But let me repeat it. The top 1 \npercent in 2007 earned 23\\1/2\\ percent of all the income earned in the \nUnited States.\n  That is the latest data available. There is no reason to believe that \nincome is not even greater right now. It is not a coincidence that the \nlast time that income was this concentrated was in the year 1928. 1928. \nThose of us who remember history know what happened in 1929. The stock \nmarket crashed, and we plunged into the Great Depression.\n  Louis Brandeis, one of the great Supreme Court Justices in the \nhistory of this country who served on the Supreme Court during both the \nRoaring Twenties and the Great Depression once said: ``We may have \ndemocracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, \nbut we cannot have both.''\n  Mr. Brandeis was right then and his words ring true today. Today, the \nwealthiest 400 Americans make an average of $345 million a year--$345 \nmillion a year, on average, for the top 400 American earners.\n  Under the Bush administration, these 400 individuals saw their \nincomes double--double--while their Federal tax rate was cut almost in \nhalf over the last 15 years, before Bush, through Bush. So during the \nBush years their incomes doubled while their tax rates went way down.\n  Now our Republican friends, and maybe some Democrats, are saying: We \nshould give these people huge tax breaks at this moment. We have a \nFederal Tax Code that is so absurd, that is so unfair that Warren \nBuffett, one of the wealthiest Americans and certainly one of the \nwealthiest people in the entire world, who is worth tens of billions of \ndollars, himself, what he has often stated is that he, one of the \nrichest people in the world, pays a lower effective tax rate than does \nhis secretary.\n  Hedge fund managers who made $1 billion last year now pay a lower \neffective--by ``effective'' I mean real because of all the loopholes--a \nlower effective tax rate than many teachers, nurses, firefighters, and \npolice officers, and our Republican friends want to make that absurd \nsituation even worse by maintaining huge tax breaks to millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  During the Bush years, the wealthiest 400 Americans saw their wealth \nincrease by some $400 billion. Let me repeat that. Four hundred \nfamilies--not a whole lot of people--saw their wealth increase by some \n$400 billion, and all the while, while the people on top have seen an \nexplosion in their incomes and in their wealth, the middle class is \nrapidly disappearing, poverty is increasing, and we are moving toward \nan oligarchic form of society, where so few have so much, so many have \nso little.\n  Our Republican friends have argued that these massive tax breaks, \nsome $700 billion in a 10-year period for the top 2 percent, would \ntrickle down, trickle down to all Americans. Give tax breaks to \nbillionaires and it is going to trickle down and improve our economy \nand do well by everybody.\n  We have been told over and over by Republican colleagues that \nmillionaires and billionaires would use the massive tax breaks they \nreceived under President Bush to create jobs in the private sector. \nWell, guess what. The results are in. During the 8 years of the Bush \nadministration, a time in which the wealthiest Americans received one \nof the largest tax cuts in this Nation's history, the United States of \nAmerica lost over 600,000 private sector jobs and only gained, over \nthat 8-year period, a net total of 1 million new jobs, all of them, by \nthe way, government jobs.\n  So we saw the experiment in action. We gave huge tax breaks to the \nrich, and we ended up having one of the worst job creation records in \nthe history of the United States--losing over 600,000 jobs. It is an \ninteresting theory. We have seen it in practice. It does not work.\n  In addition, under President Bush, median family incomes went down by \nover $2,000. Let me repeat that. Do you know why people are angry in \nNorth Carolina, Vermont or all over this\n\n[[Page S7078]]\n\ncountry? They are angry because during an 8-year period, their median \nfamily income went down by $2,000 a family, and we lost 600,000 private \nsector jobs.\n  During those same 8 years, more than 8 million Americans slipped out \nof the middle class and into poverty, over 7 million lost their health \ninsurance, more than 4 million manufacturing jobs were lost, and over 3 \nmillion Americans lost their pensions. In other words, we went through \nthat exercise. It failed. How could anybody want to go back to those \npolicies?\n  Our Republican friends do. That is what they want. That is what they \nwant to see us move toward--more tax breaks for the wealthy, more \ninequality, more power concentrated in the hands of a few, and more \nmiddle-class Americans slipping into poverty. Do we provide tax breaks \nto millionaires and billionaires or do we invest in the middle class? \nThat is what this debate is all about.\n  My Republican friends have told us the worst thing you can do in a \nrecession is to increase taxes on the wealthy. Well, the Republicans \ntold us the same thing when Bill Clinton was President.\n  When Bill Clinton's economic plans were signed into law in 1993--as a \nMember of the House I voted for it, it won by one vote--a plan which \nincreases taxes by a few percentage points, guess what happened. We \nraised taxes on the wealthy. We lowered the deficit. Guess what \nhappened. Unlike the Bush years, where we lost 600,000 private sector \njobs, during the Clinton years, over 22 million jobs were created. We \nhad the longest peacetime expansion in our economy in our Nation's \nhistory, and budget deficits turned into budget surpluses. Those are \nthe facts. No one can deny them.\n  Further, what conservative and progressive economists of all stripes \nhave told us is that providing tax breaks for the rich is the least \neffective way--the least effective way--to stimulate or improve the \neconomy.\n  That is not Senator Bernie Sanders talking. That is what both the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Senator John McCain's top \neconomic adviser during the Presidential campaign, Mark Zandi, have \ntold us. According to Mr. Zandi, again, an economic adviser to \nPresidential Candidate McCain, every $1 provider in tax breaks to the \nwealthy pumps only 32 cents into the economy.\n  On the other hand, we know that one of the best ways to grow the \neconomy and to create decent-paying jobs is to invest in our Nation's \ncrumbling infrastructure so we build the roads, the bridges, the \nrailways, the culverts, the tunnels we desperately need.\n  According to Mr. Zandi, for every $1 invested in infrastructure, it \ngenerates $1.57 in economic activity. Without a strong and vibrant \ntransportation system, businesses fail, the Nation fails. Increasingly, \nas people travel around the world, go to airports, ride on trains, use \nroads, they tell us the United States has an infrastructure which is \nfalling way behind much of the rest of the world.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers gave us a D several years ago \nand has told us we need to invest trillions of dollars in our crumbling \ninfrastructure in order to bring us to the level we have to be.\n  Not only is rebuilding our infrastructure good for our future, it is \nalso good for the moment in dealing with the need to create jobs in \nthis terrible recession. Every $1 billion invested in infrastructure \ncreates or saves over 45,000 American jobs. Not only is investing in \ninfrastructure good for the economy, it is something we have to do \nsooner or later.\n  I am a former mayor. What I can tell you is, you can ignore your \nroads and bridges this year or the next year, but at some point you are \ngoing to have to deal with them. They do not get better by not \nrebuilding them. In fact, it is often more expensive to have to rebuild \nthem than it is to maintain them.\n\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, the American Society of Civil Engineers \ntells us that over the next 5 years we need to invest $2.2 trillion in \nour Nation's infrastructure. Why not do this work now when we have \nmillions of Americans who desperately want to go back to work? We are \ngoing to have to do it sometime. Let's do it now.\n  Allowing the Bush tax breaks to expire for the wealthiest 2 percent \nwill bring in $700 billion in revenue over the next 10 years--$700 \nbillion. In my view, what we should do with that $700 billion is pretty \nsimple. I would take half of that--$350 billion--and use it for deficit \nreduction so that we begin to cut back on our national debt and our \ndeficit. The other thing I would do is invest the other half--$350 \nbillion--in our infrastructure so we create the desperately needed jobs \nthat our economy calls for.\n  Our Republican friends are dead wrong, are irresponsible, are not \nkeeping faith with our kids and grandchildren when they want to \nmaintain these tax breaks for the top 2 percent, for many millionaires \nand billionaires, which would result in increasing the deficit by \nnearly $1 trillion over a 10-year period counting interest and that \nwould provide an average break of over $100,000 a year to some of the \nwealthiest people in this country.\n  So that is what the choice is: Do we put money into deficit \nreduction, lowering our interest costs, helping our kids and \ngrandchildren a little bit in terms of the kind of debt they are going \nto have to assume--$350 billion over a 10-year period for deficit \nreduction is significant--do we use another $350 billion to invest in \nour infrastructure so we can create millions of jobs rebuilding America \nor do we make the richest people in this country even richer?\n  I think the answer is pretty clear. I think the American people have \nspoken out with their views on this issue. They do not believe, when \nthe middle class is collapsing, the wealthiest people are becoming \nricher, and when we have a $13 trillion national debt, it makes any \nsense at all to give huge tax breaks to the rich.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Learning From History\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, yesterday on the floor of the \nSenate I told the story of something that happened in Lordstown, OH, a \ncommunity not too far from Youngstown, in the Mahoning Valley in \nnortheast Ohio 1 week ago today. This story was a celebration of the \nfirst car coming off the line in the Lordstown Chevrolet-GM plant, the \ncar the Chevy Cruz. It is a high mileage car, I believe the highest \nmileage car GM ever produced. It is a relatively inexpensive car. They \nexpect it to be a huge seller all over the United States. It is a good \neconomy car with a lot to it that recommends itself.\n  I am not here to endorse the car or even endorse the company. I am \nhere to say that this celebration was a direct result of what the \nPresiding Officer and others in this body and the President of the \nUnited States did a year and a half ago.\n  Turn the clock back to the beginning of the Presiding Officer's \nservice in the Senate in early 2009. President Obama had just taken \noffice. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month. The banking industry \nalmost collapsed. President Bush had begun the bailout of the banks to \nmake sure they did not collapse. President Obama continued working on \nthis issue.\n  We know where the auto industry was at the same time. Sales were down \n40 percent in the auto industry, 1 million jobs were at risk of being \nlost, on top of the 8 million jobs that had already been lost by the \ntime President Obama raised his right hand to be sworn in on January \n20, 2009.\n  It was not just the Big Three--Chrysler, Ford, and GM--that were in \ntrouble, two of which declared bankruptcy. It was also the tier 1 \nsuppliers, those large companies that made products that go directly \ninto the assembly of a car. It was also all the other component \nmanufacturers--tier 2, tier 3 companies--that make everything from door \nhandles to tires to bolts to hold the car together to windshields to \nside\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\npanels, the stamping plants, the component plants, the engine plants, \nand ultimately the automobile itself.\n  I take special pride in the Chevy Cruz because it is such an Ohio \ncar. The engine is made in Defiance, OH. The transmission is made in \nToledo, OH. The bumpers are made in Northwood, OH. Most of the metal is \nstamped in Parma, OH. Some of the rest of the metal is stamped in \nLordstown, and the assembly is done in Lordstown. The Cruz is really an \nOhio car.\n  The good news is that 1,100 jobs were added for a third shift on the \nCruz. That is the Lordstown plant alone. That is just that plant. That \nis not counting all the job increases for the component manufacturers.\n  Again, looking back a year and a half when there was so much trauma \nin this country, when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month--we had \nalready lost 8 million jobs the last year of President Bush's term. The \nauto industry was about to go belly up. Conservative politicians, the \nnaysayers, the doom-and-gloom crowd in this body and across the way and \nothers were saying: Let the market work. If the auto industry fails, \nthat is the market's decision. If the dealers go out of business--\ndealers not just in Ohio but in Colorado and everywhere else--that is \nthe market. If the suppliers go out of business, that is the market \nspeaking. If the communities where these companies are lose jobs and \nlose revenue and they lay off teachers, firefighters, police officers, \nand mental health counselors, that is the free market working. If the \nauto dealer in Lima, OH, goes out of business, that means the Little \nLeague that car dealer used to sponsor will not have new uniforms. That \nis the market working.\n  In spite of the naysayers, in spite of the conservative politicians \nin this country and in this body who said, Wash our hands, we didn't \ncause it, we are not going to do anything about it, we did not do that. \nWe did not turn our back on that. Mr. President, 400,000 Ohio jobs are \ndirectly or indirectly dependent on the auto industry. Tens and \nhundreds of thousands of jobs in every State of this country depend on \nthe auto industry, not to mention the retirees, many of whom get \npensions because of their 25, 30, 40, sometimes 45, years of work in \nthis industry.\n  We did not turn our backs. We invested in the auto industry. That is \nwhy we had that celebration last Tuesday in Lordstown, OH, because the \nnaysayers lost, the doom-and-gloom crowd was cast aside, and those of \nus who thought we should invest in the auto industry were successful. \nWe were successful in that 1,100 people in Lordstown are back at work \nand hundreds of thousands of others did not lose their jobs because of \nthat. And we are all in a much better position because of that.\n  We need to learn from our history. If we had turned our back on this \nindustry, we would have been in a depression. Almost any economist \nthinks that. Auto and housing are, I believe, the two biggest \nindustries in our country.\n  I want to go back a little further to the whole idea of letting the \nmarket work and the government never being involved. Let me take--and \ndo it very fairly--January 20, 1993, to January 20, 2001, the 8 years \nof Bill Clinton's Presidency, then January 20, 2001, to January 20, \n2009, the 8 years of George Bush's Presidency. I am not shading this. I \nam just taking these 8 years.\n  During the 8 years of President Clinton's Presidency, we increased \ntaxes on the wealthy, balanced the budget, and had smart--not too much \nregulation--had smart regulation. During the 8 years of President \nClinton, a net 22 million jobs were created in this country, more than \na 22 million net increase of jobs during Bill Clinton's 8 years. During \nGeorge Bush's 8 years, there was a net increase of 1.1 million: 22 \nmillion during President Clinton's 8 years; 1.1 million during \nPresident Bush's 8 years.\n  During President Clinton's 8 years, incomes went up for the average \nperson in this country. During President Bush's 8 years, income for the \naverage person went down.\n  At the end of President Clinton's 8 years--in other words, January \n20, 2001--when he left the White House, we had the largest budget \nsurplus in American history. When George Bush left the White House on \nJanuary 20, 2009, we had the largest budget deficit in this Nation's \nhistory.\n  Yet too many people in this body think that we should go back to the \nyears of deregulation of Wall Street, cutting taxes on the rich, and \npassing trade agreements that send jobs to China, Mexico, and all over \nthe world.\n  I will take you back further. If you do not quite believe that--\nalthough it is provably true--go back to the Reagan tax cuts. Ronald \nReagan staked his whole reputation on them. When he was campaigning, he \nsaid: We are going to cut taxes. In 1981, the Reagan administration \npushed through a tax cut. Congress voted for it. It was a major tax \ncut, overwhelmingly for corporations and the wealthiest wage earners of \nthe country.\n  For the next 16 months, we lost jobs in this country. For the next 16 \nmonths, we had a net decrease in employment--for 16 months. Only when \nPresident Reagan signed a tax increase to balance the budget did we \nbegin to have job growth.\n  The same thing happened with President Obama. President Obama came in \nand passed the stimulus package. We were losing a lot of jobs. We kept \nlosing jobs because that is what was happening to the economy.\n  When we passed the Recovery Act, we began to see the economy get \nbetter. It has not gotten better quickly enough. We have gotten no help \nfrom the other side of the aisle, which opposed everything because they \nwanted to go back to the Bush ideas and tax cuts for the wealthy, \nderegulation of Wall Street, and passing trade agreements that \noutsource jobs.\n  We are not going to do that with President Obama. We are not going to \ndo that with the Democrats in the majority in the House and the Senate. \nWe are not going back to tax cuts for the rich, deregulation of Wall \nStreet, and trade agreements that send jobs overseas.\n  Instead, we are beginning the recovery. For the last several months, \nwe have seen a net increase every month in private sector job creation. \nThat increased not as fast as we wanted. Too many 22-year-olds come \nhome from the Army and college and cannot get a job. I know that. There \nare too many people laid off who cannot get a job. There are too many \npeople working but not working as many hours, not working 40 hours, \neven though they want to.\n  We know this economy is not where it should be. If the voters this \nyear elect people who subscribe to the George Bush philosophy of tax \ncuts for the wealthy and deregulation of Wall Street and more trade \nagreements that outsource jobs to China and Mexico, we are making a \nterrible mistake. We do not want to look back. We want to look forward.\n  We can learn from history, and the best way to learn from history is \nto see who has been President, what their governing philosophy has been \nand what works. Twenty-two million jobs during the Clinton years and \none million jobs during the Bush years. When President Bush cut taxes--\nat the beginning of his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts--you know what happened? \nWealthy Americans saved their money. They didn't invest it or spend it \non job creation; they saved it. Good for them. But why would we pass a \ntax cut instead of doing it right, the way we have done it, and put \npeople to work on bridge projects and water and sewer projects and \nhelping small businesses?\n\n  We are passing legislation this week that Senator Landrieu has pushed \nso hard on. My colleague, Senator Voinovich, is one of only two \nRepublicans to support it, even though the Chamber of Commerce is a \nstrong supporter of it. It will make a difference in creating jobs \nbecause we know most jobs--two out of three--are created by small \nbusiness.\n  Facts are facts, Mr. President. We can learn from history. We \nshouldn't turn back the clock and do things the way we did in the first \npart of this decade.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of SPC Chad \nDerek Clements of the U.S. Army and Huntington, IN.\n  Specialist Clements was assigned to F Company, 4th Brigade Support \nBattalion, 4th Infantry Division. He was only 26 years old when he lost \nhis life on August 30th while serving bravely in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom in the Arghandab River Valley in Afghanistan. He was \nonly 3 weeks into his first deployment.\n  A Huntington, IN, native, Chad graduated from Huntington North High \nSchool in 2002. He enlisted in the Army in February 2009 and arrived in \nAfghanistan the second week of August. He followed in the proud \nmilitary tradition of his father, Daniel, a Navy veteran who passed \naway in 2001.\n  Those closest to him described Chad as having a big heart. He deeply \nvalued his family and his friends. Chad was an avid fan of the local \nFort Wayne Komets and the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey teams, and he \nenjoyed collecting memorabilia of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt.\n  Today, I join Chad's family and friends in mourning his death. He is \nsurvived by his mother, Anne Beady Tarter; his stepfather, Ed Tarter; \nhis sister, Danielle Clements; his grandmother, Betty Beady; his \ngrandfather and step-grandmother, Marvin and Carol Beady; his \ngrandfather, Everett Clements; his stepbrother, Corey Tarter; and his \nstepsister, Heather Tarter.\n  We take pride in the example of this American hero, even as we \nstruggle to express our sorrow over this loss. We cherish the legacy of \nhis service and his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: \n``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this \nground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have \nconsecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world \nwill little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never \nforget what they did here.''\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of SPC Chad Derek Clements in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to our country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace.\n\n\n                    Sergeant christopher Neal Karch\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to honor the life of SGT Christopher \nNeal Karch of the U.S. Army and Indianapolis, IN.\n  Sergeant Karch was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 508th Parachute \nInfantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. He \nwas only 23 years old when he lost his life on August 11 while serving \nbravely in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. He was \n20 days from completing his second tour of duty.\n  Sergeant Karch graduated from Lawrence Central High School in 2005 \nand was pursuing a degree from the University of Maryland with plans to \ngraduate in 2012. He joined the Army 2 months after his high school \ngraduation, where he served in the same division and lived in the same \nbarracks as his father Pat--also a veteran. A decorated soldier, \nSergeant Karch earned the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart and the \nArmy Good Conduct Medal. His platoon leader described him as the \n``epitome of an airborne paratrooper.''\n  Today, I join Sergeant Karch's family and friends in mourning his \ndeath. He is survived by his father, Pat Karch; his mother Lynn Kersey; \nhis grandparents, Nick and Dian Nicholson, Bill and Joyce Seal, Norman \nand Denise Karch, and Jerry Hallgarth; and his uncle, Vince Karch.\n  As we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we take pride in \nthe example of this American hero and cherish the legacy of his service \nand his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: \n``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this \nground.

He had been in Afghanistan for 5 weeks.\n  An Elkhart native, Justin graduated from Elkhart Memorial High School \nin 2000. He shared a passion for working on old bicycles and cars with \nhis father, Blue, who described his son as hardworking and dependable.\n  Today, I join Justin's family and friends in mourning his death.

Raver\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I honor PFC Bryn T. Raver, 20, of \nArkansas, who died on August 29, 2010, in Nangahar, Afghanistan, in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom. According to initial reports, \nPFC Raver died of injuries sustained on August 28, 2010, when his \nmilitary vehicle was hit by rocket-propelled grenade fire\n  My heart goes out to the family of PFC Raver who made the ultimate \nsacrifice on behalf of our Nation. Along with all Arkansans, I am \ngrateful for his service and for the service and sacrifice of all of \nour military servicemembers and their families.\n  More than 11,000 Arkansans on active duty and more than 10,000 \nArkansas reservists have served in Iraq or Afghanistan since September \n11, 2001. These men and women have shown tremendous courage and \nperseverance through the most difficult of times. As neighbors, as \nArkansans, and as Americans, it is incumbent upon us to do everything \nwe can to honor their service and to provide for them and their \nfamilies, not only when they are in harm's way but also when they \nreturn home. It is the least we can do for those whom we owe so much.\n  PFC Raver was assigned to the 1st Brigade Special Troops Battalion, \n101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, KY. He is survived by his wife, \nwho resides at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington; a daughter in \nAlpena, AR.; and his father of Everton, AR.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7081-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7081-S7082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           50TH ANNIVERSARY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the legislation that allowed for the formation of real \nestate investment trusts, now commonly known as REITs.\n  On September 14, 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law \nthe Cigar Excise Tax Extension Act. Included in that law were the \ncritical provisions that first enabled investors from all walks of life \nto benefit from the income generation and diversification advantages of \ncommercial real estate investments. Our predecessors in Congress \nrecognized that without this innovation such investments would continue \nto be limited to institutions and wealthy individuals.\n  The law signed by President Eisenhower enabled the creation of the \nfirst REITs. However, the groundwork for the modern REIT era was truly \nlaid in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, when REITs were given the ability \nto operate and manage real estate, rather than simply owning or \nfinancing it. As a result, the great majority of today's REITs are \nowners, operators, and developers of properties in the office, retail, \nindustrial, health care, apartment, lodging and self-storage sectors--\nproperties used by a broad range of tenants from across the economy.\n  Reflecting the evolving real estate market, Congress and the Treasury \nhave implemented incremental changes to the REIT approach to real \nestate investing over the years. For example, laws such as the REIT \nSimplification Act of 1997, the REIT Modernization Act of 1999, the \nREIT Improvement Act of 2004, and the REIT Investment Diversification \nand Empowerment Act of 2008 have been enacted with the support of \nCongresses and Presidents of both parties.\n  While the REIT model has evolved, the original legislative intent of \nmaking large-scale, income-producing commercial real estate investment \navailable to all types of investors remains at the core.\n  For example, by definition in the Internal Revenue Code, 75 percent \nof a REIT's assets must be in qualifying real estate, 75 percent of its \nincome must come from rents and other qualifying sources, and 90 \npercent of its taxable earnings must be distributed to shareholders in \nthe form of dividends. Among active businesses, the requirement to pay \nout 90 percent of taxable earnings is unique to the REIT industry, \nwhich distributed approximately $13.5 billion to shareholders in 2009.\n  Additionally, the income, asset, and distribution requirements, when \ncombined with the disclosure and other regulations that govern public \ncompanies, protect shareholders and provide transparency in a way that \nother real estate investments do not. With 132 REITs traded on the New \nYork Stock Exchange, ownership of shares in these companies also \nprovides a significant liquidity advantage over alternative real estate \ninvestments.\n  Michigan has played an important role in creating the vibrant REIT \nindustry that exists today. Taubman Centers, Inc., based in Bloomfield \nHills, is a leading owner of regional malls. In the 1990s, when they \npioneered a new way to take public a portfolio of real estate that had \nbeen privately held, they unleashed a wave of initial public offerings \nby REITs in the 1990s.\n  Three other REITs--Agree Realty Corporation, Ramco-Gershenson \nProperties Trust, and Sun Communities, Inc.--also call Michigan home. \nAnd, more than 620 properties across my home State are owned by REITs.\n  Commercial real estate accounts for more than 6 percent of the gross \ndomestic product of the United States, and my colleagues and I are all \ntoo aware of the challenges facing this sector. In the face of this \nchallenge, REITs have been well-served by staying true to their core \nvalues of careful investment, transparency, and liquidity. While \ncommercial real estate is not yet out of the woods, I believe \npolicymakers and the other participants in the commercial real estate \nmarket can learn a great deal from this business model, which has been \nemulated by more than two dozen countries around the world.\n  I thank you for this opportunity to commend the REIT industry on its \n50th anniversary. Allow me to also commend our predecessors in Congress \nfor having the foresight to enable all Americans to access and benefit \nfrom investments in real estate. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to continue this work that began more than 50 years ago.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, 50 years ago today, President Eisenhower \nsigned into law legislation that established real estate investment \ntrusts, commonly known as REITs. His action gave the final stamp of \napproval to what our colleagues in this Chamber envisioned at that time \nfor the general public: A secure and efficient way to invest in high-\nquality commercial real estate in the United States. I want to \nrecognize the 50th anniversary of REITs and their significant \ncontribution to the overall economic vitality of our Nation over the \npast 50 years.\n  As my colleagues know, REITs allow any investor, no matter their \nfinancial resources, to secure all of the advantages of investing in \nreal estate in the United States. Prior to 1960, access to the highly \ndesirable investment returns of commercial real estate assets was \nlimited to institutions and wealthy individuals who had the financial \nwealth to make direct real estate investments. By creating REITs, \nCongress recognized that small investors should be afforded the same \nopportunity to invest in portfolios of large-scale commercial \nproperties and achieve the same investment benefits--diversification, \nliquidity, performance, transparency--as those able to make direct \ninvestments in real estate.\n  REITs are companies dedicated to the ownership and development of \nincome-producing real estate, such as apartments, regional malls, \nshopping centers, office buildings, self storage facilities, and \nindustrial warehouses. Federal tax law requires that REITs meet \nspecific tests regarding the composition of their gross income and \nassets. Specifically, 95 percent of their annual gross income must be \nfrom specified sources such as dividends, interests, and rents; and 75 \npercent of their gross income must be from real estate related sources. \nSimilarly, at\n\n[[Page S7082]]\n\nthe end of each calendar quarter, 75 percent of a REITs assets must \nconsist of specified real estate assets. Consequently, REITs must \nderive a majority of their gross income from commercial real estate.\n  While REITs have played a major role in the U.S. economy since 1960, \ntheir mark in the investing world has been achieved since passage of \nthe Tax Reform Act of 1986, a time period many refer to as the modern \nREIT era. This law removed most of the tax-sheltering capability of \nreal estate and emphasized income-producing transactions, allowing \nREITs to operate and manage real estate as well as own it. I am pleased \nthat over the years, Congress has adopted legislation to perfect the \nREIT method of investing in real estate. Among many proposals, these \ninclude the REIT Simplification Act of 1997, the REIT Modernization Act \nof 1999, the REIT Improvement Act of 2004, and the REIT Investment \nDiversification and Empowerment Act, or RIDEA, passed in 2008.\n  I am pleased that my home State of Georgia is home to several REIT \ncompanies that are engaged in the daily business of creating wealth and \nemployment for many investors across the country and my constituents. \nThese companies include Cousins Properties Incorporated, Gables \nResidential Trust, Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Incorporated, Post \nProperties, Incorporated, and Wells Real Estate Investment Trust. In \ntotal, there are more than 1,400 REIT properties located in Georgia, \nwith an estimated historical cost in the billions of dollars.\n  Commercial real estate represents more than 6 percent of this \ncountry's gross domestic product and is a key generator of jobs and \nother economic activities. Today, because of what Congress did five \ndecades ago, anyone can purchase shares of real estate operating \ncompanies, and do so in a manner that meets their investments needs by \nfocusing on a particular sector in the commercial real estate world and \na specific region of the country. That is the beauty of the REIT method \nof investing, whose influence has now spread abroad to more than two \ndozen countries that have adopted a similar model encouraging real \nestate investment.\n  In closing, I want to again congratulate the REIT industry on its 50 \nyears of leadership in the real estate investing market. REITs have \nfulfilled Congress's vision by making investments in large scale, \ncapital intensive commercial real estate available to all investors. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with them on issues of importance to \nREIT investors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7082-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7082-S7083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JANE STRANCH\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of \nMs. Jane Stranch to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit. I am concerned about Ms. Stranch's nomination to the court of \nappeals because, like many recent judicial nominees, she embraces the \nuse of foreign law by the courts, which is contradictory to the \nConstitution, the judicial oath, and the intent of our Founders.\n  I reached this conclusion after carefully reviewing her record, her \nhearing testimony, and her responses to written questions following her \nhearing. For example, in response to my question asking her whether it \nis ever proper for judges to rely on foreign or international laws or \ndecisions in determining the meaning of the Constitution, Ms. Stranch \nadmitted she believes using foreign law in limited circumstances is \nappropriate.\n  First, she stated that she is ``aware of only a very few cases in \nwhich [the Supreme Court] has referenced non-U.S law in a majority \nopinion, including Roper [v Simmons],'' but, then she continued: ``In \nthese few cases, references to foreign law were made for such purposes \nas extrapolating on societal norms and standards of decency, refuting \ncontrary assertions or confirming American views. None of these cases \nused foreign or international law to interpret a constitutional text. \nThe Supreme Court's restraint on this issue is a model for the lower \ncourts.'' Ms. Stanch's misleading answer fails to recognize that, by \nlooking to foreign law to determine whether the imposition of the death \npenalty for those under 18 has become ``unusual,'' the Court is \nallowing foreign law to influence its interpretation of a \nconstitutional text. Her statement that the Court is merely confirming \nAmerican views or refuting contrary assertions is disturbing because \nforeign countries' views on the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution \nare irrelevant to what our Founders wrote and believed. Also, Ms. \nStranch commended the Supreme Court for its ``restraint'' in its use of \nforeign law when an appropriate answer would be to condemn the Court \nfor using foreign law at all. Her answer implies that she believes \nusing foreign law is appropriate in some cases, as long as it is \nlimited use.\n  Ms. Stranch compounded my concern about her views on the appropriate \nuse of foreign law when she responded to my next question asking under \nwhat circumstances she would consider foreign law when interpreting the \nConstitution. She responded that, as a judge, foreign law ``would be \nused as confirmatory only'' in her cases. This answer suggests a \njudicial activist approach where she will use foreign law to confirm \nwhatever result she deems appropriate. Ms. Stranch further states that \nbecause ``references [to foreign law] are so rare at the Supreme Court \nlevel [it] suggests even rarer usage in the lower courts.'' Allowing \nthat the lower court should use foreign law rarely is deeply \nconcerning. Judges should not be using foreign law at all.\n  Ms. Stranch's answers to questions relating to the proper \ninterpretation of the eighth amendment are also problematic. In \nresponse to a question asking how she would determine what are the \n``evolving standards of decency'' with regard to the eighth amendment's \nprohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, she responded by citing \nthe language in the opinion that the Court has ``established the \npropriety and affirmed the necessity of referring to the `evolving \nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society' to \ndetermine which punishments are so disproportionate as to be cruel and \nunusual.'' But, she then continues stating: ``The Court held that the \nbeginning point of that determination is its review of objective \nindicia of consensus as expressed by enactments of legislatures. The \nexercise of the Court's independent judgment regarding the \nproportionality of the punishment followed.'' While she is merely \nreciting what the Supreme Court did in the Roper opinion, she fails to \nacknowledge what is concerning about the Court's opinion.\n  First, it is concerning that when the Court in Roper was looking to \n``objective indicia of consensus as expressed by enactments of \nlegislatures,'' it was not only looking at other States' laws--as \nopposed to the law of the State in question--but also to foreign \nlegislatures' laws. Rather than look to other legislatures for \n``evolving standards,'' the proper analysis in this case would have \nbeen to look to the meaning of the text when the Founders wrote it. \nThus, the Court should be determining whether capital punishment for \npersons under 18 was considered ``cruel and unusual'' when the \nConstitution was written. To do otherwise embraces an evolving and ever \nchanging Constitution. Ms. Stranch fails to acknowledge this concern. \nSecond, Ms. Stranch admits that the ``exercise of the Court's \nindependent judgment regarding the proportionality of the punishment \nfollowed,'' but does not acknowledge that a Court should not be making \nthese types of ``independent'' determinations.\n  Ms. Stranch's answers on foreign law are concerning because she not \nonly misstates how the Supreme Court has used foreign law in its cases, \nbut she also refuses to pledge not to use foreign law herself. In fact, \nshe believes that ``rare'' usage of foreign law by the lower courts is \nappropriate. For these reasons, I will vote against her nomination and \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I also would note that I believe Ms. Stranch is just one of many \nconcerning nominees by this administration who embrace the use of \nforeign law by judges. This trend first became apparent with the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor last year. Prior to her hearing, \nJudge Sotomayor stated that outlawing the use of foreign law would mean \njudges would have to ``close their minds to good ideas'' and that it is \nher ``hope'' that judges will continue to consult foreign law when \ninterpreting our Constitution and statutes. She also said ``I share \nmore the\n\n[[Page S7083]]\n\nideas of Justice Ginsburg in thinking, in believing that unless \nAmerican courts are more open to discussing the ideas raised by foreign \ncases, and by international cases, that we are going to lose influence \nin the world.''\n  Similarly, Ms. Elena Kagan asserted that ``it may be proper for \njudges to consider foreign law sources in ruling on constitutional \nquestions.'' She further stated that judges can get ``good ideas'' from \nthe decisions of foreign courts. For this reason among others, I \nopposed both Supreme Court nominees.\n  Even lower court nominees, such as Third Circuit Judge Thomas \nVanaskie, have embraced the trend. In his testimony, Judge Vanaskie \nimplied that he believed the Supreme Court used foreign law correctly \nin the much criticized cases of Lawrence v Texas and Roper v Simmons, \nand said the ``opinions of international tribunals and foreign courts \nmay be relevant'' when interpreting our Constitution. Because of his \nstatements on the use of foreign law and his expansive view of the \ncommerce clause, I opposed his nomination.\n  Looking to foreign law is a tool of activist judges who seek to reach \nthe outcomes they desire, based on their personal sympathies and \nprejudices, rather than on the law. As Justice Antonin Scalia aptly \ndescribed it, the Court is merely ``look[ing] over the heads of the \ncrowd and pick[ing] out its friends.'' Further, judges who do so \nviolate their judicial oath. A circuit court judge must swear to \n``faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties \nincumbent upon her as a judge under the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States.'' The oath requires our judges to evaluate cases based \non U.S. laws and the U.S. Constitution, not the decisions of foreign \ncountries who do not treasure the same liberties and fundamental \nfreedoms enshrined in our Constitution. The decisions of foreign \ncountries should have no bearing on an American judge's decisions.\n  This progressive trend of looking to foreign law is deeply disturbing \nand is something I hope my colleagues will consider when voting on this \nnomination and the administration will consider when nominating \nindividuals in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7083-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                IRON COUNTY COURTHOUSE 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow Missourians, I \nextend my warmest congratulations to the citizens of Iron County and \nIronton upon their celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Iron \nCounty Courthouse.\n  Courthouses like the one in Iron County symbolize the basis of \nAmerica's freedoms: a fair and independent judiciary. America is a \nnation based on laws and not men.\n  While it is not perfect, to be sure, our system of justice makes it \npossible for all Americans to live in relative peace and prosperity \nmost of the time.\n  The Iron County Courthouse has long stood as a mark of this \ncommunity's history. The county from which the courthouse takes its \nnamesake was originally established from portions of the counties of \nSt. Francois, Madison, Washington, Dent, Reynolds, and Wayne by an act \nof the legislature approved February 17, 1857. According to county \nrecords, the Iron County Courthouse was the product of an order which \ncalled for the construction of a courthouse and the issuing of county \nbonds, bearing 10 percent interest, for $10,000. The courthouse's \ncornerstone was laid on July 4, 1858, and the structure was completed \njust 2 years later in October 1860.\n  In its 150-year history, the Iron County Courthouse has been the site \nof countless hearings and trials in addition to serving as the home of \ncounty offices ranging from soil and water to university extensions. \nThe circuit court for Iron County was organized on May 16, 1858, by \nJudge John H. Stone. In September 1864, during the Civil War, the \ncourthouse received damage in the Battle of Pilot Knob.\n  The courthouse has been featured on the cover of several local and \nregional publications and, even more notably, has earned the honor of \ninclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.\n  We recognize the important role the courthouse has played in Iron \nCounty's history and congratulate local residents on its 150th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7083-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING JANET FAIRBANKS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to offer a few words \nin memory of Janet Fairbanks, a California regional planner who passed \naway last month in her beloved hometown of San Diego.\n  Janet Fairbanks was a visionary planner who brought people and \ncommunities together to plan for sensible, sustainable growth while \nprotecting the natural environment.\n  From 1980 until her retirement in 2006, Ms. Fairbanks helped guide \nthe development of growth management and habitat conservation plans, \nfirst at the city of San Diego and later at the San Diego Association \nof Governments, SANDAG. Along with her technical skills and expertise, \nJanet was known for her outstanding ability to educate public officials \nand a wide array of stakeholders about the virtues of smart growth, \nconservation, and biodiversity--and then to bring these often divergent \nindividuals and groups together to create plans that enabled \ncommunities to grow and thrive while preserving San Diego County's \nunique natural areas and resources.\n  As a longtime member of the California Planning Roundtable, Ms. \nFairbanks brought city and regional planners together with \nconservationists to protect some of California's most precious and \nendangered natural areas. And as an active member of the California \nBiodiversity Council, she brought a planner's comprehensive perspective \nto the Council's mission of protecting California's fragile \nbiodiversity.\n  Janet Fairbanks helped to make San Diego County a nationally \nrecognized leader in regional planning and conservation. She will be \nsorely missed, but her work and legacy will live on in the beautiful \ncommunities she helped to create and the natural landscapes she helped \nto preserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7083-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ARKANSAS'S ``BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS''\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I recognize four Arkansas \nschools that were recently designated as ``National Blue Ribbon \nSchools'' by the U.S. Department of Education. These schools represent \nthe best of our State, and I am proud to congratulate them on this \nsignificant achievement.\n  Arkansas's Blue Ribbon Schools for 2010 are Arnold Drive Elementary \nSchool in Jacksonville, Calico Rock Elementary School in Calico Rock, \nKingston Elementary School in Kingston and Salem Elementary School in \nSalem.\n  The national Blue Ribbon designation honors public and private \nelementary, middle and high schools whose students achieve at very high \nlevels or have made significant progress and helped close gaps in \nachievement, especially among disadvantaged and minority students. \nNationally, 254 public and 50 private schools received the designation.\n  I commend Arkansas's Blue Ribbon Schools for their extraordinary \nefforts helping students receive a high-quality education and reach \ntheir full potential. Education is key to a bright future, and I am \nproud of these schools for encouraging students to achieve their dreams \nand goals through a high-quality education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7083-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7083-S7084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING ARKANSAS'S WORLD WAR II HONOR FLIGHT VETERANS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I recognize more than 80 \nArkansas World War II veterans who will travel to Washington, DC, this \nweekend to visit the national World War II Memorial and other memorials \ndedicated in their honor.\n  The group is traveling as a part of the second Northwest Arkansas \nHonor Flight. They will fly free of charge from Northwest Arkansas \nRegional Airport to Washington, DC, and back. Without the efforts of \nthe Northwest Arkansas Honor Flight program, many of these veterans \nwould never be able to visit our Nation's military memorials, including \nthe World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo Jima memorials, and Arlington \nNational Cemetery.\n  This year's veterans range in age from 88 to 98 and include four \nwomen\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\nwho served in the military during World War II. They will receive cards \nand letters of appreciation from local school groups and other members \nof the community. To date, more than 700 cards and letters from the \nnorthwest Arkansas community have been collected.\n  In Arkansas, there are approximately 26,714 living World War II \nveterans, and each one has a heroic tale. World War II was one of \nAmerica's greatest triumphs, but was also a conflict filled with \nindividual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 million people worldwide \nwere killed, including more than 35 million civilians, and more than \n400,000 American servicemembers. The ultimate victory is a testament to \nthe valor of American soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.\n  I salute these World War II veterans, along with all of our 260,000 \nArkansas veterans. My father and both grandfathers served our Nation in \nuniform and taught me from an early age about the sacrifices our troops \nand their families make to keep our Nation free. All of our veterans--\nfrom the greatest generation to Vietnam war veterans to the new \ngeneration of servicemembers in the Middle East and across the globe--\nhave sacrificed greatly on behalf of our country. I thank them for \ntheir service and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7084-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FORT SMITH'S RIVERFRONT BLUES FESTIVAL\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

More than 600 events competed for inclusion on the \n2011 list. This year marks Fort Smith's first appearance on the list.\n  Riverfront Blues Fest will celebrate its 21st year in 2011, and is \nknown as ``The Best Little Bluesfest in America.'' The festival draws \nthousands of music lovers to enjoy top musical talent on the banks of \nthe Arkansas River on two summer nights.\n  Fort Smith Riverfront Blues Fest's entry in the 2011 Top 100 Events \nin North America reads:\n\n       The Fort Smith Riverfront Blues Fest is the premier blues \n     event on the Arkansas River. It's big enough to draw national \n     and international musical talent, yet intimate that you don't \n     have to fight the crowds to enjoy the music. Set on the banks \n     of the Arkansas at Fort Smith Riverpark, this blues festival \n     brings people from several states to enjoy two low-cost \n     nights of family entertainment. Because the festival gets \n     started after 4 p.m., this leaves plenty of time to see the \n     sights in and around historic Fort Smith.\n\n  Two other Arkansas events made the 2011 Top 100 Events list: the \nWorld's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade in Hot Springs and the \nArkansas Trail of Holiday Lights, which occurs in 60 communities across \nthe state, including Fort Smith.\n  I congratulate all of these Arkansas events and communities for \npreserving and promoting the history and heritage of our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7084-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING KELD RADIO\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

My \nheart goes out to his family, friends, and loved ones, and I pray for \nthem as they mourn this loss. They can be proud of the legacy that \nJefferson has left behind for our State and Nation.\n  A member of the ``Little Rock Nine,'' Jefferson bravely stood up for \nwhat he believed was right, at a time when it wasn't easy or popular to \nbreak against convention. His courage set an example for future \ngenerations, who learned that education and equality go hand in hand. \nHis desire to follow his educational dreams inspired countless \nArkansans and Americans, and we all suffer his loss.\n  Throughout his life, Jefferson was committed to service. He bravely \nserved his country in the U.S. Army from 1966 to 1968 as a staff \nsergeant and an infantry squad leader in Vietnam. He later worked as an \naccounting clerk with the U.S. Department of Defense.\n  According to those who knew him best, Jefferson's humor and light \nheart helped fellow members of the Little Rock Nine stay strong as they \npursued their studies. Jefferson maintained that strong sense of humor \neven in his final days.\n  Arkansas has lost a cherished member of its community. Jefferson \nrepresents the best of our State, and our world is a better place \nbecause of his courageous actions and commitment to equality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7085-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 3772.

A bill to establish a building efficiency retrofit loan \ncredit support program, a State building revolving fund grant program, \nand a commercial and large building grant program; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President. I rise today to join with my colleague \nand fellow member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nSenator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, to introduce the Recovery Through \nBuilding Renovation Act of 2010.\n  There is enormous potential to reduce our nation's energy consumption \nand create jobs by investing in energy efficiency, especially through \nrenovating existing buildings.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, buildings account \nfor more than 48 percent of total energy consumption in the United \nStates. That is more than transportation sector and more than the \nindustrial sector. More than 70 percent of the commercial buildings in \nthis country are older than 20 years and these buildings are \nsignificantly less efficient than buildings built today. Improvements \nto these types of buildings can improve efficiency by 20 to 40 percent \nusing widely available technologies and the payback period can be as \nlittle 5 years.\n  These investments in building efficiency pay for themselves and then \nsome.\n  Most importantly, Senator Landrieu and I view this legislation as \npart of our broader effort here to create jobs and contribute to our \neconomic recovery.\n  Updating buildings with modern energy efficiency technologies not \nonly saves money on energy costs, it also creates jobs. Jobs in the \nconstruction industry. Jobs in the manufacturing industry. Jobs in the \nretail sector of the economy. These jobs can't be outsourced and they \nare jobs that can serve as an important part of our clean, alternative \nenergy economy.\n  Yet despite all this potential, there is actually very little of this \nenergy efficient renovation taking place because of financial barriers. \nMost commercial buildings are leased and investments in energy \nefficiency by building owners are uncertain because the tenant, not the \nowner, will capture the energy savings. This is often referred to as a \n``split incentive.'' Likewise, lenders typically will not accept \nprojected energy savings--even if guaranteed by an energy services \ncompany--as sufficient collateral to finance a building renovation.\n  Our legislation would use the DOE loan guarantee program to help \nunlock private capital and encourage investment in building retrofit \nprojects and programs.\n  The Recovery Through Building Renovation Act expands the existing DOE \nloan guarantee program to cover buildings in the commercial and \nindustrial sectors, in schools and universities, and hospitals so that \nthey can be renovated to be more energy efficient.\n  Our legislation also establishes a competitive grant program within \nDOE to allow states to capitalize revolving loan funds to renovate \nmunicipal buildings. This program is modeled after the highly \nsuccessful Texas LoanSTAR program. Finally, it also establishes a DOE \ngrant program to capitalize loan loss reserve funds for tax-district \nfinancing programs, such as property assessed clean energy, or ``PACE'' \nprograms, which a number of states are utilizing.\n  There is so much potential that exists here and I think we need to \nput existing programs to work, like the loan guarantee program, to \nunlock private capital and reap the benefits that will come from making \nthese buildings more energy efficient.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support our legislation.\n  Mr. President, 1 ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3780\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 618\n\n       Whereas, according to a report by WorldatWork, a nonprofit \n     professional association with expertise in attracting, \n     motivating, and retaining employees, the quality of workers' \n     jobs and the supportiveness of their workplaces are key \n     predictors of workers' job productivity, job satisfaction, \n     and commitment to employers and of employers' ability to \n     retain workers;\n       Whereas, according to the 2008 National Study of Employers \n     by the Families and Work Institute, employees in more \n     flexible and supportive workplaces are more effective \n     employees, are more highly engaged and less likely to look \n     for a new job in the next year, and enjoy better overall \n     health, better mental health, and lower levels of stress than \n     employees in workplaces that provide less flexibility and \n     support;\n       Whereas, according to a 2004 report of the Families and \n     Work Institute entitled ``Overwork in America'', employees \n     who are able to effectively balance family and work \n     responsibilities are less likely to report making mistakes or \n     feel resentment toward employers and coworkers;\n       Whereas, according to the ``Best Places to Work in the \n     Federal Government'' rankings released by the Partnership for \n     Public Service and American University's Institute for the \n     Study of Public Policy Implementation, work-life balance and \n     a family-friendly culture are among the key drivers of \n     engagement and satisfaction for employees in the Federal \n     workforce;\n       Whereas, according to a 2009 survey of college students by \n     the Partnership for Public Service and Universum USA entitled \n     ``Great Expectations! What Students Want in an Employer and \n     How Federal Agencies Can Deliver It'', attaining a healthy \n     work-life balance was an important career goal of 66 percent \n     of the students surveyed;\n       Whereas a 2008 study by the Partnership for Public Service \n     entitled ``A Golden Opportunity: Recruiting Baby Boomers into \n     Government'' revealed that workers between the ages of 50 and \n     65 are a strong source of experienced talent for the Federal \n     workforce and that nearly 50 percent of workers in that age \n     group find flexible work schedules ``extremely appealing'';\n       Whereas finding a good work-life balance is important to \n     workers in multiple generations;\n       Whereas employees who are able to effectively balance \n     family and work responsibilities tend to feel healthier and \n     more successful in their relationships with their spouses, \n     children, and friends;\n       Whereas 85 percent of wage and salaried workers in the \n     United States have immediate, day-to-day family \n     responsibilities outside of their jobs;\n       Whereas, in 2000, research by the Radcliffe Public Policy \n     Center revealed that men in their 20s and 30s and women in \n     their 20s, 30s, and 40s identified a work schedule that \n     allows them to spend time with their families as the most \n     important job characteristic for them;\n       Whereas, according to the 2006 American Community Survey by \n     the United States Census Bureau, 47 percent of wage and \n     salaried workers in the United States are parents with \n     children under the age of 18 who live with them at least \n     half-time;\n       Whereas job flexibility often allows parents to be more \n     involved in their children's lives and research demonstrates \n     that parental involvement is associated with children's \n     higher achievement in language and mathematics, improved \n     behavior, greater academic persistence, and lower dropout \n     rates;\n       Whereas the 2000 Urban Working Families study demonstrated \n     that a lack of job flexibility for working parents negatively \n     affects children's health in ways that range from children \n     being unable to make needed doctors' appointments to children \n     receiving inadequate early care, leading to more severe and \n     prolonged illness;\n       Whereas, from 2001 to the beginning of 2008, 1,700,000 \n     active duty troops served in Iraq and 600,000 members of the \n     National Guard and Reserve (133,000 on more than one tour) \n     were called up to serve in Iraq;\n       Whereas, because so many of those troops and National Guard \n     and Reserve members have families, there needs to be a focus \n     on policies and programs that can help military families \n     adjust to the realities that come with having a family member \n     in the military;\n       Whereas research by the Sloan Center for Aging and Work \n     reveals that the majority of workers aged 53 and older \n     attribute their success as an employee by a great or moderate \n     extent to having access to flexibility in their jobs and that \n     the majority of those workers also report that, to a great \n     extent, flexibility options contribute to an overall higher \n     quality of life;\n       Whereas studies show that \\1/3\\ of children and adolescents \n     in the United States are obese or overweight, and healthy \n     lifestyle habits, including healthy eating and physical \n     activity, can lower the risk of becoming obese and developing \n     related diseases;\n       Whereas studies report that family rituals, such as sitting \n     down to dinner together and sharing activities on weekends \n     and holidays, positively influence children's health and \n     development and that children who eat dinner with their \n     families every day consume nearly a full serving more of \n     fruits and vegetables per day than those who never eat dinner \n     with their families or do so only occasionally;\n       Whereas unpaid family caregivers will likely continue to be \n     the largest source of long-term care services in the United \n     States for the elderly;\n       Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services \n     anticipates that by 2050 the number of such caregivers will \n     reach 37,000,000, an increase of 85 percent from 2000, as \n     baby boomers reach retirement age in record numbers; and\n       Whereas the month of October is an appropriate month to \n     designate as ``National Work and Family Month'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2010 as ``National Work and Family \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of work schedules that allow \n     employees to spend time with their families to job \n     productivity and to healthy families;\n       (3) urges public officials, employers, employees, and the \n     general public to work together to achieve more balance \n     between work and family; and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Work and Family Month with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7094-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 619--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n   SENATE OF EACH NEW CONGRESS IS NOT BOUND BY THE RULES OF PREVIOUS \n                                SENATES\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico submitted the following resolution;

Res. 620\n\n       Whereas negative images, stories, and influences in the \n     day-to-day lives of Americans can detrimentally affect their \n     emotional well-being, interactions with others, and general \n     demeanor;\n       Whereas a group of teenagers participating in a leadership \n     forum at Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas, identified a \n     lack of encouragement as one of the greatest problems facing \n     young people today;\n       Whereas the youth of our Nation need guidance, inspiration, \n     and reassurance to counteract this negativity and to develop \n     the qualities of character essential for future leadership in \n     our country;\n       Whereas a National Day of Encouragement would serve as a \n     reminder to counterbalance and overcome negative influences, \n     and would also provide much-needed encouragement and support \n     to others;\n       Whereas following the events of September 11, 2001, \n     thousands of people of the United States made sacrifices in \n     order to bring help and healing to the victims and their \n     families, inspiring and encouraging the Nation; and\n       Whereas the renewed feelings of unity, hope, selflessness, \n     and encouragement that began on September 12, 2001, are the \n     same feelings that the National Day of Encouragement is meant \n     to recapture and spread: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 12, 2010, as ``National Day of \n     Encouragement'';\n       (2) acknowledges the importance of encouragement and \n     positive influences in the lives of all people; and\n       (3) urges the people of the United States to encourage \n     others, whether it be through an act of service, a thoughtful \n     letter, or words of kindness and inspiration, and to thereby \n     boost the morale of all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "14", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/14/senate-section/article/S7096-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2010\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.
