Mr. President, many Americans are fortunate to have health \ninsurance to help them pay for their prescriptions, treatments, or even \ndoctor visits. Like any kind of insurance, we hope we never have to use \nit, but it is comforting to know it is there. But what happens if the \nsystem designed to give us that sense of security and stability is not \nitself secure or stable? Where does one turn when that certainty is \ntaken away? That is the fear too many middle-class families in America \nhave. They see the jobs around them disappear. For some, one of those \njobs may be their own job. They see their paychecks get smaller, or \nthey struggle each week because that paycheck simply does not go far \nenough. They may have insurance today, but they don't know if they will \nbe able to say the same tomorrow.\n  Too many families in the greatest country and the largest economy in \nthe world, by far, live just one illness or one accident or one pink \nslip away from losing that sense of security--their health insurance.\n  Far too many families have to make a decision when their children get \nsick: Do they buy them new school supplies or do they buy them clothes? \nDo they buy some extra groceries for the family or are they going to be \nable to take them to the doctor? As I say, do they get them new clothes \nwhen they grow out of their old ones or do they get the treatment they \nneed to stay healthy or even to get healthy? Far too many hard-working \nAmericans have to make a choice when their doctor gives them a \nprescription for chronic illness, or what insurance companies like to \ncall a preexisting condition. Do they get that medicine or do they add \nthat little piece of paper to a top of a mounting pile of bills they \ncannot afford to pay?\n  What about small businesses, those entrepreneurs in big cities and \nsmall towns that innovate, invent, and fuel our economy? They do have a \nchoice to make. Do they hire new employees? Do they lay off more hard-\nworking Americans or do they just simply cancel their health insurance \nfor their employees because it is too expensive? Businessmen and \nbusinesswomen do not have a lack of insurance because they are cheap or \nthey do not care about their employees, they do not have health \ninsurance because they cannot afford it. It is too expensive.\n  Taking your child to the doctor, filling a prescription, and giving \nyour workers health insurance should not have to be choices. They \nshould not end in question marks. That is exactly why we are working to \nbring stability and security back to health care. Health care reform \nmeans making sure every American can afford access and care. Reform \nmeans making sure that if you lose your job, your health care will not \ngo with the job you have lost. It means if you change jobs, your health \ncare stays with you. Reforming health care means that if your mother \nhad breast cancer or you had minor surgery last year or your kid gets \nallergies every spring, your insurance company cannot say: I am sorry, \nyou are just too much of a risk for us to\n\n[[Page S7334]]\n\ncover anymore. Health care reform means lowering the cost of care and \nkeeping it low. It means improving the quality of care you get and \nkeeping the quality high. It means that premiums you pay every month \nwill not go up just because your insurance company feels as if they \nshould.\n  Senator Patty Murray of Washington told a story. I was at an event \nwith her yesterday. She got up yesterday morning to find in the \nWashington press an insurance company that insures 135,000 \nWashingtonians will have a 17.5-percent increase immediately in their \nhealth insurance premiums. That is an average. Some are higher, some \nare lower. Reform means the premiums you pay every month will not go up \njust because your insurance company feels like it. It means keeping \ncosts stable so the price of staying healthy does not fluctuate like a \ngallon of gas. It not only means making sure you can keep going to your \nfamily doctor or keep your health care plan if you like it but also \nthat you can afford to do so.\n  No one can predict when the next accident might come, when one might \nget laid off. We don't know when we will get sick or when one of our \nloved ones will get sick. But we can put people in control of their own \nhealth care.\n  A doctor's first job when someone comes into the emergency room is to \nstabilize the patient. When it comes to addressing the emergency care \nin our health system, our job is to do the same--stabilize it. We have \nto cure the uncertainty in health care. We must fix our broken health \ncare system so that when you open your medicine cabinet, you can be \ncertain the prescription you need to get better will be there. When you \nopen your wallet, you should be certain you can afford to go to the \ndoctor. And when you open that small business in your hometown, you can \nbe certain you can hire employees to grow your company, put your ideas \ninto motion, realize your American dream, and have your employees \ncovered with health insurance.\n  The status quo is ruining our country's financial stability. Right \nnow, one-sixth of every dollar spent in America goes for health care. \nIf we do not change this, by the year 2020--that is a little over 10 \nyears away--it will be 35 cents of every dollar spent will be on health \ncare. It will bankrupt our country. We must change this.\n\n  I ask my Republican colleagues: Let's not make this a partisan issue. \nLet's work together. That is why I so appreciated a number of valiant \nRepublicans on the Finance Committee working together to try to come up \nwith a health care plan that can be supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate. We can do it alone. Democrats can do it \nalone. We do not want to do it alone because it would be under \nsomething we call reconciliation, and it changes the rules. And instead \nof being able to do a large amount of health care, we are only going to \nbe able to do a little health care. We want to work with our Republican \ncolleagues. This is not a partisan issue. People losing their health \ncare are not Democrats, Republicans, or Independents; they are \nAmericans, whether from the State of Oregon or the State of Nevada.\n  The Presiding Officer represents the State of Oregon. There is \nextremely high unemployment in Oregon, higher than in Nevada, and we \nare over 11 percent. In 1 month, we went from 10.4 percent to 11.3 \npercent unemployment. So the people losing their jobs, losing their \nhealth care in Oregon and Nevada and all the rest of the States are not \npartisans. They want something done to restore their jobs, to get them \nnew jobs, and to give them health insurance, if they do not have it, \nand make sure it is not taken away from them.\n  I reach out to my Republican colleagues to join with us in this \nnecessity of doing something about health care. This is not something \nwe are looking for work to do. We are doing it because it is absolutely \nessential. Right now, I repeat, one-sixth of every dollar spent goes to \nhealth care in America. If we do not change this, in just a few years \nit will be 35 cents of every dollar. We cannot sustain that.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding you are going to open morning \nbusiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/10/senate-section/article/S7334-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to note, in the context of my \nremarks, the announcement yesterday that the deficit for the first 9 \nmonths of this year is now $1.1 trillion, headed for, at the end of \nthis year, $1.8 trillion, perhaps the highest percentage of GDP in the \nhistory of this country outside of wartime. We are now in the process \nof adding amendment after amendment in the HELP Committee without any \nidea of the cost. As one of my colleagues who proposed a massive \nexpansion of women's health care yesterday said in the committee: It is \nnot the cost that is important; it is the cause. A remarkable approach \nto the fact that we are mortgaging our children and grandchildren's \nfutures in a fashion which is the commission of generational theft.\n  Chairman Dodd received a new score on his bill last week by hiding \nthe real cost of the bill. A few weeks ago, the preliminary cost was \nover $1 trillion. Now it is at $900 billion--same bill, just different \nnumbers. On the one hand, we are told reform is urgent and, at the same \ntime, they don't implement the bill for 4 years; conveniently, after \nthe next Presidential election. Then they will tax employers with a \njob-killing employer health mandate, collect $52 billion from small \nemployers, the engine that will take us out of our recession. Nobody \ndisagrees about the role of small business in our economy. Then this \nlatest proposal hides the cost of the additional hundreds of billions \nof dollars of Medicaid expansion.\n  The State of California is offering IOUs to pay their bills. They \nhave a $26 billion deficit. We are going to increase Medicaid's burden \non the States to the tune, in the case of California, of several more \nbillion dollars. How are they going to pay for it? It is an impossible \ntask.\n  I am told that is not about the cost, but it is about the cost. Just \nas the stimulus package was about the cost, just as the continued \nbailout of industries such as the automotive industry, banks, financial \ninstitutions and anybody who is ``too big to fail,'' when small \nbusiness people all over America are closing their doors because they \nare too small to save.\n  For the first 9 months, the deficit is $1.1 trillion. That is $800 \nbillion greater than the deficit recorded last year. The American \npeople have a right to know what this health care bill will cost, what \nit will cost now and what it will cost our grandchildren.\n  The Washington Post today tells us how not to reform health care, in \nopposing the government insurance President Obama now says is so \ncritical. According to today's Washington Post:\n\n     . . . it would be tragic if this issue were to drag down \n     health reform or make it impossible to secure Republican \n     votes. Restructuring the health-care system is risky enough \n     that Democrats would be wise not to try to accomplish it \n     entirely on their own.\n\n  I certainly hope my friends on the other side of the aisle pay \nattention to that comment. It has turned into a partisan effort, and it \nis too bad.\n  From today's Wall Street Journal, ``Democrats Hoodwinked the Health \nLobby. Americans's health-care CEOs are being taken for a ride by \nCongress and their own lobbyists.''\n  It is a very interesting article by Kimberly Strassel.\n\n       The industry's calculation is that by cutting deals, it can \n     set the terms of its contributions to ``reform'' and even \n     wangle upsides. The insurers came first, promising to squeeze \n     $2 trillion in costs out of the system. Democrats are letting \n     Ms. Ignagni believe\n\n[[Page S7335]]\n\n     that in return she will get a mandate to require all \n     Americans to carry insurance (which her members will supply) \n     and be spared a public option (which would decimate her \n     industry).\n\n  It goes on to talk about Mr. Tauzin who:\n\n     . . . came along pledging that drug makers would cough up $80 \n     billion to narrow a gap in Medicare drug coverage. He's been \n     led to think that Washington will forgo its plans to allow \n     drug reimportation or give him a hand on generics.\n\n  The word is that the administration is now saying drug reimportation \nis not important, in exchange for this deal with Mr. Tauzin. How \nunsavory is that. Drug reimportation will save the American people $50 \nbillion a year. It is a fact. PhRMA, the large prescription drug \nlobby--a very powerful one here in our Nation's capital--in return for \nsaying they will save $80 billion, the administration in return will \ngive up their support for what would save the American people $50 \nbillion, when the $80 billion they are talking about is purely \nillusory, to say the least.\n  The Wall Street Journal article goes on to say:\n\n       Democrats have complemented their smiling encouragements \n     with behind-the-scene threats. After retaking the House in \n     2006, the party made clear that companies that did not hire \n     Democratic lobbyists would not get a hearing in Washington. \n     The ruling party is now seeing the fruits of its bullying. \n     These days a meeting of health-care lobbyists is better \n     described as a reunion of Senate finance Chairman Max \n     Baucus's former aides. Health-care lobbying has been turned \n     on its head: The new cabal of Democratic lobbyists does not \n     exist to protect the industry from Congress. It exists to \n     present Democratic ultimatums to business.\n       When Senate Republicans last month hosted a meeting to \n     discuss reform ideas, Mr. Baucus's office called in a block \n     of these Democratic lobbyists to deliver a message. ``They \n     said, 'Republicans are having this meeting and you need to \n     let all of your clients know if they have someone there, that \n     will be viewed as a hostile act,'' reported one attendee to \n     the Baucus caucus.\n\n  Interesting.\n\n       All these actions--the White House meetings, the strung-out \n     negotiations, the muzzling--have been taken with one aim: To \n     buy silence. President Barack Obama is committed to a public \n     option. Liberal Democrats intend to make the private sector \n     fund their plans. They figure by the time they drop a bill \n     that contains odius elements, it'll be too late for any \n     industry player--big or small--to cut a Harry & Louise ad.\n       Industry players this week got a glimpse of how they will \n     be treated. House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman \n     dismissed the $80 billion drug deal, claiming it did not have \n     House support, and moreover that the White House ``told us \n     they are not bound to that agreement.''\n       The question is just how long it is going to take for \n     America's health-care CEOs to realize they are being taken \n     for a ride both by Congress and their own lobbyists. \n     Americans are wary enough about ObamaCare to maybe appreciate \n     some straight talk from corporate America. If only corporate \n     America can find the smarts to give it.\n\n  The debate and discussion continues in the House and the Senate. They \nstill haven't found a way to pay for the health care reforms they want \nto make. It is still around a trillion dollars. We hear everything from \na 10-cent tax on soft drinks to the employer benefit proposal which was \nso strongly derided and attacked during the last campaign. So far we \nare talking about laying another trillion or two of debt on the \nAmerican people, in addition to the $1.8 trillion deficit we have \nalready amassed this year.\n  Again, I urge colleagues and the administration to sit down in true \nnegotiations, in bipartisan fashion together, and maybe we can solve \nthis issue. We all know the quality of health care in America is the \nhighest in the world. But the costs of health care in America and the \ninflation associated with it are something we must address so that \nhealth care is affordable and available to all Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this week Congress is deciding whether to \nbroaden access to affordable generic drugs for millions of Americans. \nAs we all argue our points, it is important to remember what this issue \nis all about. Broadening access to generic drugs is not about \nRepublicans or Democrats. It is not even about the drug companies, the \nbiologic makers, or the other pharmaceutical companies. It is about men \nand women in my State and the State of the Presiding Officer and around \nthe country. Broadening access to generic drugs is about the 192,370 \nnew cases of breast cancer that will be diagnosed in American women \nthis year, and the $48,000 average annually is what it will cost to \ntreat their disease with the biologic drug Herceptin, $48,000 annually. \nThis is about the 1.3 million adults affected by rheumatoid arthritis \neach year and the $2,000 average annually it cost to treat their \ndifficult disease with the biologic drug Remicade. Broadening access to \ngenerics is about the 148,610 men and women diagnosed with colon cancer \neach year and the $100,000 it costs them each year to treat the disease \nwith the biologic drug Avastin.\n  Let me mention a few other noteworthy numbers: $1.2 billion \nrepresents the average cost to develop a new biotech product; this \nincludes research and development and the costs lost to products that \nnever make it to market. It is not just $1.2 billion for the product \nitself that makes it to market. It is about the false starts and \nincludes all that too. Continuing, $9.2 billion represents the 2008 \nsales of Genentech's biologic colon cancer treatment Avastin. I said it \ncost $100,000 per patient to treat with that drug. Eight billion \nrepresents the 2008 sales of Amgen's biologic arthritis treatment \nEnbrel. Finally, $7 million represents how much money PhRMA spent in \nthe first 3 months of 2009 to lobby Congress; $7 million to lobby \nCongress in the first 3 months of this year. That is before we started \nthe most intense part of working on this bill.\n  I encourage colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep all of \nthese numbers in mind as we go through the debate this week and next \nweek--the numbers of patients who depend on these drugs, the cost to \nthe patients one by one by one for each of these drugs, the amount of \nmoney the drug companies, the biologic companies have made on these \ndrugs, and the amount of money they are spending lobbying Congress to \nhave their way on these issues.\n  Countless Americans cannot afford expensive brandname drugs, known as \nbiologics. These drugs provide promise and hope--and we are very \nindebted to these companies for developing these drugs; they clearly \nsave lives--these drugs provide promise and hope to those suffering \nfrom devastating diseases and chronic illnesses, including cancer, \nParkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and MS.\n  For example, annual treatment for breast cancer with the biologic \ndrug Herceptin costs $48,000 a year. The annual treatment for \nrheumatoid arthritis with Remicade, as I said, costs approximately \n$20,000 a year. These drugs are simply too expensive for so many people \nto afford.\n  The average household income in Ohio for 2007 was $46,597. For the \npatient who cannot afford a treatment, it does not matter if it is a \nbreakthrough and it does not matter if it is lifesaving, he or she \nsimply cannot afford it.\n  There is currently--to put this in context--no FDA approval process \nfor biogenerics, biologic generic equivalents, comparable to the \nprocess that enables generic drugs to compete against their brandname \ncounterparts.\n  We all have seen the money you can save when you go to your doctor \nfor a typical drug that has a generic substitute. It is the same drug \nwith the same active ingredients, and a physician will encourage their \npatient to buy the generic equivalent. That is true for the chemical \ndrugs we have had for many years. It is not true for the biologics. \nThere is no generic equivalent. There is no pathway allowed for \ngenerics to compete against the biologics.\n  Absent that process, there is no free market exerting downward \npressure on biologic prices, so prices remain high, so prices remain \n$20,000 a year or sometimes as high as $7,000 or $8,000 a month for \nsome of these biologics.\n\n[[Page S7336]]\n\n  That is the problem in a nutshell, but behind it--this is all talking \npublic policy up here--but behind it, underneath it, are the lives of \nhundreds of thousands of Americans, situations in which Americans \ncannot afford treatments that prevent disability and, in some cases, \nprevent death.\n  Early this year, Ohio representatives from the Arthritis Foundation \nvisited my office to talk about soaring health care costs and the \nlimitations of our current system. These individuals spoke of extreme \nand prolonged physical pain, pain that could be alleviated if only the \ntreatments existed--which they do--and only if they were affordable--\nwhich too often they are not.\n  Biologics provide great promise and hope to those suffering from \ndevastating diseases and chronic illnesses. But absent competition, \nabsent what we call follow-on biologics, absent a generic substitute to \ncompete--but absent competition--countless Americans will be unable to \nbenefit from these medicines.\n  It would be irresponsible on our part not to pursue a safe and \nefficient path to biogenerics. And it would be irresponsible on our \npart to pursue a pathway that allows for over a decade of monopoly \nprotections for brandname products.\n  We did not do that with the generic drugs, the so-called Hatch-Waxman \nbill, which everyone in this body is familiar with. Most people at home \naround our country--most people in Toledo and Akron and Cincinnati and \nDayton and Springfield and Mansfield--have benefited from Hatch-Waxman, \nthe generic drug law, which cut prices for brandname drugs 50, 60, 70, \n80 percent. But you cannot do that with biologics because we have not \nwritten the law to open up the process to allow follow-on biologics, to \nallow generic biologics, to allow competition in the system.\n  But next week, as the Presiding Officer knows, in the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, we have the opportunity to \nmake affordable generic drugs more accessible for our seniors, more \naccessible for our Nation's middle class, more accessible for the \nhundreds of thousands--no, the millions--of Americans who are suffering \nfrom these diseases. But so many of them are unable to afford these \nexpensive biologics.\n  Health care reform must broaden access to generic alternatives to \nbiologics, the most expensive kinds of prescription drugs. Failing to \ndo so is not just bad policy, bad public policy; failing to do so means \nwe are letting down millions of our sickest citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, late last week, media reports heralded \nthe decrease in the pricetag of the HELP Committee's health care \nproposal. But I would suggest that before we uncork the champagne, \nbefore we celebrate a great accomplishment, let's study more closely \nthe untold story. I believe we will find accounting gymnastics that \nhave been employed.\n  While the headlines may have touted a HELP Committee bill that scored \nat $611 billion over 10 years, the real pricetag, when fully \nimplemented, actually totals about $2 trillion.\n  That is a big darn difference. An almost $1.5 trillion discrepancy \nsimply cannot be swept under the rug. It is too big to be a rounding \nerror--even in the Federal Government--and too much of a budget buster \nto be ignored. So where is the difference?\n  First, the Congressional Budget Office assumes it will take the \nFederal bureaucrats over 4 years to get the government-run health care \nand other subsidies up and running. So while the $611 billion score \nclaims to be a 10-year number, essentially it only covers 6 years of \nthe costs.\n  If you look at the CBO score for the first 10 years after the program \nis fully implemented, the actual spending is closer to $1.5 trillion. \nIn addition, while the press releases were claiming credit for \nincreased insurance coverage, they were actually leaving out what it \nactually cost to make that happen.\n  That euphoric claim that 97 percent of Americans would be covered \nunder the HELP proposal is not even in the HELP Committee proposal. \nOnly in Washington can you assume something to be, take credit for the \naccomplishment, and then not pay the bill.\n  The 97-percent statistic is based on an assumption. The assumption is \nthat Medicaid will be expanded up to 150 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel. This expansion is estimated to bring 20 million new people into \na government-run health care plan.\n  However, CBO estimates that it will cost around $500 billion over 10 \nyears. Nowhere is that cost yet considered. And this is only the \nFederal share of the program. It does not take into account the State \ntaxes that will need to be raised in order for each State to pay its \nshare of this bill.\n\n[[Page S7337]]\n\n  At one point, I was a Governor. In my own State of Nebraska, this \nexpansion will cost the State taxpayers $73 million a year when they \nhave to assume the costs of the program. That is a lot of money to come \nup with in these tough economic times.\n  The American people, I believe, deserve more than budgetary tricks. \nLet's be honest about what we are trying to do here, and let's be very \ncandid with people about the real costs, the fully implemented costs of \nthe program. Let's also be very upfront about the realities of what a \ngovernment-run program can or cannot accomplish in actually bringing \ndown health care costs.\n  Some claim that a government-run plan will serve as competition for \nprivate insurance and, thus, will bring down the cost of those \ninsurance premiums. However, the CBO score makes it clear that if a \ngovernment-run plan competes on a truly level playing field, it is not \ngoing to lower health care costs. The only way a government-run program \ncan offer reduced insurance premiums is if they pay providers and \nhospitals at rates equivalent to current government programs. But this \nwouldn't cover costs. Instead, it would create cost shifting under \nprivate insurance, which is already happening today. CBO cautioned that \nreducing payment rates would only increase the access problems we have \nwith current government programs.\n\n  Currently, we know 40 percent of doctors don't take Medicaid \npatients. It is not that they don't want to; it is because the rates \nare so low they don't cover their costs. This directly contradicts \nPresident Obama's message: If you like your doctors, you will be able \nto keep them.\n  The reality is, on this government program--Medicaid--which is due to \ninsure more, that is not the case. The CBO score actually confirms that \nmany employees would lose their employer-based health care should this \nbill become law.\n  Let me put up a chart, if I might.\n  In fact, the HELP Committee's bill seems to directly encourage \nemployers to dump their employees into a government-run plan. In the \ncommittee draft, businesses that employ 25 or more employees would be \nrequired to pay an annual penalty, which is shown here, of $750 for a \nfull-time employee, if they choose not to provide private health \ninsurance for the employees. When you do the math, though, this isn't a \npenalty at all compared to the cost of private insurance.\n  Looking again at the chart, in 2008, the average employer's cost for \nan individual in a group plan was $3,983. So putting their employees on \nthe public plan option is actually a savings. It is a savings, as the \nchart shows, of $3,233 a year for each employee for that employer.\n  Paying the so-called penalty to get out from underneath the private \ninsurance costs looks like a pretty smart business decision. In fact, I \ndon't think it is a coincidence that a very large retailer recently \ncame out in support of the employer mandate. When I heard this news, my \ninitial reaction was, What is the catch?\n  Well, I think we found the catch. With over 1.4 million employees, \nthis company reports that 51.8 percent of their employees have coverage \nthrough an employee health care plan. If all of these employees end up \non the public plan, it would save this company $2.4 billion a year. The \nemployees, members of our middle class, lose their insurance plan and \nthe promise is not kept.\n  It is no surprise the company does very well: $2.4 billion goes to \nthe bottom line. Also no surprise, this company is supporting an \nemployer mandate. Ultimately, people will not have a choice to keep \ntheir employer-based coverage and will not receive the same level of \ncare when their employer dumps them onto the government plan to make \ntheir bottom line look better. This will directly impact the ability of \nthe middle class to choose the doctor they want. It will inject \ngovernment bureaucrats into their medical decisions because they have \nno choice. It is an employer's choice to move you to the government \nplan. To promise otherwise is misleading.\n  False promises will not help us achieve true solutions. Congress has \nbeen tasked with solving this problem, and we must work together to \nresolve the problem of reining in soaring costs. Adding another $2 \ntrillion entitlement program onto a budget that is already in serious \ntrouble doesn't make sense.\n  The American people have sent us to Washington to identify the \nproblem and fix it, not exacerbate it. Let's not put together bad \npolicy and end up with another financial debacle. This time there is \nfar more than money on the line. Americans treasure their ability to \nchoose their doctors, to receive treatment, to have control of their \nlife. They don't want a Federal bureaucrat in the middle of it. So \nlet's be candid with the American people and put together a good bill \nthat actually addresses the real problems. Let's get it right this \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/10/senate-section/article/S7337-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7337-S7339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about health care \nand why Congress needs to pass reform now.\n  There are three simple truths to healthcare reform:\n  First, if we don't pass healthcare reform this year, the stars will \nnot align for another opportunity to pass a major reform bill for years \nand years to come.\n  Don't kid yourself: The last time Congress failed to pass major \nhealth care reform, 15 years passed until today.\n  If the Congress fails to enact a health care reform bill this year, \nwith a new President in his first year in office who has a strong \nrelationship with Congress, it simply will not be done until years from \nnow when the system has collapsed into truly catastrophic shape.\n  And that leads to the second simple truth: We must pass reform now \nbecause the consequences of failure are not that we will be stuck with \nthe health care system we have today. The consequences of failure are a \nvery ugly health care reality our system is quickly becoming.\n  Our health care system has become a gigantic resource-eating machine \nwhich over time sucks in more money and yet delivers fewer options and \ndecreased quality care, rising premiums, uncertain coverage, decreased \nquality.\n  That is the reality.\n  The comparison of failing to enact reform is not to the system we \nhave today but to a very ugly destiny we will face relatively soon.\n  For example, if we do nothing, by 2016 health care premiums are \nprojected to grow to an average of $24,000 per family. Let me repeat, \nby 2016, $24,000 on average for health care costs per family every \nyear. That is simply unacceptable.\n  The third simple truth of health care reform is that if you like what \nyou have today, we need health care reform so you can keep it.\n  We need reform to maintain stable coverage that can't be taken away \nfrom you; to maintain stable costs, that will not eat away at your \npaycheck and will not put coverage out of reach; and to maintain stable \nquality, so you get the treatment you need, when you need it, and from \nthe doctor you choose.\n  Only reform keeps and improves on the best of our current system. \nFailure to act pleads to a catastrophic health care future. I am not \nexaggerating.\n  This is where we are. The pressures on the system are building. If we \nfail to act now, those pressures will cause rising costs, decreased \nchoice, the loss of access to current quality health care and basically \nworse health care outcomes across the board than we face today.\n  Let me add some additional statistics and projections.\n  Health care spending is swallowing up our gross domestic product, \nGDP. In 2009, health care will account for 18 percent of our GDP.\n  Eighteen cents of every dollar we spend is dedicated to health care. \nIf we do nothing, this will rise to 28 percent of GDP in 2030 and 34 \npercent in 2040. This trajectory is unsustainable.\n  Today, the average premium for family coverage is just over $12,000--\nan increase of 119 percent in 9 years. As I\n\n[[Page S7338]]\n\nsaid, if we sit by and do nothing, by 2016, a family premium will be \nestimated to cost at least $24,000--another increase of 83 percent. And \nin my home State of Delaware, it will be even higher, with a family \ninsurance policy purchased through an employer estimated to cost over \n$28,000.\n  Can you imagine paying for that? And that doesn't even include out-\nof-pocket costs such as deductibles and copayments. When health \ninsurance premiums grow at a rate five times as fast as wages, \nsomething has to change.\n  There also has been an increasing prevalence of medical bankruptcies. \nA recent study published in the American Journal of Medicine showed \nthat bankruptcies involving medical bills now account for more than 60 \npercent of U.S. personal bankruptcies, an increase of 50 percent in \njust 6 years.\n  In fact, more than 75 percent of families entering bankruptcy because \nof health care costs actually have health insurance. Most are middle-\nclass, well educated, and own their homes. They just can't keep up with \nthe alarming rise in out-of-pocket costs associated with medical care.\n  Passing health care reform is important, but not easy. But for the \nreasons I have mentioned, this year is different. This year, the call \nfor reform is coming from people and organizations that in the past \nopposed reform.\n  This year businesses, unions, insurers, provider groups and patient \nadvocacy groups are all looking for reform.\n  And why is that? Because the growing healh care dollars involved \nthreaten virtually to bankrupt us all. We need reform to stabilize the \nsystem.\n  I think it is important to keep in mind that this is not just about \nan alarming set of numbers, statistics and cost projections.\n  Behind all these numbers are real people who need quality and \naffordable health care, including people who struggle every day to get \nhealth care or keep the health insurance they already have.\n  Let me take just a few minutes to talk about some people from my home \nState of Delaware and why we need health reform for them, as well as \nfor millions of Americans like them in all parts of the country.\n  We need health reform because of people such as Angela Austin.\n  Angela is a recent mother who lives in Dover. She works as a \nbartender. Most of her earnings come from tips. She doesn't get health \ninsurance through her employer. When Angela became pregnant she tried \nto find private health insurance, but she was repeatedly denied \ncoverage because her pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition. \nShe applied for Medicaid--to find prenatal care for herself and the \nbaby--but was denied coverage because she earned $200 more than the \nmonthly income limit allowed. She called organizations and clinics and \nwas unable to find a payment plan she could afford.\n  Midway through her pregnancy, Angela decided to cut back her work \nhours so she could qualify for Medicaid. Thankfully, Angela was finally \nable to get services at Christiana Care's Wilmington Hospital, where \nthey provide prenatal care and delivery on a sliding scale for those \nwho can't afford insurance.\n  She worked all 9 months of the pregnancy and delivered the baby on \nMay 27. The Medicaid coverage was especially crucial because she had \ncomplications from hyperthyroidism and was able to get the necessary \nprescriptions to control the condition.\n  The sad part of this story is that when Angela was so anxious that \neverything possible be done to insure a healthy baby, the system threw \nup road blocks. Pregnancy should not be considered a preexisting \ncondition. What is more, no one should be denied coverage because of a \nprexisting condition, and no one should be forced to choose poverty to \nqualify for Medicaid.\n  We also need health reform for small businessmen such as Ian Kaufman \nof Georgetown. By the way, Ian is not a relative of mine.\n  Ian moved to Delaware right out of college in 1990. He was laid off \nfrom his job this past January and decided to start a small business. \nIn the process, Ian picked up COBRA coverage to ensure that his family \nmaintained their health care insurance.\n  When he first signed up for the COBRA coverage, his monthly premium \nwas $1,800. That is a lot of money. Thanks to the COBRA provisions in \nthe Recovery Act, Ian saw his payments reduced by 66 percent--which \nmade his monthly premiums much more manageable.\n  However, this premium assistance will run out sometime this fall, and \nhe will once again have to pay $1,800 a month.\n  In anticipation of higher COBRA payments, Ian applied for coverage \nfrom Blue Cross and Blue Shield but was turned down. They never gave \nhim a reason for denying him coverage, but he suspects it was because \nof a pre-existing condition of one of his daughters.\n  Ian worries that the high cost of providing health care for his \nfamily, in addition to the difficulty of even finding a willing policy \nprovider, will affect his ability to stick with his startup business.\n  Unfortunately, Ian's health insurance predicament as a self-employed \nbusinessman is not uncommon. There are too many sole proprietors and \nsmall businesses that cannot afford health policies for themselves, \ntheir families and any employees they might have. It should not be this \nway.\n  But it is not always just a problem of finding private health \ninsurance. We also need health reform for people such as Bonita \nSponsler from Dagsboro so they don't slip through the cracks of our \nexisting safety net of Medicaid and Medicare.\n  Bonita was laid off from her job in March 2007. Three weeks later she \nsuffered a brain aneurysm. Bonita applied for Social Security \ndisability and was awarded benefits, but as with everyone who qualifies \nfor such coverage, she has to wait 2 years before Medicare coverage \nkicks in.\n  Meanwhile, Bonita has suffered two additional aneurysms since her \ninitial episode, and it is advised that she receive an arteriogram to \nmonitor her condition. Unfortunately, she can't afford to pay the \nseveral thousands of dollars it costs for an arteriogram, so she is \ntaking her chances until she becomes eligible for Medicare in October. \nThis a considerable risk due to her propensity for aneurysms, but it is \nthe only option she can afford. In fact, she has had to cancel a \nscheduled arteriogram in September because she still would not have \ncoverage by then. It should not be this way.\n  Finally, we need health reform for people who pile up insurmountable \ndebt, many times due to accidents or injuries they never caused and \ncouldn't avoid.\n  Without using her name, I want to highlight the situation of a \nDelaware woman who is a victim of domestic violence.\n  She suffered major eye damage and has had three surgeries. She has no \nhealth insurance and by late 2008 owed almost $30,000 in hospital and \nanesthesia bills, in addition to $6,000 in personal bills.\n  She received lost wages from the Violent Crimes Compensation Board. \nShe applied for Medicaid but was turned down. She then applied for \nSocial Security disability but was also turned down as her eye \ncondition was not considered to be permanent and could be repaired with \nadditional surgery.\n  After waiting many months, she was finally able to get the eye \nsurgery she needed because the doctor who performed the procedure \nreduced the fee from $12,000 to $3,000 and allowed her to go on a \npayment plan.\n  However, she still owes $20,000 to $30,000 for the prior surgeries. \nShe is presently not working and does not have health insurance. She \ncould have had COBRA following the loss of her job, but it was $890 a \nmonth and she could not afford it. She presently can see well enough to \ndrive. However, she is due for yet another surgery and the financial \narrangements for that will again be extremely difficult if not \nimpossible. It shouldn't be this way.\n  These stories help to show why we can no longer wait for health \nreform.\n  These stories require us to put our differences aside and come \ntogether to make certain that Americans have access to affordable, \nquality health care when they need it.\n  In my short time in the Senate, I have had the pleasure of presiding \nover the floor at the President's desk. I have listened to many of my \ncolleagues give good, passionate speeches staking out their position on \nwhere we need to go\n\n[[Page S7339]]\n\non health reform. I can truly say I have learned a lot from those \nspeeches, many of which have helped shape my own views on the health \nreform debate.\n  That said, I have also heard some speeches that give me cause for \nconcern, as some colleagues seem to have prejudged the legislation \nbefore it has even appeared.\n  I have heard about the dangers of a British or Canadian-style \ngovernment-run health care system.\n  I have been warned about rationing and bureaucrats getting between \nAmericans and their doctors.\n  I have listened to stories about patients from other countries that \ncome here to get care they can't receive in a timely manner back in \ntheir own country.\n  I have heard over and over about a government-run takeover of health \ncare.\n  I do not doubt the sincerity of my colleagues who see potential \npitfalls in health care reform. But when I hear these speeches, I often \nwonder what legislation they are warning us about.\n  So far, I have not seen any bill being discussed in committee that \ncalls for a government-run, single-payer system such as Canada or Great \nBritain.\n  I have not seen any legislative text that puts restrictions on what \ntreatments doctors can provide or what they can discuss with their \npatients.\n  I have not read any language that rations any sort of health care.\n  I hope that the fears about change in our health care system do not \nhurt our chances of enacting reform this year.\n  I hope the debate over the bill is centered around what is actually \nin the legislation, not extrapolations about provisions in the bill or \nfrightening projections of a health care system in other countries that \nare not actually being proposed here in Congress.\n  I hope that as the debate moves forward, all of us in the Senate will \nstep back, take a breath, and remember why we need to reform health \ncare. We are moving quickly toward a health care system that Americans \nwill no longer be able to afford. The system is quickly hurtling out of \ncontrol.\n  Yes, we do need to keep what works, and we need to fix what is \nbroken.\n  We need to make certain that Americans can get affordable health \ninsurance without worrying about preexisting conditions.\n  We need to help Americans avoid bankruptcy because of out-of-control \nmedical bills.\n  We need to ensure stability in the system so that Americans maintain \ninsurance options and their choice of doctor.\n  Most important, we as a country need to take control of our health \ncare destiny. We can have a future in which Americans can have stable \ncoverage, with stable costs and stable quality. Or if we do nothing, we \nwill have a future of rapidly increasing premiums, uncertain coverage \nand decreased quality.\n  I urge my colleagues to gather their collective will, realize what is \nbest for our country and do the right thing during this historic \nopportunity by passing health care reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/10/senate-section/article/S7339-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7339-S7348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wanted to deliver these remarks on the same \nsubject of health care earlier in the week. I had been back home in \nArizona during the July recess and had spoken to many of my \nconstituents about the subject. I didn't have the opportunity to \naddress this subject until today. I note that health care is very much \non their minds. They have been asking a lot of questions. My \nconstituents have been following the health care debate, and the \nmajority I have spoken with are very much in favor of reform.\n  I think all of us in this body realize there are things we have to do \nto lower the cost of health care and ensure everybody has an \nopportunity to be covered.\n  I can also tell you they are very concerned about the reforms that \nhave been proposed by the President. They wonder whether they, in fact, \nwill work to their best interests. Cost is an issue that has come up \nrepeatedly when I have spoken with my constituents. They want to know \nwhy we have to spend so much money in order to--allegedly--save money \nand how much it will cost. I tell them it is projected to cost at least \na trillion dollars. This is not a fanciful figure; this is what the two \nbills pending before the Senate are being scored at, meaning that the \nCongressional Budget Office has said that is about how much they are \ngoing to cost. The ultimate price tag could be even higher because in \nthe case of one of the bills, not everything that is going to be in it \nhas already been scored by the CBO, and as to the Finance Committee \nbill, it is still very much a work in progress.\n  The usual reaction people have to a trillion dollar-plus health care \nbill is that they cannot believe we would want to spend that much money \nor that we can't afford to spend that much. They know already that \nthere are only two ways the Federal Government can pay for such a \nmassive program: one, either borrow more money or, two, impose new \ntaxes or some combination of the two. Naturally, they don't like either \nalternative.\n  Most Arizonans think Washington has already borrowed more money than \ntaxpayers can handle, after the President's $1.2 trillion stimulus \nbill, the $400 billion Omnibus appropriations bill, and the $3.4 \ntrillion, 10-year budget. Now we hear talk about adding an additional \ntrillion dollars on top of that. The folks in Arizona think that is \njust too much. In fact, by the end of the fiscal year, our publicly \nheld debt will be about 57 percent of our gross domestic product, and \ndeficits of a trillion dollars a year are projected for the next \ndecade. We just got the statistics for the deficit this year. It is \nalready at $1.1 trillion. By the end of the year, it could easily be \nanother half-trillion dollars above that. This will drive the debt to \nat least 82 percent of the gross domestic product by 2019. To give you \nan idea of what that means, the GDP is how much money we make as a \ncountry. It would be the same as saying that for a family that has an \nincome of $100,000, its credit card debt is $89,000. Try paying off an \n$89,000 credit card debt on a $100,000 income. The interest payments on \nthe debt will soon make up the single-largest item in our budget. So, \nobviously, when we talk about spending another trillion dollars we \ndon't have, my constituents are very wary of this. They are wary about \nthe debt, and, to say the least, they don't think it is fair for \nWashington to pass another trillion-dollar bill, with the costs being \ntransferred to our children and grandchildren--especially after what \nhappened with the stimulus, which has, frankly, included a great deal \nof waste and obviously has failed to contain unemployment.\n  A lot of folks have expressed skepticism that spending another \ntrillion dollars is the right way to reduce health care costs. Frankly, \nI agree with them. Somebody has to pay the trillion dollars. They are \nalso concerned about the new taxes that have been proposed to pay for \nthis because, in fact, part of this trillion dollars is proposed to be \npaid for through new taxes. There have been all kinds of ideas \nproposed, such as a tax on beer, soda, juice, and snack food. Those are \nreally small items, but they hit people right where it counts when they \ngo to the grocery store.\n  There is also a new value-added tax idea. This hits the small \nbusiness men and women, who are especially concerned because of the new \ntaxes that some are suggesting they should pay--as much as a 10 \npercentage point increase in the amount of taxes they would have to \npay. This is important because, in our economic downturn today, we know \nit is small businesses that are going to create the jobs that will \nbring us out of the recession. This would not be just a job killer but \nan economic growth and recovery killer with that kind of tax imposed on \nthese folks.\n  My constituents want to know--and, frankly, I want to know--if the \nPresident will fulfill his campaign pledge not to raise taxes one \nsingle dime on the middle class and whether he will veto any \nlegislation that includes the kinds of taxes of which I am speaking \nthat would fall directly on families. They believe and I believe there \nought to be a different way to achieve the health care we want--in \nother words, without this new round of spending and taxes.\n  They have heard the President argue in his pitches for Washington to \nchange our health care system that if we spend\n\n[[Page S7340]]\n\nall this money on health care now, we will somehow save money later. \nAmericans have some commonsense questions about this claim: How will \nthe government actually do this? Will their health care be rationed? If \nthey are privately insured, will they be able to keep the health care \nthey already have? Eighty-five percent of persons are already insured \nand are happy with what they have. Yet proposals in the pending \nlegislation would cause many of them to lose that insurance and go onto \ngovernment programs. That, of course, then raises questions like \nrationing, as I have discussed many times before.\n  A Washington-run health care system would likely try to suppress \ncosts by denying or delaying care. Administration officials are already \ntalking about using comparative effectiveness research for this \npurpose. This is not a fanciful or hypothetical notion. As we know, \nthis is exactly what has happened in countries such as Canada and the \nUnited Kingdom, two countries with government-run health care systems. \nIn a ``20/20'' health care segment, they reported that Norwood, \nOntario, holds a lottery each week to give one winner a trip to a \nfamily doctor. The show filmed the town clerk pulling a name from a box \nand calling the name of an elated winner. Is that what we want in the \nUnited States? The average emergency room wait in Canada is 23 hours--\nif you are even considered sick enough to be admitted. In Britain, in \n2007, the government set a goal to reduce the average wait time to see \na physician to fewer than 18 weeks. That is 4\\1/2\\ months waiting to \nsee a doctor. Do Americans want that?\n  That is how government-run health care works: You make something free \nand demand soars. To reduce costs, bureaucrats deny or delay treatment \nor tests or procedures they deem too expensive. The way it works is \nsimple: You set a budget of how much you are going to spend on health \ncare every year. It doesn't matter how sick your folks get; it has to \nfit within that budget. Think about that for your family. Say you set a \nbudget and you are going to spend no more than $5,000 on health care \nthis year. A good friend of mine in Arizona had an automobile accident; \nit was very serious. He had to have his spleen removed. He is still in \nrecovery, and it is obviously going to cost a lot of money--more than \n$5,000. Well, if he set a budget and said that is all he is going to \nspend, what is he to do? Does he not get the treatment he needs as a \nresult of that accident? You cannot reform health care or reduce costs \nby rationing care to patients.\n  One of the things Republicans will insist on is that the way we do \nthe reform doesn't hurt what we already have, which is a system that \nallows you to get to the emergency room and allows you to see a doctor. \nYou can choose your own doctor. If you have insurance, you get to keep \nit. We don't want to take care of the few who are unable to get \ninsurance today in a way that requires us to change what everybody else \nhas, if it is already working for them.\n  It is true that you won't find the words ``ration'' or ``denial'' of \ncare or ``withholding coverage'' in these bills. Obviously, they don't \nstate it that way. But the results are precisely what are required by \nthe policies in the bill. The results are easily masked by all kinds of \nterminology, but the rules, the forms, the legal obligations, and the \nprovider reimbursement schemes all result in the ability of the \ngovernment to tell you whether something is going to be covered, \nwhether you and your doctor think it is necessary for your care or not.\n  I have heard some respond by saying that at least in the Canadian \nsystem they may ration care, but everybody has access to a doctor. Not \ntrue. The Fraser Institute, a Canadian think tank, released a study \nthis year that found that 1.7 million people--out of a country of 33 \nmillion--were unable to see a physician in 2007. That number does not \ninclude those who have a doctor but are on a waiting list.\n\n  As I said earlier, many of my constituents also worry about losing \ntheir current coverage if a new Washington-run health care system is \nimplemented. True, they have heard the President say repeatedly that if \nyou have health insurance, you get to keep it. But they have also heard \nthe other side of the story, and I have read at least one of the \nbills--in fact, there are two specific provisions--that render this \nstatement untrue--that if you have health insurance, you get to keep \nit. Not true. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that just \npart of one of the proposed plans shows that millions of people would \nlose their existing coverage and be told to enroll in government health \ncare. The Lewin study specifically mentioned 119 million people who \nwould be shifted from their current employer-provided coverage onto the \ngovernment plan.\n  Many of my constituents also want to know if the President would veto \nlegislation that has the potential to cause Americans to lose the \nprivate insurance they currently enjoy.\n  There is a final concern, and this concerns me. It goes to America's \nseniors. We have made some very strong commitments to our seniors \nthrough the Medicare Program. Our seniors obviously are more \nsusceptible to needing health care. They have a greater number of \nhealth concerns than younger Americans. And we have said to them: We \nwill, through Medicare, ensure that your health concerns will be taken \ncare of. They are obviously very concerned about rationing if Medicare \nwere somehow to be cut in order to raise money to solve the problem for \nothers in our society. That is precisely what at least one of these \nbills proposes to do--cut Medicare and take that money and apply it to \nthe new costs that we are going to be incurring as a result of this so-\ncalled health care reform.\n  Seniors are worried these cuts in Medicare will adversely affect \ntheir ability to get care. They also fret that adding the 47 million \nuninsured Americans--which would be just for starters--to health \ninsurance rolls, including government insurance rolls, would impact the \ncare they now receive by crowding the system. In other words, leading \nto wait times, rationing for them or even potentially denial of care. \nWe must not implement a new health care system that would suddenly \nerode the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  My constituents want high-quality, patient-centered health care. Most \nalready have good health insurance for themselves. They are concerned \nabout its cost. They are also concerned that there are some who need to \nbe insured who are not. But what they want to hear are fresh new ideas \nabout how to achieve this result without, in effect, throwing the baby \nout with the bathwater; without adversely affecting the system that \ncurrently takes care of them, whether it is seniors being cared for in \nMedicare or it is the vast majority of Americans who are already \ninsured and like the insurance they have. They do not want us to rush a \ncostly new plan through the Congress.\n  I think the President was correct when he said: If we don't do this \nquickly, we might not do it at all. Well, what did he mean by that? In \neffect, what he was saying is that if the American people have a long \nenough time to study and debate exactly what is being proposed, they \nmay not like what they see. I think that is exactly what is happening \nhere.\n  There is a bill that is going to be marked up next week in the House \nof Representatives, and I don't think the American people are going to \nlike what they see in that bill. We have a bill that has been marked up \nin the HELP Committee in the Senate, and much of my criticisms go to \nthat particular bill. There is one section in that bill, for example, \nthat spends $400 billion over 7 years to subsidize health care for \nfamilies making between $66,000 a year and 80,000-some dollars a year. \nIs that what we want to cut Medicare to pay for?\n  As I said, the more Americans understand the details of these bills, \nthe more questions I think they are going to ask. We owe it to our \nconstituents to allow them the time to understand it and to ask us \nthose questions. I want to be able to go back to Arizona and say: All \nright, here are the three bills--or two bills or however many there \nare--and here is what they do. Do you like it or not? If not, how would \nyou change it? We need the time and the ability to get the reaction \nfrom our constituents if we are going to be true to our position as \nrepresentatives of the people.\n  So when the President says: If we don't do this quickly, we might not \ndo it at all, he is probably right. But it is better to get it right; \nto take our time\n\n[[Page S7341]]\n\nto do it right and not make mistakes, than to rush something through \nthat is going to add $1 trillion in new spending; that is going to \npotentially impact the coverage we already have, potentially impact \nMedicare for our seniors and perhaps not achieve the results we want. \nThis is one of the most important things this Congress--the American \nCongress--will have done in years. It is complicated, it is hard, and \nwe have to get it right.\n  One of the first things a physician learns in medical school, when \nconfronting a patient to see what is wrong with that patient and to \nbegin the treatment, is to, first, do no harm. It is possible to do \nharm to a patient. So the physician, first of all, is admonished: The \nbody is a wonderful thing, it recovers pretty well; don't do anything \nto harm. The same thing is true with our economy and with the policies \nwith respect to health care. There are a lot of good things being done \nin health care--physicians are working very hard to take good care of \nus, most people have good insurance, seniors rely on Medicare. Let's \nnot do harm to what we have in order to take a small segment of our \npopulation and make sure they can get insurance.\n  That is the primary position we are taking when we say: Let's don't \nrush this. Let's do it right. At the end of the day, we can all be \nproud of the fact that we have reformed our health care system to \nreduce, not increase, some of the expenses and to ensure that those who \ndon't have insurance can, in fact, be covered.\n  I said I wished to give these remarks earlier in the week, having \ntalked with a lot of my constituents in Arizona. I also wished, toward \nthe end of this week, to comment on the President's trip to Russia. He \nis going to be returning home soon, and his trip to Russia produced \nsome very important announcements, which I wished to discuss today.\n\n\n                   President Obama's Visit to Russia\n\n  I am going to switch subjects now and discuss the President's trip to \nMoscow and his summit with the President of Russia.\n  The most significant object of that summit, as we know, was the \ndiscussion of further strategic arms reductions. I personally believe \nit is important that the verification and confidence-building measures \nof the 1991 START agreement not expire without some measure to continue \nthem, possibly including a legally binding replacement treaty. I know \nthat is one of the purposes of the President's visit. But I am also \ncognizant of the fact that a follow-on to the 1991 START agreement does \nnot address the most current threats to the United States and the West; \nnamely, those posed by nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. The \ntwo subjects are barely related.\n  For example, the threat from Iran and the history of Russian support \nfor the Iranian nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program is well \nknown. It is probably even going on today. This should have been at the \ntop of the President's agenda with Russia, if, in fact, he is going to \naddress the threats that are most currently before us, rather than a \ndecades-old arms control agreement with Russia.\n  Additionally, there is the ongoing nuclear weapon ambitions of North \nKorea. Some press reports suggest it may be sharing its technology with \ncountries such as Syria and Burma. Given the well-known willingness of \nthese rogue states--and I speak of North Korea and Iran--to support \nterrorism, their unchecked nuclear ambitions will surely hasten the day \nwhen terrorists are able to acquire nuclear weapons. I believe nuclear \nproliferation and nuclear terrorism are the greatest threats to our \nNation today, and we should be focused much more on those threats, as I \nsaid, than going back and negotiating an arms control agreement with \nRussia, which obviously is not a current threat to the United States.\n\n  The main focus of the President's trip when he was in Moscow appears \nto have been on the subject of a strategic arms reduction treaty with \nRussia. That being the case, the Senate has a great responsibility--if \nthe administration seeks our advice and consent by submitting the \ntreaty to us for ratification--to understand what the proposal is and \nto provide our advice to the President before it is negotiated and, if \nappropriate, our consent to ratify. Obviously, the Constitution \nrequires this process of advise and consent when it comes to treaty \nmaking.\n  Here are some of the questions I think we need to answer. First of \nall, what does the United States get from such a new treaty when it \nappears that the Russians are on their way to reaching the levels of \nweaponry announced without a treaty? They are going to do it anyway.\n  Second, why has the United States bent to Russian demands to take \ntactical nuclear weapons off the table when the Russians have a 10-to-1 \nadvantage in tactical nuclear weapons over the United States and have \nopenly talked in their military doctrine about using tactical nuclear \nweapons in conflict?\n  How will the administration provide for the modernization of U.S. \nnuclear forces, including the warheads and the complex of \ninfrastructure that sustains them and the nuclear weapons delivery \nsystems, the bombers and the missiles and submarines that must \naccompany any START ratification process? That is perhaps the most \ncritical question of all.\n  A number of these questions and recommended courses of action have \nrecently been articulated by some of this country's leading experts on \narms control and nonproliferation policy, including Ambassador James \nWoolsey, Dr. Fred Ikle, Ambassador John Bolton, and many others.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nat the conclusion of my remarks, a document entitled ``U.S.-Russian \nSTART Renewal Negotiations: Guidelines to Protect U.S. Interests.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  I also urge my colleagues to study materials recently released by the \nNew Deterrent Working Group involved with the Center for Security \nPolicy, a respected think tank here in Washington, that has studied \nthese issues for years; and also a very objective and important guide \nfor how we should approach our thinking on these negotiations from the \nHudson Institute. These are outstanding compilations of expert opinions \nfor Senators to familiarize themselves with as we head into a treaty \nratification process. They are too lengthy to insert in the Record, but \nI am happy to provide these papers to any of my colleagues who would \nlike to read them.\n  Another important question concerns missile defense. Just before the \nsummit, it appeared the White House was taking a strong line in \nrefusing to accept Russian demands to link missile defenses with a \nfollow-on treaty. The Russians have said: We are not even going to talk \nabout the START numbers unless we can also talk about U.S. missile \ndefense. The Russians don't like it. They would like to have us put \nsome limitations on that. The administration recognized not only should \nthere be no constraint on the development of missile defenses, but, \nmoreover, any treaty--any treaty--that limits U.S. missile defenses \nwould be dead on arrival in the Senate if we tied the two subjects \ntogether.\n  This past week, I joined Senators Wicker, Johanns, McCain, Hatch, \nLieberman, Ben Nelson, and Begich in sending a letter to the President \nin which we confirmed that ``linking missile defense plans to offensive \nforce negotiations runs contrary to American strategic interests and \nwould undermine our security.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 2, 2009.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In anticipation of your upcoming visit \n     to the Russian Federation, we write to express our concern \n     about recent comments by Russian leaders suggesting \n     limitations on U.S. missile defense plans in Europe as a \n     prerequisite for agreeing to a successor to the Strategic \n     Arms Reduction Treaty (START). We urge you to not combine \n     discussions about U.S. missile defense efforts and the \n     ongoing START negotiations.\n       Speaking on May 20, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov \n     said that an agreement on a START replacement would be \n     ``impossible . . . without taking into account the\n\n[[Page S7342]]\n\n     situation in the missile defense sphere.'' Russian President \n     Dmitry Medvedev also noted during an April speech that \n     ``(a)nother aspect of security is the relationship between \n     offensive and defensive weapons.'' Prime Minister Vladimir \n     Putin likewise suggested a quid pro quo between START and \n     missile defense during a visit to Japan on May 10, when he \n     said that ``Russia will link missile defense to strategic \n     offensive armaments.''\n       We feel strongly that linking missile defense plans to \n     offensive force negotiations in this way runs contrary to \n     America's strategic interests and would undermine our \n     security. As you have noted, the planned European missile \n     defense system is limited in scope to defend the United \n     States and its allies against the rising threat posed by \n     Iranian long-range ballistic missiles, but it poses no threat \n     to Russia's strategic missiles.\n       We support your determination to bring into force a follow-\n     on agreement to START prior to its lapse on December 5th of \n     this year. However, we will be reluctant to support any \n     agreement that is explicitly conditioned on U.S. abandonment \n     of missile defenses in Europe or otherwise linked to a U.S. \n     decision to curtail or abandon those defenses.\n       Given that negotiations for a follow-on treaty to START are \n     being conducted on a relatively short timeline, we believe \n     that the paramount goal this year is to ensure that the \n     verification and confidence building measures from the 1991 \n     START treaty do not lapse.\n       The United States and the Russian Federation will need to \n     find ways to cooperate on many issues in the coming years and \n     we hope that your representatives bear in mind the broader \n     strategic context in which these negotiations with Moscow are \n     taking place.\n           Sincerely,\n         James M. Inhofe, Joseph I. Lieberman, Jon Kyl, Ben \n           Nelson, John S. McCain, Mark Begich, Jeff Sessions, \n           Mike Johanns, Roger Wicker, Orrin Hatch, United States \n           Senators.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Notwithstanding what I have said, buried in the joint \nunderstanding--which has now been made public--reached by President \nObama and Medvedev is inclusion of the following language suggesting an \naccession to the Russian demand to include missile defense in the \nfollow-on treaty:\n\n       A provision on the interrelationships of strategic \n     offensive and strategic defensive arms.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Joint Understanding be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. KYL. This last statement is a dangerous connection to make and \none the administration must not negotiate. U.S. missile defenses exist \nto protect against ballistic missile threats by rogue regimes and the \nthreat of accidental or unauthorized launches. They are not about \nRussia. Consequently, we should not allow Russia to attempt to limit \nour defenses, and that is what I fear these words from the Joint \nUnderstanding may allow to occur. Such a linkage in the START agreement \nwill be rejected by Members of the Senate.\n  I would also like to call attention to a curious statement by the \nPresident which was quoted in this past Sunday's New York Times:\n\n       It's naive for us to think that we can grow our nuclear \n     stockpiles, the Russians continue to grow their nuclear \n     stockpiles, and our allies grow their nuclear stockpiles, and \n     that in that environment we're going to be able to pressure \n     countries like Iran and North Korea not to pursue nuclear \n     weapons themselves.\n\n  The fact is, the United States has not been growing or even \nmodernizing its nuclear stockpile. Why did the President make such a \nfalse statement? Yes, the Russians are growing theirs, at least \nmodernizing it. Britain and France are modernizing their stockpiles, \nthough not growing them, as far as I have seen in the press. India, \nPakistan, and North Korea are all growing their stockpiles; and, of \ncourse, we are all familiar with Iran's actions. All of this has \noccurred in the absence of the United States growing its stockpile. \nWhat the President said is not true. In fact, it has all occurred while \nthe United States has undertaken substantial nuclear force reductions. \nWe haven't modernized our nuclear weapons, and we haven't conducted an \nunderground nuclear test for 17 years. One would think this history \nwould put to rest the naive assumption that the U.S. movement toward \ndisarmament will be reciprocated by other nations, including those that \nthreaten our national security.\n  I would also like to submit for the Record a Wall Street Journal op-\ned written by Steve Rademaker, former Assistant Secretary of State for \nInternational Security and Nonproliferation in the last administration. \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks that letter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. Rademaker correctly observes:\n\n       The critics are not impressed that by 2012 the U.S. will \n     have reduced its deployed strategic warheads by 80 percent. \n     They will not be satisfied if the U.S. reduces by 99 percent. \n     So long as there is one nuclear weapon remaining in the U.S. \n     inventory, he says, they will point to this as the root cause \n     of nuclear proliferation.\n\n  As I indicated a few moments ago, there are real concerns facing the \nSenate at this time as we consider the START follow-on treaty. It is \nimperative that the President understand the true situation as he \nnegotiates with his Russian counterparts.\n  This is all the more important as we begin to understand the highly \nsignificant reductions the administration apparently wants to negotiate \nin a follow-on agreement. According to the Joint Understanding from \nwhich I quoted before, the President plans to reach an agreement that \nrepresents a significant departure from current force levels.\n  I note that the 1,700 to 2,200 deployed strategic nuclear force \nlevel--actually on the high end of that range--was considered the \nminimum force level required for deterrence and assurance just last \nyear when the Departments of Energy and Defense issued an unclassified \nwhite paper, ``National Security and Nuclear Weapons in the 21st \nCentury.''\n  Given yesterday's announcement, I am curious to understand how \nestimates of necessary force levels could have changed so dramatically \nin the 10 months since that paper was issued. I am also very concerned \nabout the implications for our triad and for our conventional arms \nmodernization, if we lock in a launcher limit at anything close to 500.\n  The triad is the combination of our strategic bomber force, our \nintercontinental ballistic missiles based on land in silos, and ICBMs \nin submarines. Those are the three parts of our strategic triad. If we \nwere to reduce the numbers as dramatically low as this paper would \nindicate, it is very clear the triad would be jeopardized; that is to \nsay, not all elements of it would have the weaponry to be part of our \nstrategic deterrent.\n  Moreover, these numbers would suggest that parts of this triad can be \nused for conventional purposes. Bombers can drop high explosive bombs. \nThey don't just drop nuclear weapons. A missile--we have a lot of \ncruise missiles that send high-explosive warheads to their destination. \nIt doesn't have to be a nuclear warhead. If we reduce the number of \ndelivery systems down below a certain level, we not only impact our \nstrategic nuclear deterrent but also our conventional deterrent and \nconventional capability.\n  This may be very advantageous for Russia. In fact, Russia is headed \nto a low level anyway because of their economy. But I believe it is a \ngrave risk for the United States and our allies. I think these are \nissues that will warrant the highest level of scrutiny by the Senate. \nWe can't be rushed in our work. These are very important existential \nquestions.\n  I note that the Senate had over 425 days between the signature on the \nSTART I agreement and the eventual ratification of that treaty. There \nwere 1,119 days between the signing and ratification of START II. And \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention allowed the Senate 1,563 days of \nreview, deliberation, and debate. The last successful arms control \ntreaty with the Russians, the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, or \nSORT, permitted the Senate 287 days to review.\n  I say again, there is no need for a rush. As the Wall Street Journal \nreported yesterday, July 8:\n\n       The White House Coordinator for Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction, Security and Arms Control, Gary Samore, said on \n     Sunday that the Administration may have to enact certain \n     provisions of a treaty by executive order and on a \n     `provisional basis' to meet the December deadline.\n\n\n[[Page S7343]]\n\n\n  Clearly, there are options available to ensure that the Senate has \nall the time it needs to thoughtfully consider a treaty and to make \nsure a nuclear weapons modernization program is in place and funded \nbefore the Senate proceeds to ratification of the START follow-on.\n  Mr. President, according to press reports, Russian President Medvedev \nhas indicated that his nation would like to reduce the number of \nstrategic launchers several times below the number currently permitted \nunder START. This is reflected in the launcher limits outlined in the \nJoint Understanding.\n  This sounds good, but it is unclear that Russia is actually giving \nanything up.\n  In recent testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, \nDr. Keith Payne, a former official of the Defense Department and a \nmember of the bipartisan Congressional Commission on the Strategic \nPosture, cautioned ``We should be very careful about moving toward \nlower launcher numbers because it would provide significant advantages \nfor the Russian Federation, but significant disadvantages for U.S. \nstrategy.''\n  As Dr. Payne noted in his testimony, Russia's strategic ICBMs, SLBMs \nand bombers will drop dramatically with or without a new arms control \nagreement.\n  Specifically, Dr. Payne stated: ``within 8 or 9 years, the number of \nRussian strategic launchers will have dropped from approximately 680 \nlaunchers (some of which already are not operational) to approximately \n270 launchers simply as a result of aging of their systems and the pace \nof their modernization program. In contrast, the service life of \nexisting U.S. systems extends several decades.''\n  Dr. Payne continues: ``Despite spending up to 25% of the Russian \nmilitary budget on the strategic forces, Russia's strategic nuclear \nforces will decline steeply with or without arms control.''\n  Consequently, Russia isn't giving up anything by agreeing to these \nreductions. At the same time, reductions in delivery vehicles could \nhave consequences for the U.S., in terms of prompt global strike \ncapabilities nd conventional strike modernization.\n  Dr. Payne also wrote about these facts in a recent Wall Street \nJournal piece, and I ask unanimous consent to print it in the Record as \nwell.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. KYL. Additionally, in order to get a follow-on START agreement \nwith Russia--one that appears to be much more to Russia's advantage \nthan ours--we have also decided we will not seek to get the Russians to \ngive up a very real advantage they possess: their tactical nuclear \nweapons, also known as nonstrategic nuclear weapons.\n  While the United States and Russia have a rough equivalence in their \nstrategic nuclear weapons, there is a significant imbalance in tactical \nnuclear weapons that favors Russia.\n  This imbalance is exacerbated by the fact that Russia maintains an \nactive nuclear weapons production complex, while the United States does \nnot.\n  According to the recently concluded report of the bipartisan Perry-\nSchlesinger Commission, there is a growing asymmetry between United \nStates and Russian nuclear weapons capabilities thanks to a \nlongstanding problem whereby the Russian Federation has maintained far \ngreater numbers of tactical nuclear weapons than the United States.\n  According to the commission, the Russians have approximately 3,800 of \nthese weapons, while the United States has only a few hundred.\n  And according to a recent CRS report, the Russians may have as many \nas 8,000.\n  Despite this asymmetry, we are told that the forthcoming START \nfollow-on will not deal with Russian tactical nuclear weapons, at \nRussian demand.\n  Yet, it is clear that our allies who rely on our extended deterrent \nare increasingly concerned.\n  For example, the Perry-Schlesinger report stated: ``The combination \nof new warhead designs, the estimated production capability for new \nnuclear warheads, and precision delivery systems such as the Iskander \nshort-range tactical ballistic missile (known as the SS-26 in the \nWest), open up new possibilities for Russian efforts to threaten to use \nnuclear weapons to influence regional conflicts.''\n  And according to that report, ``The United States should not cede to \nRussia a posture of superiority in the name of deemphasizing nuclear \nweapons in U.S. military strategy. There seems no near-term prospect of \nsuch a result in the balance of operationally deployed strategic \nnuclear weapons. But that balance does not exist in nonstrategic \nnuclear forces, where Russia enjoys a sizeable numerical advantage. As \nnoted above, it stores thousands of these weapons in apparent support \nof possible military operations west of the Urals. The United States \ndeploys a small fraction of that number in support of nuclear sharing \nagreements in NATO. Precise numbers for the U.S. deployments are \nclassified but their total is only about five percent of the total at \nthe height of the Cold War. Strict U.S.-Russian equivalence in NSNF \nnumbers is unnecessary. But the current imbalance is stark and \nworrisome to some U.S. allies in Central Europe. If and as reductions \ncontinue in the number of operationally deployed strategic nuclear \nweapons, this imbalance will become more apparent and allies less \nassured.''\n  It is therefore inexplicable to me that we will not be negotiating \nwith the Russians about reductions in those nuclear forces.\n  Moreover, I am concerned by suggestions that discussions of these \nforces will have to wait for the ``next treaty'' which may not ever \narrive. In the meantime, this follow-on agreement may lock in a \nsignificant disadvantage for the United States and our allies.\n  In recent months, it has become clear that the state of our nuclear \ndeterrent is in need of serious attention.\n  As high an authority as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned: \n``At a certain point, it will become impossible to keep extending the \nlife of our arsenal, especially in light of our testing moratorium. It \nalso makes it harder to reduce existing stockpiles, because eventually \nwe won't have as much confidence in the efficacy of the weapons we do \nhave.''\n  Secretary Gates continued this argument when he said: ``To be blunt, \nthere is absolutely no way we can maintain a credible deterrent and \nreduce the number of weapons in our stockpile without either resorting \nto testing our stockpile or pursuing a modernization program.''\n  This is a statement of significant import. Secretary Gates has warned \nthat without a modernization program, such as the Reliable Replacement \nWarhead RRW, which Congress rejected during the last administration, we \nwill be unable to reduce the number of weapons we maintain.\n  In fact, we are not even certain we can modernize without testing, \nbut we would be a lot closer to knowing the answer to that question if \nCongress had approved the RRW studies.\n  As the Perry-Schlesinger Commission noted, our nuclear weapons and \ntheir delivery platforms are long overdue for a needed modernization \nprogram and will continue to experience safety, reliability and \ncredibility problems until that modernization is in place.\n  In fact, even in its Interim Report, the commission stated: ``High \nconfidence in stockpile reliability not only is important for \nmaintaining deterrence, it is also vital for making substantial \nreductions in the size of our stockpile.''\n  Thus, it should not be surprising that the commission made the \nfollowing findings and recommendations that are of such importance that \nI want to read them into the Record in their entirety:\n\n       i. For the indefinite future, the United States must \n     maintain a viable nuclear deterrent. The other NPT- \n     recognized nuclear-weapon states have put in place \n     comprehensive programs to modernize their forces to meet new \n     international circumstances.\n       ii. The Stockpile Stewardship Program has had some \n     remarkable achievements. But in recent years, the level of \n     funding provided to support these safeguards has been \n     inadequate.\n       iii. The Life Extension Program has to date been effective \n     in dealing with the problem of modernizing the arsenal. But \n     it is becoming increasingly difficult to continue within the \n     constraints of a rigid adherence to original materials and \n     design as the stockpile continues to age.\n       iv. As the reductions have proceeded over the period since \n     the end of the Cold War, the potential to deal with technical \n     surprise has been reduced, as the diversity of types of \n     weapons in the stockpile has shrunk.\n\n[[Page S7344]]\n\n       v. The infrastructure that supports two thirds of the \n     strategic deterrent triad--the SLBMs and ICBMs is not being \n     sustained.\n\n  Mr. President, it is clear that not only is a modernization program \nfor our nuclear weapons, the complex that supports it, and the delivery \nsystems associated with it long overdue, it is also inextricably linked \nto safely reducing our nuclear arsenal further and must be considered \nby the Senate simultaneously to, if not before, the START follow-on is \nsubmitted.\n  Such a modernization program should take into account issues raised \nby the Nuclear Weapons Council in its December 24, 2008, letter to the \nNNSA administrator.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 5.)\n  Mr. KYL. It should also take into account the commission's \nrecommendations, which noted that as long as modernization takes place \nwithin current policies regarding testing and military characteristics, \nthere should be no political controversy.\n  The administration should request a modernization program that in its \nfirst year includes: increases to stockpile surveillance; LEP studies \nfor W76 and B61 that add safety, reliability and credibility; increases \nto directed stockpile work; certification and safety at the Nevada Test \nSite; accelerated funding of the Los Alamos CMRR facility and the Y-12 \nUPF; and, increases to advanced computing platform and code work.\n  Mr. President, lastly, I wish to discuss an important but so far \noverlooked component of the pending arms control discussions, namely \nRussia's history of violating its obligations.\n  The unclassified version of the 2005 State Department Report on \nAdherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and \nDisarmament Agreements and Commitments makes clear, and not for the \nfirst time, that Russia has not lived up to all of its agreements under \nthe 1991 START agreement.\n  Dr. Payne noted this in his recent testimony, and I quote, ``in my \nopinion, the most important of these violations has been discussed \nopenly in Russian publications. It is the Russian testing of the SS-27 \nICBM with MIRVs in direct violation of START. The SS-27 is listed as a \nsingle-warhead ICBM and can only be tested and deployed with a single \nwarhead under START. Russian Sources place the number of MIRVs on this \nforthcoming missile at 4 or more.''\n  These are not the only such issues regarding the Russians compliance \nwith START. I ask unanimous consent that the START section of the \nunclassified Compliance Report be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 6.)\n  Mr. KYL. Additionally, the Commission on the Strategic Posture noted \nthat the Russians are in violation of their commitments concerning \ntactical nuclear weapons under the 1990-91 Presidential Nuclear \nInitiatives.\n\n       I remind my colleagues these are the same tactical nuclear \n     weapons that Russia refuses to discuss in the follow-on \n     treaty, a demand the administration seems to have accepted.\n\n  Clearly, if the United States is going to negotiate a successor to \nthe 1991 START agreement with the Russians, we must have a way to \nreconcile past compliance failures and ensure that future violations, \nif any, are resolved in a timely manner.\n  As I have articulated, there are significant issues that the Senate \nwill have to follow closely and scrutinize as a part of the process of \nadvice and consent.\n  This is a two-way process of consultation between the administration \nand the Senate.\n  I remind my colleagues and the administration, it is more important \nthat this be done right than quickly.\n  Arrangements can be made to ensure that the provisions of START that \nenjoy almost universal support in this body do not expire, as \nadministration officials have freely admitted.\n  I urge the administration to continue consulting regularly with the \nSenate, including the National Security Working Group that I cochair \nwith my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  U.S.-Russian START Renewal Negotiations--Guidelines To Protect U.S. \n                               Interests\n\n       Recognize that the U.S. nuclear deterrent force is a key \n     element in the defense of the United States and of our allies \n     and friends.\n       U.S. nuclear umbrella is crucial non-proliferation tool. \n     The U.S. nuclear umbrella is perhaps the most important \n     nonproliferation tool we possess, as many of our allies and \n     friends rely on our deterrent force. Absent a U.S. nuclear \n     deterrent seen to be credible, effective and safe, those \n     nations would have to consider developing their own nuclear \n     weapons.\n       Analyze first, then negotiate. The U.S. Defense Department \n     should complete a proper Nuclear Posture Review, as mandated \n     by Congress, before the U.S. concludes a new treaty with \n     Russia on further nuclear weapons reductions.\n       Limit Russian advantage in ``tactical'' nuclear weapons--A \n     new U.S.-Russian agreement should aim to reduce the current \n     Russian superiority over the U.S. in numbers of ``tactical'' \n     nuclear weapons. Russia has approximately ten times the \n     number of such weapons in the U.S. arsenal.\n       Address before U.S. leverage shrinks--The U.S. will have \n     less leverage to address this issue once a START renewal \n     agreement has been concluded.\n       Recognize the significance of Russia's large advantage in \n     ``tactical'' nuclear weapons. The distinction between \n     strategic and tactical nuclear weapons is an artifact of the \n     Cold War that facilitated arms control agreements on very \n     high levels of nuclear forces.\n       Today, the size of nuclear arsenals is much smaller and the \n     importance of large numbers of smaller-yield weapons is much \n     greater.\n       To U.S. allies and friends, all nuclear weapons are \n     strategic.\n       An agreement that preserves the large imbalance in total \n     numbers of deployed nuclear weapons in Russia's favor will, \n     over time, affect the views of U.S. allies and friends on the \n     reliability of the U.S. nuclear umbrella.\n       U.S. policy for decades--in administrations of both \n     parties--has been to maintain a nuclear capability second to \n     none. That policy would be undermined by an agreement that \n     further reduces strategic weapons while leaving so-called \n     non-strategic weapons unlimited.\n       Recognize existence of risks in strategic reductions below \n     current levels--There is no compelling reason for the U.S. \n     and Russia to reduce deployed strategic nuclear warheads \n     below the current range of 1700-2200, as set in the Strategic \n     Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT). This level of offensive \n     strategic nuclear arms, the lowest in decades, was based on \n     analysis that took into account the dangers and uncertainties \n     of the security environment. Quickly reducing to an arbitrary \n     number like 1500, does not take into account these risks.\n       Don't pay for what's free--According to credible Russian \n     sources, Russia's strategic nuclear weapons will be reduced \n     by approximately 60% over the next decade in any event--with \n     or without a START renewal treaty--due to the aging or \n     planned modernization of systems. The United States should \n     not make concessions for the purpose of inducing Russia to \n     make reductions that will occur anyway.\n       Certain reductions may be harmful--Whether a reduction \n     below the 1700-2200 range is prudent depends on a number of \n     considerations, especially preserving deterrence and taking \n     account of all potential adversaries.\n       Preserve deterrence and extended deterrence--Any reductions \n     should allow the U.S. to preserve not only deterrence of \n     threats directly against the U.S. but also extended \n     deterrence--for allies and partners who depend on the U.S. to \n     deter potential nuclear aggressors.\n       Effect on triad--In particular, any reductions should allow \n     the U.S. to maintain a robust nuclear triad of land-based, \n     sea-based and bomber-delivered weapons.\n       Importance of triad--It is important to maintain the triad, \n     lest the survivability and flexibility of the U.S. strategic \n     posture be undermined.\n       Consider all potential adversaries--In assessing the \n     sufficiency of the U.S. deterrent, the potential nuclear \n     capabilities of all possible adversaries of the U.S. and of \n     allies and partners who depend on that deterrent should be \n     considered, not just the capabilities of Russia.\n       Don't incentivize proliferation--The U.S. nuclear posture \n     should not be constrained to the point that other current or \n     potential nuclear powers come to believe they can create a \n     nuclear arsenal that would give them significant strategic \n     leverage against the U.S.\n       In any case, exercise caution in limiting delivery \n     systems--In the interest of stability and flexibility, the \n     U.S. should not agree to reduce the number of delivery \n     systems in a way that would increase the vulnerability of \n     our deterrent (including our extended deterrent that \n     protects U.S. allies and partners).\n       Don't incentivize MIRVs--For the same reasons, a new \n     agreement should not restrain or penalize ``de-MIRVing''--\n     that is, converting multiple-warhead missiles into single-\n     warhead missiles.\n\n[[Page S7345]]\n\n       Severe limits on the number of delivery systems create \n     pressure for the parties to arm missiles with multiple \n     warheads.\n       Preserve U.S. ability to modernize for safety and \n     reliability--Any agreement should preserve the right of the \n     U.S. to develop new warheads to be able to react to \n     unforeseen circumstances.\n       A crucial requirement: A comprehensive modernization plan--\n     The Senate should not consent to any treaty until the \n     Administration has proposed to Congress a satisfactory, \n     comprehensive modernization plan that fulfills the \n     modernization recommendations of the bipartisan Congressional \n     Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, \n     especially the maintenance of a safe, reliable and credible \n     U.S. nuclear deterrent, including an extended deterrent for \n     the protection of U.S. allies and partners.\n       Don't constrain missile defense--A new U.S.-Russian arms \n     control agreement should not constrain the U.S. ability to \n     develop and deploy missile defenses.\n       Don't constrain advanced conventional weapons--A new U.S.-\n     Russian agreement should not constrain or penalize (1) U.S. \n     development of advanced conventional--that is, non-nuclear \n     weapons, including those capable of strategic strike, or (2) \n     U.S. deployment of such weapons to replace nuclear weapons.\n       Take account of unpredictability of technology \n     developments--We cannot now predict what conventional weapons \n     developments may be possible.\n       Consider effects on programs of the future--Thus, the \n     effect of a given treaty limitation cannot be measured only \n     by how it would impact programs already on the books.\n       Address Russian compliance problems--Devise a mechanism \n     that ensures treaty violations are investigated and parties \n     to an agreement adhere to their obligations.\n       From the outset, the Russians have failed to comply fully \n     with their obligations.\n       For example, according to an August 2005 U.S. State \n     Department report, Russia has prevented U.S. inspectors from \n     verifying warhead limits on certain ICBMs.\n       Update START verification--A key U.S. objective in an \n     agreement with Russia should be to update START verification \n     provisions to take account of new circumstances and fix \n     problems.\n       Verification regime extendable--Obama administration \n     officials have a sense of urgency because the START Treaty \n     expires in December 2009 and they want to ensure that the \n     treaty's verification regime does not lapse. But the US and \n     Russia can agree to extend the verification regime without \n     having to rush to reach agreement on further weapons \n     reductions.\n       Endorsed by:\n       John Bolton, Ambassador to United Nations, Under Secretary \n     of State for Arms Control and International Security (G.W. \n     Bush);\n       Seth Cropsey, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for \n     Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (G.H.W.

A provision to the effect that each Party will reduce \n     and limit its strategic offensive arms so that seven years \n     after entry into force of the treaty and thereafter, the \n     limits will be in the range of 500-1100 for strategic \n     delivery vehicles, and in the range of 1500-1675 for their \n     associated warheads.\n       The specific numbers to be recorded in the treaty for these \n     limits will be agreed through further negotiations.\n       2. Provisions for calculating these limits.\n       3.

A provision to the effect that each Party will determine \n     for itself the composition and structure of its strategic \n     offensive arms.\n       5. A provision on the interrelationship of strategic \n     offensive and strategic defensive arms.\n       6. A provision on the impact of intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles in a non-\n     nuclear configuration on strategic stability.\n       7. A provision on basing strategic offensive arms \n     exclusively on the national territory of each Party.\n       8. Establishment of an implementation body to resolve \n     questions related to treaty implementation.\n       9. A provision to the effect that the treaty will not apply \n     to existing patterns of cooperation in the area of strategic \n     offensive arms between a Party and a third state.\n       10. A duration of the treaty of ten years, unless it is \n     superseded before that time by a subsequent treaty on the \n     reduction of strategic offensive arms.\n       The Presidents direct their negotiators to finish their \n     work on the treaty at an early date so that they may sign and \n     submit it for ratification in their respective countries.\n       Signed at Moscow, this sixth day of July, 2009, in \n     duplicate, in the English and Russian languages.\n       FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\n\n       FOR THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION:\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 7, 2007]\n\n                          Blame America First\n\n                         (By Stephen Rademaker)\n\n       Two groups with diametrically opposed agendas have for \n     years argued that the likes of Iran and North Korea will not \n     be deterred in their quest for nuclear weapons so long as the \n     U.S. and the other nuclear powers are ignoring their \n     obligation under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) to \n     give up their nuclear arsenals. Apologists for the \n     proliferators, who care not at all about nuclear disarmament, \n     and arms control activists, to whom there is no higher \n     priority than nuclear disarmament, have long agreed about \n     this and little else.\n       Jimmy Carter spoke for the latter group when he wrote, in \n     an op-ed in the Washington Post a while back, ``The United \n     States is the major culprit in this erosion of the NPT.'' The \n     key to ending nuclear proliferation, according to Mr. Carter \n     and the many others who share this point of view, is for the \n     U.S. to demonstrate leadership by moving decisively to \n     eliminate its nuclear weapons. This perspective is likely to \n     be heard more frequently as international efforts to \n     constrain the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea \n     appear to falter.\n       There are, however, two basic flaws in the suggestion that \n     nuclear proliferation is rooted in U.S. nuclear policy. \n     First, the reasons why Iran, North Korea and other would-be \n     proliferators seek nuclear weapons have nothing to do with \n     Washington's nuclear policy. Second, the claim that the U.S. \n     is disregarding its legal obligations under the NPT does not \n     withstand scrutiny.\n       To recognize that the motivations of today's nuclear \n     proliferators have nothing to do with U.S. nuclear policy, it \n     is necessary only to consider one question: Would Iran's \n     Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or North Korea's Kim Jong Il be any less \n     interested in having nuclear weapons if the U.S. gave up its \n     nuclear weapons? In both cases, the answer is clearly no.\n       President Ahmadinejad, by his own statements, is bent on \n     dominating the Middle East and destroying the state of \n     Israel. Nuclear weapons afford a shortcut to the realization \n     of these objectives and therefore the Iranian regime wants \n     them. Whether or not the U.S. has nuclear weapons is \n     irrelevant to this calculus. Mr. Ahmadinejad may occasionally \n     find it a convenient talking point to draw comparisons with \n     the nuclear programs of other countries, but there is little \n     doubt his policy would be the same even in the absence of \n     that talking point.\n       In the case of North Korea, the pursuit of nuclear weapons \n     appears to stem from Kim Jong Il's hunger for prestige and \n     power. All indications are that Kim would be even more \n     interested in having nuclear weapons if he thought he could \n     be the only leader on Earth to possess them.\n       Those who argue that the U.S. has disregarded its nuclear \n     disarmament obligations under the NPT are quick to make \n     categorical assertions about the treaty's requirements, but \n     almost never quote the pertinent language of the NPT, for the \n     simple reason that it provides no support for their claims. \n     The key provision, Article VI of the treaty, consists of only \n     one sentence: ``Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes \n     to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures \n     relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early \n     date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a Treaty on general \n     and complete disarmament under strict and effective \n     international control.''\n       It is impossible to discern from this language a binding \n     legal obligation on the U.S. and the other four nuclear-\n     weapon states to give up nuclear weapons. The operative legal \n     requirement is to ``pursue negotiations in good faith on \n     effective measures relating . . . to nuclear disarmament. . . \n     .''\n       The U.S. has not only negotiated on such matters for more \n     than three decades, but it has signed and implemented a \n     series of arms control agreements beginning in 1972 that have \n     ended the nuclear arms race and substantially reduced the \n     U.S. nuclear inventory. When the latest arms control \n     agreement with Russia expires in 2012, the U.S.\n\n[[Page S7346]]\n\n     will have reduced by about 80% the number of strategic \n     nuclear warheads deployed at the height of the Cold War.\n       Significantly, the obligations of Article VI apply not just \n     to the five countries allowed by the treaty to have nuclear \n     weapons, but to all parties to the NPT. Article VI clearly \n     links the obligation to negotiate on nuclear disarmament with \n     an obligation on the part of all NPT parties to negotiate ``a \n     Treaty on general and complete disarmament.''\n       The treaty also does not assume that nuclear disarmament \n     must be a prerequisite to general and complete disarmament. \n     To the contrary, one of the treaty's introductory paragraphs \n     spells out the expectation of the parties that actual \n     ``elimination from national arsenals of nuclear weapons'' \n     would take place not prior to, but ``pursuant to a Treaty on \n     general and complete disarmament.''\n       Those who in essence agree with the views of a Noam Chomsky \n     that ``The United States has led the way in refusal to abide \n     by the Article VI obligations,'' notwithstanding more than 30 \n     years of nuclear arms control, need to explain why they are \n     not similarly exercised by the failure of all other NPT \n     states to satisfy their Article VI obligations. In \n     particular, they need to explain why the U.S. must do more to \n     comply with Article VI's nuclear disarmament provisions, in \n     the absence of even token steps by anyone else to comply with \n     that Article's general and complete disarmament requirements.\n       Because the language of Article VI does not actually say \n     what proponents of nuclear disarmament want it to say, they \n     have worked for decades to reinterpret it. They have, for \n     example, promoted declarations by international conferences \n     reformulating the requirements of Article VI, and then argued \n     that these reformulations are legally binding on the U.S., \n     without approval by the U.S. Senate. These efforts have \n     succeeded to a remarkable degree, at least as measured by \n     popular conceptions of the NPT's nuclear-disarmament \n     requirements.\n       And so the critics are not impressed that by 2012 the U.S. \n     will have reduced its deployed strategic nuclear warheads by \n     80%. They will not be satisfied if the U.S. reduces by 99%. \n     So long as there is one nuclear weapon remaining in the U.S. \n     inventory, they will point to this as a root cause of nuclear \n     proliferation.\n       Few serious students of nuclear strategy believe that the \n     stockpiles of the nuclear weapon states can be reduced to \n     zero in the foreseeable future. Fortunately our reliance on \n     nuclear weapons has been declining, and the U.S. should \n     continue to eliminate unnecessary nuclear weapons based on \n     considered judgments about our national security \n     requirements. But we should not base such decisions about our \n     nuclear force structure on wishful thinking that we can earn \n     the goodwill of nuclear proliferators and other critics whose \n     agendas are advanced by blaming America for nuclear \n     proliferation.\n\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 8, 2009]\n\n                          Arms Control Amnesia\n\n                          (By Keith B. Payne)\n\n       Three hours after arriving at the Kremlin yesterday, \n     President Barack Obama signed a preliminary agreement on a \n     new nuclear arms-control treaty with Russian President Dmitry \n     Medvedev. The agreement--a clear road map for a new strategic \n     Arms Reduction Treaty (START)--commits the U.S. and Russia to \n     cut their nuclear weapons to the lowest levels since the \n     early years of the Cold War.\n       Mr. Obama praised the agreement as a step forward, away \n     from the ``suspicion and rivalry of the past,'' while Mr. \n     Medvedev hailed it as a ``reasonable compromise.'' In fact, \n     given the range of force levels it permits, this agreement \n     has the potential to compromise U.S. security--depending on \n     what happens next.\n       In the first place, locking in specific reductions for U.S. \n     forces prior to the conclusion of the ongoing Nuclear Posture \n     Review is putting the cart before the horse. The Obama \n     administration's team at the Pentagon is currently examining \n     U.S. strategic force requirements. Before specific limits are \n     set on U.S. forces, it should complete the review. Strategic \n     requirements should drive force numbers; arms-control numbers \n     should not dictate strategy.\n       Second, the new agreement not only calls for reductions in \n     the number of nuclear warheads (to between 1,500 and 1,675), \n     but for cuts in the number of strategic force launchers. \n     Under the 1991 START I Treaty, each side was limited to 1,600 \n     launchers. Yesterday's agreement calls for each side to be \n     limited to between 500 and 1,100 launchers each.\n       According to open Russian sources, it was Russia that \n     pushed for the lower limit of 500 launchers in negotiations. \n     In the weeks leading up to this summit, it also has been \n     openly stated that Moscow would like the number of deployed \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-\n     launched missiles (SLBMS), and strategic bombers to be \n     reduced ``several times'' below the current limit of 1,600. \n     Moving toward very low numbers of launchers is a smart \n     position for Russia, but not for the U.S.\n       Why? Because the number of deployed Russian strategic \n     ICBMs, SLBMs, and bombers will drop dramatically simply as a \n     result of their aging. In other words, a large number of \n     Russian launchers will be removed from service with or \n     without a new arms-control agreement.\n       The Obama administration will undoubtedly come under heavy \n     pressure to move to the low end of the 500-1,100 limit on \n     launchers in order to match Russian reductions. But it need \n     not and should not do so. Based solely on open Russian \n     sources, by 2017-2018 Russia will likely have fewer than half \n     of the approximately 680 operational launchers it has today. \n     With a gross domestic product less than that of California, \n     Russia is confronting the dilemma of how to maintain parity \n     with the U.S. while retiring its many aged strategic forces.\n       Mr. Medvedev's solution is to negotiate, inviting the U.S. \n     to make real cuts, while Russia eliminates nothing that it \n     wouldn't retire in any event.\n       This isn't just my conclusion--it's the conclusion of many \n     Russian officials and commentators. Russian Gen. Nikolay \n     Solovtsov, commander of the Strategic Missile Troops, was \n     recently quoted by Moscow Interfax-AVN Online as saying that \n     ``not a single Russian launcher'' with ``remaining service \n     life'' will be withdrawn under a new agreement. Noted Russian \n     journalist Pavel Felgengauer observed in Novaya Gazeta that \n     Russian leaders ``have demanded of the Americans unilateral \n     concessions on all points, offering practically nothing in \n     exchange.'' Precisely.\n       Beyond the bad negotiating principle of giving up something \n     for nothing, there will be serious downsides if the U.S. \n     actually reduces its strategic launchers as much as Moscow \n     wishes. The bipartisan Congressional Strategic Posture \n     Commission--headed by former secretaries of defense William \n     J. Perry and James R. Schlesinger--concluded that the U.S. \n     could make reductions ``if this were done while also \n     preserving the resilience and survivability of U.S. forces.'' \n     Having very low numbers of launchers would make the U.S. more \n     vulnerable to destabilizing first-strike dangers, and would \n     reduce or eliminate the U.S. ability to adapt its nuclear \n     deterrent to an increasingly diverse set of post-Cold War \n     nuclear and biological weapons threats.\n       Accepting low launcher numbers would also encourage placing \n     more warheads on the remaining ICBMs--i.e., ``MIRVing,'' or \n     adding multiple independently targeted warheads on a single \n     missile. This is what the Russians openly say they are \n     planning to do. Yet the U.S. has long sought to move away \n     from MIRVed ICBMs as part of START, because heavy MIRVing can \n     make each ICBM a more tempting target. One measure of U.S. \n     success will be in resisting the Russian claim that severely \n     reducing launcher numbers is somehow necessary and \n     ``stabilizing.'' It would be neither.\n       Third, the new agreement appears to defer the matter of so-\n     called tactical nuclear weapons. Russia has some 4,000 \n     tactical nuclear weapons and many thousands more in reserve; \n     U.S. officials have said that Russia has an astounding 10 to \n     1 numerical advantage. These weapons are of greatest concern \n     with regard to the potential for nuclear war, and they should \n     be our focus for arms reduction. The Perry-Schlesinger \n     commission report identified Russian tactical nuclear weapons \n     as an ``urgent'' problem. Yet at this point, they appear to \n     be off the table.\n       The administration may hope to negotiate reductions in \n     tactical nuclear weapons later. But Russia has rejected this \n     in the past, and nothing seems to have changed. As Gen. \n     Vladimir Dvorkin of the Russian Academy of Sciences said \n     recently in Moscow Interfax-AVN Online, ``A treaty on the \n     limitation and reduction of tactical nuclear weapons looks \n     absolutely unrealistic.'' If the U.S. hopes to address this \n     real problem, it must maintain negotiating leverage in the \n     form of strategic launchers and weapons.\n       Fourth, Mr. Medvedev was quoted recently in RIA Novosti as \n     saying that strategic reductions are possible only if the \n     U.S. alleviates Russian concerns about ``U.S. plans to create \n     a global missile defense.'' There will surely be domestic and \n     international pressure on the U.S. to limit missile defense \n     to facilitate Russian reductions under the new treaty. But \n     the U.S. need for missile defense has little to do with \n     Russia. And the value of missile defense could not be clearer \n     given recent North Korean belligerence. The Russians are \n     demanding this linkage, at least in part to kill our missile \n     defense site in Europe intended to defend against Iranian \n     missiles. Another measure of U.S. success will be to avoid \n     such linkages.\n       In short, Russian leaders hope to control or eliminate many \n     elements of U.S. military power in exchange for strategic \n     force reductions they will have to make anyway. U.S. leaders \n     should not agree to pay Russia many times over for \n     essentially an empty box.\n       Finally, Russian violations of its existing arms-control \n     commitments must be addressed along with any new commitments. \n     According to an August 2005 State Department report, Russia \n     has violated START verification and other arms-control \n     commitments in multiple ways. One significant violation has \n     even been discussed openly in Russian publications--the \n     testing of the SS-27 ICBM with MIRVs in direct violation of \n     START I.\n       President Obama should recall Winston Churchill's warning: \n     ``Be careful above all things not to let go of the atomic \n     weapon until you are sure and more than sure that other means \n     of preserving peace are in your hands.'' There is no need for \n     the U.S. to accept Russian demands for missile-defense \n     linkage, or deep reductions in the number of our ICBMs, SLBMs \n     and bombers, to realize much lower numbers of Russian \n     strategic\n\n[[Page S7347]]\n\n     systems. There is also no basis for expecting Russian \n     goodwill if we do so.\n\n                               Exhibit 5\n\n         Department of Defense and Department of Energy Nuclear \n           Weapons Council,\n                                Washington, DC, December 24, 2008.\n     Hon. Thomas P. D'Agostino,\n     Administrator, National Nuclear Security Administration, \n         Department of Energy, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. D'Agostino: The Department of Defense (DoD) and \n     the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), have \n     joint responsibility to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable \n     nuclear weapons stockpile and supporting infrastructure to \n     provide the United States a credible nuclear deterrent. I \n     understand that NNSA is implementing Records of Decision \n     (RODs), in connection with the recently completed \n     Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement \n     (SPEIS), regarding the future U.S. nuclear weapons complex. \n     Our staffs have been working together to address the detailed \n     issues associated with the SPEIS decisions, including \n     specific requirements the nuclear weapons complex must \n     achieve to enable stockpile and infrastructure \n     transformation.\n       The U.S. nuclear deterrent continues to serve as the \n     ultimate guarantor of U.S. security and our security \n     commitments to allies. The required size and composition of \n     the nuclear weapons stockpile is dependent on the global \n     security environment and the ability to respond to \n     unanticipated technical problems. We cannot know with \n     certainty the future global security environment, nor can we \n     predict the nature or extent of potential problems with \n     warheads or delivery systems. These factors argue for a \n     flexible nuclear weapons infrastructure capable of responding \n     to future geopolitical or technical challenges.\n       To minimize stockpile size and reduce the likelihood that a \n     return to underground nuclear testing will be needed in the \n     future, DoD will require a warhead with modern safety, \n     security, and use control features. In addition, DoD will \n     continue to rely on life extension of legacy warheads and \n     therefore requires an infrastructure capable of developing \n     and producing these warheads. Of critical importance, and \n     independent of future stockpile planning, our nuclear \n     infrastructure must ensure that our future stockpile is:\n       Safe and Secure: To the degree feasible, refurbished or \n     replacement warheads will incorporate enhanced safety \n     features such as: insensitive high explosives, multipoint \n     safety, meet all other safety-related Military \n     Characteristics, and be protected against theft and sabotage \n     including the possibility of unauthorized or accidental \n     detonation.\n       Reliable: U.S. nuclear forces must be able to hold at risk \n     those critical capabilities of our potential enemies that are \n     defined by presidential guidance. Increased performance \n     margins should be pursued in weapon refurbishment or \n     replacement programs, ensuring with high confidence that our \n     nuclear weapons are reliable and credible while reducing the \n     likelihood of a return to underground nuclear testing.\n       Adaptable: The NNSA should employ, to the maximum extent \n     possible in refurbished or replacement weapons, modular \n     designs that are interoperable between multiple delivery \n     platforms.\n       In light of these standards and the need to achieve and \n     modernize a responsive nuclear infrastructure, the DoD \n     recommends the NNSA RODs regarding the future of the nuclear \n     weapons complex take into account the following:\n       Independent of the size of the future nuclear weapons \n     stockpile, provide a plutonium research, development, and \n     manufacturing capability that will ensure (1) continued \n     excellence in plutonium research, (2) an ability to conduct \n     surveillance of plutonium pits, and (3) a capacity to deliver \n     newly manufactured pits with actual production rates \n     determined by NNSA that, when coupled with full exercise of \n     analytical chemistry and other quality control processes, \n     will demonstrate key capabilities and meet stockpile \n     requirements. As stated in the March 2008 ``National Security \n     and Nuclear Weapons in the 21st Century'' paper signed by \n     Secretaries Gates and Bodman, planned pit production \n     facilities should be capable of providing an estimated \n     maximum capacity of 50-80 pits per year. Near-term planning \n     for pit manufacturing capacity should be executed in a way \n     that does not foreclose appropriate adjustments in capacity \n     if necessary in the future.\n       Provide an infrastructure to produce, with sufficient \n     capacity, uranium and other components of nuclear warhead \n     canned subassemblies, and to support surveillance and \n     dismantlement activities.\n       Maintain the ability to produce tritium in quantities \n     sufficient to support the stockpile.\n       Maintain the ability to conduct surveillance of all \n     components of nuclear warheads so that potential reliability \n     issues can be quickly identified, allowing responsive \n     correction.\n       Provide sufficient capacity for warhead assembly and \n     disassembly that takes into account upcoming warhead life \n     extension programs, the potential introduction of replacement \n     warheads with enhanced surety features, and the capability to \n     address future and emerging requirements, while at the same \n     time addressing the growing number of warheads slated for \n     dismantlement resulting from recent stockpile reductions \n     directed by the President.\n       Complete and sustain the research and development, \n     scientific, computational and experimental facilities and \n     capabilities, including warhead design, engineering and \n     production skills needed to support the future stockpile.\n       Ensure a 24-36 month preparedness to conduct, as may be \n     required, an underground nuclear test to help resolve a \n     safety or technical problem in the stockpile.\n       As you implement the RODs regarding the future complex, I \n     trust that you will fully consider these requirements and \n     request that you update the Nuclear Weapons Council on \n     progress at an upcoming meeting.\n\n                                                     ------ ------\n                               (For John J.

THE STRATEGIC ARMS REDUCTION TREATY (START)\n\n       Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine are in compliance \n     with the START strategic offensive arms (SOA) central limits. \n     Both the United States and Russia met the START seven-year \n     reduction final ceilings of 1,600 delivery vehicles and 6,000 \n     attributed warheads by the December 4, 2001, deadline. By \n     December 2001, these four Former Soviet Union (FSU) successor \n     states had reduced their aggregate forces to 1,136 deployed \n     launchers, 5,518 deployed warheads, and 4,894 deployed \n     ballistic missile warheads, as defined by Article II of the \n     Treaty, and all strategic weapons had been removed or \n     eliminated from the territories of Ukraine, Belarus, and \n     Kazakhstan. Additionally, START required the four FSU \n     successor states to eliminate at least 154 heavy ICBM (SS-\n     18)silo launchers by December 2001. In the original MOU, \n     dated September 1, 1990, the Soviet Union declared 308 SS-18 \n     heavy ICBM silo launchers. As of November 30, 2001, a total \n     of 158 SS-18 silo launchers had been eliminated--104 in \n     Kazakhstan and 54 in Russia--leaving a total of 150 deployed \n     heavy ICBMs.\n       Notwithstanding the overall success of START \n     implementation, a significant number of longstanding \n     compliance issues that have been raised in the START Treaty's \n     Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission (JCIC) remain \n     unresolved. The Parties continue to work through diplomatic \n     channels and in the JCIC to ensure smooth implementation of \n     the Treaty and effective resolution of compliance issues and \n     questions.\n       The United States raised six new compliance issues during \n     the period of this report. The United States considers four \n     of these to have been closed. However, several previous--\n     often long-standing--compliance issues remain unresolved. A \n     number of these issues, some of which originated as early as \n     the first year of Treaty implementation, highlight the \n     different interpretations of the Parties about how to \n     implement the complex inspection and verification provisions \n     of the START Treaty.\n\n\n                              ICBM ISSUES\n\n       Inability to Confirm during Reentry Vehicle Inspections \n     (RVOSIs) that the Number of Attributed ICBM Warheads Has Not \n     Been Exceeded. During RVOSIs of deployed Russian ICBMs, U.S. \n     inspectors have been hampered, in some cases, from \n     ascertaining whether the missile had a front section, or that \n     the front section contained no more reentry vehicles (RVs) \n     than the number of warheads attributed to a missile of the \n     declared type under the Treaty.\n       The purpose of an RVOSI, as set forth in paragraph 6 of \n     Article XI of the Treaty, is to confirm that a ballistic \n     missile contains no more RVs than the number of warheads \n     attributed to a missile of that type.\n       The RVOSI procedures are referenced in paragraph 16 of \n     Section IX of the Inspection Protocol and contained in Annex \n     3 to the Inspection Protocol. Paragraph 11 of Annex 3 allows \n     the inspected Party to cover RVs. Inspectors have a right to \n     view these covers and to measure hard covers prior to their \n     placement on the RVs. The covers are then installed on the \n     RVs before the inspectors view the front section. Under the \n     Treaty, such covers must not hamper inspectors in \n     ascertaining that the front section contains no more RVs than \n     the number of warheads attributed to a missile of that type. \n     Russian RV covers, in some instances, are too large; \n     consequently, they fail to meet this requirement.\n       During certain RVOSIs, Russia did not demonstrate to the \n     satisfaction of the U.S. inspection team that additional \n     covered objects located on the front section, and declared by \n     Russia not to be RVs, were not RVs. Although START does not \n     differentiate between nuclear and non-nuclear RVs, Russia's \n     willingness to use radiation detection equipment (RDE) during \n     such RVOSIs to establish that the extra objects were not \n     nuclear has been useful for resolving some, but not all, U.S. \n     concerns.\n       FINDING. Russian RV covers, and their method of \n     emplacement, have in some cases hampered U.S. inspectors from \n     ascertaining that the front section of the missiles contains \n     no more RVs than the number of warheads attributed to a \n     missile of that type under the Treaty. Russian cooperation in \n     the use of RDE and other measures has been helpful in \n     addressing some, but not all, of the difficulties encountered \n     by U.S. inspectors.\n\n[[Page S7348]]\n\n       Russian Road-Mobile Launchers' ``Break-in.'' Russia has \n     failed to declare certain road-mobile launchers of ICBMs when \n     they first leave their production facility, as required by \n     the Treaty. Russia has moved some of these launchers to an \n     undeclared ``break-in'' area located over 60 miles from the \n     production facility without declaring that they have left the \n     production facility and are accountable under the Treaty.\n       Pursuant to paragraph 6(b) of Article III of the Treaty, a \n     mobile launcher of ICBMs becomes subject to the Treaty \n     limitations when it first leaves a production facility. Not \n     later than five days following the first exit of such a newly \n     produced non-deployed road-mobile launcher, and its entry \n     into Treaty accountability, Section I of the Notification \n     Protocol requires the Party producing the new Treaty-\n     accountable item to provide a notification of this change in \n     data. Except for transits, Parties are proscribed from \n     locating non-deployed mobile launchers outside the boundaries \n     of the START-declared facilities identified in subparagraph \n     9(b) of Article IV of the Treaty.\n       FINDING.

Russia based some deployed SS-25 \n     road-mobile launchers outside their declared restricted areas \n     (RAs) at two road-mobile ICBM bases while these RAs were \n     under construction. The United States and Russia concluded a \n     temporary, interim policy arrangement regarding the conduct \n     of inspections and cooperative measures at the facilities \n     where the launchers were housed during the period of \n     construction. This arrangement permitted U.S. inspectors to \n     conduct data update inspections and RVOSIs that they had not \n     previously been able to perform, and allowed Russia to \n     cooperate fully with providing cooperative measures access \n     for the launchers that were previously unavailable. All of \n     these road-mobile ICBMs and their launchers have since been \n     transferred from their bases, and their declared RAs have \n     been eliminated as START facilities.\n       FINDING. Notwithstanding the interim policy arrangement, \n     Russia's practice of locating deployed SS-25 road-mobile \n     launchers outside their declared RAs for long periods of time \n     constituted basing in a manner that violated the provisions \n     of paragraphs 1 and 9 of Article VI of the Treaty. This \n     practice has ceased and the United States considers this \n     issue closed.\n       Denial of the Right to Measure Certain Deployed ICBM Launch \n     Canisters on Mobile Launchers. U.S. inspectors have been \n     prevented from exercising the Treaty right to measure certain \n     ICBM launch canisters on mobile launchers, both deployed and \n     non-deployed, that are encountered during data update \n     inspections to confirm data regarding the type of item of \n     inspection. Russia, for instance, has prevented U.S. \n     inspectors from measuring launch canisters for SS-24 ICBMs \n     contained in rail-mobile launchers that are located within \n     the boundaries of an inspection site. Similar concerns have \n     arisen with regard to launch canisters for SS-25 and SS-27 \n     mobile ICBMs located on road-mobile launchers. With regard to \n     launch canisters for these latter types, Russia and the \n     United States have agreed upon a policy arrangement to \n     address this issue, though it has not yet been implemented \n     for the SS-27 ICBM.\n       Subparagraph 20(a) of Section VI of the Inspection Protocol \n     identifies ICBM launch canisters as one of the items of \n     inspection for data update inspections. In accordance with \n     the procedures in Annex 1 to the Inspection Protocol, \n     inspectors have the right to confirm the number and, if \n     applicable, the types of items of inspection that are \n     specified for the facility to be inspected and declared for \n     the inspection site, and the right to confirm the absence of \n     any other item of inspection at the inspection site. Pursuant \n     to paragraph 6 of Annex 1, inspectors may view and measure \n     the dimensions of a launch canister declared to contain an \n     item of inspection to confirm it is of the declared type.\n       FINDING. Russia prevented U.S. inspectors from exercising \n     their Treaty right to measure launch canisters for SS-24 \n     ICBMs contained in rail-mobile launchers that are located \n     within the boundaries of an inspection site, in contravention \n     of paragraphs 1 and 6 of Annex 1 to the Inspection Protocol. \n     With regard to launch canisters for SS-25 and SS-27 ICBMs \n     located on road-mobile launchers, the Parties have agreed \n     upon a policy arrangement to address this issue, but it has \n     not yet been implemented for the SS-27 ICBM.\n\n\n                            TELEMETRY ISSUES\n\n       As part of the START verification regime, the Parties are \n     obligated to notify each other of missile flight tests and to \n     exchange telemetry tapes, tape summaries, interpretive data, \n     and acceleration profiles for each flight test of a START-\n     accountable ICBM or SLBM. The United States has raised \n     several concerns regarding Russia's failure to provide all \n     Treaty-required telemetry materials for some START-\n     accountable flight tests in violation of paragraphs 4 and 5 \n     of Article X of the Treaty, and paragraph 1 of Section I and \n     paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section II of the Telemetry Protocol.\n       FINDING. Russia has in some instances failed to comply with \n     Treaty requirements regarding the provision of telemetry \n     information on missile flight testing pursuant to Article X \n     of the START Treaty and Sections I and II of the Telemetry \n     Protocol.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis courtesy. I enjoyed hearing his remarks. No Senator on either side \nof the aisle has been a more consistent spokesman on military \npreparedness than Senator Kyl has been over the years. His concern \nabout our nuclear stockpile is well known and very important. I hope \nall Americans will pay close attention to what he had to say.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 20 minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, our job in the Senate is to debate. We \nare said to be the greatest deliberative body in the world. The great \nconflicts in our country come here so that we can resolve them. After 6 \nmonths of President Obama's administration, Americans admire him, like \nhim, like his family, and appreciate his seriousness of purpose. But \nAmericans are beginning to see some significant differences of opinion \nbetween the kind of country the Democrats are imagining for our Nation \nand the kind of country Republicans and many independents are \nimagining. There is concern in Tennessee, as well as around the \ncountry, about the lack of checks and balances on too much debt and too \nmany Washington takeovers.\n  In terms of debt, we see the President's proposals for debt for the \nnext 10 years are nearly three times as much as all of the money the \nUnited States spent in World War II. As far as Washington takeovers, it \nseems to be a weekly running reality show. First the banks; then the \ninsurance companies; then the student loans; then the car companies \neven, according to recent legislation; your farm pond, according to \nsome Federal legislation; and now maybe even health care.\n  But people have a right to say to us on this side of the aisle: What \nwould you Republicans do? You can't just point with alarm--although \nthat is part of our job. What would Republicans do?\n  I wanted to mention three areas where Republicans have a different \nopinion than the current administration and where we hope we might \npersuade the American people and many Democrats and even the President \nto join us on a different path for the country. The first has to do \nwith the Government's ownership of General Motors. We want to give the \nstock back to the people who paid for it, the taxpayers. The second has \nto do with health care. We want to begin at the other end of the \ndiscussion. We want to start with the 250 million Americans who already \nhave health care and make sure they can afford it. After we are through \nmaking sure of that, that they can afford their government, because \nthey can't afford these trillion-dollar additions to health care we \nkeep hearing about.\n  Third, on clean energy, we want clean energy as well as the President \ndoes. But we also want energy that Americans can afford. We know cheap \nenergy is key to our economic success. We want jobs to be made. We want \ncars to be made in Michigan and Ohio and Tennessee and not Mexico or \nJapan. We have a plan for clean energy that is low cost, that will \nreduce utility bills and keep jobs here which would compare with the \nWaxman-Markey climate change bill passed by the House and headed our \nway.\n  I would like to talk about each of those three very briefly. First, \nGeneral Motors. I congratulate the new GM for emerging from bankruptcy \ntoday. General Motors has meant a great deal to our country and a great \ndeal to our State, Tennessee. When General Motors decided nearly 25 \nyears ago to put the Saturn plant in Tennessee, we had very few auto \njobs. Nissan had already made a decision to come to our State. That was \na pioneering decision because most auto plants were in the Midwest. \nToday there are a dozen such auto plants, including the General Motors \nplant in Spring Hill. In Tennessee, instead of having a few auto jobs, \na third of our manufacturing jobs are auto jobs.\n  So we are grateful to General Motors for its decision 24 years ago, \nand we\n\n[[Page S7349]]\n\nwant it to succeed. We want that Spring Hill plant to be making some GM \nproducts soon and believe that it will be because of all the natural \nadvantages it has.\n  What are the best ways we in Washington can help General Motors \nsucceed? That was the question asked of me last week in Tennessee. The \nanswer is to get the General Motors stock that is owned by the \ngovernment out of Washington, DC, and into the hands of the taxpayers. \nI have legislation I have introduced, and I am looking for the \nopportunity to amend an appropriate bill on the Senate floor that is \ncosponsored by the Republican leader and Senator Kyl and a variety of \nothers. It would take the 60 percent of General Motors the U.S. \nGovernment owns and give it to the 120 million Americans who pay taxes \non April 15.\n  What is the reason for doing that? They paid for it. They should own \nit. What is the second reason for doing that? If the stock stays here, \nwe find that Washington bureaucrats and those of us in Congress can't \nkeep our hands off the car company.\n  We have the President calling up the mayor of Detroit saying: Yes, I \nthink the headquarters ought to be in Detroit instead of Warren, MI. We \nhave the Congressman from Massachusetts calling up the president of \nGeneral Motors saying: Don't close the warehouse in my district. And \nyou have the delegation from Tennessee and from Indiana and Michigan \nsaying: Put a car plant here. And you have 60 committees in Congress \nauthorized to summon the executives here--we own the company, after \nall; let's hear what they have to say--and tell them what to do. Paint \nit this color. Get your battery from this district. Make it this way.\n  What are the poor executives going to do? Drive in their \ncongressionally approved hybrid cars from Detroit to Washington to \ntestify before 60 subcommittees while Toyota is busy making cars?\n  GM will never succeed if we keep this incestuous political meddling \nalive.\n  There are a variety of ways to get the stock out of the government \nand back in the hands of the people. The President has said he would \nlike to do it. He has also said he wants to keep his hands off it. But \nthat has not been the practice so far.\n  Senator Bennett of Utah and I have introduced this legislation that \nwould give the stock to the taxpayers who paid for it. That is the best \nway to do it, in my opinion. That would happen within a year. It would \nbe a fairly common occurrence in the American corporate world. It is \nwhat Procter & Gamble did with Clorox a few years ago. It is what \nPepsiCo did with its restaurant businesses a few years ago. The company \ndecided it had a subsidiary that did not fit the role of the major \ncompany, and so it spun it off--a stock distribution, a corporate \nspinoff.\n  I think we can all agree--at least 90 percent of the American people \nagree, according to surveys--that the government in Washington has no \nbusiness whatsoever trying to run a car company. What do we know about \nit? So the best way to get rid of it is to give it to the people who \npaid for it.\n  There are other ways to do it, and several Senators--Senator Corker, \nfor example, has suggested an ownership trust to try to make sure that \nwhile it is here, the government keeps its hands off the day-to-day \noperations. Senator Johanns and Senator Thune also have bills of this \nkind, as does Senator Nelson of Nebraska.\n  But my point is, now that General Motors has emerged from bankruptcy, \nlet's celebrate that by taking the 60 percent of the stock the American \ntaxpayers paid $50 billion for and giving it to those same taxpayers \nand getting our hands off the company and cheer them on.\n  There is another reason this would be a good idea. Most of us know \nthe Green Bay Packers are a popular team, especially in their home \narea. Why is that? Because the fans own the team. That would be the \nsame thing we would have with the General Motors stock distribution. \nJust as Green Bay Packer fans have a special interest in who the \nquarterback might be because they own the team, if 120 million \nAmericans had a little bit of GM stock, they might be a little more \ninterested in the next Chevrolet, and that might create a nice fan \ninvestor base for the new GM as it seeks to move ahead.\n  So that is the first idea we Republicans have: get the government \nstock ownership of the car companies out of Washington and back in the \nhands of the marketplace where it belongs.\n  Here is the second idea we have. It has to do with health care. We \nwould start at the other end of the debate. We would start with the 250 \nmillion Americans who already have health care and say to them: We want \nto make sure you can afford your health care, that you can choose your \nhealth care, and that when we are done fixing it in this health care \nreform--that we would like to do this year along with our Democratic \nfriends--we want to make sure you can afford your government as well. \nThat is our message.\n  Our friends on the other side--the Democrats--have more votes than we \ndo, so they have set the agenda and they are writing the bill. In the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on which I serve, \nthey are being very polite and collegial and nice to us, but they are \ntaking almost none of our ideas and recommendations, and they are \nstarting at the other end. And their other end is not going very well.\n  It is not going very well in terms of costs and debt because the \nCongressional Budget Office has begun to tell us how much some of these \nproposals will cost; and we are talking about $2 trillion in addition \nto all the trillions we have been spending this year.\n  This Nation cannot afford that. Even though we are adding $1 trillion \nor $2 trillion to the debt in order to have this sort of health care \nreform that is being proposed, it does not begin to cover the uninsured \npeople in America.\n  We would like to cover the uninsured people, too, but we think we \nought to do that after we make sure we keep the costs down for the 250 \nmillion who already have health insurance, including the small \nbusinesses of this country. That is our main goal: to lower costs. And \nwe do not want to end up with a health care plan that adds debt to the \ngovernment either.\n  That is why we have introduced a number of plans. Senator Coburn and \nSenator Burr have introduced one. Senator Gregg of New Hampshire has \nintroduced one. Senator Hatch has introduced a health care plan that \ngives the States more responsibility in figuring out exactly how to \nprovide health care, especially to low-income Americans.\n  The essential differences between our approaches and the Democratic \napproaches that are being presented is that, one, ours do not add to \nthe debt; and, two, the government does not run ours.\n  The essential nature of the Democratic proposals is to expand one \nfailed government program for low-income people that is called the \nMedicaid Program and to create another, which we believe will tend to \ndrive out your choices and your competition and not do very much to \nreduce your costs, while adding heavily to the national debt we already \nhave.\n  That is a major difference we have. And we have our proposals on the \ntable. The discussion is not going very well because it is one-sided. I \nsuggested, 3 weeks ago, when we began to discuss the Kennedy bill, we \nought to start over and suggested they might want to take some of our \nideas.\n  There is a Wyden-Bennett piece of legislation I did not even mention. \nMr. President, 14 of us--8 Democrats and 6 Republicans--are cosponsors \nof that legislation. It has a zero addition to the national debt, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. The principle of it is \nbasically to take the dollars we have available and give them to \nAmericans and let them buy their health care insurance, so instead of \nexpanding government programs, including for low-income Americans, you \nget the dollars, you get the health care, and that takes care of \nvirtually everybody.\n  All the plans from this side of the aisle, like those on the other \nside, say everybody needs to be insured. You are not disqualified for a \npreexisting condition. And the cost has to be affordable. All of us \nagree on that. The difference is whether it is going to be government \nprograms or whether you are going to have dollars you can choose. That \nis the big difference, and we hope the American people will pay \nattention to the differences we are offering. We believe they will \nbecause, as you look at the Democratic plans, the costs are becoming \nalarming.\n\n[[Page S7350]]\n\n  The first cost we saw was to the national debt, which was to expand \nbetween $1 trillion and $2 trillion, at least in the bill we have been \nconsidering in the HELP Committee. But then in the new versions of it, \nthe sponsors began to shift the costs. Well, where do they shift it? \nThe first place they shift it is to employers. It is a bad idea.\n  We have a 10-percent unemployment rate in the country today. People \nwork for employers, and all the evidence shows, if we add costs to \nemployers, one of a couple things happens. One is, the wages of the \nemployees are reduced because the employer has to pay higher taxes. The \nsecond thing is, you add costs to employers and some of those employers \ngo overseas.\n  I was in Tennessee last week talking to a lot of auto suppliers, air-\nconditioning manufacturers. They watch their costs every day. They are \nin discussions with their companies about that if costs of electricity \nor health care or anything else go up too much, they begin to go \noverseas and look for lower costs. We have already seen what has \nhappened to the automobile industry in the Midwest because of high \nhealth care costs. So why is it such a good idea to begin to shift the \ncosts and have every employer pay at least a $750-per-employee tax as a \nway of reducing the cost of health care?\n  Then the other place these plans begin to shift the costs is to the \nStates. That is a convenient place to shift it. I used to see that as \nGovernor. The Acting President pro tempore was speaker of the house in \nhis State. We are familiar with Members of Congress who hold big press \nconferences and announce a good idea and take credit for it, and then \nthey send the bill to the Governor or the speaker of the house or the \nlegislature or the mayor and say: Here, you pay for it. It is called an \nunfunded Federal mandate.\n  The unfunded Federal mandate in this case is to the Medicaid Program. \nThe Medicaid Program, in my view, is a terrible choice for a way to \nexpand coverage for low-income families. Already, 60 million Americans \nget their health care through their State Medicaid Program, which is \nusually funded about 60 percent by the Federal Government. But the \nproblem is, it is so poorly run and so underfunded the way it is \nmanaged that 40 percent of doctors will not see Medicaid patients.\n  So when you expand the Medicaid Program and dump more low-income \nAmericans into it, you are giving people a bus ticket to a company that \ndoes not have very many buses. So they do not get good health care \nservice. That is not the way we should be doing this. But that is the \nway we are trying to do it.\n  Then there is another person who is going to be affected by that \nexpansion of Medicaid, the government program, and that is the \ntaxpayer. The costs of the expansions that are being discussed when you \nexpand the program to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level--and \nwhen you, in addition to that, try to attract more doctors and \nhospitals to serve Medicaid patients, and you require States to pay \nmore to doctors and more to hospitals than they are today--the numbers \nare staggering.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said: It is a $500 billion figure \nover 10 years, or maybe it is $700 billion if you go to the fourth year \nand go for 10 years after that, or maybe it is more than that, \ndepending on the various formulas you come up with. And we will assume \nall that at the Federal level? Maybe we will to start with, but after a \nfew years, it will go back to the States. We say that easily here \nbecause we have a printing press, and we have suddenly gotten used to \ntalking about trillions of dollars. But States cannot do that. States \ndo not have printing presses. They have to balance their budgets.\n\n  I did a little calculation. If we expanded the Medicaid Program by \n150 percent of the Federal poverty level and required States to put \neveryone in there, and if we increased the payments to doctors and to \nhospitals to 110 percent of Medicare levels, which is still \nsignificantly below what private plans pay, it would add about $1.2 \nbillion every year to the budget just for the State's share of \nMedicaid. That is about a 10-percent new State income tax in our State \nto pay.\n  So that is the shifting of a cost. That is not just a little cost \nshift. That is an impossible cost shift. That is not even in the area \nof reality. I think as employers begin to discover what they are going \nto be taxed and when States discover what they are going to be taxed \nand Medicaid recipients realize if they get into this program that 40 \npercent of the doctors will not see them, this is not going to be a \nvery popular alternative.\n  Then, last week, we heard about Medicare cuts. Some of the Democrats \nin the Senate have made an agreement with the hospitals to cut \nMedicare. That is not so bad, they say. But what is even worse--even \nworse--is they are going to take the savings from Medicare cuts and \nspend it on a different program. We all know that the biggest problem \nwe have with the Federal budget is the rising cost of Medicare, and we \nhave to bring that under some control--control the growth of Medicare.\n  But if we are going to take any money out of the Medicare Program, it \nought to be spent on the Medicare Program for the seniors who are in \nit. We ought not to take money from the Medicare Program and use it to \npay for some new program we are talking about passing.\n  So all these plans that are being talked about are shifting the \ncosts. First, they are adding to the Federal deficit by maybe $1 \ntrillion. And then they are shifting the rest of the cost to employers \nwho are struggling, to States who are broke, to taxpayers in the \nStates, 10 percent of whom are unemployed. Then they are taking money \nout of Medicare and spending it instead of spending it on Medicare.\n  I do not think this is going to work. So I suggest my advice at the \nbeginning of this discussion 3 weeks ago is still good: Start over. \nStart over with one of the Republican plans or with a bipartisan Wyden-\nBennett plan. Fourteen Senators are already there: 8 Democrats and 6 \nRepublicans. And let's begin with the 250 million Americans who are \nalready covered and make sure their costs are appropriate, that they \ncan afford their health care, and that when we get through with this \nhealth care fix, that Americans can afford their government.\n  One other area of an idea that I hope--and we hope--our friends on \nthe Democratic side will agree with and the President eventually will \nagree with and the American people will agree with has to do with how \nwe go about having clean energy.\n  On Monday, I will be making a speech at the National Press Club at 11 \na.m. about a blueprint for 100 new nuclear powerplants. This is a part \nof the Republican clean energy strategy which has four provisions to \nit. The first is 100 new nuclear powerplants in the next 20 years. The \nsecond is: electrify our cars and trucks. I believe we can electrify \nhalf of them in 20 years. The third is: explore offshore for natural \ngas and oil. And fourth is: double research and development of energy. \nI would call it mini-Manhattan projects to help make alternative \nenergy, such as solar, cost competitive with fossil fuels, so the use \ncan be more widespread or for carbon recapture so our coal plants can \nbe cleaner or for advanced biofuels from crops we do not eat to make \nthat fuel more competitive with gasoline or even with fusion and green \nbuildings. These are the kinds of things we should be doing.\n  The Republican energy plan, which is based on 100 nuclear \npowerplants, is a cheap energy plan. It is cheap and clean energy. The \nWaxman-Markey bill, the so-called climate change energy bill that is \ncoming from the House, the Democratic plan, is a high-cost clean energy \nbill.\n\n  Let's stop and think about the kind of America we would like to have. \nWe want an America in which we have good jobs, and that is going to \ntake plenty of energy. We use 25 percent of all of the energy in the \nworld. We want an America in which we don't create excessive carbon so \nwe can reduce global warming. We want clean air--that kind of an \nAmerica. We want one, too, in which we are not creating a renewable \nenergy sprawl where these gigantic machines are spreading across \nlandscapes we have spent a century preserving. Of course, we want the \nhundreds of thousands of green jobs that can come from renewable \nenergy, but we don't want to do it in a way that kills the tens of \nmillions of red, white, and blue jobs that most of us work in.\n\n[[Page S7351]]\n\nWe don't want to run our manufacturing and technology, high-tech \ncompanies overseas looking for cheap electricity because of the \nstrategy we take for clean energy.\n  The strategy that is coming toward us from the House, the Democratic \nproposal, is a high-cost strategy. It is a $100 billion a year burden \non the economy which is unnecessary. It is high taxes, and it is more \nmandates, and it is a new utility bill for every American family.\n  What Republicans want to say is there is a different approach that \nwill get us to about the same place. I actually think it will get us \nthere faster. This approach starts with 100 new nuclear powerplants. \nThat means we will have electricity that is cheap enough so that cars \ncan be built in Michigan and Ohio, as well as Tennessee, instead of \nMexico and Japan. It means we would be producing more of our energy at \nhome. It means our air will be cleaner. Nuclear power is 70 percent of \nour pollution-free, carbon-free electricity today, while solar and \nwind, for example, is 6 percent. And it will do what we need to do to \nreduce global warming. In fact, our plan should put us within the Kyoto \nlimits by 2030, because nuclear power produces 70 percent of the \ncarbon-free electricity, and carbon is the principal greenhouse gas \nthat contributes to global warming.\n  So my question would be: Why would we adopt this contraption headed \nthis way from the House--$100 billion of taxes on the economy, \ngiveaways, payoffs, surprises, complications, cow taxes--why would we \ndo that? Why would we raise our prices deliberately when we can \ndeliberately lower our prices with the technology we already have?\n  We haven't built a new nuclear plant in 30 years, but France has. \nThey are 80 percent nuclear. So European plants are moving to Spain. \nFrance has among the lowest electric rates in the European Union and \namong the lowest carbon emissions in the European Union. India and \nChina are building nuclear plants, with our help, our technology, and \nwe are helping them do it. Japan is building a nuclear powerplant about \nevery year, and the President has even said Iran can do it. Then why \ndon't we get in the game? We know how to do it and we should, and we \nshould be doing it.\n  On Monday, I will be suggesting at the National Press Club on behalf \nof Republicans--but I want to recognize right at the outset that we are \nnot trying to make this a Republican--it is a Republican initiative, \nbut we don't want to end up there. We know that several of our friends \non the other side are strong supporters of nuclear power. We would like \nfor more of them to be. We would like for the President to be. I would \nlike for him to be half as interested in 100 new nuclear powerplants as \nhe already is in windmills. I think he would get a lot farther with a \nplan that includes 100 new nuclear powerplants.\n  All this needs is Presidential leadership. It doesn't need a lot of \nmoney. The financing systems we need to help get the first six or eight \nnuclear plants up and going are designed so the taxpayer doesn't lose a \ncent. The first 100 nuclear powerplants which were built in about 20 \nyears were built by the utilities with ratepayer money, not government \nmoney.\n  As far as safety, as far as what do we do with the waste, we have \ncome a long way in the last 30 years. Our plants are safely operated. \nDr. Chu, the distinguished scientist who is the Energy Secretary, said \nthat to me at a hearing this week. We have operated safely our nuclear \nreactors and our nuclear submarines since the 1950s. We sometimes \nforget about that. France and Japan and Germany and India and China all \nknow that if they want clean air and cheap energy for good jobs, they \nwill have to use nuclear power. So we need to do that as well. And the \nwaste? Let's call it used nuclear fuel. Scientists assure us that used \nnuclear fuel can be safely stored on site--and there is not very much \nof it in mass--safely stored on site for the next 40 or 60 years. That \nis step one. Step two is a mini-Manhattan Project of the kind we had \nduring World War II to explore all of the most important ways to safely \nrecycle the nuclear fuel so we can use it again and never create \nplutonium in the process. Scientists believe we can do that, figure \nthat out in 8, 10, 12 years. We already have acceptable ways to do it. \nFrance is doing it that way now. But while we store it, we can figure \nthat out. The United States is smart enough to do it.\n  So that would be our proposal on Monday. All 40 Republican Senators \nare united on it. We are looking for support on the other side. I think \nmore support will come, because as Americans look at this $100 billion \neconomy-wide cap and trade, they are going to say, Whoa, I hope that is \nnot the answer to this problem.\n  Let me give you one example. The economy-wide cap and trade applies \nto fuel. That is the gasoline in your car or your truck. One thing we \nknow for sure: It will raise the price of your gasoline at the pump. \nYou will be paying 10 or 20 or 30 cents more. You might be paying 50 \ncents more, but it probably won't reduce the carbon that comes out of \nit. Gasoline fuel produces a third of the carbon we are worried about, \nbut they have adopted in the House a device called the economy-wide cap \nand trade that won't do anything about it. We have had plenty of \ntestimony on that, because if it goes up 10 or 20 or 30 cents, that is \nnot enough to change the behavior of Americans.\n  The better way to do it is a low carbon fuel standard that gradually \nreduces the amount of carbon as people shift to other fuels. That is \nwhy we are for electric cars, because we have so much unused \nelectricity at night that we can plug in our cars and trucks at night \nuntil we have electrified half of them without building one new \npowerplant. So why in the world would they go to the trouble of \ncreating this 1,400-page contraption of mandates and taxes and rules \nthat raises prices and doesn't reduce the carbon they are aiming at? Of \ncourse, on the coal plants, they are 40 percent of the carbon. If we \ncan begin to build nuclear powerplants, then the utilities will \nprobably close some of the dirtiest coal plants.\n  Our vision is, as we look ahead 20 years, we can see 40 percent of \nour electricity from nuclear; maybe 25 percent from natural gas--that \nis a little more than we have today; maybe 8 or 10 percent from solar \nand wind and geothermal and biomass and some of these renewable \nenergies; another 10 percent from hydroelectric; the rest from coal--a \nsignificant amount, still. Hopefully, along that way one of these mini-\nManhattan projects will have found an even better way to capture carbon \nfrom coal plants.\n  This is the real clean energy policy. That would get us to the Kyoto \nprotocol. What is more important is that we want to reindustrialize \nthis country with cheap energy, cheap electricity. We don't want to run \njobs overseas.\n  Then the final part of this for the dream of energy is that it is \ncheap. People around the world are poor, and the single thing that \nwould help them most is to have low-cost or no-cost energy. We are on \nthe verge of doing that with nuclear power. We should be pursuing that \ninstead of deliberately raising the price of energy in an ineffective \nway toward a goal--in this case combating global warming--that seems to \nbe completely lost--completely lost--in the manufacturing of this \ncontraption that came from the House of Representatives that is going \nto give you a new utility bill every month.\n  So those are three Republican ideas that we have and that we hope our \nDemocratic colleagues will be interested in. We hope the President will \nsee them as constructive suggestions. We hope they will provide a check \nand a balance on the excessive debt and the number of Washington \ntakeovers we are beginning to see in Washington.\n\n  First, we congratulate General Motors on its coming out of \nbankruptcy, and a good way to celebrate would be to give all of the \nstocks to the taxpayers who paid taxes on April 15, stop the incestuous \npolitical meddling in the car companies, give them an investor fan base \nto cheer on the new Chevy.\n  Second, let's start over on health care costs. Let's start at the \nright end. Let's start with the 250 million Americans who already have \nhealth care and make sure it is good health care, and that they can \nafford it, and that when we are through with our reforms, they can \nafford the government that they are left with and they don't have \ntrillions more dollars in debt. To do that, we have four or five \nproposals on the table which fundamentally say: Take the dollars we \nhave and give them to\n\n[[Page S7352]]\n\nAmericans and let them buy their own insurance rather than stuff them \ninto government programs.\n  Finally, we want clean energy, but we want low-cost clean energy. We \nwant clean air. We want global warming dealt with. We want American \nindependence, but we want energy at a cost that will keep our \nmanufacturing jobs and our high-tech jobs right here at home and not \noverseas looking for cheap energy. We have a way to do it: 100 new \nnuclear powerplants, electric cars, offshore exploration for natural \ngas--that is low-carbon oil. We are still going to need it, so we might \nas well use our own, although we will use less. Finally, several mini-\nManhattan projects for research and development on solar and fusion and \nother areas that will help us change the energy picture, maybe after 20 \nyears.\n  These are exciting times. We are glad to be able to contribute our \nideas to the debate, and we hope the American people will listen and, \neventually, we hope our friends on the other side will join us, and \nthat even the President will take some of our ideas and make them a \npart of his agenda.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a very recent \nevent that is important to the United States and which should have \nreceived a lot greater publicity than it did. I know the occupant of \nthe chair, who is from Alaska, understands the importance of Southeast \nAsia to our economy and to security for the world. This is where the \nevent took place. On July 8, the people of Indonesia elected \ndemocratically their second democratically elected president, Susilio \nBambang Yudoyono. For obvious reasons, he is known by the initials SBY. \nHe enjoyed a victory, according to preliminary results by the national \nelection commission, of 62 percent of the vote, based on more than 18.7 \nmillion ballots counted. He needed 50 percent of the ballots to win in \none round.\n  His challengers, former President Megawati Sukarnoputri, came in \nsecond, with 28 percent, and his previous vice president, Jusuf Kalla, \nfinished third with 10 percent. We will have an official result \nreleased by the election commission by July 27.\n  I think it is very clear that SBY won an overwhelming election. This \nwould put Mr. Yudhoyono well over the 50-percent threshold to avoid a \nsecond-round runoff. Those who watch Southeast Asia believe that such \nan emphatic election victory for a man who became the democratically \nelected President 5 years ago will cement his position, quicken the \npace of reform, and strengthen the country that is very important to \nthat region and, thus, to the United States.\n  Mr. Yudhoyono rose under the dictator Suharto, who was forced out 11 \nyears ago after more than three decades in power, to a position in the \narmy, where he was a general. But when he became President, he set \naside his military uniform and took on civilian garb. He is a liberal \nwho provided much needed stability. Despite the challenges of dismal \ninfrastructure and 30 million Indonesians living below the poverty \nline, a country that extends through some 17,000 islands at low water, \nand 13,000 islands at high tide level, it is a country that is the \nlargest Muslim country in the world. A population of 240 million people \nmakes it the fifth largest country in the world. It has 90 percent of \nits population as Muslims. So this is the key to dealing with a Muslim \nnation.\n  Mr. Yudhoyono is credited with bringing economic prosperity with an \neconomy set to grow even in the face of the global downturn, expected \nto grow by 4 percent this year. Independent observers declared that the \nPresidential election was largely free and fair, despite an accusation \nof fraud by his opponents. There is no evidence of that, and we believe \nit was a free election. It is key to our national interest because it \nis the keystone for Southeast Asia.\n  Southeast Asia includes a number of countries, perhaps better known \nto the United States--Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and many smaller \ncountries. It is the fifth largest trading partner of the United \nStates. On top of that, it controls the Strait of Malaka, through which \nabout 50 percent of the world's oil supply travels. It is also an area \nwhich offers tremendous opportunity for economic growth for them and \nincreased trade and economic benefits to the United States.\n  SBY was a general in the national army during the last decade of the \nSuharto years. During that time, fortunately, he attended the \nInternational Military Education Training Institute at Fort \nLeavenworth, KS. There, leaders of friendly countries come to learn \nfrom our military how a military should operate in the modern era where \nmilitary is under civilian control, where human rights and individuals \nare respected, where the army does not control the political process, \nwhere the army is subordinate to and the protector of the population, \nrather than one which runs the population.\n  During his first tenure, as I said, he faced many challenges, and \nthey were successful. He chose as his running mate Mr. Boediono, who we \nbelieve raises expectations of accelerating reform in the second term \nof SBY. Boediono is a technocrat with no party affiliation. He \npossesses an impeccable track record for clean governance. He is an \nadvocate, as is SBY, of market-led growth, with government acting as an \nimpartial regulator rather than a state actor. The duo campaigned on a \nticket of clean governance and reform to promote broad-based economic \ngrowth. This was a vote by the predominantly Muslim country for a \nmoderate prodemocratic path that Indonesia has already taken. They \nstill face many challenges--not just poverty--with the economic \nproblems in the country. They face a long tradition of corruption that \nhas to be dealt with. SBY has taken steps to deal with that and needs \nto take more steps.\n  They also face the challenge from radical Islamists who want to \nestablish Sharia law, a government by theocracy rather than by a \npopularly elected, constitutionally governed government. I will speak \nmore about that in a minute.\n  Let me give you a little taste of the rest of it. His closest rival, \nMegawati Sukarnoputri, was the daughter of Sukarno, Indonesia's \nfounding father. Ms. Megawati failed to impress voters during her term \nas President from 2001 to 2004, and she partnered with a general who \nwas indicted for human rights abuse and was a former son-in-law of a \nprevious authoritarian dictator. They ran a nationalistic campaign that \nwas rejected by the voters of Indonesia.\n  The third ticket, comprised of current Vice President Jusuf Kalla and \na former chief of the army, Wiranto, championed a similar ideological \nplatform, with the difference being that Jusuf Kalla was a link between \nbig national businesses and the government, which we thought he would \nprobably enhance. This sets up an opportunity for the United States.\n  We are dealing with a very important Islamic country. I believe that \nit is time for us to realize this is an area where we can make \nsignificant progress, if we learn how to work with and provide \nsignificant support to a democratically elected head of an Islamic \ncountry, who wants to move on the path toward greater economic ties, \nfree from corruption, open to trade and business.\n  I happen to have laid all this out in a book called ``The Next \nFront,'' coauthored with Lewis Simons, a Pulitzer Prize-winning \nreporter. It will be published by Wiley Books in October. We call it \n``The Next Front'' because what people did not realize until recently \nwas that, after 9/11, one of the indigenous terrorist groups in \nIndonesia, Jema Islamia, which we will call JI, was a close ally of al-\nQaida, and still is. That is a terrorist organization that has spread \nfrom Indonesia into the Philippines, and potentially other parts of \nAsia. The leader of JI was tasked by al-Qaida with carrying out the \nsecond attack following 9/11, which was to be on Los Angeles. \nFortunately, our CIA, by aggressive tactics and military tactics, \nprevented that attack.\n  There is still a real danger to not only peace and stability and \nprogress\n\n[[Page S7353]]\n\nin Southeast Asia, but to the security of the United States, unless we \nensure that a government such as Yudhoyono's manages to provide \nsecurity and prevent the development of terrorist training areas and \nagencies, where they are willing and able to carry out operations, \ndisrupt terrorist organizations.\n  In ``The Next Front,'' we argue, as I have, that the best way to do \nthat is through significantly increasing contact between the United \nStates and those governments that are dealing with those problems, that \nare on the wrong track, which have the potential to provide security \nand peace and prosperity for their own homeland. When they have too \nmany young males who cannot find a job, they are often lured by the \nradical religious extremists into the terrorist organizations and \nconvinced to undertake terrorist attacks on Americans, on \ndemocratically elected governments.\n  We believe that steps that were taken yesterday in the Foreign \nOperations Committee, under the able leadership of Chairman Leahy, to \nput us on the path to increasing significantly the assistance and the \ncontact we have with Southeast Asia. We increased to $65 million the \namount of economic support fund assistance. They also instituted other \nprograms to provide more assistance for Peace Corps. An expansion of \nthe Peace Corps is one way to get American sandals on the ground now, \nso that we don't have to put American boots on the ground later.\n\n  Smart Power says that when you are faced with a radical, violent \nextremist group like al-Qaida, or the Taliban, which we face in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan now, you have to use force to deal with them. \nAt the same time you are using force, you must build up the economy and \nmeet the needs of the local leaders, so that they will work with the \nforces who are trying to drive the extremists out. That was the secret \nto the success of General Petraeus in Iraq with the counterinsurgency \nstrategy, who said we will not only clear an area but we will go in and \nhold it and build, looking to local leaders to tell us what they are \ndoing.\n  My son, who is a marine, an intel officer who served two tours there, \nsaid the first time he was there they couldn't get support from the \nlocal government because they were getting no assistance from Baghdad. \nThey were Sunnis in Fallujah. The government in Baghdad was not Sunni; \nthey were Shia, and they didn't provide assistance. The second time, \nthe counterinsurgency and our government were working through the \npopularly elected Iraqi Government to provide support and assistance to \nthe Sunnis in Fallujah. They were able to cooperate and provide \nassistance and make sure they kept that area safe.\n  We are trying to do the same thing now in Afghanistan. I am proud \nthat the Missouri National Guard is leading the way, along with 10 \nother States' national guards, and we are sending over agricultural \ndevelopment teams to help the local farmers develop a more effective \nmeans of producing crops. We saw, last year, in Kandahar province, \nwhere the Missouri National Guard operated for 1 year. They started \nproducing much more high-valued crops. As a result, they no longer \nneeded to produce the poppies needed by the drug lords to manufacture \ncocaine and dope and opium. They were able to drive the poppy \nproducers--put them into productive use and take the drug lords out, \nand the Taliban which normally follows them. This is working in \nAfghanistan.\n\n  In areas where we have peaceful governments that are threatened by \nextremist groups, it makes sense that we increase economic assistance \nbut primarily personal assistance--one-on-one assistance from American \nvolunteers going there--economic assistance, encouraging American firms \nto invest there, to help them develop small- and medium-sized \nenterprises; opening up free trade so their products can come into the \nUnited States so we can trade with them and so they can build their \neconomies. We need significantly to increase educational exchanges \nbetween our countries and theirs.\n  I mentioned earlier that President Yudhoyono had served in the IMET \nProgram at Fort Leavenworth. I first met him as President--well, I met \nhim before--when I went to Indonesia after the tsunami in Bugatchi, and \nwe talked about the work we were doing to help them recover from that \ntragic event. But I also extended an invitation for him to come to \nWebster University in St. Louis, MO, from which he had also gotten a \ndegree. They gave him an honorary degree, and I was pleased to \nintroduce him when he came to St. Louis to Webster University.\n  His is just one of hundreds, thousands, millions of examples where we \nhave helped develop leaders in countries with which we are allied and \nwhich can be even stronger allies. They could take the information we \ndevelop, take the learning and the skills we have, and provide the \nassistance they need to strengthen their country, to provide not only \nsecurity but a good livelihood for their people so there will no longer \nbe unemployed young men who are willing to take blood money from the \nterrorists in exchange for a pittance for their family to conduct \nterrorist attacks.\n  We think we have a great opportunity not only in Indonesia, following \nthese steps--expanding on the Smart Power that has been used in Iraq, \nis now being used in Afghanistan--to show that people who work with the \nUnited States can expect not domination but help in establishing their \nown free country, their own democratically elected principles, respect \nfor human rights, and a respect for religious differences so that we \nrespect Muslims and they respect Christians and Jews and Buddhists and \nHindus.\n  That was the original idea of the country of Indonesia when it was \nfounded in the 1940s. They laid out the principles of Pancasila--in \nwhich we recognize diversity; we recognize there are different \nreligions; we will learn from and tolerate differences, particularly in \nreligion.\n  We have a challenge facing us in Indonesia and others where \nextremists want to establish shariah law, which has mullahs and \nayatollahs who prescribe very harsh penalties for women who step out of \nplace, who appear without total cover in broad daylight, where anybody \nwho commits a violent crime is either thrashed or has a hand cut off or \nis put to death. This kind of backward approach to maintaining law and \norder is a threat to the civilized world and progress as we know it.\n  In Indonesia, we have the opportunity to move forward, and I \ncongratulate the people of Indonesia. I particularly congratulate \nSusilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Vice President Boediono on their \nelection--reelection--on July 8, and we look forward to seeing the \nfinal results certified on July 27. I hope I will have the support of \nmy colleagues for the robust foreign operations support for Smart \nPower. It is the wave of the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the Congress focuses on health care \nreform, I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss one approach that has \nbeen documented by the Congressional Budget Office as producing \nsignificant cost savings in American health care. That approach is free \nchoice and rewards for selecting health care wisely.\n  Today, 85 percent of American businesses that offer health care \ncoverage offer no choices. That is not because they would not like to. \nQuite the contrary; they would very much like to offer additional \nprivate sector choices. But for example, if you are a small \nbusinessperson--and I know the distinguished Senator from Alaska \nidentifies with this--and you go out into that broken private insurance \nmarket, with huge administrative costs very often approaching 30 \npercent, you can't offer choices. Without choices there can't be real \ncompetition and accountability in health care. As a result, costs go up \nand care for our workers and our employers and small businesses and \nothers becomes less affordable.\n  Some in America enjoy a better system, one where they have a full \narray of private sector health care choices.\n\n[[Page S7354]]\n\nEveryone in this Chamber knows what that is all about because it is the \nsystem we have as Members of Congress. We get a menu--a menu of private \nhealth plan offerings. The plans that are offered to Members of \nCongress can't discriminate, for example, against someone with a \npreexisting illness.\n  You go into a large group where you have a lot of bargaining power, \nwhich means you can hold down costs, and you don't face discrimination \non the basis of age. That is particularly important because it looks as \nif under some of the approaches that are being discussed in the \nCongress there could be significant discrimination against older \nworkers.\n  I believe all Americans should have the opportunity to be part of a \nhealth care system where they have more choices, and they are in a \nposition to benefit from the wise selection of those kinds of choices. \nI think that will lead to reduced costs, and I think it will lead to \nmore affordable health care coverage.\n  The legislation that is being developed in the Congress would not \nallow most people to have the free choice of insurance exchange plans. \nIn fact, it wouldn't allow them to have free choice of health plans \ngenerally, whether they are in a private plan or a public plan. Without \nchoice, there won't be competition to hold down costs.\n  So I very much hope in the weeks ahead Democrats and Republicans \nalike will come to see what the Budget Office has documented, and that \nis free choice of an increased menu of private sector health care--\nwhere the insurance companies can't cherry-pick, where they can't \ndiscriminate against someone with a preexisting illness, where people \nwould go into a large group, and where you don't have older workers \nbeing discriminated against--will hold down skyrocketing health care \ncosts and help keep quality health coverage affordable. I would hope \nDemocrats and Republicans would see that kind of approach, with \nexpanded choices, would help hold down health care costs and make \nhealth care more affordable for our people.\n  The reason I have focused on this question of holding down costs, \nmaking coverage more affordable by expanding choices--free choice, as I \ncall it--is in light of the discussion we have held this week in the \nSenate on the costs of health care reform.\n  I note my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, is here. He is someone who \nhas, in my view, done so much good work on health care for children, \nfor community health centers, for a variety of needs in our country. He \nand I participated in discussions, particularly in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, about how to come up with additional money to expand \ncoverage, particularly for the more than 45 million Americans who don't \nhave coverage.\n  The Finance Committee is going to continue to grapple with this \nissue, but I only wanted to talk about cost savings through free choice \ntoday because I believe that is what most Americans look at first.\n  Most Americans feel very strongly that they want to get all our \npeople covered. They know it is a disgrace that, in a country as rich \nand strong and good as ours, that close to 50 million people do not \nhave coverage.\n\n  But they are also very concerned about the idea that, when you are \nalready spending $2.5 trillion annually on health care, before you go \nout and spend a trillion dollars or more to pay for expanding coverage, \nyou better have a plan to save money through choice, through the kinds \nof approaches I have been talking about in order to be credible. It is \nnot credible to go to the American people and say we need $1 trillion \nor more to expand coverage, expand coverage and pay this huge sum on \ntop of the $2.5 trillion being spent today, unless you have an actual \nplan to hold down costs and generate savings.\n  That is why I hope the Democrats and Republicans will look at how the \nCongressional Budget Office has documented that, through choice, you \ncan generate significant cost savings and make health care more \naffordable.\n  I am concerned that the point I have made this morning has gotten a \nbit lost as the focus this week has been on the question of paying this \nvery large additional sum to finance coverage expansion. There is no \nquestion that at a time of soaring deficits, the Congress must pay \nattention to what it costs to pay for health reform.\n  It would be fiscally irresponsible to pass health reform that is not \npaid for. But it would be equally irresponsible to pass a bill that is \nlabeled health reform that fails to put a lid on the skyrocketing costs \nof our health care system. The two go hand in hand.\n  So what will provide significant savings? All the experts agree that \nwe need to change incentives and behavior to change how people buy and \nuse their health care.\n  First, show that you can generate cost savings for all Americans \nthrough increasing choice and rewarding those who make a wise selection \nof their coverage. That, in my view, ought to be built around what the \nCongressional Budget Office has documented, which is savings through an \napproach very much like what Members of Congress have. If you do that \nfirst, then you have the credibility to go back and say to the American \npeople: Here are the choices in front of us for expanding coverage to \nthe close to 50 million people who do not have it today.\n  What I have tried to describe this morning is a way to keep faith \nwith the small business owners who are across this country, from Coos \nBay, OR, to Oyster Bay, Long Island. Let's keep faith with them by \nshowing we are going to hold down costs and then also, in a bipartisan \nway, come together and grapple with the question Senator Hatch and I \nwere discussing with our colleagues this week, which is how to best and \nmost responsibly finance coverage for the close to 50 million Americans \nwho do not have it. I believe we can do it. I believe the approach I \nhave outlined this morning is one path to do it.\n  I have never said, in the course of health reform debates, that it is \nmy way or the highway. But I think we certainly ought to learn from the \nconstructive analyses done by the Congressional Budget Office that show \nit is possible to get hard cost savings, not within a decade but within \na matter of years, by expanding choices for our people and rewarding \nthose who make a wise selection from that menu of choices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I note the Senator from Oregon has to read \nsome things, but I have a brief additional comment to make and then I \nask unanimous consent I be given the floor thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Oregon is \none of the leading figures on health care in this Congress and has been \nin the past. He is thoughtful. He works very hard. He is one of the \nmost contributing members of the Senate Finance Committee and I, \npersonally, respect him very much and we have a very dear friendship. I \nappreciate the kind remarks he has expressed about me here today.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have unanimous consent requests to make. \nBefore I do that, I wish to say, again, how much I appreciate the \nSenator from Utah and his involvement and particularly his leadership \non health care issues. When you look at the array of important \nlegislation that has clearly improved American health care, Senator \nHatch's name is all over that legislation.\n  Think about landmark legislation for children. It could not have \nhappened without Senator Hatch. He and I have written legislation \ntogether. One of the accomplishments of which I am most proud is that \nwe found a bipartisan way to increase coverage for community health \ncenters by lowering their malpractice costs. I think it was an example \nof the way Senator Hatch approaches that kind of legislation. He \nbrought together advocates of low-income people, trial lawyers, \ncommunity health centers. Everybody said you could not find common \nground among those kinds of organizations, and with Senator Hatch's \nleadership we were able to do it.\n  I am going to make a unanimous consent request, but I wish to tell \nthe Senator from Utah I am convinced this year we are going to be able \nto pass health reform. One of the reasons we are going to be able to do \nit is because of both the good will and the expertise of the Senator \nfrom Utah. I am very\n\n[[Page S7355]]\n\nmuch looking forward to working with him on that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon and \nappreciate his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In fact, managing this \nvast portfolio has become too time-consuming and too much for him to \nhandle. He recently said, ``I don't want to run auto companies. I don't \nwant to run banks. I've got two wars I've got to run already. I've got \nmore than enough to do. So the sooner we can get out of that business, \nthe better off we're going to be.''\n  I doubt even John D. Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Andrew \nCarnegie or William Randolph Hearst could ever have dreamed about \nhaving that amount of control. But despite his professed eagerness to \ndivest himself of his newfound, unprecedented wealth, the reigning \nworld's richest man, President Obama, seems reluctant to relinquish his \nvast holdings.\n  Indeed, I am beginning to think he actually enjoys this--well, what I \ncall ``Obamanopoly.'' Soon, he will own all the railroads, all the \nutilities, Park Place and Boardwalk. And when taxpayers pick up the \nyellow or orange cards from the stacks, they will have to dig deeper in \ntheir wallet to fund this high-stakes Obamanopoly.\n  OK, I realize that our President does not really personally own all \nthis wealth. But while I am speaking tongue in cheek, my remarks do \npoint to the very real serious consequences of an ever-expanding U.S. \nGovernment. I care a great deal for the President, and I don't want to \npersonally offend him. But I think the point is made.\n  We are moving toward what I have referred to as the ``Europeanization \nof America.'' On the spectrum between anarchy and a centralized \ngovernment invested with complete power and control, our current \ngovernment is so far removed from the limited government that our \nFounding Fathers intended that they must be rolling over in their \ngraves.\n  There is method to this unprecedented meddling in the private sector. \nAs the government acquires more auto manufacturers, banks, insurance \ncompanies and other private-sector businesses, we become more dependent \non the government. The Obama administration's answer to everything is \nto take control of companies, increase regulation and spend, spend, \nspend. They are now talking about taxing and taxing more.\n  Not only does the government have more control over the economy, but \nit has a freer rein to regulate and restrict free speech. Modern \npolitical thought is, in many respects, based on a distinction between \nthe public and private spheres. Liberal democracies--using the word \n``liberal'' in the classical sense--have historically been based on the \nnotion that there are realms that are ripe for government involvement--\nthe public sphere--and others that should remain unaffected by \ngovernment--the private sphere.\n  This was one of the central ideas behind the drafting of our \nConstitution and the founding of our Nation. Indeed, the Founding \nFathers were all too aware of the problems that could arise under a \ngovernment that is too expansive and too powerful. As James Madison, \none of the main architects of the Constitution argued, ``All men having \npower ought to be distrusted to a certain degree.''\n  Because of this inherent distrust of those holding power, our \nNation's Founders devised a government that was allowed to exercise its \nenumerated powers. As Alexander Hamilton stated, when it comes to \nframing a desirable government, ``[Y]ou must first enable the \ngovernment to control the governed, and in the next place, oblige it to \ncontrol itself.'' He also said, ``Indeed, the genius of our \nConstitution is that it provides an effective government that is \nsubject to strict limitations.''\n  But it isn't only in the Constitution that we can observe the \nrelevance of this public-private distinction during the Founding \nFathers' generation. The beliefs, practices, and culture of that era \nfurther demonstrate just how separate and distinct our nation has \ntraditionally viewed the public and private spheres. French political \nphilosopher Alexis de Tocqueville, in observing the uniqueness of \nAmerican government and culture, described how private citizens in \nAmerica addressed needs in their communities. He stated:\n\n       When a private individual mediates an undertaking, however \n     directly connected it may be with the welfare of society, he \n     never thinks of soliciting the cooperation of the Government, \n     but he publishes his plan, offers to execute it himself, \n     courts the assistance of other individuals, and struggles \n     manfully against all obstacles. Undoubtedly he is often less \n     successful than the State might have been in his position; \n     but in the end the sum of these private undertakings far \n     exceeds all that the Government could have done.\n\n  I believe this spirit of private determination still exists in our \ncountry today. I have argued many times that the American people are \nthe most inventive and innovative people in the world. However, in an \nera when the President can impact huge portions of the American \neconomy, that spirit is given little opportunity to work its magic in \nthe private sector. Indeed, James Madison argued that ``there are more \ninstances of the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and \nsilent encroachments by those in power than by violent and sudden \nusurpations.'' I wonder how Madison would have viewed some of our \ncurrent President's recent decisions.\n  Ours is a government that from the very beginning has been limited in \nwhat it can do and how far in may encroach into the private sphere. \nThose limits are not defined by the Nation's economic circumstances or \npolitical winds. There is not an exception in the Constitution that \nallows popular Presidents to exercise more power than unpopular ones. \nOurs is the oldest functioning constitutional republic on the planet, \nnot because of change, hope, or adaptation, but because of consistency \nand respect for the limitations imposed upon our institutions. I \nbelieve many of the times we have struggled have been those in which we \nhave strayed from the principal obligation that our Constitution \nimposes on the Federal Government--the obligation to control itself.\n  One such example--one often cited by the administration and my \nDemocratic colleagues to justify the steps the President has taken--is \nthe Great Depression. Some may say the Great Depression was the last \ntime we saw such an expansion of government power. It came in the form \nof FDR's New Deal, which is now the model for how the majority and this \nPresident intend to remake the Federal Government and our economy. They \ncredit the New Deal with ending the depression and claim that this new \nexpansion will cure our current economic ills.\n  I hope, for our country's sake, that they are wrong.\n  What New New Deal proponents don't mention when making their case, is \nthat even with Roosevelt's policies in place, the depression lasted for \nover a decade and, in fact, deepened in the late 1930s. \nCoincidentally--and I use that word sarcastically--the New Deal's \nsupposed effect wasn't fully realized until the United States entered \nWorld War II.\n\n  Now, I don't mean to argue that our current situation is directly \ncomparable to the Great Depression. I would say it is far from it. But \nI do hope that the Democrats' long-term plan isn't to keep expanding \nthe Federal Government for several years, wait for an unforeseen \noutside calamity to take place and rescue the economy, and then take \ncredit for the recovery.\n\n[[Page S7356]]\n\n  To be sure, Roosevelt's New Deal was not without some success. But it \nlargely failed to restore prosperity to the American economy because \ninstead of implementing policies aimed as fostering economic growth and \nexpansion, it was designed as a top-down restructuring of the economy--\nmaking the government the major decisionmaker in economic matters. The \nresults were labor policies designed to preset wages at levels \npreferred by unions, regardless of market conditions; trade and \nmanufacturing polices designed to set production at levels other than \nthose set by supply and demand; and taxes on businesses that stifled \ngrowth and prevented them from hiring new employees.\n  Sadly, the President and the majority leadership in Congress have \napparently decided that despite hat these shortcomings, the New Deal \nshould be repeated. We have seen it in the President's efforts to seize \ncontrol of auto companies, only to hand it over to his labor union \nsupporters. We see it in proposals here in Congress to use the \nbankruptcy code to basically preset interest rates for lenders--and at \na time when credit is is already getting harder to come by. And we are \nseeing it in their proposals to raise taxes on small businesses despite \nharsh economic times and rising unemployment.\n  President Obama may be the richest man in America these days, but he \nis doing so on the back of the American taxpayers. If history is any \nindication, his efforts will not leave anyone else in America any \nricher or better off.\n  It is not hard to find examples of the government growing at an \nexceptionally fast pace. Just by looking at the number of government \nemployees as a percentage of America's population, one can easily see \nhow we have increased the size of the government. In 1815, the U.S. \nnumbered 8.3 million people, 4,837 of which were government employees. \nIn other words, only about one-twentieth of 1 percent of Americans \nworked for the government. In 2007, our Nation numbered 281 million \nAmericans, 2.7 million of them government workers. That is nearly 1 \npercent of the population, or about 20 times the number of government \nemployees in 1815. That percentage will certainly increase, given this \nPresident's budget, which contains 121 new government programs.\n  Another indication of the growth of government power can be \nillustrated through the amount of government spending. Organization of \nEconomic Cooperation and Development figures show that government \nspending in the U.S. is on the rise, comparable with that of many \nEuropean countries. In fact, government spending has decreased in most \nEuropean nations, while it has increased in the United States.\n  In France, for example, government spending is close to 50 percent of \nGDP, while England's government spending is roughly 44 percent of GDP, \nand Germany's is 45 percent of GDP. In the United States, Federal \nGovernment spending has been around 20 percent. However, to accurately \ncompare the U.S. to European nations, it is necessary to include State \nand local spending.\n  Once that is factored in, U.S. Government spending exceeds 37 percent \nof GDP, and that is before President Obama's stimulus package and \nbudget for this year are taken into account. Thus, it is almost a \nforgone conclusion that by the end of this year, total government \nspending in the United States will approach that of many European \ngovernments. We have jumped way ahead from the 2008 figure, with the \ncurrent figure on that chart, just barely behind the European \ncountries.\n\n  If you take a look at President Obama's past 5 months in office, you \nwill see the largest proposed 10-year spending increase in our Nation's \nhistory. We have a stimulus bill worth $787 billion, or close to $1.3 \ntrillion if interest is taken into account. We have nearly exhausted \nthe $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, and we have a budget \nproposal estimated to create a $9 trillion deficit over the next 10 \nyears. According to the Congressional Budget Office, that is what is \ngoing to happen.\n  To put that another way, Federal spending would be nearly 24 percent \nof our Nation's GDP. Government spending, alone, in 2009 will reach 27 \npercent. That is Federal Government spending alone. In 2009, it will \nreach 27 percent. When you add in State and local spending, that would \nput us nearly on par in total government spending with Germany. You can \nsee from this chart, we are almost right there.\n  The American people, especially Utahans, are speaking out against \nthis increase in the size of government. They are organizing ``Tax \nEnough Already,'' or TEA, rallies around the country, and they are fed \nup with government bailout after bailout. They correctly wonder when or \nif this government expansion will ever stop.\n  That is why I have introduced two pieces of legislation to reduce \ngovernment spending. One is called the Limitation on Government \nSpending Act, the LOGS Act, to limit government spending to 20 percent \nof GDP. The second is called the Stop TARP Asset Recycling Act, the \nSTAR Act, and that is to prevent perpetual bailouts and to repay our \nnational debt with returned TARP funds--don't just take them and spend \nmore. Give them back to the taxpayers. Give them back to the government \nso we can pay down some of these deficits and some of these problems \nthat are going on. They are two very important bills.\n  Let me discuss them again. The Limitation on Government Spending Act \nwould limit government spending to the national historic average of 20 \npercent of GDP. While I believe government spending should be much \nlower than that, the least we can do is ensure that government spending \ndoes not get out of control like the way it is currently headed.\n  Furthermore, the Stop TARP Asset Recycling Act would require all \nfunds paid out of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP--and that \namounted to $700 billion--as to all those funds that are returned or \npaid back, they must be placed in the general fund to pay down the \nNation's debt instead of being recycled back into TARP or more \nspending. Otherwise, TARP could become a revolving slush fund for the \nTreasury Department to bail out or seize companies. It is time we put \nan end to that.\n  The Obama administration's honeymoon is over. More Americans than \never agree we need to rein in this administration's runaway government \nspending. I might add, we better be prepared for massive taxation too. \nTheir belief is to spend and tax and build the Federal Government at \nall costs. More Americans than ever agree we need to rein in this \nadministration's runaway government spending.\n  According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, barely half of \nAmericans are now confident that President Obama's $787 billion \nstimulus measure will boost the economy. Think about it: barely half of \nall Americans. Furthermore, a USA Today poll reveals that a 51-percent \nmajority disapproved of the job he has done in controlling Federal \nspending. Even President Obama agrees with this.\n  After the massive amounts of government spending he has signed into \nlaw, President Obama had the audacity to proclaim in an April 18 weekly \naddress that we need to restore responsibility and accountability to \nour Federal budget. Who are we kidding? The President cannot put us on \nthe course to a $9 trillion deficit and then tell us we need to be more \nfiscally responsible. That is akin to someone killing their parents, \nand then complaining about being an orphan.\n  In the same address, the President continued this hypocrisy by \nsaying, ``We are on an unsustainable course'' and ``we need to restore \nthe people's confidence in government by spending their money wisely.'' \nBut wait. It gets even better. After signing into law a $787 billion \nstimulus and a $3 trillion deficit, he nobly stated:\n\n       If we want to spend, we need to find somewhere else to cut.\n\n  If you doubt the hypocrisy, you do not have to look further than the \ncurrent health care debate or the cap-and-trade program he proposes to \npay for by levying even more taxes. The closest the President has come \nto cut spending was by calling upon his Department heads to find $100 \nmillion in savings--$100 million. I guess you would call that ``pocket \nchange'' we can believe in.\n  Enough is enough. No more spending. No more taxes. No more government \nexpansion. We are not looking for a new New Deal. We are looking for\n\n[[Page S7357]]\n\nsmaller, more efficient government. We are not looking for another \ngovernment bailout. Whatever happened to: Ask not what your country can \ndo for you, ask what you can do for your country?\n  Where ``Obamanopoly'' is concerned, it is time to say: Game over. It \nis time to pull the reins on this headlong rush toward the \nEuropeanization of America. As former President Gerald Ford said:\n\n       A government that is big enough to give you all you want is \n     big enough to take it all away.\n\n  I am concerned about what is going on. I admit that President Obama \nis a very attractive human being. I personally like him. But I think \nthis tax-and-spend set of policies we are seeing is taking our country \ndown to the point of ruin, and we have to stand up and stop it. I have \nto tell you, if we do not do it, our kids and our grandkids and our \ngreat-grandkids--and Elaine and I have all three--are going to be \npaying a huge price.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/10/senate-section/article/S7357-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday I was unable to be here for the \nconsideration and final passage of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nAct because of a death in my family, but I would like to submit my \nsupport for this important legislation for the Record.\n  Whether it is a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, we must \nmaintain the ability to respond quickly and efficiently to security \nchallenges. No job is more important than keeping our citizens safe, \nand no one does that job better than our front line public safety \nofficials. This legislation provides them with the resources they need.\n  My fellow Connecticut residents and I know first hand how important \nit is to be prepared. Just last week, officials from FEMA and DHS \ntoured Farmington and Wethersfield after tornadoes toppled trees and \nutility lines, damaging buildings and closing roads. The worst of the \nstorm hit Wethersfield square-on, severely damaging 70 houses and \nleaving several to be condemned.\n  It is rare that a tornado touches down in Connecticut, but it reminds \nus that disaster can happen anytime, anyplace, anywhere.\n  At these moments of crisis, we must be assured that our communities \nhave the first-responder personnel, training, and equipment necessary \nto keep families safe.\n  That is why I authored and continue to support the Assistance to \nFirefighters, FIRE, Grant Program to help equip and train firefighters, \nand the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response, SAFER, Grant \nProgram to increase the number of firefighting personnel.\n  We have made the Federal Government a partner to our Nation's \nfirefighters and because we did, we have delivered more than $55 \nmillion to Connecticut communities in the last decade.\n  This year's bill includes $420 million in SAFER grants--double the \namount appropriated last year. This funding will help to stem the tide \nof layoffs so that our communities can be protected by an adequate \nnumber of dedicated firefighters.\n  In addition, I was pleased that the Senate accepted an amendment I \noffered that provides an additional $10 million to the FIRE Grant \nProgram. This increase will help more local fire departments equip and \ntrain first responders in Connecticut and across the country.\n  The bill also provides $300,000 for the Coast Guard Academy in New \nLondon to begin work on Eagle Pier, which will be the permanent home of \nthe EAGLE, the historic tall ship seized from Germany during World War \nII.\n  For more than 60 years, Eagle Pier was the home of the Coast Guard \nTraining Vessel EAGLE, but in recent years, as the aging pier has \nfallen into disrepair, the EAGLE has been homeported at a pier at Fort \nTrumbull.\n  The EAGLE is a Connecticut icon and one of only two remaining \ncommissioned sailing vessels in American Government service, the other \nbeing Boston's USS Constitution.\n  In addition to showcasing a rich history, the EAGLE serves as a \nmodern day seagoing classroom for Coast Guard Cadets, providing hands-\non maritime instruction to supplement the students' rigorous classroom \nworkload.\n  This bill makes important investments in our domestic security, first \nresponders, and the State of Connecticut, and I am proud to support it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1430\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today, I join with Senator Sanders, my \ncolleague from Vermont, and Senator Carper, my colleague from Delaware, \nin supporting an increase in funding for two essential programs in the \nfiscal year 2010 Homeland Security appropriations bill to support our \nbrave firefighters: assistance to firefighter grants, AFG, and staffing \nfor adequate fire and emergency response grants, SAFER.\n  The Assistance to Firefighter Grants, AFG, Program, commonly referred \nto as fire grants, helps fund the purchase of urgently needed emergency \nresponse equipment, apparatus, and training. The AFG Program relies on \ndirect input from the locally affected fire services in the grant \nprocess to ensure funding reaches those agencies that are most in need. \nA fiscal year 2007 review of AFG by the Department of Homeland Security \nfound this program to be 95 percent effective, the second highest \nrating of any program at the Department.\n  A recent needs assessment survey conducted by the Fireman's Fund \nInsurance Company found that 60 percent of respondents report that \ntheir local fire department has delayed equipment replacement purchases \ndue to the economic downturn, and 50 percent reported that if economic \nconditions do not improve in the next year, it could affect their \nability to provide service to their communities. Local fire department \nand EMS agencies need fire grants to continue to ensure the safety of \ncitizens across the country.\n  A fire company in McAdoo County, located in east-central \nPennsylvania, used its fire grant to purchase an automatic \ndefibrillator. The biggest killer of firefighters in the line of duty \nis heart attacks, and now the brave men and women at McAdoo Fire \nCompany are better protected as they risk their lives every day to help \nthose in emergency situations.\n  SAFER grants assist fire departments in the hiring of career \nfirefighters and the recruitment and retention of volunteer \nfirefighters. The single most significant challenge facing volunteer \nfire service is recruitment and retention. Over the past two decades, \nthe percentage of volunteer firefighters under the age of 40 has shrunk \nfrom 65 percent to 50 percent. The SAFER Grant program was created to \nprovide funding directly to fire departments and volunteer firefighter \norganizations in order to help them increase the number of trained, \n``front-line'' firefighters available in their local communities. SAFER \ngrants enhance the ability of local fire departments' to comply with \nstaffing, response and operational standards.\n  The Center Township Volunteer Fire Department, located in western \nPennsylvania, received a SAFER grant in March of 2009. With that \nfunding, they can recruit more volunteer firefighters and retain those \nwho already give so generously of themselves in efforts to protect and \nhelp others. SAFER grants are particularly beneficial to municipalities \nthat are growing by expanding the number of firefighters in conjunction \nwith increased population growth and greater housing development. I am \nproud of the courage and self-sacrifice of volunteer firefighters in my \nhome State and across the Nation and want to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment supports their dedication.\n  This amendment offers critical funding assistance to emergency first \nresponders and ensures that the safety of our citizens remains a \nnational priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/10/senate-section/article/S7357-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7357-S7358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING NORM COLEMAN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to speak in honor of the service of \nmy good friend, Senator Norm Coleman. Senator Coleman was among the \nmore thoughtful and intelligent Senators that I have known. His \npresence in this Chamber will be sorely missed.\n  Senator Coleman came to the Senate with more insight into the lives \nand needs of his constituents than most obtain after years of service \nin Congress. He was elected mayor of St. Paul, MN,\n\n[[Page S7358]]\n\nin 1993. Of course, at that time he was a Democrat, but I don't hold it \nagainst him. He eventually realized the error of his ways and was \nreelected as a Republican in 1997. He became the most popular and well \nknown mayor in Minnesota, mostly because he shared something in common \nwith Minnesotans: a love of hockey.\n  In 1993, the Minnesota North Stars became the Dallas Stars, leaving \nthe State of Minnesota without a franchise in the National Hockey \nLeague. Norm shared the view of probably every Minnesotan that this was \njust not right. Honestly, how can you have an NHL without a team in \nMinnesota? Due in large part to Mayor Coleman's lobbying efforts the \nNHL awarded St. Paul an expansion franchise in 1997, the Minnesota \nWild.\n  You would think that bringing hockey back to Minnesota would be \nenough to get him elected to any office he wanted in the state. But, as \nmany have observed, the people of Minnesota are unpredictable. In the \n1998 gubernatorial election, in a race that grabbed the attention of \nmany people throughout the country, Norm finished just 3 percentage \npoints behind Jesse Ventura, whose preGovernor career was, to put it \nlightly, a colorful one.\n  Though this result had to be difficult for Norm, I think we all \nultimately benefited from the outcome of that race. Norm was elected to \nthe Senate in 2002 and immediately became known for his thoughtful \ndemeanor and his dedication to the people of Minnesota. He was a loyal \nRepublican, but he was also willing to work with those in the opposing \nparty to help the State of Minnesota and the Nation as a whole. He \nsupported President Bush, but, as should be expected of any loyal \nsupporter, he was not afraid to express his disagreement or offer his \nadvice with regard to changes and reforms. Indeed, I think Republicans \nand Democrats alike have had a good working relationship with Senator \nColeman because, as many have noted here today, he was more concerned \nwith getting things done and being true to his convictions than he was \nabout being political and towing the party line.\n  Mr. President, while I welcome Senator Coleman's successor, I must \nadmit that I was disappointed when I heard of the final decision of the \nMinnesota Supreme Court. Obviously, I don't like seeing the number of \nRepublicans in the Chamber go down. But, more importantly, I am sad to \nsee the Senate lose such a vibrant and intelligent voice. Indeed, I \nthink his views and statements on the legislation being considered by \nthe Senate this year would add greatly to the debate.\n  I want to wish Senator Coleman the best of luck in his future \nendeavors. While I am sure that he will be a valuable asset for any \neffort with which he becomes involved, I am more certain that he will \nbe missed here in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/10/senate-section/article/S7358-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \ncongratulate and recognize a tremendous asset to the children of \nPhiladelphia, PA, the United States, and really the world--the \nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia. The hospital, or CHOP as it is \nknown, has been ranked first in children's cancer, diabetes and \nendocrine disorders, neonatal care, respiratory disorders and urology \ncare by U.S. News & World Report. I congratulate the hospital's \npresident and chief executive officer, Dr. Steven Altschuler, and his \nteam of over 10,0000 employees for this tremendous accomplishment.\n  CHOP was the Nation's first established children's hospital, growing \nfrom its original structure with 12 beds on Philadelphia's Watts Street \nto a sprawling campus in West Philadelphia with over 40 outpatient \nlocations throughout southeast Pennsylvania and New Jersey, providing \ncare to over 1 million patients last year.\n  CHOP notably provides the highest level of pediatric care and \nconducts groundbreaking research through funding from the National \nInstitutes of Health. When I came to the Senate in 1981, funding for \nthe NIH totaled $3.6 billion. Since becoming LHHS Chairman in 1996, \nSenator Harkin and I have succesfully worked to more than double NIH \nfunding, which was $12.7 billion at that time. In the fiscal year 2009 \nSenate LHHS Appropriations Subcommittee bill, we provided $30.2 billion \nfor NIH funding, a $1 billion increase from fiscal year 2008. We also \nsecured an additional $10 billion in funding through an amendment to \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. I recently visited CHOP for \na townhall meeting and was able to see firsthand some major discoveries \nthat have occurred there as a result of NIH-funded research.\n  In a conversation with Dr. Philip Johnson, the director of CHOP's \nResearch Institute, I learned about an experimental therapy developed \nat CHOP using elements of the body's immune system to improve cure \nrates for children with neuroblastoma, a challenging cancer of the \nnervous system. This type of cancer is very aggressive, causing 15 \npercent of all childhood cancer deaths. I am told that patients who \nreceived this therapy were 20 percent more likely to live disease-free \ntwo years after treatment. Shortly after visiting CHOP, I also learned \nof a study led by Dr. Johnson that could lead to an HIV vaccine, by \ninserting a gene into the muscle that can cause it to produce \nprotective antibodies. AIDS is one of the most devastating pandemics, \nhaving killed more than 25 million people. Such a vaccine appears years \naway from realization; however, with continued investment from the NIH, \nit is possible that this work could save millions of lives.\n  I have fought and will continue to fight for increased funding for \nthe NIH because medical research saves and improves lives. The medical \nresearch at CHOP, through federally funded NIH support, provides \nchildren with a real chance to be cured so that they may continue to \ngrow and prosper.\n  As we continue the debate around health reform, it is important that \nwe recognize the unique needs of children. As I stated, CHOP served \nover 1 million patients last year. When it opened in 1855, it treated \njust 63 patients in its first year. Clearly the demand for highly \nspecialized, pediatric care is growing not only in Pennsylvania but \nthroughout the United States; however, there are shortages in the \nnumber of pediatric specialists able to treat children with very \nparticular needs. That is why it is important to support programs, such \nas the Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Program, to help \nchildren's hospitals train future pediatricians. I have supported ample \nfunding for this program because it helps address a national dilemma \nand provides children's hospitals with the resources they need to \nfoster innovation and improve quality.\n  Mr. President, the accomplishments seen at the Children's Hospital of \nPhiladelphia are unique and revolutionary. I am proud of CHOP for their \nefforts to improve children's health care and promote health and \nwellness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/10/senate-section/article/S7358-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7358-S7359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MOLDOVA'S UPCOMING ELECTION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the Republic of Moldova holds repeated \nparliamentary elections on July 29, after previous elections on April 5 \nthis year were followed by youth protests to display their lack of \ntrust in the electoral process. These protests turned violent and led \nto arrests of hundreds of protesters, their severe beatings, and \ninhumane treatment while in police custody. Even an independent member \nof Parliament, Valentina Cusnir, was abused and beaten by police, \nsuffering injuries. Three young men have died, and the cause of death \nis reported to be injuries from the beatings they received. Foreign \njournalists were expelled and local reporters were arrested and \nintimidated, their equipment was confiscated. The parliamentarian \nopposition parties, which accused the Communist Party in power of \nelection fraud, have boycotted elections of the new President that, \nultimately, triggered repeated elections. The Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe stated that Moldova's recent elections had \n``shortcomings that challenged some OSCE commitments, in particular the \ndisregard for due process in adjudicating complaints of alleged \nirregularities and deficiencies in the compilation of voter lists \nlodged by opposition political parties.''\n  On July 29, the Government of Moldova has another chance to show her \ncitizens and the international community that it remains committed to\n\n[[Page S7359]]\n\ndemocratic principles and international standards. Moldovan authorities \nmust provide access for all electoral participants and civil society \nexperts to public media outlets, as well as ensure the ability of \nvoters abroad to participate in this important poll. The United States \nshould condition good relations with the new government of Moldova \nbased on its respect for the rule of law and human rights. The U.S. \nHelsinki Commission, which I chair, will continue to monitor the \nconduct of the electoral process in Moldova and will hold a public \nbriefing following the elections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/10/senate-section/article/S7359-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA WWII VETERANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 92 \nWorld War II veterans from all over Louisiana who will travel to \nWashington, DC on May 16 to visit the various memorials and monuments \nthat recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable \nservicemembers.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, sponsored this \ntrip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is honoring surviving \nWorld War II Louisiana veterans by giving them an opportunity to see \nthe memorials dedicated to their service. The veterans will visit the \nWorld War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iwo Jima memorials. They will also \ntravel to Arlington National Cemetery.\n  This was the final of four flights Louisiana HonorAir made to \nWashington, DC, this spring. It is the 17th flight to depart from \nLouisiana, which has sent more HonorAir flights than any other State to \nthe Nation's Capital.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our \nmilitary on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today more than 30,000 living WWII \nveterans, and each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory \nof freedom over tyranny. This group had 32 veterans who served in the \nU.S. Army, 16 in the U.S. Air Force, 37 in the Navy, 4 in the Coast \nGuard, 2 in the Marine Corps, and 1 in WAVES.\n  Our heroes, many of them from the Shreveport area, trekked the world \nfor their country. They fought in Germany, France, Italy, Africa, \nJapan, Guam, Bougainville, Guadalcanal, China, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, the \nPhilippines, Tarawa, New Guinea, Korea, Thailand, and Saipan. Their \njourneys included the invasions of North Africa, Sicily and Normandy, \nNew Georgia, and the Battle of Midway. Their fight for freedom even \nextended to Iceland and the Marshall and Solomon Islands.\n  One of our Navy veterans received the Asiatic Pacific Purple Heart, \nand an Army veteran fought at Normandy and received EAME Campaign and \nBronze Service Star medals. Yet another Army veteran fought five major \nbattles of European theatre.\n  A USMC veteran was one of four brothers serving in the Marines and \nfought in Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Guam, Saipan, and Okinawa. He lost \nhis twin brother in Guam.\n  A Navy veteran observed the atomic bomb test at Bikini and was in \nTokyo Bay the morning of the Japanese surrender. Another veteran was \nawarded five naval battle stars for his service in the invasions of \nBougainville, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 92 veterans, all \nLouisiana heroes, who visited Washington, and Louisiana HonorAir for \nmaking these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/10/senate-section/article/S7359-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:59 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2997.

A bill to provide for duty-free treatment of certain \nrecreational performance outerwear, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the U.S. Outdoor \nAct. no denying that this economy has got Americans worried. People are \nstressed, and with good reason. One thing that we see time and again \nduring recessions is that people look to get their minds off the tough \ntimes for just a little while with low-cost, simple activities that the \nwhole family can enjoy. Outdoor recreation fits that bill; it makes \npeople healthier and happier too.\n  But recreational performance outerwear--jackets and pants used for \nskiing and snowboarding, mountaineering, hunting, fishing, and dozens \nof other outdoor activities--are assessed some of the highest duty \nrates applied to any products imported into the U.S. These \ndisproportionately high tariffs, let us call them what they are, taxes, \nwere originally implemented to protect U.S. outerwear manufacturers \nfrom foreign competition. Instead, now these import taxes stifle \ninnovation, add substantial costs for outdoor businesses, and \nultimately raise the prices we all pay at the cash register. We can fix \nthis, help these companies to better compete globally while investing \nin eco-friendly technology and jobs here in the U.S., and help \nconsumers in these tough times so more people can get out and enjoy the \ngreat outdoors.\n  So today, I am proud to introduce the U.S. Optimal Use of Trade to \nDevelop Outerwear and Outdoor Recreation Act, or the U.S. Outdoor Act. \nThis bill is the result of partnership between performance outerwear \nmanufacturers and the domestic textile and\n\n[[Page S7361]]\n\napparel industry. In 2007, the U.S. International Trade Commission \nfound that there was no commercially viable production of performance \nouterwear in the U.S.. This legislation reflects those findings, and \nmakes a solid investment in U.S. jobs. It spurs outdoor recreation and \nits industry, which accounts for $730 billion dollars and 65 million \njobs across the U.S., with 73,000 jobs in Oregon, and this bill can \npotentially create many more. This would also help lower costs for \nconsumers, who pay $289 billion in outdoor retail sales and services \nacross the country, with $4.6 billion in Oregon.\n  The U.S. Outdoor Act eliminates the import duty for qualifying \nrecreational performance outerwear, bringing duties that can be as high \nas 28 percent down to zero.
