Madam President, in our democratic system, protection \nand preservation of the United States of America, her institutions, and \nher citizens is based solely on the voluntary risks taken and \nsacrifices made by ordinary Americans.\n  Woven into the fabric of this great Nation and within all Americans \nis the notion that freedom is not free. Time and time again our \ncitizens, members of our Armed Forces, and law enforcement officials, \nwhen called upon, have answered the call to defend that freedom.\n  Twelve years ago this past Saturday, two courageous Capitol police \nofficers answered the call and made the ultimate sacrifice for their \ncountry and their fellow countrymen. Today, I wish to honor the \nsacrifice of Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut and Detective John Michael \nGibson. An American President once noted:\n\n       Freedom is never more than one generation away from \n     extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the \n     bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected and handed on \n     for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset \n     years telling our children and our children's children what \n     it was once like in the United States where men were free.\n\n  People like Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson defended and even \ngave their lives in the service of this truth that is so vital to our \nsociety. That is why we remember them and that is why we will continue \nto tell their story, so those who follow will never forget the cost of \nfreedom.\n  Both men served for 18 years on the Capitol police force. Officer \nChestnut--or J.J. to his friends--was 58 years old and a father of \nfive. He was a 20-year veteran of the Air Force, serving in Vietnam and \nTaiwan.\n  Detective Gibson was 42 years old and a father of three. A \nMassachusetts native, friends recall his intense love for his Boston \nsports teams--the Bruins, the Red Sox, and UMass basketball. A friend \nrecalled that just a few days before the shooting, John told him he had \nnever had to draw his weapon on the job. Yet, despite being mortally \nwounded on the day he died, John did not hesitate to return fire.\n  This is not only a tribute to Detective Gibson's commitment, it is a \ntestament to the outstanding training and preparation the officers of \nthe Capitol police force receive to handle even the toughest \nsituations. Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson were the first \nCapitol police officers to die in the line of duty.\n  In honor of their sacrifice, a plaque has been placed in the Capitol, \nand their names have been etched upon the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial, as well as the headquarters of the U.S. Capitol \nPolice--fitting tributes to honor these good and courageous men.\n  My friend the majority leader, a former Capitol police officer \nhimself, knows all too well the honor as well as the risks associated \nwith the job. So as we honor Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson \ntoday, we also honor all Capitol police who put their lives on the line \nevery single day to protect us and this institution.\n  To all members of the Capitol police, we thank you for your service \nand your sacrifice. We are grateful for the heroic sacrifice of these \ntwo men. On this day of remembrance, we remember their families as \nwell. May God continue to look after them, and may God continue to \nprotect all those, like Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, whose \ndaily work is to protect the rest of us from harm.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3628, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 476, S. 3628, a bill to \n     amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit \n     foreign influence in Federal elections, to prohibit \n     government contractors from making expenditures with respect \n     to such elections, and to establish additional disclosure \n     requirements with respect to spending in such elections, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n3628, the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in \nElections Act, otherwise known as the DISCLOSE Act. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the motion to proceed to a debate on this \ncritical legislation tomorrow at 2:45.\n  We must not forget why we are here today. In Citizens United v. FEC, \nthe Supreme Court narrowly overruled almost a century of law and \nprecedent and held that corporations have the same first amendment \nrights as people and therefore can spend freely on elections from their \ntreasuries. The Court also opened the door to new kinds of campaign \nspending by labor unions and certain nonprofit organizations.\n  At a time when the public's fears about the influence of special \ninterests were already high, that decision stacked the deck even more \nagainst the average American. As a result, we are faced with a new \nreality in our democracy: unlimited amounts of cash can now flow into \nour Federal elections anonymously and with no accountability.\n  Voting is the bedrock of our democracy. Elections provide the voters \na loudspeaker through which they can make their opinions heard. \nAllowing special interest money to pour into elections unchecked and \nundisclosed will drown out the voices of the voters. But the Supreme \nCourt decision did leave us one narrow opportunity to make an impact on \nthis new era in campaign spending.\n  In Citizens United, eight of the nine Justices agreed that disclosure \nof campaign expenditures is constitutional and in the public's \ninterest. The Court held that disclosure requirements ``do not prevent \nanyone from speaking'' and serve governmental interests in ``providing \nthe electorate with information'' about the sources of money spent to \ninfluence elections so that voters can ``make informed choices in the \npolitical marketplace.''\n  By working within the contours of the Court's majority opinion, we \nhave crafted this bill around new disclosure requirements designed to \nshine a bright light on those who would operate in the shadows. This \nlegislation will follow the money. In cases where corporations or other \nspecial interests try to mask their activities through shadow groups, \nthe legislation drills down so that the ultimate funder of the \nexpenditure is disclosed. No more Citizens for Good Government, or \nPeople for Democracy--and the ads are nasty and tawdry, but we never \nknow who they are from.\n  This legislation requires the sponsors of ads to file regular reports \nwith the Federal Election Commission detailing their political \nexpenditures and the source of the donations they received to fund \nthem.\n  This legislation enhances disclaimer provisions so the public is \naware that it is not a candidate or a political party speaking but a \nspecial interest or a corporation. We require CEOs and heads of special \ninterest groups to identify themselves in their advertising. Candidates \nfor Federal office already have to stand by their ads. There is no \nreason that corporations and special interests should not have to \nidentify themselves as well.\n\n[[Page S6231]]\n\n  The bill also prohibits entities that receive taxpayer money--such as \nlarge government contractors or corporations that received Federal \nrescue funds--from turning around and spending that money to influence \nelections. The bill also bans foreign-controlled corporations from \nspending in our elections.\n  As Justice Stevens noted in his dissent, Citizens United allows \nforeign-controlled interests to participate in American elections now \nsimply by using their domestic-based entities. We need to prevent that \nfrom happening, and the DISCLOSE Act does just that.\n  If not for the DISCLOSE Act, by the way, foreign companies, foreign \ncorporations, foreign entities could participate in our elections. They \ncould put themselves up under the name of ``Americans for Good \nGovernment'' and no one would even know. Let's be clear, current law \nbans foreigners, foreign corporations, foreign unions from \nparticipating in our elections, but under the complex nature of \ncorporate law, we have domestic entities that would no longer fit into \nthis ban by current law but which are controlled by foreign interests \nor even hostile foreign governments. We cannot allow BP, CITGO, or \nChinese sovereign wealth funds to influence our elections, particularly \nunder a name that would not show it was them. We need to close this \nloophole now, and that is what the DISCLOSE Act does.\n  Let me turn to what the bill does not do. There has been a strong \nargument from the hard right, desperate to see that this bill not pass; \nthat this is an infringement on free speech. That is absurd. Claiming \nthat disclosure is tantamount to muzzling free speech is nothing more \nthan a scare tactic from special interests that do not want the public \nto know what they are doing.\n  If you have the courage of your convictions, you should say who you \nare, plain and simple. Democrats and Republicans alike have long \ndefended disclosure campaign expenditures as both appropriate and \nconstitutional. The minority leader has talked about disclosure as a \nsubstitute for campaign finance reform. And in this bill, we are \nworking well within the free speech guarantees of the first amendment \nin our strengthening of disclosures and disclaimers on campaign ads.\n  Second, this bill does not circumvent the Supreme Court. While I \nbelieve the Court's ruling was an activist overreach, this legislation \nclearly does not. The main purpose of the DISCLOSE Act is to provide \nthe American public with information on who is speaking when political \nadvertising and expenditures are made. Its purpose is not to circumvent \nor overturn the Court's decision by imposing a backdoor ban on special \ninterest spending.\n  Recently, the Supreme Court, in another case, Doe v. Reed, again \nupheld disclosure as constitutional under the first amendment, with the \nsupport of eight Justices, which means a whole number of conservative \njudges had to support that idea.\n  This bill does not treat corporations and labor unions, along with \ntrade associations and most other organizations, differently. Last \nmonth, we all know the House passed its version of the DISCLOSE Act. We \nhave made changes to the House bill that I believe make it more \nevenhanded while sticking to the central goal of bringing transparency \nand public disclosure to the new kind of election spending the Supreme \nCourt approved. For example, the House bill received criticism for \nallowing organizations that collect dues to avoid disclosing transfers \nof funds they make to their affiliates. This was criticized, fairly or \nunfairly, as a union carve-out. So we eliminated this exemption in the \nSenate bill. Another exemption was made for transfers between separate \norganizations if the funds could not be traced to an individual donor. \nWe removed this exemption as well. So anyone who votes against this \nbill under the guise that it treats labor and corporations differently \nhas not read the bill. We have kept this bill balanced and evenhanded. \nThe changes made a strong bill even stronger.\n  To recap, the bill does not chill speech. It does not impose a \nbackdoor ban on corporate spending. It does not treat labor unions \ndifferently from corporations. What this bill does do is listen to the \nAmerican people, and 8 in 10 American voters, Democrats, Republicans, \nand Independents, overwhelmingly disapprove of the Supreme Court's \nopinion in Citizens United and overwhelmingly support what we are doing \nhere today. And there is good reason why. The public does not want to \nbe deceived by advertising from anonymous funders. The public does not \nwant foreign-controlled interests taking over our elections. And the \npublic does not want their tax dollars being used by large Federal \ncorporations to influence elections.\n  Already, the Citizens United decision has given rise to a cottage \nindustry of swift boat-style shadow groups, groups that do not make \ndemocracy proud. Karl Rove admitted this month that his new 527, dubbed \n``American Crossroads,'' was born out of a loophole created by the \nCitizens United decision. He bragged that his group will flood the 2010 \nelections with $52 million worth of ads bankrolled anonymously by \nspecial interests. Other shadow groups like Rove's are planning similar \nlevels of activity. All together, these groups could account for $300 \nmillion in political spending this fall alone. The Supreme Court, \nunfortunately, opened the door to these anonymous donations. We must \nact now to close the door before faceless groups are allowed to spend \nunlimited sums without any accountability or transparency. The voters \ndeserve to know the source of this spending.\n  My prediction--sad but I really believe true--is that if we do not \nclose this loophole, the roots of our democracy will get more and more \ncorroded, endangering the whole vital tree, the oak of democracy \nitself. It is hard to believe that we are now saying that a company, a \ngroup, that has multimillions of dollars can spend that money against a \nparticular candidate, say whatever it wants, whether it is true or \nfalse, and not be held to any accountability whatsoever. What has \nbecome of our democracy?\n  The Supreme Court made the wrong decision. I still can't understand \nwhy they did it. But we have an opportunity here--not as Democrats or \nRepublicans but as Americans--to rectify, at least modify within the \nConstitution and at least require disclosure because we all know \ndisclosure will not chill speech but it will make sure that those who \nwish to launch millions of dollars of nasty and perhaps untruthful ads \nagainst a candidate they don't like will at least have to say their \nname. What could be wrong with that?\n  The Senate will vote tomorrow afternoon to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the consideration of the DISCLOSE Act. I urge my \ncolleagues to allow us to move to a debate on this crucial legislation. \nWe have a clear choice tomorrow: We can vote to debate how to make our \nelections more open and transparent or we can bow to special interests \nthat seek to influence our elections behind closed doors. It is time \nfor us to have that debate. Our democracy cannot afford a filibuster of \ntransparency and disclosure in its elections. Let's be clear: If we \nfail to act now, the winner of November's elections will not be \nDemocrats or Republicans; it will be special interests.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Ethanol\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week there was a news conference by \na group of outside people who attacked ethanol, and then the senior \nSenator from Arizona gave a speech on that subject last week. I told \nthe senior Senator that I was going to have something to say about \nethanol this week; I didn't tell the news conference people that I was. \nSo it seems to be that time of year once again. Without fail, every few \nmonths or so, we have big oil on the one hand and big food interest \ngroups on the other hand start a misinformation campaign in an effort \nto denigrate the U.S. biofuels producers. In other words, they are \nattacking renewable fuels.\n  Last week, almost as if on cue, a group opposed to domestic efforts \nto reduce our dependence on foreign oil began their usual song and \ndance. A\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\npress conference led by the Grocery Manufacturers Association and other \nspecial interest groups was held to malign the benefits of homegrown \nrenewable fuels. Don't forget that this is the same group of folks who, \na few years ago, waged a high-priced, inside-the-beltway smear campaign \nagainst ethanol for allegedly leading to higher food prices. At that \ntime, the price of corn was going up because there was speculation in \ncommodities, the price of oil was going up, and so the grocery \nmanufacturers decided: We have to have an excuse to increase the price \nof food--20 percent, roughly. Well, you know what, the price of grain \ncame down, but the price of food has not come down. So I think it was \nsimply a diversionary tactic to get away with what they maybe would not \nhave gotten away with with the consumers.\n  Well, I think 2 years ago, maybe 3 years ago, that myth was roundly \ndispelled, but I want to keep reminding people that there was that \ncampaign out there. Economists proved what Iowa farmers and our \nNation's farmers knew to be true: The higher cost of corn was \nresponsible for just a tiny fraction of the increase in food prices. So \nwhile food manufacturers wanted consumers to believe that corn ethanol \nwas doubling or tripling their grocery prices, nonbiased observers knew \nthat the corn input costs were just pennies of the retail price of \nfood.\n  However, with dozens of multibillion-dollar corporations and profits \nto protect, it is not surprising to see this group--or maybe I better \nsay these groups--attack our country's farmers and ranchers, who are \nworking to produce our Nation's food, our Nation's feed, our Nation's \nfiber, and now, with renewable fuels, producing fuel that you and I \nburn in our car tanks almost daily. And farmers can do that. They can \ndo all of that. They are doing it right now. This year, we will have \nthe largest corn crop this country has ever produced, and doing it on 3 \nmillion less acres of cropland.\n  So these same groups are at it again. They see new opportunities to \nundermine our domestic biofuels industry, and they have a bottom line \nto look out for and pockets to line. They are now arguing that our \nNation cannot afford government policies to foster the growth of \nrenewable energy. In other words, they are arguing that the cost of \nenergy independence is too high and we cannot afford it. They would \nprefer that we increase our reliance on fossil fuels and imported crude \noil. The unfortunate outcome of such attacks, however, is that less \ninformed individuals begin to believe this misinformation. So it is \ntime that we review the true cost of imported fossil fuels.\n  In 2008, Americans sent over $450 billion to foreign countries to \nsatisfy our demand for oil. At $80 a barrel--and I suppose oil is, I \nthink, roughly $75 now, but if it is $80 a barrel, we will send nearly \n$350 billion overseas, out of this country, this year for oil.\n  We rely on foreign oil to meet 60 percent of our oil demand. But do \nnot forget, much of the world's oil reserves are located in the \nvolatile and very unpredictable Middle East.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, oil price shocks \nand price manipulation by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries cost our economy about $1.9 trillion between 2004 and 2008.\n  Our dependence on imported oil accounts for about one-half of our \ntrade deficit--one commodity--a very important commodity for us, but it \naccounts for one-half of our trade deficit.\n  The Federal Government's support for homegrown ethanol equals less \nthan 2 percent--just less than 2 percent of the money we will send to \nCanada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria, and other countries \nwhere we import oil.\n  The domestic ethanol industry supports 400,000 green jobs in the \nUnited States. Last year, ethanol contributed over $50 billion to our \ngross domestic product. It contributed $8.4 billion in tax revenue to \nthe Federal Government. The incentives we provide for ethanol \nproduction lead to a surplus of tax revenue for the Federal Treasury. \nSo which is the better bargain--being dependent on foreign countries \nfor 60 percent of our energy needs at a cost of $350 billion or keeping \nthis money at home, creating green jobs and increasing our national and \neconomic security? I believe the choice is very obvious.\n  Up to this point, I have only considered the economic cost. There are \nother costs. I will put up a chart with one of the environmental costs. \nThis chart depicts a small example of the environmental cost of our \ndependence upon foreign oil. The first photo, the lower photo, is the \none we are all too familiar with, the explosion and the ensuing \noilspill at BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig. The other photo might look \nlike Mars or the Moon, but it depicts land in Canada where oil is being \nextracted from tar sands. The fact is, fossil fuels are getting more \nexpensive to extract and are likely to come at greater environmental \ncost. That is the negative aspect, environmentally, beyond the economic \nissues I have discussed.\n  We have an alternative. That alternative, which the next chart shows, \nis homegrown, renewable biofuels. The chart shows the cornfield on the \nleft, and where we go to the gasoline station to get the renewable \nfuels to power the car on the right. Today, ethanol accounts for 10 \npercent of our transportation fuels. No other fuel alternative comes \nclose to ethanol's contribution to a clean environment and less \ndependence on foreign energy and less dependence upon fossil fuels. \nDomestically produced ethanol contributes more to the fuel supply than \nall imports except Canada. More ethanol means less greenhouse gas \nemissions. A University of Nebraska study found that ethanol reduces \ndirect greenhouse gas emissions by 48 to 59 percent compared to \ngasoline. Ethanol production continues to improve, and increasing crop \nyields means we are producing more fuel from less grain on fewer acres.\n  Let me repeat something I said earlier: Probably 13 billion bushels \nof corn, the largest crop ever produced in the United States, and we \nhave 3 million less acres in crop production this year compared to a \nyear ago. Ethanol producers are reducing energy and water usage. So the \nproduction of ethanol is becoming more efficient.\n  Finally, it is important we consider the national security cost of \nour dependence upon foreign oil. I will put up a chart about the Middle \nEast. The Middle East accounts for 20 percent of U.S. oil imports; 17 \nbillion barrels of oil are shipped each day through the single most \nimportant shipping chokepoint; that is, the Straits of Hormuz out of \nthe Persian Gulf. In fact, the military people say that is one of the \nserious problems in dealing with Iran, if they decided to sink ships \nthere, what they could do economically to the rest of the world and \nwhat they could do national security wise to the rest of the world. \nThey have threatened that. They have never done it, probably because \ntheir livelihood depends on it as much as the rest of the world. But it \nis still one of those chokepoints. On average, 15 crude oil tankers \npass through the Straits of Hormuz every day, with much of that oil \nheaded to the United States.\n  We have two other large oil shipping chokepoints; one at the Suez \nCanal and the other one at the Gulf of Aden at the bottom of the map. \nTo determine the true cost of America's dependence on foreign oil, it \nis important to understand the cost to the taxpayers of defending and \nprotecting these shipping lanes. A New York Times editorial, in the \nlate 1990s, calculated the true cost of a gallon of gas, including the \nmilitary cost of making sure it can get from the oil wells of the \nMiddle East to the United States at $5 a gallon. Last week, I \nquestioned four-star retired U.S. Army GEN Wesley Clark on the true \ncost of gasoline, when he appeared before the Committee on Agriculture. \nHe estimated it to be around $7 to $8 a gallon today, 10 years later \nthan the New York Times editorial.\n  Homegrown ethanol produced in the Midwest--I suppose anyplace in the \nUnited States, but most of the corn is produced in the Midwest--doesn't \nneed a military escort to the gas stations on the east or west coasts \nsuch as oil from the Middle East does. Homegrown ethanol does not need \nthe Department of Defense to protect its transport from our farm fields \nto consumers. Again, our Nation's investment in ethanol is a real \nbargain. It is increasing our economic and national security. That is \nwhy it is important we continue to support this industry.\n  Some have claimed it is a mature industry and it no longer needs our \nhelp.\n\n[[Page S6233]]\n\nThis statement ignores the fact that ethanol is competing with a \ncentury-old industry dominated by big oil, which itself has received \nbillions of dollars from the taxpayers over many decades and for \ndecades longer than the ethanol industry.\n  Getting back to the detractors I referred to, most often the people \nwho held the press conference a week ago today denigrating oil, these \nethanol detractors continue to undermine these efforts. One \norganization estimates that a lapse in the tax incentive for ethanol \nwould shut down 40 percent of the industry and result in the loss of \n112,000 green jobs. That is 112,000 jobs that rely on the production of \nethanol. We can't allow ethanol to follow the path of biodiesel which \nhas essentially shut down because this Congress failed to extend that \ntax incentive that ran out last December 31. While President Obama \nspoke in his address on Saturday about investing in homegrown clean \nenergy, 45,000 biodiesel jobs have vanished because of the lapse of the \nbiodiesel tax credit. It is inexcusable.\n  President Obama touted the goal of creating 800,000 clean energy jobs \nby 2012. Why not take action today to extend the lapsed biodiesel tax \ncredit and immediately put 45,000 people back to work? The same thing \ncould happen to the ethanol industry, if we fail to extend the tax \nincentive which runs out December 31 this year. If we undermine \nethanol, we are putting out the welcoming mat for dictators such as \nHugo Chavez. In fact, last night on the television, it said Chavez is \ntalking about maybe not selling oil to the United States.\n  Then, last week, as I referred to in my speech--and I told the \nSenator from Arizona I was going to speak on ethanol this week--we had \nthe senior Senator from Arizona question the wisdom of domestic \nrenewable fuel incentives. He was quoted as saying:\n\n       Maybe we will stop this damned foolishness called ethanol \n     subsidies. It's one of the greatest rip-offs that takes place \n     on the American taxpayers.\n\n  So to those who would do away with our domestic ethanol production, I \nhave one question: Which country should we look to for 10 billion \ngallons of fuel? Would we want to go to Saudi Arabia? Would we want to \ngo to Venezuela? Would we want to go to Nigeria? Whom would we rather \nsupport with our hard-earned money? I want to ask this question: Would \nwe rather support Hugo Chavez or the American farmer? Would we rather \nsupport Chavez, which is an insane thing to do? Sending money to \nsomeone who buys guns to fight us is insanity. In this chart we have \nthese two people on the left, Chavez and the President of Iran. We have \nthe farmer of America on the right. Where would we want to get our \nenergy from? Whom would we want to rely on?\n  It is pretty easy to answer that question. We shouldn't be reducing \nour use of renewable fuels. We should be increasing it. We should \nproduce all we can from corn and from the biomass that is left over \nfrom corn and from grasses and from wood waste. We should increase the \nuse of biofuels by mandating the production of flex-fuel vehicles and \nincreasing the availability of blender pumps.\n  Ethanol is here today. It is creating a cleaner environment. It is \nkeeping money at home in our economy and increasing our national \nsecurity. Undermining the only renewable fuel that has the proven \nability to accomplish these goals would be insanity, a little bit like \nthe two people we see on the left but not the person on the right. The \nperson on the right is the backbone of the American economy because \nnothing has contributed to the national wealth except what comes from \nthe national resources of the country.\n  Bottom line: Ethanol is good for America, but let's segment that. It \nis good for agriculture. It is good for good-paying jobs in small town \nAmerica, where these renewable plants are located. It is good for the \nenvironment. It is good for lessening our dependence on foreign oil, \nwhich helps our trade balance, which helps our national security. There \nisn't another issue Members can come before the Congress with that has \nno negatives and all positives. In other words, everything about \nethanol is good, good, good.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                             Raising Taxes\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suspect my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona, will have something in response to say to my friend from \nIowa. But what I wish to talk about is a comment Secretary of the \nTreasury Geithner made on television yesterday, in which he said he \nthought it would be a good idea to raise taxes in this country and that \nhe didn't think income taxes on the higher two of the five tax brackets \nwill hurt economic growth. He also said he supports allowing the top \ncapital gains rate to be increased by 25 percent, from 15 to 20 \npercent.\n\n  I want to talk about that for a few minutes today. In this country, \nwe have two goals: job creation and economic growth. We also want to \nreduce our Federal deficit and ultimately the Federal debt.\n  So how do we promote investment? There are two basic theories. One \ntheory is that if we spend a lot of money that we borrow from countries \nsuch as China on programs such as the stimulus program, we can create \neconomic growth and jobs. That has not worked. We have 3 million more \npeople out of work today than when the stimulus package was put into \neffect. In fact, unemployment was supposed to be 8 percent or so now \nwith the stimulus package, and, of course, it is 9.5 percent and with \nno relief in sight. The other way to do this is through investment by \nbusinesses, both large and small businesses. I think most economists \nbelieve that if businesses have capital to invest, they can hire more \npeople, create more output or productivity, and therefore produce both \ngrowth and jobs.\n  So what we should be doing is promoting job creation and economic \ngrowth through private investment. How do we promote that? I know one \nthing you do not do, especially in bad economic times, is raise taxes. \nThe last thing any business, especially a small business, needs--when \nyou are asking them to hire more people--is to say: By the way, would \nyou also give some money to Uncle Sam above what you are already \ncontributing? We need it, and you can put off hiring that person you \nwere going to hire for your business until later.\n  We know that is not how you promote economic growth. You should not \nraise taxes, as I said, especially in a time like this.\n  Secretary Geithner said he did not believe higher taxes would hurt \neconomic growth. So I checked on what the President's chief economist \nsaid--Christina Romer, Chairwoman of the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers--to see whether she agreed with Secretary Geithner. \nWell, it turns out she very much disagrees. In a paper that has just \nbeen published in the June 2010 issue of the American Economic Review \ncalled ``The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Policy Changes,'' she writes, \namong other things, the following--I am quoting now from page 764:\n\n       Our estimates suggest that a tax increase of 1 percent of \n     GDP reduces output over the next three years by nearly three \n     percent. The effect is highly statistically significant.\n\n  So output or growth is reduced by nearly 3 percent just over the next \n3 years.\n  She says on page 797:\n\n       The key results--\n\n  And we are talking about the impact of tax changes on consumption and \ninvestment, which are the two key components to growth.\n  She says:\n\n       The key results are that both components decline, and that \n     the fall in investment is much larger than the fall in \n     consumption. In response to a tax increase of one percent of \n     GDP, the maximum fall in personal consumption expenditures is \n     2.55 percent. . . . just slightly less than the maximum fall \n     in GDP. The maximum fall in gross private domestic investment \n     is 11.19 percent. . . .\n\n  So think of it: Just raising taxes by 1 percent of GDP results in a \ndecrease--or she calls it a fall--in gross private domestic investment \nof over 11 percent. So not only are you not contributing positively to \ninvestment and therefore hiring, but you are cutting it by 11 percent \nduring this same period.\n  She says on page 781:\n\n       In short, tax increases appear to have a very large, \n     sustained, and highly significant negative impact on output . \n     . . the more intuitive way to express this result is that tax \n     cuts have very large and persistent positive output effects.\n\n  So there you have it: Tax cuts promote economic growth. Tax increases\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\ndepress economic growth. They create a fall in both investment and \nconsumption and therefore output, and the result is statistically \nsignificant.\n  Secretary Geithner is wrong. Raising taxes will have a highly \nsignificant, negative impact on job creation, investment, and economic \ngrowth in our country.\n  President Kennedy agreed with this a long time ago. He once said:\n\n       An economy constrained by high tax rates will never produce \n     enough revenue to balance the budget, just as it will never \n     create enough jobs.\n\n  The reason I quoted that is because the second goal we have--to \nreduce budget deficits and public debt--is often used as an excuse by \nthose who want to raise taxes, saying: Well, we reduce debt by raising \ntaxes. As President Kennedy said, if you have high tax rates, you are \nnever going to produce enough revenue to balance the budget. You \nbalance the budget with economic growth. The more growth you have, the \nmore revenue is produced because people are making more money and they \nare paying more taxes. We know that historically. This is not in doubt. \nDuring times of economic growth, when people are doing well, revenues \nto the Treasury increase. In times like today, revenues are decreased. \nYou are not going to be able to balance the budget in this kind of a \nsituation by simply raising tax rates because--what did we just show a \nmoment ago--raising tax rates depresses job creation, economic growth, \ninvestment. So you cannot do it by raising taxes.\n  Indeed, I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nexposed themselves a little bit here because they never seem to have a \nconcern about the deficit when it comes to spending. That is why they \nwere able to spend over $1 trillion in an economic stimulus package and \nnot pay for a variety of other things for which they increased \nspending.\n  I thought the most interesting example was last week when they \nrefused Republican offers to pay for the $34 billion cost of extending \nunemployment insurance. All of us wanted to extend unemployment \ninsurance. That was not in doubt. The question was, Should we pay for \nit with offsets in spending elsewhere? In a $3 trillion budget, we \nsaid: There are a lot of places you can get the money, starting with \nunspent stimulus funds. So we could have paid for or offset the $34 \nbillion cost of extending unemployment benefits. That was our proposal.\n  The Democratic side said: No. We will not extend unemployment \nbenefits unless we can add to the debt in doing so. We are going to \nvote no unless it adds to the debt.\n  In the House of Representatives, the comment was made that they were \nphilosophically opposed to paying for or offsetting the cost because \nthey did not want to get into a position where they would have to find \na way to do that in the future. So they rejected an offer that was made \nby at least one Democratic Senator to use some stimulus funding to \noffset the cost of unemployment benefits. No, they said, we don't want \nto do that. We do not want to offset the costs in any way. We want to \nadd to the debt.\n  So it seems a little hypocritical now for colleagues to come to the \nfloor and say: Oh, we have this big deficit problem. We don't want to \nadd any more to the debt. Let's raise taxes.\n  Then they have the temerity to say to Republicans--who say, we do not \nwant to raise taxes on anybody, on corporations, on businesses, large, \nsmall, individuals, or anybody else--to say: Well, then, in that case, \nyou are going to have to raise taxes on somebody because the budget \nassumes the tax rates that currently exist are going to be increased \nnext year. So if you are going to increase those tax rates for some \npeople--let's say the top two brackets--how are you going to pay for \nthat?\n  We say: What is to pay for? Taxes should not be raised. They should \nnot be raised on anybody.\n  Several of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \napparently in agreement with that. This is not the time to raise taxes \non anybody.\n  But in any event, if you say: Well, we have to raise taxes to reduce \nthe budget deficit, then why just raise taxes on the top two income tax \nbrackets? That would raise, over 10 years, $682 billion. But if you \nraise taxes on everybody, you could raise taxes by $2.731 trillion.\n\n  Well, the obvious answer is, well, we wouldn't want to pay for that. \nWe wouldn't want to offset the cost of that.\n  But you have to figure out a way to offset the cost if we raise taxes \non the upper two brackets. It is a circular argument that I suggest \nboth makes no sense and is hypocritical.\n  The bottom line is this: Small businesses will get killed by an \nincrease in the rates of income tax--the so-called upper two brackets. \nTwenty million people are employed by small businesses that pay their \ntaxes in those two brackets. As a result, what you are going to do is \ninhibit the growth of our small businesses. An increase in the top \neffective rate--this is from Douglas Holtz-Eakin--from 35 percent to 42 \npercent would lower the probability that a small business entrepreneur \nwould add to payrolls by roughly 18 percent.\n  So I think all of us realize that raising taxes, especially in those \ntop two brackets, will inhibit growth because small business owners \nwill have to pay the tax rather than hire someone. As I said before, \naccording to the NFIB, there are more than 20 million workers in those \nfirms directly targeted by the higher marginal rates. We would have to, \nin effect--and this came as a result of statistics presented to us by \nSenator Snowe, who is also on the Finance Committee--you would need to \nhave economic growth of 5.8 percent--about twice as much as we have \ntoday--in order to return to a 5-percent unemployment rate by 2012. To \nget there by 2013, you would have to have an annual growth rate of 5 \npercent to get back to 5 percent unemployment. Well, how are we going \nto increase growth by that much?\n  I come back full circle to my original point: Our goal is economic \ngrowth and job creation. You do not get there by raising taxes. So when \nmy colleagues start talking about raising taxes on anybody--from the \ndeath tax to the capital gains tax to marginal rates--my question to \nthem is, Given the fact that the Chairwoman of the President's Council \nof Economic Advisers has been so clear that this will inhibit job \ncreation and economic growth, why would you want to do that? Why would \nyou want to inhibit economic growth and job creation? The better way, \nif we are really interested in reducing the deficit, as we should be, \nis to begin to slow down the spending so that eventually we are not \nspending more than we take in.\n  I will close with this point: Last Friday, the White House announced \nthat it turns out the deficit for next year is going to be $1.47 \ntrillion. That is about three times higher than the highest deficit \nwith President Bush, and that was when the Democratic Congress was \nappropriating the money. The year before that, it was less than $200 \nbillion. In fact, the exact deficit the last year Republicans were in \ncontrol of the Congress and President Bush was President was $160 \nbillion--$160 billion. That was 1.2 percent of GDP. For next year, it \nis going to be $1.47 trillion--$1.471 trillion--or 10 percent of our \nGDP.\n  The answer is clear: The way to reduce our deficits and reduce our \ndebt is by reducing spending. The way to economic growth is by not \nincreasing taxes. So I hope my colleagues will consider this as we \nbegin to debate the plans to finally achieve economic growth and job \ncreation for the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, I rise today to talk about \nthis legislation, the DISCLOSE Act.\n  Like much of the legislation that is being taken up in the Senate \nthese days, the partisan battle lines are already being drawn on this \nbill. One side sees the impending vote as yet another opportunity to \nscore some political points off the other, and vice versa. That makes \nfor a lively debate, but I am not sure what good it does the American \npeople.\n  I will say on a personal note that I will always fight with every \nounce of my strength for the people of Oregon and the folks whom I have \nthe honor to represent. I say to the Presiding Officer, you and I have \ntalked about this from time to time. I do not exactly come to the floor \nof the Senate looking for gratuitous, political, counterproductive \nfights. What I have been interested in, what I have tried to make the \nhallmark of my service here, is trying to find common ground, trying to\n\n[[Page S6235]]\n\nfind ways to bring people together. Some have said that is overly \noptimistic, almost too idealistic. But I prefer to say it is simply \nbipartisanship and principled bipartisan. It has been my experience in \nthe Senate that if you can get folks to put aside their political \ntalking points and focus on commonsense policy, not only are there \nopportunities for us in the Senate to find common ground, there are \nopportunities to advance policies that make sense for all Americans, \nwhether they are Democrats or Republicans. I have joined Senator \nSchumer in cosponsoring the DISCLOSE Act because I continue to believe \nthis is such an opportunity for bipartisanship and finding common \nground.\n\n  For me, this issue took hold after the 1996 special election where \nSenator Smith, my former colleague--my very good and personal friend--\nand I campaigned against each other to be Oregon's first new U.S. \nSenator in more than 30 years. Suffice it to say that campaign was not \nthe kind of calm and upbeat debate that folks here in the Senate would \nexpect from either me or from Gordon Smith. Instead, it was one of the \nugliest campaigns in Oregon history. There were attack ads being run by \nboth the left and the right. Certainly, while policy differences and \npersonal criticisms are fair and an almost inevitable part of a \npolitical campaign, what bothered Senator Smith and me at that time, \nduring that special election--the only race that was being run anywhere \nin our country--is not only did Oregon voters not know who was \nresponsible for the bulk of those ads; neither Gordon Smith nor I could \nfigure out who was saying what about whom.\n  My view was that something had to change. Something is way out of \nwhack when you are having scores of ads, hundreds and hundreds of ads \nbeing run, and no one can figure out who is running them. My concern is \nthat we are heading back into exactly that same kind of situation, \ngiven the decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Shortly after my election in 1996, when I had watched all of those \nads being run from all those various and sundry groups and not able to \nidentify who was running them, I came back to the Senate and said I am \ngoing to do everything I can to change that. I got together with a \nnumber of us on both sides of the aisle; let me emphasize that, because \nit can't be emphasized enough. This was a bipartisan group that was \nconcerned about that particular issue. We came up with a concept known \nas Stand By Your Ad, where, in effect, those who run ads in their \ncampaigns--it has continued to this day--would have to own up to their \nbeing the ones sponsoring the message.\n  As part of the campaign reform of 2002, Stand By Your Ad was \nincluded. In my view, it has ushered in a new era of personal \naccountability in political elections by requiring candidates to take \npersonal responsibility for the contents of their ads. Not only has \nevery Member of this body seen those ads; my guess is just about \neveryone but our new colleague from West Virginia has actually recorded \nthose ads. That is, in effect, what is required. One has to say: ``I am \nRon Wyden and I approved this message.'' It certainly isn't a hard \nthing to do, and it certainly is not out of line with what the American \npeople have a right to expect, which is openness and personal \naccountability.\n  Now with the Supreme Court decision giving corporations and unions \nand even foreign economic interests the ability to spend as much, if \nnot more, money to influence elections than the candidates themselves, \nI think it is only right that these groups abide by the same rules as \nthe candidates themselves. Just as voters have a right to know when a \ncandidate is trying to influence their vote, I believe voters have a \nright to know when one of these powerful organizations seeks to do the \nsame.\n  Of course, this is going to have an impact on the content of \npolitical speech. Sunlight is the most powerful disinfectant, and I \nthink all of us ought to understand these groups that are buying all \nthese ads are going to be a little bit more hesitant to pay for an \noutrageous attack, an outlandish overreach, if they know they have to \nput their name on it. I think the question that ought to be asked here \nin the Senate is not why should organizations have to stand by their \npolitical speech, but the question should be why don't they want to. \nWhat are they actually ashamed of? In my view, if you feel strongly \nenough about an issue to buy television time, you ought to have the \nguts to put your name on it. I have felt that ever since 1996 when I \nfirst campaigned for the Senate, and I continue to believe that today.\n  I know the debate we are going to have tonight and tomorrow on the \nDISCLOSE Act is going to spur a lot of very impassioned speeches about \npolitical elections, and there are going to be accusations flown by one \nside or another about who is going to get a political advantage and \nwhat ought to be done to quash the person who is somehow deriving a \npolitical advantage out of it. But I would simply say as we go into \nthis discussion that everybody here in the Senate ought to remember \nexactly how we earned our seats in the first place.\n  This very institution was founded on the idea of equality and free \nand open debate. Each and every citizen's voice and vote would be given \nthe same weight as each and every other. What concerns me is that the \nSupreme Court decision, in my view--I say this respectfully--does a \ndisservice to that concept by making it possible for some voices to \ndrown out others. That is what ought to be contemplated at this point, \nand it is certainly what I have been talking about at home, which is \nthat this decision has made it effectively possible for a foreign \neconomic interest to have a louder voice in this country's political \nprocess than a hard-working, tax-paying Oregonian. I don't think that \nis fair; I don't think it is just; and I am not prepared to stand for \nit.\n  I am proud to join Senator Schumer in sponsoring and advocating for \nthis important legislation that, in my view, is worthy of \nbipartisanship. I know there is going to be a strong push to deal with \nthe politics of this issue, but I think this bill is now worthy of \nbipartisan support.\n  Changes have been made to the legislation to address some of the \noriginal concerns that were expressed about the bill. There were \nconcerns originally addressed that some groups weren't being held as \naccountable as others and I believe the legislation has been amended to \ncorrect many of those problems. I think Senator Schumer deserves \nconsiderable credit for it. I have always felt that a credible effort \nat transparency means you have to hold your friends just as accountable \nas those who may disagree with you, and this legislation does that. It \ndoes other important reforms in terms of electronic filing, and I think \nit is very much in the interests of the American people. It certainly \nwill make it possible for the press to report more expeditiously on \nthese kinds of expenditures.\n  I wish to commend Chairman Schumer of the Rules Committee. I think he \nhas been genuinely interested in a collaborative and open process. I \nbelieve Senator Schumer has asked me specifically to participate in \nthis kind of process because he knows that is what I feel so strongly \nabout.\n  We have major issues we have to tackle in the days ahead. I heard \nSenator Kyl talk about taxes. Senator Kyl made a point, in discussing \ntaxes with me, about the whole role of tax expenditures which, in \neffect, is a huge issue in this tax debate. Senator Gregg and I have \nput out the first bipartisan tax reform bill in two decades. So we have \na lot of work to do here and we have to do it in a bipartisan way. I am \nvery hopeful the changes that have now been made, particularly ones \nensuring that one makes it clear--that it is so important that \naccountability and transparency apply in the broadest possible way--and \nthat will make it possible to bring both sides together here in the \nSenate.\n  We came together back in 1996 to write Stand By Your Ad. A number of \nthose Senators on both sides of the aisle I know feel very strongly \nabout open and transparent government. Let's find a way for the Senate \nto duplicate what we did in 1996, and let's make sure that as we go \ninto this election there is transparency and accountability. I don't \nwant to see again what we saw back in 1996 where ads are flying from \nall sides, in every direction, making charges that are clearly \noutrageous and over the line and in no way ensures that voters know who \nis\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\npaying for those ads. The country deserves better. The Senate ought to \nmake it possible for the country to get better and more accountable \ngovernment, and I am very hopeful this Senate will pass the DISCLOSE \nAct, particularly the important changes that Senator Schumer has made, \nin the days ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with some interest to my \ncolleague from Arizona, the minority whip, discuss his notion about the \neconomic issues confronting our country. I wish to respond a bit to \nthem with great respect, of course, because I think the opportunity to \nhave competing ideas about our country's future is a very important \nopportunity here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Some long while ago I wrote in a book that I published about Stanley \nNewberg. I wrote in the book that I had read about Stanley in a very \nsmall New York Times article, but it so piqued my interest that I \ndecided to try to find out about Stanley, so I did. I found that \nStanley had come to this country as a young boy to escape the \npersecution of the Jews by the Nazis. He, with his father, sold fish, I \nbelieve, on the Lower East Side of New York City, in Manhattan. He \nfollowed his dad selling fish. He learned English. He went to school. \nThen he was able to do well in school and go to college. His parents \nhad saved for him. He went to college and graduated from college and \nthen went to work. He got a law degree and then he went to work for an \naluminum company. He did so well he rose up and finally managed the \naluminum company and then purchased the aluminum company. When he died, \nthey opened his will. In his will he said he wanted to leave his $5.7 \nmillion to the United States of America for the privilege of living in \nthis great country, and that was Stanley Newberg's will.\n  I thought: That is really unusual for someone to die and in their \nwill leave their money to this country with gratitude for the privilege \nof living in this great country. What a remarkable thing to remind all \nof us that being an American is something we shouldn't take for granted \nMonday through Friday or all week long, for that matter.\n  It is the case, I think, for most of us that when we grew up, we \nunderstood this country was the biggest, the strongest, the best, \ndestined to expand opportunity for our children, and things would \nalways be better for the next generation than for the last. That is how \nwe viewed this country of ours.\n  But it is the case, it seems to me, these days that America has lost \na step. There is great concern about whether the kids will have it \nbetter than we had it. There is great concern about the economy and the \nfact that there are probably 18 million to 20 million people who woke \nup this morning either without a job, or with less of a job than they \ncould easily handle. They are underemployed or unemployed--18 million \nto 20 million people. People woke up this morning and saw the news that \nwe are deep in debt and getting deeper in debt. They are concerned \nabout the federal debt, and they should be, there is no question about \nthat.\n  Let me, for a moment--because I want to engage on the proposition by \nmy colleague from Arizona--transport us back to 2001. In 2001, on the \nfloor of the Senate, during that period, we had a pretty raucous \ndebate. That debate on the Senate floor was about the first budget \nsurplus in 30 years under the last year of President Bill Clinton--a \nbudget surplus of a couple hundred billion dollars. Alan Greenspan was \nnot sleeping at night because he was worried that we were going to pay \ndown the Federal debt too rapidly and that would injure the economy. \nMany of my colleagues said we have a surplus now, and the economists \nproject that we are going to have surpluses for 10 years--as far as the \neye can see. You have heard the old line that if you were to lay all \nthe economists end to end, they would never reach a conclusion. \nIndividually, almost all of them said we have a surplus, and now we \nwill have one as far as the eye can see. Many of my colleagues \nsupported George W. Bush's proposal to provide tax cuts for the next 10 \nyears. They said: Let's provide tax cuts for the next 10 years because \nwe need to give this surplus back to the American people.\n  I stood on the floor of the Senate then and said I don't think we \nought to give back tax funds that don't yet exist. These surpluses are \nonly projections. What if something would happen? How about being a \nlittle conservative about this? But, no, Katy bar the door; they said \nwe are going to provide large tax cuts, and the largest to the \nwealthiest Americans, such that if you made $1 million a year in \nincome, you got an $80,000 or so a year tax cut. That was the proposal. \nIt passed--without my support, but it passed. So that was the \nexperience in 2001.\n  Fast forward to 2010. Where are we? We are $13 trillion in debt. By \nthe way, this is testimony before the Senate Committee on Finance by \nLeonard Burman, who is the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Professor of Public \nAffairs at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University:\n\n       If the Bush tax cuts had never been enacted, the debt held \n     by the public at the end of 2009 would have been 30 percent \n     lower, to about $5.2 trillion . . . This was less than the \n     level of debt at the end of 1999.\n\n  The question is--and this is what brought me to the Senate floor--my \ncolleague says we have to extend the tax cuts that were provided in \n2001. The President says let's extend the tax cuts for middle-income \nfolks making $250,000 a year, or below. My colleague from Arizona, and \nothers, say, no, let's extend all of Bush's tax cuts from 2001. Let's \nextend them all. The difference is about $1 trillion added to the debt \nover the next decade. Extending those tax cuts for roughly 2 percent of \nthe wealthiest U.S. households will cost, with interest, about $1 \ntrillion.\n  My colleague says if you don't do that, then you are increasing taxes \non upper income people, and that is going to retard economic growth. \nLet me talk for a bit about that, because it is interesting to me that \nthose who are on the floor saying let us not let the tax cuts expire--\nby the way, these were tax cuts for upper income people, who got the \nlargest tax cuts, and they were given because we were trying to give a \nsurplus back. Does anybody see a surplus around here? Has anybody seen \na surplus for 9 years?\n  Right after the Senate and the Congress passed legislation to provide \nsignificant tax cuts for wealthy Americans, we had a recession in 2001, \non 9/11 we had a devastating terrorist attack, and then we went to war \nin Afghanistan, and then we went to war in Iraq, and we had a \ncontinuing war against terrorism. We never saw a surplus beyond that \nyear. That deficit and debt went up, up, up, and up.\n  At the same time all of that was happening, this new administration \nthat came in in 2001 not only said we are going to cut taxes largely \nfor the wealthy, but they said we are going to hire a bunch of \nregulators in this town who will promise not to look. You do what you \nwant and we won't watch. Wall Street went wild. It was an unbelievable \ncarnival of greed. We had trillions and trillions of dollars of \nfinancial vehicles being created that had never been created before, \nsuch as naked credit default swaps, synthetic CDOs--you name it--and \nthey were trading back and forth. As Will Rogers said, people were \ntrading things they never got from people who never had it. Everybody \nwas making a lot of money on Wall Street, like hogs in slop, as they \nsay on the farm.\n  The fact is that the house of cards they created came tumbling down. \nWhen this President crossed the threshold of the White House in January \nof last year, had he taken a Rip Van Winkle nap for a year and done \nnothing, the budget deficit he inherited was going to be $1.3 trillion. \nNow we have a $13 trillion Federal budget deficit, and now we have the \ncircumstances of a tax cut, the bulk of which went to the wealthy, that \nwas described by the minority 9 years ago as being essential to give \nback the surplus that doesn't exist.\n  The question is, will that tax cut be extended for the wealthiest \nAmericans?\n\n[[Page S6237]]\n\nPhrased another way, shall we add another $1 trillion in Federal debt \nin order to give tax cuts at $80,000 a year to someone who makes $1 \nmillion a year? At the same time our colleagues say that is essential \nto do, they say if you don't do that, you will have an unbelievable \nimpact on small business, because that is who will pay these taxes. \nThat is not true at all--just not true. About 3 percent of small \nbusiness income, would be captured by that; 97 percent would not. Those \nare the facts.\n  At the same time we have people pushing for that--adding $1 trillion \nto the debt by giving the highest income earners in the country \nextended tax cuts--the same folks are coming to the floor and saying, \nby the way, one of our highest priorities is not only to extend the tax \ncuts for the highest income earners, it is to make sure we repeal \npermanently the estate tax. They don't call it that; they call it the \n``death tax.'' Why do they do that? Because a pollster did a poll and \nsaid if you call it the ``death tax,'' you can fool the American people \nwho will believe there is a tax on death. But of course, there is not; \nthere is a tax on inherited wealth.\n  It seems to me that is an interesting set of priorities. They say we \nare concerned about the Federal deficit and debt--and, by the way, we \nwant to add $1 trillion to the debt by opposing President Obama's \nrequest that we not extend the tax cuts for people making over \n$250,000. We want to add $1 trillion to the debt, and we also want to \nrepeal the entire estate tax.\n  I don't know how one believes that set of priorities represents the \nbest interests of our country. I am for lower taxes. I would love it if \npeople could pay minimal taxes across this country. But I am also for a \ncountry that works, and a country that matters, and a country that \ninvests in itself and its future. Someone once asked the question: If \nyou were given the assignment to write an obituary and the only \ninformation you had about the deceased was their check register, what \nwould you write? So you look at that check register and find out what \ndid they spend money on? What was their value system? What was \nimportant to them?\n  The same is true with the Federal budget and the priorities we \ndescribed by taxing and spending. What will historians say when looking \nback and seeing that we were in deep trouble, with 20 million people \nout of work or underemployed, a $13 trillion debt, and the minority was \nsaying the highest priority was to cut taxes for those earning \n$250,000, and more, and to repeal the tax on inherited wealth? That is \nunbelievable.\n  You know, the only way, as of last year, you would pay any tax on \ninherited wealth is if you had more than $7 million a year. How many \nfamilies have more than $7 million net per year? By the way, this year, \nthe inheritance tax is zero, and it springs back the next year. That \ngoofy set of circumstances was arranged by the same people who wrote \nthe tax cut bill in 2001 to give back a surplus that turned out not to \nexist. So we have a zero tax year this year, and four billionaires have \ndied so far. By the way, their estate will pay a zero rate, and my \ncolleagues come to the floor and say that money has already been taxed. \nWrong, it has not. Much of it is growth appreciation of property or \ntax, and it has never borne a tax. It is just the folks who go to work \nevery day and pay their taxes on time; they pay for their kids' \nschools, and roads, and police, and fire protection, and the Defense \nDepartment, and the CDC--they are the ones paying the taxes.\n  But do you know what? If you find the people who have 10, 15, 20, and \n$50 million in assets--I will show you that the bulk of that has come \nthrough growth appreciation that has never borne a tax at all in this \ncountry. That is the highest priority for the minority--to eliminate \nthe tax on inherited wealth. That is unbelievable to me.\n  We in this country have a very serious set of problems. We need to \ncut Federal spending, there is no question about that. Federal agencies \nare big and, in some cases, bloated. I mentioned the other day that I \nthink I have done pretty well myself. I want to spend in this country \nto invest in good things that will make this a better country. I want \nus to continue building and improving our roads, our schools, and the \nthings that make this a better country. But I also believe we ought to \ncut back where we should.\n  In my State, some years ago, there was a proposal to build a new \ncourthouse, and $46 million was put into an appropriations bill, which \npassed, to build a new courthouse in the largest city of my State. I \nthought it was way overboard, so I cut it to $23 million--in half. It \nwas built for $19 million. Some people say: That is strange, cutting \nfunding for your own State. But I thought it was excessive spending. I \ndon't care whether it is my State, or other States; we need to tighten \nour belts and cut spending. We can cut in areas where we are spending \ntoo much, no question about that.\n  You don't address this unbelievable burden of debt deficit and by \ndeciding you are going to cut your revenue as well. You cannot do that. \nWho will pay for this country and what it needs? We have some people at \nthe top of the income ladder in this country who are only paying a 15-\npercent income tax rate--the highest income earner, 2 years ago, earned \n$3.6 billion--that is $300 million a month--and paid a 15-percent tax \nrate.\n  Most working people don't get to pay a tax rate that low. Some of \nthose folks are running their companies through tax haven countries, \nwith deferred compensation deals to even avoid paying a 15-percent \nrate. Somebody has to pay some taxes to invest in the future of this \ncountry. We need to invest in our children and in our infrastructure. \nSomebody has to pay those taxes. I understand that nobody likes to pay \nthem very much, but we have to get control of this deficit, no question \nabout that. We have to decide as a country that you can't ask men and \nwomen to lace up their boots and put on ceramic body armor and go \nhalfway around the world and take a gun and fight and be shot at and, \nby the way, we ask you to do that in the name of our country, and we \nwill not pay for a penny of it. We will add it to the debt. We have \ndone that for 8 years. We cannot continue to do that. Americans know \nbetter than that.\n  Let me finish by saying that, as I said earlier, we should not \nnecessarily believe that everything will be all right just because we \nlive here in America. This country deserves good judgment and tough \ndecisions to put the country back on track. In the book McCullough \nwrote on John Adams, they were putting this new country together and he \nwas traveling in Europe. The record of all of that is in his letters to \nAbigail. He would write back as he was traveling abroad and ask the \nplaintive question: Where will the leadership come from to build this \nnew country? From where will the leadership come? Who will be the \nleaders as we try to put this new country together? Then, in the next \nletter, he would answer the question.\n\n  There is only us to provide the leadership. There is me. There is Ben \nFranklin, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Madison, Mason. In the \nrearview mirror of history, the ``only us'' represents some pretty \nunbelievable human talent who risked their lives, risked their \nfortunes, risked all they had to do the right thing for this country.\n  The question for us now, with a $13 trillion debt, an anemic economy, \ngreat partisan divides that exist between the political parties, and \nelections coming up in November, the question is, From where will the \nleadership come? Who really is willing to lead this country by saying: \nHere is what we have to do? It is not pleasant always. But who is \nwilling to make those judgments to say we cannot just always take for \ngranted what America's future might be based on what it was? This \ncountry deserves better.\n  I am not here to say one party is all right and one party is all \nwrong. I heard my colleagues say: If you do this, it is bad for small \nbusinesses. That is not the case in any event. We have had a bill on \nthe Senate floor that would provide assistance, help, and investment to \nsmall businesses. It has been on the floor 3 weeks, and the very people \nwho say they are for small businesses have been blocking it for 3 \nweeks. All we need is some straight talk from time to time.\n  I would like everybody to pay the lowest possible tax rate. I would \nlike our government to be the most efficient. I would like us to invest \nin the future of our country. I would like all\n\n[[Page S6238]]\n\nthose things to happen. I would like it if we were not at war. I \nwatched yesterday down at a place called the Newseum. Once again, I \nwatched the video of 9/11/2001. That was not brought on by us; that was \nbrought on by others, and we did not have a choice but to address these \nissues.\n  When we do these things, we must do them as a country that cares \nabout our future. We cannot just spend money, send soldiers to war, do \nall these things and say: We don't have to pay for any of it and you \nall will understand. That is not leadership.\n  This President inherited a pretty tough situation. Now he is \ncriticized for saying he inherited a tough situation. The history books \nwill write what he inherited. He is trying pretty hard but does not get \nagreement on much of anything these days. At the very least we ought to \nsay we agree, let's extend tax cuts for middle-class Americans. This is \na pretty tough time for them. But we had some of the highest rates of \ngrowth in this country when the wealthiest Americans were paying the \ntax rate that previously existed. Extending tax cuts for the wealthy at \na time when we are at war and we say we would like to extend to them an \n$80,000-a-year tax cut if they have a $1 million a year income? That is \nnot leadership, in my judgment.\n  This country deserves better, this country can do better, and this \nCongress can do better with a little less partisanship and a little \nmore thought and see if we can come together to represent the future of \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I forgot to put my chart up again. Every \nday I want to remind people what this is all about.\n  Will Rogers, 80 years ago, said what applies today. He said:\n\n       The unemployed here ain't eating regular, but we'll get \n     around to them as soon as everybody else gets fixed up OK.\n\n  We will get around to the unemployed as soon as everybody else gets \nfixed up OK. I am part of the Old West out in the northern Great \nPlains. They used to say about wagon trains: You don't move a wagon \ntrain ahead by leaving some wagons behind. This country is best when it \nworks together.\n  Will Rogers described this in the 1930s:\n\n       The unemployed here ain't eating regular, but we'll get \n     around to them as soon as everybody else gets fixed up OK.\n\n  Wall Street got fixed up with hundreds and hundreds of billions of \ndollars and untold trillions from the back door of the Federal Reserve \nBoard. They got fixed up. Now they are seeing record profits again.\n  There are a whole lot of folks at the bottom of the economic ladder \nwho are not fixed up and are out of work--not from their fault, nothing \nthey did; they are just out of work because they lost their jobs during \na severe economic downturn.\n  It seems to me that is what requires our leadership. In this Chamber, \nat this moment, nobody is out of work. Everybody puts on a white shirt, \na suit, and comes to work. Nobody is out of work. But a whole lot of \nAmericans are. We ought to keep our priorities on that every single \nday.\n  This country works best when we are able to put people back to work. \nThere is no social program this Senate is involved in, no social \nprogram as important as a good job that pays well. That is what makes \neverything else possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Separation of Powers\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the serious erosion of the doctrine of separation of powers \nduring the course of the past two decades. With the pendency of the \nconfirmation of Solicitor General Elena Kagan for the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, this is a particularly apt time to discuss this \nmatter since these issues were a part of the confirmation process.\n  What we have found in the course of the past two decades is that \nCongress has lost considerable institutional authority, with the Court \ntaking over on congressional authority or by refusing to decide certain \ncases, leaving the executive branch a great deal of what had been \ncongressional authority. We find, for example, that the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act--where the Congress of the United States \ndetermined that the exclusive way for obtaining a wiretap on the \ninvasion of privacy was through a court order--has been abrogated to a \nsubstantial extent by the terrorist surveillance program, which I shall \nspeak about at a later time. Similarly, when you have the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, again by deciding not to take the case \ninvolving the survivors of 9/11, the Court has left the executive \nbranch with considerable authority which, I would submit, rightfully \nbelongs to the Congress.\n\n  But today the issue I want to discuss, and I will turn to others at a \nlater time, is the question of how the Court has taken over more of \ncongressional authority by moving into the area of fact finding, which \nis a traditional legislative responsibility.\n  Chief Justice Roberts, in his confirmation hearings, testified \nextensively, as did Justice Scalia in his confirmation hearings, about \nit being a legislative function to find the facts. Congress has the \ninstitutional competence to have hearings, to examine witnesses, to go \ninto evidence, and to make a factual determination about what public \npolicy should be. As Chief Justice Roberts said in his confirmation \nhearing, when the Court moves into that area, the Court is, in effect, \nlegislating.\n  I submit that where the traditional doctrine of separation of powers \nis being altered, it is a very fundamental and serious change in our \nconstitutional structure. Separation of powers is an integral part of \nthe structure of the Constitution: article I for the legislative \nbranch, article II for the executive branch, and article III for the \njudicial branch. This separation of powers has provided the checks and \nbalance in our system.\n  But in the course of the past two decades, the Court has moved into \nan area where Congress had traditionally been in charge. In the case of \nUnited States v. Lopez, a 5-to-4 decision decided in 1995, the Supreme \nCourt of the United States said legislation which limited someone from \ncarrying a gun on school property was unconstitutional because it was \nnot justified under the commerce clause. This was a very surprising \ndecision because there had not been a successful challenge to the \nexercise of Congressional authority legislating under the commerce \nclause for some 60 years.\n  This is what Justice Souter had to say, for a four-Justice dissent, \nthe case being a 5-to-4 decision, as so many of them are. In dissent, \nJustice Souter said the Court should defer to ``congressional judgment \n. . . that its regulation addresses a subject substantially affecting \ninterstate commerce if there is any rational basis for such a finding. \n. . . The practice of deferring to rationally based legislative \njudgments is a paradigm of judicial restraint. . . . [I]t reflects our \nrespect for the institutional competition of Congress on a subject \nexpressly assigned by the Constitution to the Congress and our \nappreciation of the legitimacy that comes from Congress's political \naccountability in dealing with matters open to a wide range of possible \nchoices. . . . The modern respect for the competence and primacy of \nCongress in matters affecting commerce developed only after one of the \nCourt's most chastening experiences. . . .'' Justice Souter was \nreferring to what happened to the Supreme Court during the New Deal era \nwhen the Supreme Court in the 1930s struck down a great many of the \ncongressional enactments, leading to a great deal of controversy, \nleading to proposals to expand the number of Justices, and the famous \nPresident Roosevelt Court-packing\n\n[[Page S6239]]\n\nplan. But within what Justice Souter says, and what I have just quoted, \nit is a matter of legislation when the Court moves into the fact-\nfinding process.\n  The Lopez case was followed 5 years later by the case of United \nStates v. Morrison. There, the Supreme Court of the United States \ninvalidated portions of the Violence Against Women Act, holding that \nthey were not constitutional because of the congressional method of \nreasoning. Again, Justice Souter sounded the clarion call, speaking for \nfour Justices when he said:\n\n       Congress has the power to legislate with regard to activity \n     that, in the aggregate, has a substantial effect on \n     interstate commerce. . . . The fact of such a substantial \n     effect is not an issue for the courts in the first instance . \n     . . but for the Congress, whose institutional capacity for \n     gathering evidence and taking testimony far exceed ours. . . \n     . The business of the courts is to review the congressional \n     assessment, not for soundness but simply for the rationality \n     of concluding that a jurisdictional basis exists in fact.\n\n  Justice Souter then went on to point out that there was a mountain of \nevidence in support of what the Congress had decided to do.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States later invalidated \ncongressional legislation in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, largely \non the same ground. The case involved allegations of violations of age \ndiscrimination in employment, and, in the Kimel case as in the Morrison \ncase, the Court relied upon a test where it said the act of Congress \nshould be judged in terms of its proportionality and congruence. This \ntest of congruence and proportionality was articulated by the Supreme \nCourt in the City of Boerne case. It had never been a part of \nconstitutional doctrine, and the grave difficulty is in inferring what \nis meant by congruence and proportionality.\n  In a later floor statement, I will take up two decisions of the \nSupreme Court of the United States, each 5 to 4, involving the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  One of the problems which has been found in the confirmation process \nis the grave difficulty of getting an idea of the ideology of the \nnominees because of the refusal of the nominees to answer questions. It \nwas thought that the confirmation proceeding of Solicitor General Elena \nKagan would provide an opportunity to find out something about the \napproach, the ideology or philosophy of the nominee because Ms. Kagan \nhad written so critically, in a 1995 article in The University of \nChicago Law Review, about the nomination proceedings involving Justice \nGinsburg and Justice Breyer.\n  Ms. Kagan, in that argument, criticized them for stonewalling and not \nanswering any questions. Also, Ms. Kagan in that article criticized the \nCongress--the Senate, really--for not doing its job in the confirmation \nprocess and finding out where the nominees stood.\n  When Ms. Kagan appeared before the Judiciary Committee, it was a \nrepeat performance. One question which I asked her brought the issue \ninto very sharp focus. I asked her what standard would she apply, if \nconfirmed, on judging constitutionality? Would she use the ``rational \nbasis'' standard, which had been the standard of the Supreme Court for \ndecades, the standard which Justice Souter talked about in the two \ndissenting opinions I have just referenced? Or would she use the \n``congruent and proportional'' standard, which had everybody befuddled.\n  Justice Scalia said that the standard of proportionality and \ncongruence is a ``flabby standard,'' which was so indefinite, vague, \nand unsubstantial that it left the Supreme Court open to make any \ndetermination it chose and in effect to legislate.\n  In later floor statements, I will take up the question as to what \nmight be done to try to stop this erosion of the doctrine of separation \nof powers, what might be done to stop the reduction of Congressional \nauthority. One line which had been suggested was to defeat nominees. As \nI will comment later in more detail, there does not seem to be much of \na Senate disposition to defeat nominees for failure to answer \nquestions. Based upon what has happened in every confirmation \nproceeding since Judge Bork's confirmation proceeding in 1987, the \npractice has evolved of no answers and confirmation.\n  Another idea was explored by Senator DeConcini and myself after the \nScalia hearings, where Justice Scalia answered virtually nothing. \nJustice Scalia was confirmed in 1986. Justice Bork's confirmation \nproceeding followed in 1987, and after Judge Bork did answer questions, \nas he really had to with such an extensive paper trail, Senator \nDeConcini and I decided we didn't need to pursue the idea of a Senate \nstandard. But that is an option which might be considered.\n  Another potential method of dealing with the issue would be the idea \nof televising the Supreme Court--which I have talked about and will \ntalk about in some detail at a later date. Taking off on what Justice \nBrandeis said about sunlight being the best disinfectant, and publicity \nbeing the way, as Justice Brandeis put it in a famous article in 1913--\nbeing the way to deal with social ills.\n  In an article in the Washington Post on July 14, just a couple of \nweeks ago, a noted commentator on the Supreme Court, Stuart Taylor, \nsaid that the only way the Supreme Court would change its ways is if \nthere was an infuriated public. To infuriate the public, the first \nthing that has to happen is for the public to understand what the \nSupreme Court is doing.\n  In light of the lateness of the hour, that is a subject which I will \ntake up at a later time in detail. But the focus today is on the three \ncases: the Lopez case, the Morrison case, and the Kimel case.\n  I thank the staff for staying overtime. I know there had been a hope \nto conclude a few minutes earlier, by 6, but we are not too far gone \nconsidering tradition on the Senate floor of extended presentations.\n  I believe there is an announcement the clerk would like me to make in \nconcluding the proceedings today?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/26/senate-section/article/S6239-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the 20th \nanniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  The enactment of this important legislation was a significant \nmilestone in our national journey to perfect our Union, uphold our \nfounding values, and reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that the \nrights enshrined in our Constitution are truly available to all of our \ncitizens. I was honored to have been able to support this bill in 1990, \nand am proud to be here today to talk about what its enactment means to \nmillions of our fellow Americans, as well as to celebrate the \ncontributions of those whose tireless work, and undying support, made \npassage of this bill a reality.\n  Thanks to this landmark law, our country has made progress in \neliminating the historical stigma previously associated with mental and \nphysical disabilities. It is also a critical step toward guaranteeing \nbasic civil rights for an entire population who, for much of our \nNation's history, have faced incredible unfairness and isolation. For \ndecades, we have fought for the civil rights of people with \ndisabilities, combating the antiquated mindsets of segregation, \ndiscrimination, and ignorance. Our Nation has come from a time when the \nexclusion of people with disabilities was the norm. We have come from a \ntime when doctors told parents that their children with disabilities \nwere better left isolated in institutions. We have come from a time \nwhen individuals with disabilities were not considered contributing \nmembers of society.\n  Those times have thankfully changed. The passage of the ADA in 1990 \nprovided the first step toward that change our country so desperately \nneeded, and 20 years later, many of these individuals are thriving in \nways that a few short years ago, would have been unthinkable. More and \nmore, individuals with disabilities are able to integrate into \ncommunities across America. Thanks to the ADA, they are finding \nemployment, buying their first home, and enjoying our public parks,\n\n[[Page S6240]]\n\ntransportation, and other civic facilities far more successfully than \never before.\n  Just as I was a proud supporter of the ADA then, I was a proud \nsupporter of the resolution which the Senate passed last week, \nintroduced by my colleagues Senators Harkin and Hatch, commemorating \nthe 20th anniversary of that historic achievement. I would like to \nthank Senator Harkin in particular for his leadership on the passage of \nthe ADA.\n  I would also like to thank my former Connecticut colleague, Lowell \nWeicker, who, as a Senator in 1988, was the original sponsor of the \nlegislation that went on to become the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nand is still a national leader in advocating for individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Without their tireless efforts and support, it would not have been \npossible to pass this legislation those 20 years ago.\n  Equal protection under the law is not a privilege in the United \nStates of America--rather, it is a fundamental right due every citizen, \nregardless of race, gender, national origin, religion, sex, age, or \ndisability. It is unacceptable to deny any individual his or her right \nto those protections because of a disability. Our country has an \nobligation to its citizens to ensure that their fundamental rights are \nprotected, and, if those rights are violated, that the appropriate \nrecourse is available.\n  In 2008, the overall percentage of people with a disability in my \nhome State of Connecticut was 10.4 percent; approximately 350,000 \nresidents. That is 350,000 reasons why 20 years later, I am proud of--\nand somewhat awed by--the impact this bill has made. And that is just \nin my home State. Across the entire country, more than 50 million \npeople have been aided by the passage of this historic legislation.\n  The resolution that we passed in this body last week honors and \ncommemorates the 20th anniversary of the ADA. We passed it 100-0. This \nstrong, bipartisan statement underscores the far reaching importance of \nthis landmark law. I am proud to not only have been able to vote for \nits passage those 20 years ago, but also to have been an original \ncosponsor along with several of my colleagues still present in this \nbody, including Chairman Harkin.\n  As we take this opportunity to commemorate the tremendous advances \nthe disability community has made, we must not forget the steadfast \nsupport of the wide network of groups and individuals who have made it \ntheir mission to help every single American, despite his or her \ndisability, reach his or her fullest potential, and which made this \nextraordinary achievement possible.\n  I have worked closely with these groups throughout my tenure in the \nSenate to ensure they have gotten the support they need from the \nFederal Government, especially the Consortium for Citizens with \nDisabilities. I thank them for their support and assistance, and truly \nvalue the working relationships I have established over my entire \ncareer.\n  In my capacity as a senior member of the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, I have spent my career fighting \nalongside my colleagues to improve the lives of people with \ndisabilities. Some of the most important pieces of legislation I have \nintroduced or supported throughout my career have been to further that \ngoal. From the Disability Savings Act, a bill I introduced in 2008 \nwhich would encourage individuals with disabilities and their families \nto start disability savings accounts for their unique disability-\nrelated needs, to the Best Buddies Empowerment for People with \nIntellectual Disabilities Act, a bill I introduced earlier this \nCongress with Senator Hatch which promotes the expansion of that \nacclaimed program. I am hopeful we can pass this important legislation \nthis year.\n  I am also pleased that the recently enacted Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act makes further progress toward meeting the needs of \nthe disabled community. That legislation incorporates an important idea \nknown as the CLASS Act, which creates a voluntary disability insurance \nprogram designed to pay for nonmedical and support services so that \npersons with disabilities are able to live independently. Getting this \nprogram started was a remarkable achievement, and something many of my \ncolleagues and I had worked for many years to accomplish.\n  Of course, none of the important advances we have made, legislatively \nor otherwise, would have been possible without the tireless work of one \nof the great advocates for equal opportunities for individuals with \ndisabilities that the Senate has ever seen--my dear friend, the late \nSenator Ted Kennedy. For Teddy, the issue of fairness and empowerment \nfor individuals with disabilities was always in the forefront of his \nmind and legislative agenda. Along with his late sister Eunice Kennedy \nShriver, his commitment to this issue, which touches so many of our \nfellow citizens, is a legacy that we must seek to preserve and to \ncontinue.\n  On this, the 26th day of July 2010, I urge my colleagues and fellow \ncitizens to celebrate the freedom and opportunities provided by the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and recognize the strides we have made \nto raise the employment and graduation rates, increase self-\nsufficiency, and very simply, lift the self-esteem of those who for too \nlong were denied these opportunities.\n  As we strive to perfect our Union, we must remember that we are a \njust society. We are a society that has enshrined the notion of \nequality, both in rights and opportunity, for all in our very founding \ndocuments. We must continue to reaffirm the promise made in those \ndocuments to each citizen, no matter their race, creed, or \ncircumstance.\n  The passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act is one example of \nhow we have worked to keep those promises. It represents a successful \nstep toward fulfilling our Nation's goals of equality of opportunity, \nindependent living, economic self-sufficiency, and full participation \nfor Americans with disabilities. It has been a tremendous honor to have \nbeen able to support this law, and as I look back on the good it has \ndone, 20 years later, I am confident that future generations will \ncontinue to build on its success as a cornerstone to ensuring that all \nAmericans have equal access to the American dream.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I join Arkansans and all Americans to \ncommemorate the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, known as ADA. This legislation has literally opened doors for \ncountless Arkansans living with disabilities.\n  ADA protects the civil rights of all people with disabilities by \nexpanding opportunities for Arkansans and all Americans with \ndisabilities and by reducing barriers, changing perceptions and \nallowing all Americans to go to the schools of their choice, gain \nmeaningful employment, and fully participate in community life.\n  This week, communities across Arkansas will commemorate the 20th \nanniversary of ADA with events and celebrations, including construction \nof wheelchair ramps by volunteers and a 5K Roll n' Walk Run event on \nthe Fayetteville trail system in northwest Arkansas.\n  I commend these volunteers and participants for their dedication to \nensuring that Arkansans with disabilities have full access to the \nresources they need, in addition to promoting ADA's anniversary.\n  On the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I \njoin my fellow Arkansans to celebrate this historic legislation that \nhas touched the lives of so many in our State and Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/26/senate-section/article/S6240-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6240-S6241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I join my colleagues in paying \ntribute to our colleague Robert Byrd of West Virginia. He served his \nbeautiful mountain State for a record-setting 57 years in Congress, \nincluding 51 years in this Chamber. He cast more rollcall votes and \nserved in more leadership positions than any other Senator in U.S. \nhistory, including 12 years as his party's leader. He revered this body \nso much that he wrote four volumes on Senate history from 1789 to 1989. \nOver nine terms, he mastered parliamentary procedure in an effort to \nprotect the Senate's rules and to defend the legislative branch's \nauthority. He carried a copy of the Constitution in his pocket, and he \npeppered his speeches with frequent references to the intent of our \nFramers. When asked how many Presidents he had served under, he \nreplied, ``None. I\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\nhave served with Presidents, not under them.''\n  Senator Byrd will enter the history books as one of the Senate's true \ngiants, but his beginnings were humble. His biography is a shining \ntestament to the American dream. He was adopted in infancy and raised \nin impoverished coal-mining towns. His first job was to collect garbage \nscraps for his family's hogs. Although he graduated valedictorian of \nhis 1934 high school class, at first he could not afford college. He \nmarried his high school sweetheart, Erma Ora James, with whom he \nenjoyed 68 happy years. The outstanding work ethic and solid values \nthat he learned while growing up in Raleigh County helped him later \ndevote 10 grueling years of his life to studying while simultaneously \nserving as a Member of Congress. When he finally earned his law degree \nin 1963, President John F. Kennedy awarded him his diploma.\n  Senator Byrd served his beloved home State with unprecedented \ndevotion. He wrote in his autobiography that ``it has been my constant \ndesire to improve the lives of the people who have sent me to \nWashington time and again.'' Virtually every county in West Virginia \nwill long remember his hard work, dedication, and legendary \ncontributions. Like many Americans today, I commend him for his \noutstanding service to his State, to our Nation, and to the institution \nof the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/26/senate-section/article/S6241-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n             Private First Class Michael Shane Pridham, Jr.\n\n  Mr. BAYH.

He was only 19 years old when he lost his life serving \nbravely in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Qalat, Afghanistan. \nHe was 6 weeks from completing his tour of duty.\n  Private Pridham--``Mikey'' as he was to known to his family and \nfriends--was from Louisville, KY. He attended Southern High School \nbefore later earning his GED diploma through the U.S. Army.\n  Today, I join Private Pridham's family and friends in mourning his \ndeath. He is survived by his wife Deidre, whom he married 2 days before \ndeploying overseas and who is expecting the couple's first child, \nAliyah, in October; his father and stepmother, Michael Shane and Andrea \nPridham Sr. of New Albany, IN; his mother, Keri Allen of Louisville, \nKY; and his brothers, Jeffrey Pridham, Joey Pridham, Kaleb Nix and \nKaden Eskridge.\n  We take pride in the example of this American hero, even as we \nstruggle to express our sorrow over this loss. We cherish the legacy of \nhis service and his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen soldier, I recall \nPresident Lincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: \n``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this \nground.

Madam President, I come to the floor of \nthe Senate to talk today about the recently passed Wall Street reform \nbill.\n  I believe elected officials should come to Washington to solve \nproblems not ignore them. The American people know that we need to \nenact major changes to our financial regulatory system. With the bill \nthat passed into law earlier this month, Congress has begun the process \nof repairing a regulatory system that did not work as it should have \nand contributed to the financial meltdown that shook our economy in \n2008. This action, long overdue, will help our regulatory structure \ncatch up with the realities of the market so as to provide a more \nsecure economy. Although no bill will ever be perfect, and I remain \nseriously concerned that we must take further actions if we are going \nto prevent another financial crisis, this bill takes important steps \ntowards greater market transparency and consumer protection. It will \nhelp make sure that taxpayers are never again put on the hook for \nbailing out the financial sector. It strengthens the regulatory safety \nnet in key respects. For these reasons, I supported cloture motions and \nfinal passage of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n  I did my utmost to work in a bipartisan manner on this bill, filing \nor cosponsoring 27 amendments, working across the aisle on almost all \nof them. For example, we amended the bill to remove unnecessary \nprovisions that would have severely constricted small startup \nbusinesses around the country as they worked to raise capital from \nangel investors. Massachusetts is one of America's hotbeds for \ninnovation and business startups, and I was proud to stand up for small \nstartup businesses and the investors who help give life to their ideas. \nAnother amendment I proposed with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, \nwhich was adopted 99-1, created a dedicated liaison office for military \nfamilies within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, so that \nmembers of our Armed Forces and their families can fight back when they \nare targeted by unscrupulous lenders or sold fraudulent life insurance \npolicies. As a 30-year member of the National Guard, I have seen the \npain caused when members of the Guard are hit by financial predators. I \nwas also proud to join my colleagues in supporting assessment and \nregulatory relief for small community banks and a safer role for the \ncredit rating agencies in our financial system.\n  Since the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs did \nnot hold a full markup of the bill before it came to the Senate floor, \nI spent a lot of time exploring how certain provisions were drafted and \nhow they might work if enacted into law. One of those areas was the so-\ncalled Volcker rule. I believe that the principles behind the Volcker \nrule, which was proposed in earnest only after the House had passed its \nown Wall Street Reform bill, are very well-intentioned and in many \nrespects will be quite effective. The Volcker rule was conceived as a \nway to limit certain risky proprietary trading activities so that Wall \nStreet firms start to look more like the safe banks, mutual funds, and \ninsurance companies we have in Massachusetts. After the collapse the \ncountry suffered, no one can argue with a straight face anymore that \nall banks should be able to take huge risks on anything they want, \nwhenever they want, without any regard to the consequences. This was an \nimportant issue for financial institutions and regulators across the \ncountry. Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina also worked hard to find \nthe right balance within the Volcker rule for bank asset management, \nand I would like to associate my views with her statements in the \nSenate Record on this topic.\n  Without changes, the original Senate bill would have unreasonably \nregulated limited purpose trusts--institutions throughout our Nation \nthat never should have been captured in the regulatory ``net'' of \nVolcker rule bank regulation. Since the drafting did not match the \nintent, this problem was addressed by clarifying that these companies \nshould not be subject to bank holding company oversight or the Volcker \nrule restrictions by virtue of operating a limited purpose trust \nregardless of charter. In other words, bank regulation should only \napply to the trust itself, not its parent and affiliates. Without this \nclarification, the Volcker rule restrictions, as well as the capital \nrequirements under the adopted Collins amendment, would have led to \nwidespread disruption in providing products and services to customers \nand investors, job losses, and uncertainty around the nation. The final \nversion of the legislation appropriately does not regulate institutions \nwith limited\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\ntrusts--including mutual funds and insurance companies--because these \ninstitutions do not take customer deposits, make loans, or access the \nFed discount window.\n  The original Volcker rule also would have gone too far in preventing \nbanks from offering appropriate investment services to their clients as \na limited and safe part of their business model. At a time of deep \neconomic uncertainty, when millions of Americans are looking for work, \nthis could have a devastating impact on jobs in Massachusetts and \nacross the country while unfairly targeting safe institutions and \ndriving their business to riskier ventures. Even the Glass-Steagall law \nclearly permitted banks to serve as investment advisers, and yet the \noriginal Volcker rule language threatened the ability of banks to offer \nthese services, including seeding new investment funds that they then \noffer to clients.\n  Bank-affiliated investment funds are sponsored for clients and \ncomprised almost entirely of client money. Most are not excessively \nspeculative or risky investment vehicles--they include simple cash \nfunds, stock index funds, and other nonleveraged strategies. Preventing \nbanks from offering such services, which provide banks with a steady \nsource of fee income, will make the banks more reliant on other more \nvolatile revenue streams--a danger the bill was supposed to head off. \nFurthermore, in order to remain in the asset management business, these \nbanks must be allowed to invest a very small amount alongside their \nclients in these funds so that all interests are aligned. Many large \nstate pension plans, as well as large endowments and foundations, value \nsuch ``skin in the game'' investments as a key factor in deciding with \nwhom they will place their money.\n  If banks can't offer these services or invest a small amount to seed \nfunds and keep skin in the game, institutional investors will be forced \nto take their money elsewhere, and in many cases, that will be to less \nregulated hedge and private equity funds. In negotiations during Senate \nconsideration of the legislation, I advocated for limiting the maximum \naggregate investment level in all bank affiliated funds to somewhere in \nthe vicinity of 5 percent of a bank's tier 1 capital. In the end, the \nfinal compromise landed on 3 percent. Although it could be higher, this \nis an appropriate role for alternative asset management within the \nbanking industry.\n  To put this number in perspective, even if all of these investments \ncollapsed, the bank losses would equal only half of the typical losses \ncharged off from bank retail lending operations last year. To address \nconcerns that fresh bank capital could be put at risk in the event of a \nfund failure, the final language makes it explicit that these \ninvestment funds are segregated and that it is against the law for the \nbanks to bail them out. It is also important to remember that new \nsystemic risk authorities have been created to identify and halt \nactivities at key firms that threaten financial stability.\n  One other area of remaining uncertainty that has been left to the \nregulators is the treatment of bank investments in venture capital \nfunds. Regulators should carefully consider whether banks that focus \noverwhelmingly on lending to and investing in start-up technology \ncompanies should be captured by one-size-fits-all restrictions under \nthe Volcker rule. I believe they should not be. Venture capital \ninvestments help entrepreneurs get the financing they need to create \nnew jobs. Unfairly restricting this type of capital formation is the \nlast thing we should be doing in this economy.\n  Another area of potential confusion is in the language governing \n``fund of funds.'' These are funds that invest in a wide range of other \ninvestment partnerships, hedge funds or private equity funds, so that \ninvestors can benefit from the good investment ideas of a variety of \nfunds. Banks' investments in the fund of funds that they sponsor for \nclients are to be limited under this bill to only 3 percent of the \nfund. But that fund, which will be comprised of, at a minimum, 97 \npercent client money, under Dodd-Frank, is not restricted as a \npercentage of any of those investment partnerships, hedge funds, or \nprivate equity funds that it might be invested in, because the bank's \nexposure is still limited to 3 percent in the original fund, mitigating \nany chance of a concentration risk or bailout incentive.\n  Finally--and this should go without saying--I want to make it clear \nthat throughout all the negotiations to write the legislative language \nof the conference report, it was always clear to me that the Volcker \nrule was never intended to prohibit banks from offering alternative \ninvestment options as a part of a company-wide retirement plan, or as \nan offering to ERISA customers. Any other regulatory treatment would be \narbitrarily punitive and would have no public policy impact. The \nlegislation is clear on this, but I would also like to point out that \nthe FDIC-sanctioned traditional bond and equity market investments made \nby small community banks for the purpose of diversification are not the \nintended target of Volcker rule restrictions.\n  I want to spend a moment or two discussing consumer protection--one \nof the most controversial elements of this bill. During the crisis, \nmore than half of the people who ended up in subprime mortgages with \nballooning rates would have qualified for more conventional fixed rate \nloans. Some of that was caused by consumer greed, but it was also \nbecause of bad incentives and deceptive practices where the true costs \nof loans were hidden in the fine print. The new CFPB has the power to \nuse its broad authority to simplify and dramatically improve the \nquality of information going to the consumer, and I expect that's how \nthey will use their authority. I also expect that unifying financial \nconsumer protection under one roof at the Federal Reserve will help to \nsimplify and consolidate some of the compliance burdens on our \nfinancial institutions. Talking to local bankers, it is clear that \nbanks are being forced to spend a lot more money and time on \ncompliance. I worry about community banks' ability to compete in this \narea with the bigger banks. I am hopeful that the CFPB will improve the \ncurrent state of affairs on both of these fronts.\n  There are a number of other provisions in the bill that bear review. \nSection 113 of the conference report details multiple criteria that \nmust be considered by the Financial Stability Oversight Council to \ndetermine that an institution is a ``nonbank financial company \nsupervised by the Board of Governors.'' These criteria should not be \ngiven equal weighting. In fact, the Council should place most of the \nweight on one important measure--the leverage of the financial \ninstitution. If the recent financial crisis has proven anything, it has \ndemonstrated the systemic de-stabilization that can be caused when too \nmany firms are overleveraged, with only a slim cushion available to \nabsorb losses. Excessive leverage is by far the most dangerous \ncharacteristic for any business. A poorly run company that faces \nnumerous problems can feel relatively safe if it has limited leverage; \nconversely, a thriving, profitable company that has excessive leverage \ncan be wiped out after a single stumble. As a result, leverage should \nbe the primary consideration when deciding whether to put a financial \ninstitution into the special category of ``nonbank financial company \nsupervised by the Board of Governors.''\n  I also believe that the size of an institution should be de-\nemphasized as a consideration for making determinations as to which \ncompanies are ``nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of \nGovernors.'' There is nothing inherently destabilizing or risky about \nthe size of a large company. If anything, size usually coincides with \nsignificant benefits, including economies of scale and a diverse \nportfolio of assets. The Council and regulators should be very careful \nnot to use size as a proxy for risk or it will capture some very \nhealthy companies in the Fed supervisory web while simultaneously \ndiscouraging the growth of up-and-coming firms. Size is not as \nimportant a factor when it comes to the safety and soundness of an \ninstitution and it should be given less weight as a consideration.\n  Furthermore, considering the burdens that come with being categorized \na ``nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors,'' \nit is critical that the Council make its determinations on a company-\nby-company basis and not attempt to make determinations by grouping \nmultiple\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\ninstitutions together based solely on a set of similar characteristics. \nFor instance, the Council should never make a determination that all \nfirms in a financial subsector that are above a predefined size should \nbe ``nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of \nGovernors.'' This would inevitably subject otherwise healthy firms to a \nlong list of unnecessary regulations and will distract regulators from \nfocusing on the most potentially problematic financial firms and \nactivities.\n  In title II of the bill, the orderly liquidation authority includes \nprovisions that allow the FDIC to unwind firms that threaten stability. \nWhile I repeatedly supported amendments that would have relied more \nheavily on the bankruptcy code rather than this approach, I also \nbelieve that if used appropriately, resolution authorities can be an \nimportant and useful tool in unwinding financial institutions that \nthreaten market stability. I will be watching closely as these \nprovisions are implemented by the FDIC. Under this section, the FDIC \nhas the power to ``take any action'' to provide disparate treatment to \nsimilarly situated creditors if the FDIC ``determines that such action \nis necessary to maximize the value of assets of the covered financial \ncompany; to initiate and continue operations essential to the \nreceivership of the financial company; to maximize the present value \nreturn from the sale or other disposition of the assets of the covered \nfinancial company; or to minimize the amount of any loss realized upon \nthe sale or other disposition of the assets of the covered financial \ncompany.''\n  Without clear rule writing, this language could be wrongly \ninterpreted to include a range of unnecessary, arbitrary actions to \nfavor certain creditors. Instead, the FDIC should only provide \ndisparate treatment to similarly situated creditors if the sole purpose \nof the action is to cover the cost of indispensable services required \nto keep the physical operations of the financial institution or bridge \nfinancial company functioning during the early stages of liquidation. \nExamples of such services include the delivery of electricity, computer \nmaintenance and janitorial services. The flexibility in these \nprovisions should not be used by the FDIC to provide disparate \ntreatment to holders of financial instruments, especially financial \ninstruments that are widely distributed and held by multiple parties. \nFor instance, issuances of loans, notes and bonds are normally held by \nvarious parties. The FDIC should not use its authority to discriminate \namong holders of the same instrument or holders that own different \ninstruments that hold the same unsecured priority. In other words, it \nwould be a clear abuse of these provisions if the FDIC makes a \ndetermination to provide disparate treatment to similarly situated \ncreditors based on ``who'' owns the claim. The FDIC should take all \nnecessary precautions to avoid even the impression of playing political \nfavorites.\n  The expectation of receiving a financial return consistent with \nsimilarly situated creditors is a bedrock principal of American \ncapitalism. It is my hope and expectation that the FDIC will fulfill \nits obligations and report to Congress any actions that involve any \ndifferent treatment of similarly situated creditors under resolution \nauthority. The FDIC should disclose the details of any parties given \ndisparate treatment and the categories and names of similarly situated \nparties that did not receive the benefits of this treatment; how much, \nin absolute dollars, and as a percentage of its claim, a favored \nrecipient of the disparate treatment received, and how that compares to \nthe returns realized--or may be realized--by similarly situated \ncreditors who did not receive the favorable treatment; and a thorough \nexplanation as to why the treatment was necessary to maintain the \nphysical operations of the financial institution or relevant entity, \nincluding an analysis of any conflicts of interest that the FDIC, or \nrelated government authorities, may have had when providing the \ndisparate treatment.\n  I also want to be clear about my views on derivatives regulation. The \nderivatives title of the law is extremely important, and if implemented \nappropriately, will bring much needed transparency and accountability \nto a market that played a central role in the near collapse of our \nfinancial services sector in the fall of 2008. This bill appropriately \nregulates large Wall Street swap dealers for the first time by \nsubjecting them to new clearing, capital and margin requirements. But \nthese provisions also could significantly impact thousands of end-user \nfirms that use derivatives to reduce their exposure to risk rather than \nmerely to speculate. It is very important that we manage how this bill \nimpacts these Main Street businesses. If the regulations imposed on \nswap dealers are inappropriately extended to Main Street businesses \nthat are only trying to hedge risks, we could unwittingly exacerbate \nthe economic challenges we still face. Many experts think that greater \ntransparency will drive risk-management costs down for businesses in \nthe long run, but the government clearly needs to go about the \nimplementation of these provisions very carefully.\n  While the conference report has many good features, it also suffers \nfrom a glaring omission: any attempt to regulate government-sponsored \nenterprises--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These institutions played a \nkey role in triggering the financial crisis we suffered. To date, over \n$140 billion of taxpayer funds have been spent bailing out Fannie and \nFreddie, and estimates of additional risk to taxpayers runs into the \nhundreds of billions of dollars. We clearly need to address these \ninstitutions, which risk burdening future generations of Americans with \nmountains of debt. I look forward to working on this issue as soon as \nCongress and the administration move forward on legislative proposals.\n  I believe we had a choice: do nothing or try to address a real \nproblem that shook the very financial foundation of our country. While \nthe bill was far from perfect, the final version was vastly improved \nfrom the version we started with at the beginning of the process. I \nbelieve it includes important measures that will help prevent another \nfinancial meltdown like the one in 2008 that left millions of Americans \nout of work and saw our economy take its worst dip since the Great \nDepression. Equally important, the bill is not funded through higher \ntaxes, which is something I could not support at a time when nearly one \nin ten Americans is unemployed and our economy is still struggling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/26/senate-section/article/S6243-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6243-S6244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE BOATING LAW ADMINISTRATION\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I would like to recognize the \n50th anniversary of the National Association of State Boating Law \nAdministrators, NASBLA, a Kentucky-based nonprofit organization.\n  Recreational boating is one of America's most popular pastimes with \nover 13,000,000 recreational vessels registered nationwide, of which \n200,000 are in my home State of Kentucky. In 1958, Congress recognized \nthe growing interest in recreational boating, and passed the Federal \nBoating Act, which led to the creation of the National Association of \nState Boating Law Administrators in 1960. NASBLA is a national, \nnonprofit association of State officials responsible for the \ndevelopment and implementation of State boating programs.\n  NASBLA's mission is to strengthen the ability of State and \nterritorial boating authorities to ensure a safe, secure, and enjoyable \nrecreational environment. NASBLA addresses its mission by fostering \npartnerships among States, the Coast Guard, and others to streamline \nboating laws, maintain national education standards, strengthen \nhomeland security on our waterways, and communicate to Federal agencies \non behalf of the States' boating programs. The tireless work of NASBLA \nhas helped to significantly reduce the number of recreational boating \nfatalities since 1970. However, even with such progress in safety, \nthere is still room for improvement. In 2008, recreational boating \naccidents still claimed the lives of 709 Americans, of which more than \nhalf may have been saved with the proper use of a personal flotation \ndevice.\n  Due to the efforts of the National Association of State Boating Law \nAdministrators and its members over the last\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\nfive decades, our Nation's waterways are safer and more enjoyable for \nthe boating public. I congratulate the NASBLA as it celebrates 50 years \nof service and wish it great success over the next 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/26/senate-section/article/S6244-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT DAVID COLLINS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation \nAct of 1977 to provide for use of excess funds available under that Act \nto provide for certain benefits, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCoalfield Accountability and Retired Employee Act of 2010, CARE Act. \nSenator Goodwin joins me in introducing this important legislation. It \nis the first bill we have worked together on, and I look forward to \nmany more as partners in the Senate fighting for West Virginians.\n  The CARE Act protects the pensions for over 100,000 mineworkers. It \ntakes excess funds from the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program and \ntransfers that money to the United Mine Workers of America, UMWA, \npension plan. These are AML funds that go unused and are not needed, \naccording to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement \nand the UMWA. So what our legislation does is put that money to good \nuse, and protects the pensions of our hardworking mineworkers.\n  Congress needs to act because the UMWA pension fund is on the road to \ninsolvency. It has been hit by the perfect storm--the recent financial \ncrisis, the small number of active mineworkers who provide the funding \nbase for the pension plan, and the large number of ``orphans'' who \nreceive their pensions under the plan. These ``orphans'' are retired \nmineworkers for whom a company no longer makes contributions to the \npension fund, typically because the company is out of business.\n  So Congress and the Federal Government have to act in order to make \nsure that the pensions of our mineworkers\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\nare protected. Dating back to President Harry Truman, the Federal \nGovernment has assumed a responsibility to our mineworkers. In 1992, I \nwas extremely proud to work on the passage of the COAL Act, where we \nrecommitted to our miners. That bill allowed the transfer of interest \naccruing to the unappropriated balance of the Abandoned Mine \nReclamation Fund to be used to provide health care for a large number \nof orphaned miners and their widows. This Federal commitment was once \nagain affirmed in the 2006 amendments to the Abandoned Mine Reclamation \nProgram which sought to again protect the health care plans of miners \nfrom insolvency.\n  Now, 18 years after passing the COAL Act, Senator Goodwin and I are \nagain renewing our commitment to the nation's miners with the CARE Act. \nThis bill will protect the solvency of our miners' pension plans.\n  In West Virginia, we revere our miners--the men and women who put \ntheir lives on the line every single day to provide for their families \nand bring light and heat to millions. Their tenacity, their courage and \ntheir determination is an inspiration to us all. The work they do \neveryday provides nearly half of our nation with power to light and \nheat our homes. We should all thank them for the service they provide \nthis country, and continue protecting our miners' retirement benefits \ngoing forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. Collins, \n        Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3650. A bill to amend chapter 21 of title 5, United States Code, \nto provide that fathers of certain permanently disabled or deceased \nveterans shall be included with mothers of such veterans as preference \neligibles for treatment in the civil service; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are taking \na huge toll on our servicemembers and their families. To date, 123 \nOregonians have died in those wars, leaving behind grieving friends and \nfamilies. I'll never forget the pain I've heard in the voices of the \nOregon parents I've spoken to after they've lost a son or daughter to \nwar.\n  These parents are often called ``Gold Star parents'' because, by \ntradition, they display a Gold Star flag to let the world know of their \nsacrifice.\n  Our nation can't lift the burden of their grief. No one can.\n  However, our nation does commit to recognize the immense sacrifice of \nGold Star parents by giving them certain benefits. One of those \nbenefits is a 10-point hiring preference for unmarried Gold Star \nmothers when they apply for jobs with the federal government.\n  But I was surprised to learn that this preference cannot be given to \nGold Star fathers. This inequity is a relic from the past; an example \nof the law has not kept up with the times. We can now see that all \nunmarried Gold Star mothers and fathers deserve to have the federal \ngovernment recognize their sacrifice equally. That is why I am \nintroducing a bill to update the law.\n  I learned of this disparity from my friend Steve Ellis of Baker City, \nOregon. Steve lost his beloved daughter, Army Corporal Jessica Ann \nEllis, when she was killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad in 2008. \nAlthough Steve is a Gold Star father, he would still not be eligible \nfor the benefit under my proposed change because he is married. But he \ndidn't point out this inequity in the law for his own benefit. He did \nit for future Gold Star fathers. He saw an inequity in the law, and \nfelt it was his duty to try and get it fixed for other Gold Star \nfathers.\n  So today I introduce the Jessica Ann Ellis Gold Star Fathers Act as a \nsmall legislative fix that will make a big change to federal veterans' \npreference laws through true equality.\n  This bill will give any unmarried Gold Star parent, regardless of \ngender, a 10-point hiring preference when they apply for federal jobs. \nIt will also give the benefit to any unmarried parent of a totally and \npermanently disabled servicemember.\n  Gold Star mothers and fathers deserve equal recognition for the loss \nof a child who bravely made the ultimate sacrifice for his or her \ncountry. The Jessica Ann Ellis Gold Star Fathers Act will give them \nthat.\n  This bill is supported by the American Gold Star Mothers \norganization, and is cosponsored by Senator Akaka, Senator Voinovich, \nSenator Collins, Senator Landrieu and Senator Lieberman. I hope it can \nbe passed quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3650\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
