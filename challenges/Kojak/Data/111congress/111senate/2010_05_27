Madam President, I am honored to welcome Captain William \nF. Cuddy, as the guest Chaplain for the U.S. Senate for today. Since \nJuly of 2006, Captain Cuddy has served as Chaplain of the U.S. Coast \nGuard.\n  Coast Guard Chaplains have a long history of assisting service men \nand their families in their spiritual journey. Since 1929, when \nChaplain Roy L. Lewis was ordered to the submarine base at Groton, CT, \nwith primary duties to the base and additional duties to the Coast \nGuard Academy, religious ministry has been a critical component of \nsupporting the men and women who shoulder the burdens of safeguarding \nour homeland.\n  Captain Cuddy proudly continues that tradition by providing religious \ncounsel to our young men and women who are often tested by military \nlife.\n  What's more, Captain Cuddy's ministerial outreach is an asset to the \nfamilies of our Coast Guard men and women during spouses' deployments \naway from home.\n  A native of Boston, MA, Captain Cuddy graduated from Cathedral High \nSchool in June 1967 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He served aboard the \nUSS Essex homeported in Newport, RI, until 1970, when he left active \nduty for the Navy Reserve and entered Fitchburg State College. He \ngraduated in 1974 with bachelor of science in education.\n  Captain Cuddy then entered St. John's Seminary in 1974. During his \nseminary studies, Captain Cuddy remained active as an aviation \nstructural support technician with a number of Reserve squadrons and \nwas commissioned an ensign in March 1977 in the Chaplain Corps' \nTheological Student Candidate Program.\n  After graduating from St. John's Seminary in 1979, he was ordained by \nCardinal Humberto Mederios for service in the Archdiocese of Boston and \nreceived an appointment in the Reserve Chaplain Corps in 1980 as a \nlieutenant junior grade.\n  Captain Cuddy once again reported for active duty in July 1990. While \nassigned to Mayport, FL, from 1998 to 2001, he provided chaplain \nsupport to the Coast Guard units in northern Florida. In this role, he \nprovided spiritual support to the men and women safeguarding our \ncountry.\n  On behalf of the State of Florida and my colleagues here in the \nSenate, I thank Captain Cuddy for his service to our country and for \nhis prayer today. We welcome him to the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4473-6", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4473-S4474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, a community in Kansas still shakes 1 year \nafter the brazen murder of one of its own. This weekend will mark the \nfirst anniversary of Dr. George Tiller's death. He was gunned down in \nfront of his Wichita church the day before the last Memorial Day.\n  Dr. Tiller was killed at point-blank range at his place of worship in \nthe middle of a Sunday morning, while his wife sang in the church choir \njust a few yards away.\n  He was murdered by an unrepentant assassin who took his life in the \nname of protecting life. It was an indefensible crime and an \nincomprehensible excuse.\n  Just as despicable as Dr. Tiller's death was the fact that his murder \nwasn't an isolated incident. It wasn't even the first time someone \ntried to kill him. His clinic was bombed in 1985. He was shot twice in \n1993. Over the next 16 years, 7 clinic workers would be killed before \nDr. Tiller would become the eighth murder victim. More than 6,000 other \nacts of violence have been launched at clinics and their workers--\nbombings, arsons, assaults, and other attacks. One of the things they \ndo is go into one of these clinics and throw acid all over and make the \nbuilding not habitable.\n  The last doctor killed before Dr. Tiller was a husband and father \nfrom Buffalo named Barnett Slepian. He was an OB/GYN, who also helped \npoor women access safe, legal abortions. Because of that, he was \nmurdered in his home, in his kitchen--standing in his kitchen, he was \nshot through the window with a high-powered rifle and murdered. I \ndidn't personally know Dr. Slepian, but I knew his niece. She came from \nReno, NV, and she once worked in my office. She worked as a legislative \nassistant and a speechwriter. Her name is Amanda Robb. She is now an \naccomplished writer living in the Presiding Officer's State of New \nYork. As life is so unpredictable and so unusual, I worked on the \nspeech last night, and to the person helping me, Stephen Krupin, I \nsaid, ``We are going to talk about Dr. Slepian, whose niece worked for \nme. And she is here in Washington today--just out of nowhere. I have a \ngathering every Thursday morning, and I will be darned, Amanda Robb \nshowed up, which is so unusual. I was so glad to see her. She was a \ngreat personality and someone I will always remember having worked for \nme.\n  The tragedy of Dr. Tiller's death and of Dr. Slepian's death--and of \nevery atrocity like it--is independent of the issue of abortion. It is \nnot about the legality of abortion or the funding of it. These are \nemotional debates, and ones on which people of good faith can disagree.\n  What so shook that Kansas town was rather an act of terrorism. What \nreverberated out to our borders and coasts from the center of our \ncountry was the violation of our founding principle--that we are a \nnation of laws, not of men.\n  Everyone in America has the right to disagree with its laws. Everyone \nhas the right to dispute and protest its laws. But no American has a \nright to disobey the laws.\n  Not all of us would choose Dr. Tiller's profession or seek his \nservices or agree with his philosophy or that of Dr. Slepian, but it is \nthe responsibility of every American to respect another's right to \npractice his profession legally.\n  Those who believe in the sanctity of life cannot be selective. We \nmust value every life--not just those with which we agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4474-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, later this morning, we will have some \nimportant votes related to national security. Passage of the defense \nportion of the supplemental will fund the surge forces in Afghanistan \nand our ongoing military efforts in Iraq.\n  Thanks to the McChrystal strategy, American forces have already \nbrought a lot of pressure on the Taliban in Afghanistan. We need to \nkeep that pressure up if this counterinsurgency strategy is to succeed, \nand it must.\n  This is why I encourage all Members to vote against the Feingold \namendment, which calls for a plan of withdrawal of the forces from \nAfghanistan. When it comes to funding our operations in Iraq, we must \nbe committed to providing the assistance and forces necessary to \nprovide security as the Iraqis work to form a new government.\n  We will also have votes related to the security of our borders. This \nis clearly a very pressing issue. We should respond with the urgency \nthat the situation demands and the unity that Americans expect on \nmatters of national security.\n  In these days of economic uncertainty, Americans are watching the \nSenate very closely. The $13 trillion national debt has concentrated a \nlot of minds on what we are doing here. Some have tried to defend the \nextenders bill and the nearly $100 billion it would add to the debt. I \nthink most Americans would say the real emergency here is the $13 \ntrillion debt. Even some Democrats seem to agree with me. That is why \nwe are seeing a quiet revolt over in the House on this bill. We must do \nsomething about our debt.\n  On the oilspill, there appears to be some good news this morning. We \nhope what we are hearing proves to be true. Americans are eager to hear \nwhat the President has to say this afternoon. More important, they are \neager to see what the administration plans to do. But for now, we are \nall hoping that the efforts to stop this leak are sustained.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4474-5", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 20 minutes of debate relating to the border security amendment.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am going to take a couple minutes to \ndescribe the second-degree amendment I have. I appreciate the fact that \nthere was an offer on the other side to simply accept my amendment. I \nappreciate that, but because it is attached to a first-degree \namendment, I am not sure about the prospects for that. I thought it \nimportant that all of us have an opportunity to be recorded.\n  This amendment is simple. It provides $200 million for extending the \nOperation Streamline Program to another border sector, in addition to \nthe Yuma sector and the Del Rio, TX, sector, where it is already in \noperation--extend it to the Tucson sector. This could substantially \nreduce illegal immigration, because about half of all of illegal \nimmigration goes through the Tucson sector.\n  Operation Streamline is simple. It involves the Department of Justice \naccepting those who cross the border illegally into the court system \nand putting them in jail for about 2 weeks, and sometimes 30 days if \nthere is an incident of repeated crossing or attempted crossing. What \nwe have found is that there is a great deterrent effect. If people who \nare apprehended know they are going to jail for a couple weeks, they \ntend not to cross in that area anymore.\n  In fact, in the Yuma sector where this has been in effect now for \nseveral years, illegal immigration has been cut by 94 percent, from \n118,500 apprehensions 5 years ago to about 5,000 this year. It is \nsimply a fact that when people know they are going to go to jail or the \nprospects are very high they are going to go to jail, whether they are \ncriminals crossing the border--that is about 17 percent of the people--\nor the remainder who simply want to come here to work, they realize \ngoing to jail is going to obstruct their plans. They cannot make money \nand send it back to Mexico, El Salvador, or wherever their family might \nbe if they are trying to cross for work purposes. What we found in the \nYuma sector is they simply do not cross it anymore. They have now moved \nfarther to the east in the Tucson sector.\n  This amendment of mine simply provides $200 million, fully offset, of \nemergency funding to implement Operation Streamline--a combination \nDepartment of Justice and Department of Homeland Security program--to \nensure this deterrent can be in place in the Tucson sector just as it \nis in Del Rio, TX, and Yuma, AZ.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. As I said, the money \nis offset. This is definitely an emergency. It will substantially help \nus to secure the border without the necessity of building permanent \nstructures such as fencing or anything of that sort. It is a good \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I also wish to speak to the amendments \nthat have been offered by Senator McCain, Senator Kyl, myself, and \nSenator Hutchison with regard to border security.\n  One thing we cannot lose sight of is that the failure of the Federal \nGovernment to deal seriously with border security leaves all of the \nborder States basically on their own. We have heard a number of people \nwho criticized the State of Arizona for dealing with this issue the \nbest they can. But what are they supposed to do if the Federal \nGovernment does not step up and deal with its responsibility, which is \na Federal responsibility?\n  We talked about the violence, particularly relating to the cartels, \nwith 23,000 Mexicans killed since 2006 in these drug wars. Right across \nfrom El Paso, 1,000 people have been killed in Ciudad Juarez, which is \nliterally across the river, like Virginia is from Washington, DC. We \nhave seen the spillover effect in American citizens being killed and \nliving in fear on this side of the border.\n  We cannot forget there is also an important war on terror issue here \nas well, something we have not talked about very much but something I \nwas reminded of yesterday when the Department of Homeland Security \nissued an alert to police and sheriff's deputies in Houston asking them \nto keep their eyes open for a Somali man believed to be in Mexico \npreparing to make a crossing into Texas. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity in this announcement believes this man has a tie to an \norganization affiliated with al-Qaida. I say to my colleagues, maybe \nthis individual is not coming to Houston to stay in Houston. Maybe he \nis coming to the State of one of my colleagues or their town where they \nlive. It demonstrates again why this porous border represents a \nnational security problem for the entire country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks a list of other-than-Mexican illegal \nimmigrants.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I have in my hand a list of the \ncountries from which individuals who have been detained at the border \nhave originated. In 2009, 2 people from Afghanistan were apprehended on \nthe southern border; 10 from Iran, a state sponsor of international \nterrorism, as we know; 10 have come from Iraq; 19 from Pakistan; 12 \nfrom Somalia; and 3 from Yemen. Out of a total of 45,000 other-than-\nMexican citizen immigrants apprehended at the border, these are just \nsome examples of why our porous border represents a national security \nthreat in the global war on terror.\n  There is also another reminder in the news recently where two F-16s \nhad been dispatched to intercept an ultralight aircraft flying across \nthe border into Arizona. Some 200 ultralight aircraft have been \ndetected in 2009 alone. These ultralight aircraft do not require\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\na license to fly. They typically fly so low to avoid any radar \ndetection. It is estimated by the Department of Homeland Security that \nsome 600 of them have flown into the United States, primarily \ntransporting huge loads of illegal drugs, of course, being sold on \nAmerica's streets to our children, among others.\n  From these two facts--the fact that we have other than Mexican \ncitizens who simply want to come to work using the porous border, both \nMexico's porous southern border and our southern porous border, and to \ncome into the United States for unknown purposes, perhaps to do us \nharm--it is obvious our current border security measures are inadequate \nto deal with this new phenomenon of ultralight aircraft transporting \ndrugs into the United States and perhaps transporting back to Mexico \nthe bulk cash that is generated from these drug sales, further funding \nillegal drug activity and the cartels that are causing so much mayhem \non our southern border.\n  The problem we have with our broken immigration system is that it is \nsimply not perceived as credible by the American people. Until we deal \nwith this broken border, we are not going to be able to deal with other \naspects of our broken immigration system, and I would support an effort \nto do that. But it seems to be that our colleagues on the other side \ntoo often seem to view border security as leverage or a bargaining chip \nthey are not willing to give up unless they get something else for it. \nBut it is, in fact, the Federal Government's responsibility to deal \nwith this situation, as the President himself has acknowledged in his \nrecent announcement to send 1,200 additional National Guard to the \nborder. I will tell you that it is a welcome gesture, but it is no more \nthan that--a gesture. These 1,200 National Guard on a 2,000-mile \nborder--you can imagine how many gaps in the effort of border security \nwill still be left. That is why I support the McCain amendment and the \nKyl amendment to provide additional National Guard on a temporary \nbasis.\n  Our National Guard is already severely stressed because of the \nconflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, our all-volunteer military forces. \nWhat we need to do is provide a permanent solution, not a temporary \nsolution, and that means more Border Patrol, more ATF, DEA----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. All the boots on the ground that we need to make our \nborder security efforts credible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n SOUTHWEST BORDER OTM APPREHENSIONS BY

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how much time do I have to discuss my \namendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Texas and other Senators from \nborder States who are deeply concerned about the issue of broken \nborders and the drug cartels and human smuggling that has put the lives \nand security of our American citizens in some danger.\n  A fact: The kidnapping capital of the world is Mexico City. The city \nthat ranks second in kidnapping to Mexico City is Phoenix, AZ, which is \na long way from the border. It happens to be a place where drop houses \nexist where people are held for ransom, where unspeakable cruelties are \ninflicted upon those who are being smuggled, where they have become a \ndistribution center for drugs coming up through the so-called central \ncorridor. We are badly in need of assistance.\n  Yesterday, May 26, 2010, 12:20 p.m.:\n\n       Sierra Vista, Ariz.--Acting on a tip, Sierra Vista police \n     went to a drop house and recovered close to 2,000 pounds of \n     marijuana Tuesday.\n       Police spokesman Sgt. Lawrence Boutte said officers found a \n     total of 83 bails weighing 2,054 pounds.\n       The marijuana has an estimated street value of $821,000.\n       Police arrested a 21-year-old Mexican citizen. Officers \n     said the man was expected to be charged with possession of \n     marijuana for sale. It's not known if the man was in the U.S. \n     illegally.\n       Boutte said drug smugglers use stash houses to store drugs \n     coming from Mexico before transporting them elsewhere.\n\n  ``Elsewhere'' means different parts of the country.\n  By the way, there is an argument that this amendment may be \nunconstitutional. I remind my colleagues, the\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\nConstitution--article I, section 8, clause 15--preserves to the \nCongress the power to call ``forth the Militia to execute the Laws of \nthe Union,'' including the immigration laws. This is an independent \nconstitutional power that does not rest on any power exercised by the \nPresident as the Chief Executive in article II.\n  A recent example of Congress's power to task the executive branch in \nthis area, even outside calling forth the militia, is the Secure Fence \nAct of 2006 in which the Congress tasked the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to secure the border. Even though Congress was not relying on \nits article I, section 8, clause 15 power, the Secure Fence Act of 2006 \nwas and is constitutional.\n  The President announced he was sending 1,200 National Guard to the \nsouthwest border. This is one-fifth of what is needed. If the Congress \nwill not heed the call of the Governors of Arizona and Texas, who have \nasked the President to send troops to the border, the Congress should \ndo so now.\n  During Operation Jump Start, the National Guard was deployed to the \nsouthwest border and provided logistical support, conducted \nsurveillance, and built and repaired critical infrastructure. Until DHS \nhas the technology and infrastructure in place to fully secure the \nborder, at least 6,000 National Guard must be deployed to assist the \nBorder Patrol in stopping the illegal immigration, drug smugglers, and \nhuman traffickers flowing across the border.\n  The borders are broken. There has been improvement. We have shown in \nSan Diego, in Texas, even in the Yuma sector of Arizona that we can \nsecure our border, but we need manpower, surveillance, and fences. We \ncan do it. We have an obligation to our citizens to secure our border \nand allow them to lead lives where they do not live in fear of home \ninvasions, of property being destroyed, where well-armed, well-equipped \ndrug smugglers, as well as human smugglers, operate with--if not with \nimpunity, certainly with great latitude.\n  There will be the statement made that the border is more secure. I am \nsure the Senator from New York will say that. The fact is the border is \nnot secure. It is more secure; it is not secure. The citizens in the \nsouthern part of my State do not have a secure environment in which to \nlive and raise their children.\n  Every enforcement agent on the border with whom I have talked says we \nneed additional National Guard and we need it now. I am sure that in \nNew York City and other major cities in America there is a secure \nenvironment, frankly, thanks to Mayor Giuliani. This is not the case in \nparts of my State, including Phoenix, AZ, having the dubious \ndistinction of being No. 2 as far as the kidnapping capital of the \nworld is concerned.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the involvement of Senators from other parts \nof the United States of America. I invite them to come to the border \nand talk with my citizens. I invite them to talk with the Border Patrol \nagents who are overwhelmed in their task in trying to stop the flow of \ngoods and human beings across our border. I hope they will weigh in on \nbehalf of the human rights of the people who are being terribly abused, \nkept in drop houses, held for ransom, and subjected to unspeakable \natrocities. It is another human rights argument for getting our border \nsecure. We can get it more secure by sending these National Guard \ntroops to the border, as former Governor and now Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity called for in 2006.\n  I urge a ``yea'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BYRD. Madam President, there are those in the Congress who \nlike to just talk about the need to secure our borders. I have actually \ndone something about securing the borders. In 2005, I authored an \namendment with broad, bipartisan support, which initiated a \ncomprehensive effort to secure our borders. Since I became chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee in 2007, I \nhave continued that effort. As a result, there are more Border Patrol \nagents, more technology, more border infrastructure, more detention \ncapacity, and more investigative capacity dedicated to securing our \nborders than ever before.\n  This investment has produced results. The numbers of aliens being \ndeported, especially aliens convicted of crimes, has grown \nsignificantly. The era of catch and release has ended. The recession \nand increased enforcement has resulted in a significant reduction in \nthe number of illegal aliens coming into this country. Violence on the \nUnited States side of the border is down.\n  There is more to be accomplished, particularly as drug violence in \nMexico grows, but as a result of investments made over the last 5 \nyears, the Department of Homeland Security has received significant \nassets to address this problem.\n  Deportations have greatly increased from 211,098 in 2003 to between \n230,000 and 390,000 annually for the past 3 years. Homeland Security is \non track to remove 400,000 aliens this year, including 150,000 \nconvicted criminal aliens.\n  The Department of Homeland Security, DHS, has more ``boots on the \nground'' at the border than ever before. Today, the Border Patrol is \nbetter staffed than at any time in its 85-year history, having nearly \ndoubled the number of agents from approximately 10,000 in 2004 to more \nthan 20,000 today.\n  In 2006, DHS opened the first Border Enforcement Security Task Force, \nBEST, in Laredo, TX. BESTs are law enforcement task forces that combine \nFederal, State, local, and international personnel to tackle border \ncrime. The BEST model has proven extremely effective not only at \ninterdicting illegal activity but also at building criminal cases that \nlead to high-value prosecutions. There currently are 17 BESTs, \nincluding 3 in Arizona, 1 in Mexico City, and the President's fiscal \nyear 2011 budget requests funds to open 3 more. Over the past year, DHS \ndoubled the number of agents working on the BESTs in the southwest \nborder region.\n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, Office of Investigations \ncriminal arrests have increased from 14,077 in fiscal year 2002 to \n32,512 in fiscal year 2009. Customs and Border Protection Office of \nField Operations criminal arrests--those apprehended at the ports of \nentry--have increased from 15,820 in fiscal year 2002 to 38,964 in \nfiscal year 2009.\n  This year, DHS will finish constructing nearly all of the 652 miles \nof border fencing along the southwest border the Border Patrol has \ndetermined is required. As of March 2010, all 298.5 miles of vehicle \nfencing have been completed, and only 5.7 miles of pedestrian fencing \nremain to be constructed. This comes on top of $260 million the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided for border security \ntechnology and improved tactical communications equipment.\n  According to the Border Patrol, the number of miles of the southwest \nborder under effective control by the Border Patrol has increased from \n241 miles in October 2005 to 742 in October 2009.\n  DHS Secretary Napolitano announced last month that DHS is redeploying \n$50 million of Recovery Act funding originally allocated for SBInet to \nother tested, commercially available security technology along the \nsouthwest Border, including mobile surveillance, thermal imaging \ndevices, ultralight detection, backscatter units, mobile radios, \ncameras and laptops for pursuit vehicles, and remote video surveillance \nsystem enhancements.\n  The level of detention beds for illegal aliens funded by Congress has \nsteadily increased over the past 5 years from only 18,500 beds in \nfiscal year 2005 to 33,400 beds today. Since fiscal year 2009, Congress \nhas mandated that ICE maintain 33,400 detention beds. And the average \nlength of stay has dropped from 40.4 days in fiscal year 2004 to 31.2 \ndays in fiscal year 2009.\n  The number of illegal aliens detained has increased from 256,842 in \nfiscal year 2006 to 383,524 in fiscal year 2009. The total number of \nillegal aliens removed has nearly doubled since fiscal year 2003 from \n211,098 to 405,662 in fiscal year 2009.\n  The number of fugitive operations teams has been increased to 104 \nthis fiscal year from 51 in fiscal year 2007. On April 30, 2010, ICE \nannounced it had apprehended 596 criminal aliens in a targeted \noperation in the southeastern\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\nUnited States. On April 15, 2010, ICE arrested 47 individuals charged \nwith operating shuttle bus services in southern Arizona which brought \naliens who had recently entered the country illegally from border towns \nto Phoenix for further transport to the interior of the United States.\n  Since March 2009, Customs and Border Protection--CBP--and ICE have \nseized $85.7 million in illicit cash along the southwest border, an \nincrease of 14 percent over the same period during the previous year. \nThis includes more than $29.7 million in illicit cash seized heading \nsouthbound into Mexico--a 39-percent increase over the same period \nduring the previous year.\n  During the same period, CPB and ICE together seized 1,425 illegal \nfirearms, which represents a 29 percent rise over the same period in \nthe previous year. At the same time, CBP and ICE seized 1.65 million \nkilograms of drugs along the southwest border, an overall increase of \n15 percent.\n  The Department of Homeland Security estimates that in Arizona, the \nnumber of illegal immigrants in that State declined to 460,000 last \nyear from a high of 550,000 and continues to drop.\n  Contrary to popular perception, suggestions of spillover violence \nfrom Mexico have been exaggerated. While violence and drug trafficking \norganization-related murders are up in Juarez, Mexico, El Paso, TX--\ndirectly across the border--was ranked the second safest major city in \nthe United States by CQ Press in November 2009. The assistant police \nchief of Nogales, AZ, recently stated, ``We have not, thank God, \nwitnessed any spillover violence from Mexico. You can look at the crime \nstats. I think Nogales, Arizona, is one of the safest places to live in \nall of America.'' FBI Uniform Crime Reports and statistics provided by \npolice agencies show that the crime rates in Nogales, Douglas, Yuma, \nand other Arizona border towns have remained essentially flat for the \npast decade. A May 2, 2010, article from www.azcentral.com actually was \nheadlined ``Violence is not up on Arizona border despite Mexican drug \nwar.'' The Border Patrol has reported that the March 2010 murder of \nArizona rancher Robert Krentz is the only American murdered by a \nsuspected illegal immigrant in at least a decade within the agency's \nTucson sector, the busiest smuggling route among the Border Patrol's \nnine coverage regions along the U.S.-Mexican border.\n  There is still more to be accomplished. I am pleased that this week \nthe President announced his intention to deploy up to 1,200 National \nGuardsmen on the southwest border. However, I oppose the amendments to \nadd over $2 billion for border security, given that the amendments are \noffset with significant cuts in stimulus funding that will continue to \ncreate jobs in America. I will continue my efforts to further secure \nour borders.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, we need to improve our border \nsecurity, and I have worked to do just that by supporting efforts to \ncrack down on Mexican drug cartels and to increase the number of \nFederal agents and Homeland Security personnel on the ground in the \nSouthwest border region. Unfortunately, the three amendments the Senate \nconsidered today that were intended to enhance border security would \nhave redirected funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. \nIt doesn't make sense to cut funding from a program CBO says boosted \nemployment by as many as 2.8 million jobs in the first quarter of 2010, \nwhile raising GDP somewhere between 1.7 and 4.2 percent. We face \nserious fiscal challenges, and we need to cut wasteful spending, but \nthe American people should not have to choose between saving jobs and \nprotecting our border.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the three \namendments that have been spoken about--the McCain amendment, the \nCornyn amendment, and the McCain-Kyl amendment. I will get into some \ndetail in a few minutes about the opposition, but it relates to three \npoints.\n  First, President Obama has a tough, smart, targeted $500 million \npackage that will greatly increase resources at the border, and we need \nit. Crime has increased, as my friend from Arizona has said. We need \nit. So, No. 1, there is a very good plan in place.\n  No. 2, this is a huge amount of money--$2.5 billion--that my \ncolleagues, who talk about fiscal moderation, are requesting, and much \nof it will not go to securing the border. It is sort of throwing an \nenormous amount of money at the problem that is not as carefully \nthought out, not as targeted, and not as effective, quite frankly, as \nPresident Obama's program.\n  No. 3, it takes the money out of the stimulus bill. Well, there is a \nborder problem in Texas and Arizona that affects all of us, and we want \nto solve it. The President and we are working to do that. But we have a \njobs problem in this country, too, and this is the worst kind of \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul. The stimulus money will go to creating jobs. \nIf we ask the people in, say, Michigan or Ohio or Rhode Island or New \nYork what is the No. 1 issue? Jobs. This money is being taken away from \njob creation and used, as I say, in a not effective, overmagnified way. \nIt is too much money to stop what is going on at the border.\n  So let me elaborate. First, as I mentioned, President Obama is \nsending a package to the Congress next week. It includes 1,200 National \nGuard, funding programs for DEA, ATF, FBI, and ICE that are proven to \nwork. The three amendments offered by the Senators from Texas and \nArizona are a grab bag of enormous spending. If all of the $2.5 billion \nthey are proposing just to go to the border would double the amount, it \nwouldn't be well spent. The President's money is thoughtful and \ntargeted and has been in the works for a while. Let me give some \nexamples.\n  The amendment calls for $300 million for funding for any State or \nlocal enforcement agency so long as it is within 100 miles of the U.S.-\nMexican border. Almost none of this money will be used for border \nenforcement. Border enforcement is needed at the actual border.\n  Second, the Cornyn amendment also calls for $100 million for \nconstruction of new land ports of entry. But the problem at our ports \nof entry is not lack of funding from the taxpayers, it is that we need \nan adequate fee system to make sure the users of those ports of entry \npay for things rather than taking the money away from job creation in \nour States.\n  Third, the amendment Senator Kyl has offered as a second-degree \namendment would spend about $200 million on a program known as \nOperation Streamline. In reality, this program requires taxpayers to \nfoot the bill at the cost of more than $120 per day, per inmate, to \nhouse border crossers and give them three free meals a day, free health \ncare, medicines, and surgeries for all manner of illnesses, et cetera.\n  Couldn't we better spend this $200 million and pass a comprehensive \nimmigration reform program which is so much needed? By the way, it is \nmy view that while we have to tighten up the border, people are coming \nfor jobs. The only way we will stop the flow of illegal immigration \ninto this country is to tell those who hire them they no longer can. \nThe only way to do that is our Secure Social Security Card that Senator \nGraham and I have put forward so that papers can't be forged and \nillegal immigrants can't be hired. Comprehensive reform does that; \nthese measures don't.\n  We have heard talk about needing to bolster the border for years. It \nclearly hasn't stopped the problem, as the Senator from Arizona admits. \nWe need a comprehensive approach that will include border security but \nis not only border security. If my colleagues would join us in that \napproach, we could have a tough, fair-minded proposal that would do the \njob.\n  Let me make some other points against the amendments while I have \nmore time. The McCain amendment seeks $250 million for 6,000 National \nGuard to be sent to the border. They can't use that number of National \nGuard so quickly. The 1,200 that President Obama has requested is \nright.\n  When President Bush sent 6,000 National Guard to the border in 2006, \nthere were 10,000 Border Patrol agents in the entire force. That means \na total of 16,000 after the Guard was deployed. Now, we already have \nmore than 20,000 Border Patrol agents--double the number of Border \nPatrol agents. Those and the 1,200 National Guard will do the job. We \ncannot just throw money at this problem and take it away from job \ncreation. We have to be focused and smart. The President does that.\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and join us in \nsupporting a smart program that will do the job and, furthermore, join \nus in supporting comprehensive immigration reform, which is the only \nreal way to stop the flow of illegal immigration across the border.\n  Madam President, I make a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. A motion to waive the applicable \nprovisions of the Budget Act and budget resolutions is considered made.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Pursuant to the previous \norder, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4228\n\n  There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote \nin relation to amendment No. 4228 offered by the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. Kyl. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, this amendment is fully offset. It is $200 \nmillion. It simply provides the funding for the Department of Justice \nand the Department of Homeland Security to extend a program that has \nworked very well in two sections of the border to a third section.\n  It is called Operation Streamline. It permits the Department of \nJustice to try cases, put people in jail, rather than catch and release \nwhere they are simply put on a bus and returned to the border.\n  Everybody wants to secure the border. This is a program that has had \na 94-percent success rate, a 94-percent reduction in apprehensions in \nthe Yuma border sector and almost that much in the Del Rio sector.\n  So if we can extend that to the sector where half of the illegal \nimmigration in the country comes across, I think we can substantially \nreduce illegal immigration. Then, for everyone who wants to pursue \nother legislation, I think there will be a better state of mind in \nwhich to do that.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this $200 million fully offset \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise against the second-degree \namendment by Senator Kyl. It would actually take $200 million that is \nnot going to secure the border any. It will incarcerate illegal \nimmigrants. It will pay for their food, their health care, their \nrecreation time, their reading material, for long periods of time.\n  If we want to secure the border, which we do, we have to be smart \nabout this. We cannot just keep doing the same thing again and again. \nFurthermore, it takes the money out of the stimulus, which is jobs. So \nwe are doing something that is ineffective, we are doing something that \nhas not worked in the past, and now we are taking away jobs from the \nother 48 States.\n  That does not make any sense. So I would urge that this amendment be \ndefeated. I would urge we start doing what is needed and what is smart \nto stop the flow of illegal immigration. We all know what we have to \ndo, and that is a comprehensive proposal. This will not work and takes \nmoney way from jobs in the other 48 States. I urge its defeat.\n  I raise a point of order on the pending amendment pursuant to section \n403 of S. Con. Res. 13, the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year 2010.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion to waive the applicable \nprovisions of the Budget Act and the budget resolution is considered \nmade.\n  Mr. KYL.

The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, yesterday the Department of Homeland \nSecurity told local law enforcement to keep their eyes peeled for a \nSomali man believed to be in Mexico for a period in order to make an \nillegal crossing into Texas. DHS believes this man has ties to an \norganization affiliated with al-Qaida. Maybe he will not come to \nHouston. Maybe he will go to some other city in this great country of \nours. We simply don't know whether this individual or the 45,000 other-\nthan-Mexican citizens who have immigrated illegally across our border \nrepresent a national security threat.\n  If we look at the countries they come from--Pakistan, Iran, a state \nsponsor of terrorism, Somalia, Yemen--it could mean something very bad \nwill happen as a result of our dereliction of duty to secure the \nborder. It is unfair to criticize States for trying to protect \nthemselves when the Federal Government will not do the job instead as \nit should.\n  I urge colleagues to support this fully paid-for amendment to help \nbeef up border security. The point of order that will be raised is \nsimply an effort to deny the fact that we are in a state of emergency \nand we need to act now to secure the border.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to oppose this $2.2 billion \nspending amendment. It puts money in just about every program, needed \nor not. Then it takes that money out of the stimulus, the Recovery Act, \ntaking it away from jobs. We must secure the border, absolutely. The \nPresident's plan is smart and focused. But for all of the voices on \nboth sides of the aisle who have talked about jobs and all of the \nvoices who have talked about fiscal moderation, to throw caution to the \nwind, to put $2.2 billion into programs whether they are needed or not \nmakes no sense at all.\n  We must stop illegal immigration as it comes across the border. This \nwill not do it. My colleagues know it, and I know it. This is what is \ncalled a symbolic amendment to show where one stands in many ways. It \nis $2.2 billion. We can find amendments that will do the job, that cost \na lot less, and that will not take away the jobs we want to create and \npreserve.\n  This amendment, in my judgment, is the least responsible of the three \nto, again, take every program and say: More money, more money, more \nmoney, without a plan on how to spend it. It makes no sense. I urge its \ndefeat.\n  Madam President, I raise a point of order against this amendment \npursuant to section 403 of S. Con. Res. 13, the concurrent resolution \non the budget for fiscal year 2010.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion to waive the applicable \nprovisions of the Budget Act and the budget resolution is considered \nmade.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Pursuant to the previous order, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4204\n\n  There will now be 15 minutes of debate equally divided among the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nCoburn, and the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, my amendment is cosponsored by \nSenators Boxer, Durbin, Merkley, Sherrod Brown, Sanders, Udall of New \nMexico, and Harkin, and would require the President to provide a \nflexible, nonbinding timetable for the responsible drawdown of U.S. \ntroops from Afghanistan. It does not set a specific date for the \nwithdrawal of such troops. It does not require the President to \nactually redeploy troops. It does not place any restrictions on \nfunding.\n  The President has already indicated his surge strategy in Afghanistan \nis time limited and that he will begin redeploying troops in July 2011. \nAll we are asking in this amendment is that the President provide \nfurther details on how long this redeployment is expected to take.\n  Our brave servicemembers and the American taxpayers deserve to know \nwhat is being asked of them as they risk their lives and spend their \nmoney to continue this war.\n  My amendment is not about whether we support the President or the \ntroops. All of us support the troops, and I hope we all wish the \nPresident success in Afghanistan. Nor is it about whether we agree with \nthe President's strategy. I, for one, happen to have serious doubts \nabout the administration's approach. But in light of our deficit and \ndomestic needs and in light of rising casualty rates in Afghanistan and \nin light of the growing al-Qaida threat around the world, an expensive, \ntroop-intensive, nation-building campaign doesn't add up for me. We \nshould be focusing on Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other terrorist \nsafe havens.\n\n  Frankly, I am disappointed we are about to pass a bill providing tens \nof billions of dollars to keep this war going with so little public \ndebate about whether this approach even makes any sense. But no matter \nhow we feel about the President or his approach in Afghanistan, I hope \nwe can agree on the need for an exit strategy as we approach the 9-year \nanniversary of a war that is showing no signs of winding down. That is \nall my amendment would require--a nonbinding plan to bring this war \neventually to a close.\n  We have lost 1,000 servicemembers in this war. We have spent $300 \nbillion. I hope my colleagues will agree that the American people \ndeserve an answer to the question: How much longer?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be yielded 3 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I oppose the Feingold amendment. Section \n1019 of the Feingold amendment specifically requires the President, by \nDecember 31, 2010, to submit a timetable for the completion of \nredeployment of our troops out of Afghanistan.\n  The message our military presence in Afghanistan is not open-ended \nwas delivered by President Obama at West Point last December when he \nset the date of July 2011 to begin a reduction of U.S. forces in \nAfghanistan. It was an important message of reassurance to the American \npeople, and it was an important message for the Afghan leaders to hear: \nthat while we intend to help Afghanistan succeed in its battle with the \nTaliban, our troop presence is not open-ended, and they must build up \ntheir own army and their police force to take responsibility for their \nown security.\n  If we adopt the Feingold amendment, we will be sending a very \ndifferent message to the government and to the people of Afghanistan. \nIt would reinforce the fear if we adopt this amendment--an already \ndeep-seated fear in Afghanistan--that the United States will abandon \nthe region. That is a message we can ill-afford to send regarding the \nfuture stability of Afghanistan, and it is a particularly unwise \nmessage to send while our forces are still deploying to Afghanistan and \nwhile the Taliban is doing everything it can to convince the Afghan \npeople that U.S., NATO, and Afghan forces are unable to protect them \nfrom the violence and the intimidation that is their hallmark.\n  The President's decision to set the beginning point to begin the \nreduction of our forces in Afghanistan in July of 2011 was a wise \ndecision. It was supported by our senior civilian and military leaders. \nThey supported the decision, provided that the pace and the location of \nthe reductions would be determined by the conditions on the ground at \nthe time in Afghanistan.\n  The Feingold amendment is totally different. It requires the setting \nof a timetable for completion of redeployment of our troops from \nAfghanistan, and it requires that timetable to be set by this December. \nIt is an unwise move, and I hope we do not adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. I appreciate the comments of the \nSenator from Michigan, but I feel very strongly that my amendment has \nto be properly characterized. This is not a specific timetable. It \nmerely asks the President to give us a vision of a timetable of when he \nintends for this to be over.\n  The Senator from Michigan tries to reassure us that the President has \nannounced a start date for us to get out of Afghanistan. Well, that \ndoesn't work because how do we think the people of that area of the \nworld will be reassured if we are going to only start to withdraw the \ntroops in 2011? You take one troop out, that starts it. That is not a \nvision of when we intend to complete it.\n  The Senator suggests that somehow this sends the wrong message in the \nregion. Well, actually, the wrong message is that we intend to be there \nforever. We don't intend to be there forever. But you know what. After \n9 years, people start wondering--9 years; 9 years with no vision of \nwhen we might depart. In fact, I think the absolute worst message in \nthe region is an open-ended commitment. The worst thing we can do is \nnot give some sense to the people of that region and to the American \npeople and to our troops that there is some end to this thing. All we \nask for in this amendment is some vision from the President about when \nhe thinks we might complete this task.\n  So when this amendment is properly characterized, it is actually a \nway to help us make sure the Taliban and al-Qaida and others do not win \nthe hearts and minds of the Afghan people because they need to be \nreassured that we intend to make sure their country comes back to them \nand that it will not be occupied indefinitely.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield myself 10 seconds to read the \namendment:\n\n       Not later than December 31, 2010, the President shall \n     submit to Congress a report, together with a timetable for \n     the completion of that redeployment.\n\n  Completion of that redeployment, obviously, from Afghanistan. That is \na ``shall;'' it is a report; it is a completion of the redeployment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds to respond to \nthe Senator from Michigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. I thought I had a little more.\n  Madam President, the Senator is trying to read the amendment in a way \nthat is simply not accurate.\n  The amendment simply asks the President to provide his vision of a\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\ntimetable by which he would intend to withdraw the troops. It is \nentirely nonbinding. Any suggestion that this is binding in any way on \nthe President or the U.S. Government is completely false and a \nmischaracterization of the amendment. It is not binding. In fact, it \nallows the President specifically to identify variables that would \ncause him on his own to change the timetable. So how anyone can say \nthis is a binding timetable in any way, shape, or form is beyond me.\n  It is merely a request that the President give us his vision of when \nhe might withdraw from Afghanistan. It is the only fair way to \ncharacterize this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, President Obama has articulated a sound \nstrategy for surging our force in Afghanistan, a well-defined mission \nto enable them to succeed, and a clear plan to begin to bring those \ntroops home starting next July. His plan honors the service of the 100 \nNevadans in Afghanistan today and those of every American fighting \nterrorists abroad to keep us safer at home.\n  I have always believed that our commitment in Afghanistan should not \nbe open-ended, which is why I continue to support the President's plan. \nWe have begun to reverse the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan and \nweakened al-Qaeda's operations, safe havens and leadership in the \nregion. Our troops will continue to defeat those terrorist networks and \nothers like it and we will continue to press the Afghan government to \nend corruption and take responsibility for governing the country. But, \nas the President's plan makes clear, these troops have a clear task in \nplace: to reverse the Taliban's momentum and to begin returning home \nnext July.\n  In light of the President's strategy and the recent progress, now is \nnot the time to change course.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I yield myself 2 minutes from Senator \nLevin's time or Senator Inouye's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, this legislation clearly calls for a \nreport to be submitted by the President of the United States to \nestablish a timetable, and I think the suggestion that will not have \nincredible consequences in the real world is somewhat naive.\n  If the President of the United States is forced to give Congress a \ntimetable stating dates, even if those dates have some variables \nattached to them, that sets in motion a train of events that is \nanything but a simple statement of vision. That statement of vision was \ngiven by the President at West Point. In fact, he was criticized for \nspecifically indicating that there would be a point at which American \nforces begin the withdrawal, but he did that. I think anyone \nquestioning the President's not only willingness to do this, but \nunderstanding the need to redeploy our forces, should look at today's \nheadlines in the Washington Post where the Vice President has, once \nagain, reiterated that we are coming out of Iraq; that the timetables \nthe President talked about, the vision he talked about, all of those \nthings he is following through on, and he will do the same thing in \nAfghanistan.\n  In Afghanistan, the President's strategy is clear: to provide \nmilitary resources to reseize the momentum; to provide the opportunity \nto build civilian capacity; and starting, as the Senator from Wisconsin \nindicated, at a fixed date will begin a drawdown and will begin \nchanging our mission from combat operations to more counterterrorism \noperations, more training of Afghani forces.\n  Frankly, what I think the President--and I will presume to speak at \nthis moment, at last in my view--sees in the future is a significant \ndrawdown of our military presence while we build up our civilian \npresence. That civilian presence might include some trainers, police \ntrainers. It might include a lot of folks. Indeed, this vision is tied \ndirectly to the concern we all have. There are active al-Qaida cells in \nPakistan, in Afghanistan, in Yemen, and one of the advantages of a \npresence in Afghanistan is effectively cooperating with and encouraging \nthe Pakistanis.\n  I urge rejection of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Summer Jobs\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, this past Monday evening, as dusk fell on my \nhometown of Chicago, a handful of young people took to the streets with \nviolent intentions.\n  By the time the sun came up on Tuesday, no fewer than seven people \nhad been shot, in a series of unrelated incidents.\n  This wave of violent crime continued into Tuesday afternoon, when \nthree more Chicagoans were shot and killed in broad daylight.\n  These incidents came right on the heels of another shocking murder. \nLast week, a police officer and Iraq War veteran named Thomas Wortham \nIV was shot to death only a few blocks from my home.\n  These events do not occur in a vacuum. They are part of a clear and \nconsistent pattern, a pandemic of gun violence that holds communities \nin a vice grip. Every year, with the advent of the long, hot summer, \ngang activity spikes. The line between good and bad neighborhoods \nevaporates. In essence, our streets become a war zone. This is not a \npassing concern; it is an emergency. This kind of violence should be \nshocking. It should spark outrage and indignation. Yet too many of us \nturn a blind eye. We are paralyzed by the destructive political process \nand numb to the consequences of our failure to take action.\n  This problem can't simply be passed on to someone else. This violence \nis happening in our cities and towns, where we live and where we work, \nwhere we send our children to school. It is happening in our backyards. \nSo it\n\n[[Page S4484]]\n\nis up to us to raise the alarm. It is our responsibility to stem this \nrising tide and take back our communities, our homes, our schools, and \nour places of worship. We have seen that this is a pattern. We have \nwitnessed the terrible outcomes and measured the tragic human cost. Now \nit is time to take action.\n  Certainly, we can make progress by increasing gun control and making \nit more difficult for weapons to fall into the hands of criminals. This \neffort must be a part of any comprehensive solution, and it is an issue \nI have fought for throughout my career. But the reality is, a debate \nabout gun control will quickly turn into a pitched partisan battle. It \nwill consume time and political will, and in the end, we may not get \nvery far.\n  I believe we need to take a more practical, more immediate approach. \nIt is time to give our young people an alternative to destructive \nbehavior so they can spend their summers working to get ahead instead \nof getting involved in criminal activities. Today, more than half of \nBlack men between the ages of 16 and 19 are unemployed. This number is \ngrowing rapidly. In fact, the New York Times predicts that this summer \nwill be one of the bleakest on record. So if we would like to cut down \non violent crime, this is exactly where we need to start.\n  It is no accident that last year's landmark American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act included a major summer jobs component. It created \nmore than 300,000 summer jobs for youth across the country, including \nsome 17,000 in Illinois alone.\n  This year, we need to do even more. That is why I am proud to \ncosponsor S. 2923, the Youth Jobs Act of 2010, introduced by the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray. This legislation \nwould build on the success of the Recovery Act, setting aside $1.5 \nbillion for youth employment opportunities through the Workforce \nInvestment Act. It would infuse money directly into the local economy \nand give young people the chance to gain paid work experience, what \nSenator Reid spoke about the other day, the gentleman who set up a work \nopportunity and found out that the youth don't even have the work \nexperience or they don't even know how to work. We have to get them \nsome paid work experience. This will keep them off the streets in the \nshort term and give them better employment options down the road. It \nwould create half a million summer jobs from coast to coast and put a \nserious dent in the youth unemployment rate. It will spur young people \nto invest in their future and help foster a better community.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill without delay. We can do this \nright now. It will cut down on violent crime and have a real effect on \npeople's lives across America. There is no reason to wait another day \nor another moment. That is why I am so frustrated by the obstructionism \nthat has afflicted this legislation for the past 6 months.\n  It is time to make a commitment to the next generation, give them the \nopportunity to start down the right path because if we don't, then \nevery summer, when the school year ends and children seek new ways to \noccupy their time, more and more of them will find fellowship with the \ncriminal element. This cycle of violence will continue.\n  I urge colleagues to pass the Youth Jobs Act before we adjourn for \nthe Memorial Day recess. Let's provide our young people with the \nopportunity to turn away from violence. Let's give them a chance to \nbuild a constructive future. Let's take back our communities. Let's do \nit now. Let's do it today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4484-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. BURRIS.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the \nurgent need for comprehensive immigration reform in the United States.\n  Earlier today, the Senate considered a number of proposals for border \nsecurity, and there has been extensive media attention to an \nadministration proposal to dispatch substantial numbers of the National \nGuard for border security.\n  The Senate and the House of Representatives wrestled with this issue \nin 2006. Each House produced a bill. At that time, I chaired the \nJudiciary Committee and managed the bill in committee and on the floor. \nThe Senate bill, known as the McCain-Kennedy bill, provided for \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  The House passed a bill which dealt only with Border Patrol and \nemployer verification. For reasons which need not be commented upon \nnow, there was no conference and that bill languished.\n  In the following year, Senator Reid, the majority leader, asked \nSenator Kennedy and me to lead an informal group to try to structure a \ncomprehensive immigration reform, with the decision not to run it \nthrough committee, and that effort was not successful.\n  As a result of the failure of Congress to act, we have seen many \nStates and municipalities enact legislation to try to deal with this \nissue, in the absence of what Congress has a duty to do and should have \nbeen doing. Most recently, the Arizona law has produced enormous \ncontroversy.\n  The Arizona law provides that a failure to carry immigration \ndocuments would be a crime and give police broad power to detain anyone \nsuspected of being in the country illegally. The essential provisions \ninvite racial profiling, which is highly questionable on constitutional \ngrounds. Litigation is now pending to have that act--to declare it as \nbeing unconstitutional on its face.\n  When Congress failed to legislate in 2006 and the informal group \ndesignated by Majority Leader Reid was unsuccessful in coming up with a \nbill, I introduced a draft bill on July 30, 2007, as reported in the \nCongressional Record at S. 10231, which dealt with an effort to remove \nthe fugitive status from undocumented immigrants. It was my thought at \nthe time if we did not get into the complex issues which had proven so \ntroublesome in 2007 and earlier in 2006, that we might be able to make \nsome substantial progress moving forward for comprehensive immigration \nreform.\n  My thought at that time was to remove the fugitive status but not to \nprovide for a path to citizenship. I made that suggestion even though \nmy preference was with the Senate bill enacted the year before which \ndid provide a path to citizenship. Even that path to citizenship was \ngoing to be long delayed. It would take at least 8 years, it was \nestimated, to clear up the backlog of pending applications for \ncitizenship, and another 5 years to deal with the 12 million \nundocumented immigrants, so that there was not a whole lot of practical \ndifference in eliminating the path to citizenship. That could always be \ntaken up at a later time.\n  But if the fugitive status was eliminated, that would bring most of \nthe 12 million undocumented immigrants--or at least calculated to bring \nmost of the 12 million undocumented immigrants--out of the shadows and \nidentify those who were holding responsible jobs, paying taxes, and \nraising their families, in many instances with children who were \nAmerican citizens. This approach was postulated on the obvious \nproposition that we cannot deport 12 million people. It is simply \nimpossible to take them into detention and to have them housed pending \ndeportation proceedings. Bringing the undocumented immigrants out of \nthe shadows would provide an opportunity to identify those who were \nconvicted criminals where they posed a real threat.\n  At that time I visited a number of detention centers where \nundocumented immigrants convicted of crimes were\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\nheld and introduced legislation which would have accelerated the \ndeportation of those who were criminals and were a threat to our \nsociety, demonstrated by their prior conduct. But we continue to have \nthe problem of undocumented immigrants living in the shadows, afraid of \nbeing taken into custody, especially in Arizona, and concerns \neverywhere with the prospect of the Arizona law being enacted other \nplaces, that they continue to be at the mercy of unscrupulous \nemployers. We have enormous areas of need for temporary workers. That \nis a proposition which many of my colleagues have been urging and which \nI think needs to be acted upon.\n  We have the suggestion of the so-called DREAM Act which I had at one \ntime cosponsored. I later came to the view that if we cherry-picked--if \nwe take the DREAM Act, if we take temporary workers, if we take the \nexpansion of visas, which is necessary when so many people want to come \nto this country who would be very productive in our high-tech society--\nPh.D.s, highly educated individuals--that if we move along any of those \nlines and cherry-picked, it would take away a lot of the impetus for \nthe notion to have comprehensive immigration reform.\n  So I continue to believe it is not desirable, not advisable to \ncherry-pick, even though some of those individual items may be very \nmeritorious on their own.\n  In light of what has happened in Arizona and in light of what the \nadministration is proposing on the use of the National Guard, it is my \nview it is more imperative than ever that the Congress face up to its \nresponsibility, tackle this issue, notwithstanding the political \npitfalls, and to deal with it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my prepared \nstatement be printed in the Congressional Record as if read in full, \nand the abbreviated statement I made on July 30, 2007, be printed in \nthe Record since these two statements more comprehensively summarize my \nviews on this subject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Senator Arlen Specter on the Need for Comprehensive \n                           Immigration Reform\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address \n     comprehensive immigration reform. I am fully committed to \n     working with the Obama Administration, and a bipartisan group \n     of Senators, to enact a comprehensive immigration reform law \n     that improves our economy, reunites families, and strengthens \n     our borders.\n       I have long supported comprehensive immigration reform. As \n     Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the 109th Congress, I \n     worked closely with Senator Kennedy on, and cosponsored, the \n     bi-partisan Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006. In \n     the 110th Congress, I continued to work with Senator Kennedy \n     to construct a bi-partisan agreement, called ``the Grand \n     Bargain,'' to achieve this much needed reform. Our efforts \n     resulted in the introduction of the Comprehensive Immigration \n     Reform Act of 2007. Both bills fell prey to partisan \n     politics.\n       We must renew our efforts. The immigration system in the \n     United States is inadequate to meet the needs of our country \n     in the 21st century. An insufficient number of visas are made \n     available to meet the changing needs of the U.S. economy and \n     labor market. Eligible family members are forced to wait for \n     years--some for decades--to be reunited with families living \n     in the United States. An overburdened system unfairly delays \n     the integration of immigrants who want to become U.S. \n     citizens. Unscrupulous employers who exploit undocumented \n     immigrant workers undercut the law-abiding American \n     businesses and harm all workers. Finally, as we all know too \n     well, the billions of dollars spent on enforcement-only \n     initiatives in the past have done little to stop the flow of \n     unauthorized immigrants into our country.\n       Much work needs to be done. One end of the political \n     spectrum will criticize us for creating a path to citizenship \n     for those immigrants who entered without authorization, and \n     those on the other end of the political spectrum will \n     criticize us for not being sufficiently compassionate. But we \n     have a public duty, indeed a moral imperative, to come to \n     grips with this issue. We are a nation that throughout its \n     history has welcomed and been made richer by immigrants. Our \n     country was built on the contributions of hard working and \n     ambitious immigrants, like my father Harry, who emigrated \n     from Russia in 1911. The path to American citizenship is a \n     path my father had and others today deserve as well. The time \n     for comprehensive immigration reform is now.\n       The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (or \n     DREAM) Act amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 by eliminating the \n     restriction on state provision of postsecondary educational \n     benefits to unauthorized aliens by allowing unauthorized \n     aliens to apply to adjust their status. The bill enables \n     eligible unauthorized students to adjust to conditional \n     permanent resident status provided the student: (1) entered \n     the United States before his or her 16th birthday and has \n     been present in the United States for at least five years \n     immediately preceding enactment of the bill; (2) demonstrates \n     good moral character; (3) is not inadmissible or deportable \n     under specified grounds of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act; (4) at the time of application, has been admitted to an \n     institution of higher education or has earned a high school \n     or equivalent diploma; (5) from the age of 16 and older, has \n     never been under a final order of exclusion, deportation, or \n     removal; and (6) was under age 35 on the date of this bill's \n     enactment.\n       During the 108th Congress, I cosponsored a similar DREAM \n     Act sponsored by Senator Hatch and cosponsored by Senator \n     Durbin. During the 109th and 110th Congresses, I \n     included provisions of the DREAM Act in the comprehensive \n     immigration reform bill that I championed on the Senate \n     Floor because it is one side of an important part of the \n     need for reform. Another side of that need is to enhance \n     border security and tamp down on cartel violence along our \n     Southern border. I voted against cloture on a motion to \n     proceed to the DREAM Act in 2007 because I thought passing \n     the bill would undermine the pressing need to enact \n     Comprehensive Immigration Reform. In explaining my vote, I \n     said:\n\n       I believe that the DREAM Act is a good act, and I believe \n     that its purposes are beneficial. I think it ought to be \n     enacted. But I have grave reservations about seeing a part of \n     comprehensive immigration reform go forward because it \n     weakens our position to get a comprehensive bill.\n       Right now, we are witnessing a national disaster, a \n     governmental disaster, as States and counties and cities and \n     townships and boroughs and municipalities--every level of \n     government--are legislating on immigration because the \n     Congress of the United States is derelict in its duty to \n     proceed.\n       We passed an immigration bill out of both Houses last year \n     [2006]. It was not conferenced. It was a disgrace that we \n     couldn't get the people's business done. We were unsuccessful \n     in June in trying to pass an immigration bill. I think we \n     ought to be going back to it. I have discussed it with my \n     colleagues.\n       I had proposed a modification to the bill defeated in June, \n     which, much as I dislike it, would not have granted \n     citizenship as part of the bill, but would have removed \n     fugitive status only. That means someone could not be \n     arrested if the only violation was being in the country \n     illegally. That would eliminate the opportunity for \n     unscrupulous employers to blackmail employees with squalid \n     living conditions and low wages, and it would enable people \n     to come out of the shadows, to register within a year.\n       We cannot support 12 to 20 million undocumented immigrants, \n     but we could deport the criminal element if we could \n     segregate those who would be granted amnesty only.\n       I believe we ought to proceed with hearings in the \n     Judiciary Committee. We ought to set up legislation. If we \n     cannot act this year because of the appropriations logjam, we \n     will have time in late January. But as reluctant as I am to \n     oppose this excellent idea of the Senator from Illinois, I do \n     not think we ought to cherry-pick.\n       It would take the pressure off of comprehensive immigration \n     reform, which is the responsibility of the Federal \n     Government. We ought to act on it, and we ought to act on it \n     now.i\n       Mr. President, in the ensuing years the need for \n     comprehensive immigration reform has become increasingly \n     dire. On Friday, April 23, 2010, Arizona enacted a law that, \n     according to the New York Times, ``would make the failure to \n     carry immigration documents a crime and give the police broad \n     power to detain anyone suspected of being in the country \n     illegally.'' ii The text of the law provides: \n     ``For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official \n     or agency of this State or a county, city, town or other \n     political subdivision of this State where reasonable \n     suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is \n     unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt \n     shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration \n     status of the person.'' iii Lawmakers in other \n     States, including Pennsylvania and Maryland, introduced \n     companion measures.\n       On April 27, 2010, I questioned Department of Homeland \n     Security Secretary Janet Napolitano about the new Arizona \n     law. I noted that the failure of Congress to enact \n     comprehensive immigration reform led Arizona to legislate \n     ``in a way which has drawn a lot of questions, a lot of \n     criticism.'' iv I explained that the new Arizona \n     provisions appear to create ``a significant risk of racial \n     profiling.'' v After noting that Secretary \n     Napolitano is the immediate-past Governor of Arizona, I noted \n     that ``the message sent from Arizona was that movement needs \n     to occur that this issue should not be allowed to languish.'' \n     vi Secretary Napolitano replied, ``I think there \n     are a lot of issues. If this law goes into effect--and, \n     again, the effective date is not until 90 days after the \n     session ends. But if it goes into effect, I think there are a \n     lot of questions about what the real impacts on the street \n     will be, and they are unanswerable right now.'' \n     vii She went on to testify: ``I think there is a \n     lot of cause for concern in a lot of ways on this bill and \n     what its impacts would be if it is to actually go into \n     effect. And I think it signals a frustration with the \n     failure of the Congress to\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\n     move. I will work with any Member of the Congress and have \n     been working with several Members of the Congress on the \n     actual language about what a bipartisan bill could and \n     should contain.'' viii When pressed about the \n     potential for ``racial profiling and other \n     unconstitutional aspects of the Arizona law,'' \n     ix Secretary Napolitano said, ``Well, I think \n     the Department of Justice, Senator, is actually looking at \n     the law as to whether it is susceptible to challenge, \n     either facially or later on as applied, under several \n     different legal theories. And I, quite frankly, do not \n     know what the status of their thinking is right now.'' \n     x\n       It turns out she was right. On Thursday, May 27, 2010, \n     Nathan Koppel of the Wall Street Journal reported that the \n     Department of Justice was ``Likely to Sue Over Arizona \n     Immigration Law.'' xi According to the Journal, \n     Attorney General Holder ``met with big-city police chiefs who \n     are troubled by the Arizona law, which makes it a state crime \n     to be in the U.S. illegally and can require police to \n     question certain people about their immigration status.''\n       Mr. President, I think it is high time for the United \n     States Senate and House of Representatives to pass \n     comprehensive immigration reform to avert potentially \n     unconstitutional state laws in this matter of national \n     significance. We should take up Secretary Napolitano's offer \n     to help us draft a bipartisan bill that can stand bicameral \n     scrutiny. And we should do so now. I wrote President Obama on \n     April 15, 2010 to convey my willingness to press for reform \n     this year and I wrote to Majority Leader Reid on April 28, \n     2010, to convey the same message out of a strong conviction \n     that comprehensive immigration reform must be done now.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       i 153 Cong.

Madam President, I begin by thanking the staff \n     for staying a few extra minutes to enable me to come back to \n     the floor to make a short statement.\n       I have sought recognition to speak about a revised reform \n     bill on immigration. In the course of the past 3 years, the \n     Senate has spent a great deal of time on trying to reform our \n     immigration system: to begin to fix the broken borders; to \n     add more Border Patrols; to undertake some necessary fencing; \n     to add drones; to undertake employer verification by \n     utilizing identification which now can provide, with \n     certainty, whether an immigrant is legal or illegal; to take \n     care of a guest worker program to fill employment needs in \n     the United States; and to deal with the 12 million \n     undocumented immigrants.\n       During the 109th Congress, when I chaired the Judiciary \n     Committee, we reported out a bill. It came to the floor, and \n     after considerable debate it was passed. The U.S. House of \n     Representatives passed legislation directed only at border \n     patrol and employer verification, and for a variety of \n     reasons we could not reconcile the bills and enact \n     legislation.\n       This year a different procedure was undertaken: to have a \n     group of Senators who had been deeply involved in the issue \n     before craft a bill. It did not go through committee, and, as \n     I said earlier on the floor, I think it probably was a \n     mistake because the committee action of hearings and markups \n     and refinement works out a lot of problems. At any rate, as \n     we all know, after extensive debate, the bill went down. We \n     could not get cloture to proceed, and it was defeated.\n       It was defeated for a number of reasons. But I believe the \n     immigration issue is one of great national concern--great \n     importance--and ought to be revisited by the Congress and \n     that ought to be done at as early a time as possible.\n       We have a very serious problem with people coming across \n     our borders--a criminal element, and a potential terrorist \n     element. The rule of law is broken by people who come here in \n     violation of our laws. We have continuing problems from the \n     1986 legislation that employer verification is not realistic \n     because there is no positive way of identification.\n       No matter how high the borders or the value of border \n     patrol, it is not possible to eliminate illegal immigration \n     if the magnet is present. The legislation I will be putting \n     in as part of the Record at the conclusion of my remarks is a \n     draft of suggested proposals to be considered by the Senate. \n     There are two major changes which have been undertaken.\n       Much as I dislike to, I have eliminated the automatic path \n     to citizenship but instead deal with the fugitive status of \n     the undocumented immigrants, the 12 million, and eliminate \n     that fugitive status. Whether it is categorized as permanent \n     legal resident or some other category, as a matter of \n     nomenclature it can be worked out.\n       But the principal concern has not been the citizenship, \n     although it is a desirable factor to try to integrate the 12 \n     million into our society. But the principal concern has been \n     that when an undocumented illegal immigrant sees a policeman \n     on the street, there is fear of apprehension and being \n     rounded up and deported, or the undocumented illegal is at \n     the mercy of an unscrupulous employer who will take advantage \n     of them and they cannot report to the police the treatment or \n     a violation of law by an employer because they are fearful of \n     being arrested and deported. In many places you cannot rent \n     an apartment or undertake other activities. So I think \n     eliminating the fugitive status is a major improvement.\n       The other significant change is to not tamper with or \n     change family unification but to leave it as it is now. We \n     had come up with, with the bill which was defeated, an \n     elaborate point system for immigration. It was our best \n     effort but, candidly, it turned out to be half-baked. It did \n     not go through the hearing process to hear from experts. It \n     did not have that kind of refinement and raised a lot of \n     problems. That could be revisited at a later date. I have \n     worked with the so- called interest groups representing \n     immigration interests and have had what I consider to be a \n     relatively good response.\n       I do not want to characterize it or put words in anybody's \n     mouth. There is a certain reluctance to make any more \n     concessions because concessions were made last year and the \n     bottom fell out. So they made an inquiry, understandably so, \n     that there be some realistic chance of getting the bill \n     passed if they are to give up a path to citizenship.\n       I have undertaken to talk to many of my colleagues, \n     Senators who opposed the bill, to get a sense from them as to \n     whether, with the automatic path to citizenship out, and \n     dealing only with the fugitive status, that there might be \n     some greater willingness to find an accommodation and deal \n     with the issues.\n       With respect to citizenship, even under the legislation \n     that was defeated, there would not be an opportunity for \n     citizenship until at least 8 years have passed, to take care \n     of the backlog, and then another 5 years to work out the 12 \n     million undocumented immigrants. So the citizenship, even \n     under the bill which was defeated, was not something which \n     was going to be imminent.\n       We have seen local governments and State governments trying \n     to deal with the issue. Reports are more than 100 laws have \n     been passed and ordinances enacted which would deal with the \n     immigration problem. They cannot do it on a sensible basis. \n     Last week the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of \n     Pennsylvania handed down an opinion that the city of \n     Hazelton, notwithstanding the understandable efforts by the \n     mayor, program was not constitutional; that under our laws, \n     the answer has to come from the Congress.\n       We have seen a lot of unrest on the issue. The front page \n     of the Washington Post the day before yesterday had a report \n     about groups of immigrants feeling that they had been \n     mistreated. There was an uneasiness on all sides, uneasiness \n     by people who are angry about the violation of our borders, \n     by immigrants who think they are not being fairly treated, \n     and a grave concern about the availability of workers on our \n     farms across America, concerns of the hotel industry and \n     landscapers and restaurateurs about the adequacy of our labor \n     force. So there is no doubt that this is a very significant \n     issue.\n       Last week I circulated to my 99 colleagues a letter, and \n     one page summarizing the study bill--I will call it a study \n     bill.\n       I ask unanimous consent that the text of the draft proposal \n     and the one-page letter circulated to all other Senators be \n     printed in the Record.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n       (See exhibit 1.)\n       Mr. SPECTER. In conclusion, I emphasize that I am inviting \n     suggestions and comments for improving the bill. The one view \n     that I do have, very strongly, is that it is our pay grade to \n     deal with this issue. Only the Congress can deal with the \n     immigration problem, and it is a matter of tremendous \n     importance that we do so. We obviously cannot satisfy \n     everyone, but I invite analysis, criticism, and modification.\n       I see my distinguished colleague from Vermont, one of my \n     distinguished colleagues from Vermont, awaiting recognition.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear     : I believe it is possible to enact comprehensive \n     immigration reform in this Congress, perhaps even in this \n     calendar year, if we make two significant changes in the bill \n     we recently had on the floor.\n       First, a new bill should eliminate the automatic path to \n     citizenship for the approximately 12 million undocumented \n     immigrants. Instead, we should just eliminate the fugitive \n     status for the 12 million so that they would not be fearful \n     every time they see a policeman, be protected from \n     unscrupulous employers who threaten to turn them in if they \n     don't do the employer's bidding, and be free to do things \n     like rent apartments in cities which now preclude that. From \n     soundings I have taken from many senators, that should take \n     the teeth out of the amnesty argument, which was the \n     principal reason for the defeat of the last bill.\n\n[[Page S4487]]\n\n       Second, we should not tamper with the current provisions on \n     family unity with the elaborate point system which was \n     insufficiently thought through. If that is to be ultimately \n     accomplished, we need hearings and a more thoughtful \n     approach.\n       Third, although not indispensable, I believe we should \n     provide more green cards to assist the hitech community.\n       The enclosed draft bill covers these three changes and also \n     includes the guest worker program, the increased border \n     security and enhanced employer verification in the last bill.\n       Because it will be easier to get real border security if we \n     deal with the 12 million undocumented immigrants, I think \n     this proposal presents an alternate and plausible path to \n     achieve comprehensive immigration reform now.\n       I have discussed this proposal with the senators who were \n     part of the core negotiating group and with the relevant \n     interest groups and have received a generally favorable \n     response and, in many cases, an enthusiastic response. \n     Similarly, in discussing the proposed bill with the \n     dissenters, I have heard no strenuous adverse response so I \n     believe it is worthy of a repeat effort. Although the defeat \n     of the bill on the Senate floor was a major disappointment, I \n     think that we proponents of comprehensive immigration reform \n     have significant momentum and these changes, perhaps \n     supplemented by other modifications, could put us over the \n     top.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. In the absence of any other Senator \nseeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Daily Digest clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we are coming up to a critical deadline \nthis week once again that touches millions of families across our \ncountry who don't have a job, not because they don't want to work but \nbecause they have not been able to find one in the hardest hit economy \nsince the Great Depression. Even though things are turning around, we \nhave millions of people yet to be able to find a job, to be able to \ncare for their families and keep a roof over their heads.\n  Twice this year already, the Congress has missed deadlines for \nextending unemployment benefits because of Republican obstructionism, \nbasically telling millions of Americans: Tough.\n  We are now in a situation where today we will offer a temporary \nextension to be able to continue unemployment benefits and help with \nhealth care, as well as support for our doctors whom we are all \nconcerned about maintaining their Medicare payments, and we will ask \nfor an extension. I hope the answer, again, is not: Tough. That is what \nI am very hopeful of.\n  Today there are 15.3 million Americans who have lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own, and they rely on an unemployment \ninsurance system to pay the bills and put food on the table. We have \nalso heard from economists that this is an important way of keeping \ndollars in the economy because when someone is out of work and they \nhave to be able to buy food and put gas in the car and be able to do \nthe other basics, it keeps money in the economy so that when someone \ngets an unemployment check, they are spending it because they have to \nspend it, and that is part of what is a stimulus to the economy.\n  People are trying to find work and trying to support their families \nduring tough times. They want to be working, as I said. They are \npounding the pavement every day. They are putting in applications every \nday. This is not their fault. They have worked all their lives. Many of \nthem find themselves, having worked for companies for 20 or 30 years, \nnow in their fifties and they have played by the rules and they are \nfinding that because of what has happened in a global economy and \nunfair trade rules and what has happened on a lot of different fronts, \nthey don't have a job. So they are asking that we continue to \nunderstand that, understand the real world for millions of people.\n  We have 15.3 million people who have lost their jobs and who are \nreceiving assistance. That doesn't count the people who are no longer \nreceiving any kind of help or are working one, two, three part-time \njobs just to try to figure out how to make it, and, of course, those \njobs don't provide health insurance. As we transition to help them, we \nare not yet there to be able to help those families.\n  When President Obama and when all of us as Democrats took office last \nyear, we saw at that time a loss of almost 800,000 jobs a month. We \nhave been laser-focused on jobs in the Recovery Act. We have been \nlaser-focused on doing everything we can, and continue to do that. It \nis critical that we pass a small business bill to create capital for \nour small businesses that have been hit.\n  We have another bill dealing with innovation, and the bill that will \nbe coming to us that extends unemployment is a major jobs bill, and we \nare continuing to focus on that. With what we have already done, we \nhave now gone from almost 800,000 jobs a month being lost when the \nPresident first took office, to moving to that being about zero at the \nend of the year, to being about 250,000 now new jobs being created. \nThat is good. It is not enough. We know that. It is not nearly enough, \nbut at least we have turned the ship around. At least we are not \ncontinuing to go down, down, down as we did with the last \nadministration for 8 years when we lost 6 million manufacturing jobs \nalone.\n  So we are turning it around. It takes time. It takes way too much \ntime. I am very impatient about that because I know the best thing we \ncan do to help anyone who doesn't have a job in my State is to make \nsure they can get a job. Folks in my State and folks in Illinois want \nto work. They know how to work. They are good at working. It is not \ntheir fault that there are six people looking for every job that is \navailable right now. But the reality is, because of that, people are \nlooking to us to understand what is going on in their lives, what they \nare facing in terms of enormous pressures just to keep their heads a \nlittle bit above water. They are asking us to extend unemployment \nbenefits as this economy turns around, and understand.\n  So we come now to another day of reckoning. We have gone through this \nbefore. I remember last November when there was a filibuster for--I \nbelieve it was 4 weeks--on extending unemployment benefits, and then \neverybody voted for it. After creating tremendous stress in the lives \nof families who were trying to figure out what was going on, after 4 \nweeks of filibustering, then we finally saw people voting for it.\n  We have seen various versions of obstruction on the floor of the \nSenate. I hope today is different. I hope today people are going to say \nthey understand that we need to extend for 30 days if we are not able \nto complete the jobs bill, depending on what happens if it comes over \nfrom the House. I hope we will be able to do that.\n  If there is a continual effort to block the 1-year extension, 1.2 \nmillion Americans will lose help right now for themselves and their \nfamilies while they are looking for work, and over 300,000 people in my \ngreat State of Michigan. As I said, these are people who are doing \neverything we have asked them to do.\n  Let me just share some of the e-mails and letters I get, and I get \nmany of those.\n  I get many of those. Let me share this from Rick Allegan, who wrote:\n\n       I will not be able to take care of my family at all if \n     benefit extensions are cut. After being laid off, I have not \n     even been able to land a job at local restaurants or fast \n     food places. I am very grateful for these extensions--the \n     help the State is giving me is allowing my children to eat \n     and my family to stay afloat. Please do not take [this help] \n     away. I am confident I will land a job and be back to work. \n     Until then, I just don't want to worry about where I am going \n     to get funds [I need]. I am trying very hard to find work.\n\n  Mr. President, I am sure that is true.\n  Clinton from Battle Creek wrote:\n\n       I am a 56-year-old unemployed worker in Michigan. I lost my \n     job at the end of 2008, after a 38-year career in the auto \n     repair industry. When I got laid off, I took advantage of \n     Michigan's No Worker Left Behind program, and I am currently \n     in college working toward a degree in human services. To that \n     end, I work with men at the Calhoun County Jail, and I am a \n     mentor at the newly formed ``Mentor House'' for newly \n     released prisoners here in Battle Creek. When I finish my \n     education, I will be gainfully employed and an asset to my \n     community. To this end, also let me say that if I lose my \n     unemployment benefits, I may not be able to finish college, \n     and we could also lose our home because of the\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\n     loss of income. Needless to say, we don't want either of \n     those things to happen. Thank you very much for all you do, \n     as I am truly grateful as an American citizen to have all \n     that we are afforded.\n\n  That is somebody who is doing what we told him to do--go back and get \nretrained. But he is only able to do that because of a temporary safety \nnet that will help while that is going on. The rug could be pulled out \nfrom under him and his family.\n  Christopher from Three Rivers said this:\n\n       I have been unemployed for 13 months and some days.\n       I have never, ever been unemployed this long--not ever. And \n     it's astoundingly difficult to find anything--more or less \n     even receive a reply to an inquiry. I am registered with no \n     fewer than four temp offices and have been for some months, \n     and nothing--not a single call, even though they assure me \n     they are in fact looking for me.\n       And so I do all I can, and daily, trying not to lose hope. \n     But what truly appalls and galls me is Congress' attitude \n     that all is well and the economy is getting better, so, no, \n     there won't be any further extensions of unemployment \n     [insurance].\n       And let's be clear about something: I detest this. I can't \n     stand living on barely anything, but to then have it implied \n     that I somehow enjoy doing this and thus am lazy and enjoy \n     living on unemployment is quite offensive.\n\n  Mr. President, that is offensive to millions of Americans.\n  He says:\n\n       I can assure you that I do not, and I have been doing \n     everything in my ability to find work.\n\n  People want to work. People have worked their whole lives. It is not \ntheir fault that we find ourselves in this situation. It is not their \nfault that there was recklessness on Wall Street that led to a collapse \nof financial markets, that closed down credit, that caused small \nbusinesses not to be able to get loans to be able to keep business \ngoing or manufacturers to be able to get the support they needed. It is \nnot the fault of the American people. It is not the fault of a \nbreadwinner who can no longer bring home the bread.\n  We have had a collapse on a number of levels. We are rebuilding \nagain. Things are turning around, as slow as it is. The unemployment \nrate in Michigan is coming down. That is a good thing, but it is not \nfast enough for the people whom we represent who need temporary help \nuntil that job is available, until they are able to get that community \ncollege degree, to be able to get that training for the new job we have \nall told them they should go get. Go get retraining, we say. But how do \nyou put food on the table and pay for a roof over your family's head in \nthe meantime? We have done that through unemployment benefits that \nallow people to be able to become economically independent again.\n  That is what we are talking about here--temporary help. That \ntemporary help has gone on longer than any of us would like to have it \ngo on. No one is more concerned about having to come to the floor and \ntalk about extending unemployment benefits, but the reality is, for \nAmericans, this is not their fault. We have to figure out how we can \ncontinue to support them in their efforts to look for work, to be able \nto go back to school so they can, in fact, continue their lives with \ntheir families, be productive citizens, and be able to continue to \ncontribute to this great country.\n  We also know we have millions of Americans who rely on help with \nhealth care. We said to them years ago: If you leave your job or lose \nyour job, you can continue your health care benefits. The problem is \nthat it is so expensive when you have to pay both the employer \ncontribution and the employee contribution, most people haven't been \nable to do it.\n  Last year, in the Recovery Act, we did something about that. We said \nwe would help so that people could continue their health insurance in \nCOBRA. That expires as well. Just as those jobs have not been there, \nuntil we fully see a health reform bill in place, which will take time, \nas we know, we also need to continue to help with health care.\n  This bill that will be coming in front of us, the American Jobs and \nClosing Tax Loopholes Act, also includes a very important 1-year fix--\nactually, it is beyond 1 year now; it will include multiple years--to \nfix what has been a drastic cut in reimbursements to doctors, a cut \nthat, if it were allowed to happen, would force many doctors' offices \nto stop seeing Medicare families and military families.\n  As you know, I believe the payment formula that has been in place and \nthe cuts that have been scheduled for many years should be completely \neliminated and we should completely change the system, which is called \nSGR. But until we can get to that point--and I hope it is very soon--we \nneed to make sure doctors have confidence that those drastic cuts will \nnot happen and that seniors and military families know cuts won't \nhappen and that they are going to be able to continue to see their \ndoctor.\n  It is critical right now that we work together today to make sure we \nare allowing these important policies--the help for people who have \nlost their jobs, whether it be health care or unemployment insurance, \nthe ability to continue to provide the kinds of Medicare payments so \nseniors can see their doctors--it is critical that we don't let that \nlapse. We will have an opportunity on the floor today to continue that \neither temporarily or permanently. Obviously, I would like to see the \nfull jobs bill passed today and see this completed at least until the \nend of this year. If that is not possible, it is not the fault of the \npeople who don't have jobs, so I don't know why they should be the ones \nwho are hurt because of it.\n  I am very hopeful that one way or the other we are going to let \npeople in this country know that as we focus on jobs--which is the best \nthing we can do, and it is what everybody wants--and continue to turn \nthis economy around, as we continue to see jobs being created in the \nprivate sector, we will not forget the people who have gotten caught in \nthis economic tsunami through no fault of their own.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I came to the floor to call up what I \nthought was a very important amendment. I understand the majority is \nnot letting controversial amendments come up now, so I will not call it \nup and put the Chair on the spot of having to object. But I do want to \ntake the opportunity to speak on my amendment. My hope is, if we \nconclude all germane amendments, I will have the opportunity, even if \nthere is a limited amount of time to talk about them or debate them, \nthat we would at least have a vote on them, because I think not to have \na vote is to ignore the people we are representing.\n  I intended to call up my amendment that proposes the Secretary of the \nVeterans' Administration have the authority to take any savings \nrealized during the bid process on major construction projects and use \nit to fund other authorized construction projects within the VA; in \nother words, take care of providing the facilities our veterans need \nfor the delivery of health care they have so richly deserved.\n  Because of a bad economy, the VA has actually been able to strike \nunbelievable deals with the projects they had before them. From that, \nthe best estimate I have is that the VA has saved $103 million on 12 \nprojects. Let me say that again. The VA has saved $103 million on 12 \nprojects.\n  As my colleagues all know, in section 901 of this bill, it proposes \ntaking $67 million from the construction projects for medical \nfacilities and maintenance of VA facilities and to dump that $67 \nmillion into a thing we call the Filipino Equity Fund.\n  Let me say that again, because I think most people listening probably \ndo not believe what I said. We are going to take $67 million out of the \nVA construction and maintenance fund that we were able to save because \nof good work on contracting on 12 projects, and we are going to shift \n$67 million over to the Filipino Equity Fund.\n  On the face you would say, well, if it is going to Filipino Equity \nFund, it is not going to U.S. veterans. You are right. It is not going \nto U.S. veterans.\n  Money appropriated by this Congress for the construction and the \nmaintenance of medical facilities, hospitals,\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\noutpatient clinics, maintenance of those facilities, we are going to \nshift over to the Filipino Equity Fund. I will talk more a little bit \nlater about the Filipino Equity Fund.\n  First and foremost, the money saved in the bid process was \nappropriated to fund major construction projects within the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. We are talking about hospital construction, \nrenovation, cemetery construction, and other capital improvements. Let \nme assure you the President knows this. The needs are vast.\n  Let me quote from last year's Senate MILCON Appropriations report:\n\n       The committee remains concerned that the Department has a \n     significant problem with unfunded liability on its existing \n     major construction projects. In fiscal year 2010 [this one] \n     the Department will have 21 partially funded projects with a \n     cumulative future cost of nearly $4.5 billion.\n\n  Let me say that again: In this report from this Congress about the \n2010 budget, we criticized the Veterans' Administration because they \nhad 21 partially funded projects with a cumulative future cost of $4.5 \nbillion. All of a sudden, this year, because of a down economy and our \nability to negotiate better deals, we have a surplus in the account \nwhere we have saved $103 million. And what are we going to do? We are \ngoing to shift it all over to the Filipino Equity Fund, not put it \ntoward $4.5 billion worth of identified shortfalls in existing projects \nthat have already been started.\n  We are not talking about the ones on the list that might go to the \nPresiding Officer's State or to my State of North Carolina, where I \nhave got the highest percentage of veteran retirees as a percentage of \nanywhere in the country. Let me assure you, we have got needs today \nthere. If you want to do something with that $103 million, I can put \noutpatient clinics in North Carolina where our veterans will receive \nreal health care that they deserve and, more importantly, they earned \nbecause of their service to the country. But, no, $67 million of it is \ngoing outside of the Veterans' Administration and is going to the \nFilipino Equity Fund.\n  Let me also quote from a prominent veterans organization, the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, whose witness testified at the committee's \nFebruary budget hearing.\n\n       The challenge for VA is there are still numerous projects \n     that need to be carried out, and the current backlog of \n     partially funded projects is too large. This means that the \n     VA is going to continue to require significant appropriations \n     for the major and minor construction accounts.\n\n  That is one of the veterans service organizations, the organization \nthat represents veterans all over this country, warning us: You know \nwhat. There are so many projects out there, there is not enough funding \nto go around. Why are we doing this?\n  Second, given the acknowledged need I have described, it makes no \nsense to remove the funds from an account expressly dedicated to \nmeeting the needs of that account. There is no Member of the Senate who \ncan tell me that VA construction does not need this $103 million. But \nwe are going to shift it. We are going to do that because we can.\n  Congress provides taxpayer dollars for major construction projects. \nThese dollars should remain for that purpose. Why? Because the need \nexists. If not, taxpayers are going to have to pay for it with \nadditional taxpayer money.\n  Third, we have a massive deficit. I am not sure many Members of the \nSenate will acknowledge it. We have a massive deficit, and hard choices \nhave to be made with limited resources. The choice here is what do you \ndo with $67 million. This $67 million has been identified as savings \nwithin the VA construction budget. What do you do with it?\n  Well, the amendment I would have offered--and, again, I wish I could \ncall it up so my colleagues could debate it with me and vote on it, but \nit is contentious. I understand. I never thought it would be \ncontentious to try to protect what our veterans are due. I never \nthought it would be contentious that if you found somebody taking money \nand putting it where the Senate did not authorize it to be that that \nwas contentious. I thought that is why we were here. I thought that is \ncalled oversight.\n  Well, the amendment I would have offered proposes that we keep the \nmoney to meet the needs Congress intended it for: to build hospitals, \nfor cemetery construction, for major renovation of VA facilities.\n  I have also filed an amendment proposing to fund the provisions of \nthe family caregiver law the President just signed into law. I am not \ngoing to call it up. But my colleague, the Presiding Officer, knows; he \nsits on the VA Committee with me.\n  The President signed into law a great bill. It is to allow a family \nmember of an injured servicemember to be their advocate, those 1,500-\nplus severely injured Americans with a traumatic brain injury who need \nan advocate fighting for their rehabilitation, because, quite simply, \nthe system does not fight for them.\n  They could not leave their job and lose their salary because they \nlost their health care. And the President saw the wisdom in a bill that \nwe passed out of the Veterans Affairs Committee. It is going to be \ncostly, about $4 billion over 10 years, to give a financial stipend to \nthat family member, a financial stipend that is no different than we \nwould have paid some stranger off the street to come in and take care \nof that servicemember.\n  Now we are going to give the same amount of money to that spouse or \nthat father or that mother. And, oh, by the way, we also provide them \naccess to TRICARE health care coverage that we provide our soldiers and \ntheir families.\n  That is about $4.2 trillion. If you want to use $67 million for \nsomething that Congress didn't appropriate it for, which is \nconstruction, then let's use the $67 million to offset the funding of \nthe caregiver program, something that is acknowledged that we need and, \nmore importantly, we understand exactly what the impact is on our \nservice personnel.\n  The question my amendment presents is, Is providing additional \nresources for veterans so that they have modern medical facilities to \nreceive care a higher priority than ensuring that Filipino veterans get \na pension benefit? It is as simple as that. There is no way one can \nspin this any differently. We are either going to give Filipinos a \npension benefit or we are going to supply our veterans with the health \ncare infrastructure they need and, more importantly, deserve.\n  Irrespective of where we come down on the Philippine issue--and I \nwill provide my views on that momentarily--the ultimate issue is one of \nmaking tough decisions, tough choices. I personally don't think this is \none of those. I respect my colleagues who believe otherwise.\n  Two years ago, I took this floor to argue against establishing this \nspecial pension for Filipino veterans who fought under U.S. command \nduring World War II. My argument was based on several factors. First, I \ndidn't believe it was the right priority given the other needs that \nexisted in our veterans community. Nothing has changed. There is a \ngreater need in our veterans community today than there was 2 years ago \nwhen I argued the need on behalf of our veterans versus Filipino \nveterans.\n  Second, I don't think it is appropriate to pay a benefit that is not \nadjusted for the different standards of living that exist between the \nPhilippines and the United States. Example: Pensions in the United \nStates for veterans achieve an income of 10 percent above the poverty \nlevel. The special pension we are talking about during this debate--and \nthe debate 2 years ago--got Filipino veterans to 1,400 percent above \nFilipino poverty: U.S. veterans, 10 percent above poverty; Filipino \nveterans, 1,400 percent above the poverty line. We should have called \nthis the Filipino millionaires club.\n  Finally, I don't think these benefits were ever promised in the first \nplace. I will not get into the exhaustive debate the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and I had 2 years ago. I don't remember a time \nwhere anybody told me anything I said was not factual or suggested it \nwas wrong. I made a tremendous case that in the 1930s, these veterans \nwere organized to fight for the soon-to-be-independent Philippine \nState. They were called under U.S. command in defense of their own \nhomeland.\n  Let me say that again. They were called under our command to defend \ntheir own homeland. The view of the Congress immediately following the \nwar was that care of these veterans was\n\n[[Page S4490]]\n\na shared responsibility. The United States provided a limited array of \nbenefits for Filipino veterans, including disability pay for service \ninjuries, new hospitals, which we later donated to the Philippines, and \nmedical supply donations.\n  That was the Congress immediately following the war, the decision \nthis body made when this was a fresh remembrance. It was never expected \nthat the United States would provide the same benefits to Filipino \nveterans as we do for U.S. veterans.\n  Here is a quote from 1946 made by then-Senate Appropriations \nCommittee chairman Carl Hayden:\n\n       [N]o one could be found who would assert that it was ever \n     the clear intention of Congress that such benefits as are \n     granted under . . . the GI bill of rights--should be extended \n     to the soldiers of the Philippine Army. There is nothing in \n     the text of any laws enacted by Congress for the benefit of \n     veterans to indicate such intent.\n\n  Again, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in 1946, \ncommenting on whether we were committed, whether we had promised, \nwhether we had insinuated.\n  The shared responsibility for Filipino veterans was a view that held \nacross Republican and Democratic administrations for six decades. \nProposed pension benefits for Filipino veterans was opposed by every \nadministration in Congress since 1946 up until 2008 when all of a \nsudden we created the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund.\n  Here are some facts surrounding the creation of the fund and why I am \nconcerned with what we are doing today, especially on a bill that is \nmeant to provide relief from recent disasters in the United States and \nto fund our troops. The Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund was \ncreated to make payments to Filipino veterans of World War II in \nincrements of $9,000 or $15,000, depending upon citizenship. This body \nauthorized the creation of the fund and appropriated $198 million to \nfund it. The fund was later officially created, and the $198 million \nwas officially authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct, the stimulus package.\n  Remember the big bill we passed to put Americans back to work? Well, \n$198 million went to create the Filipino equity fund. I wonder if it \ncreated any jobs over there.\n  By law, Filipino veterans were given 1 year in which to file claims \nfor benefits against the fund. That 1-year period ended February 16, \n2010. February, March, April, May--we are a little over 3 months past \nthe deadline for any Filipino veteran who wanted to file a claim to \nfile the claim. The law also required--and this is important--that the \nVeterans' Administration submit detailed information within the \nPresident's budget submission on the operation of the compensation \nfund, the number of applicants, the number of eligible persons \nreceiving benefits, and the amount of funds paid. I am not sure anybody \nhere would be shocked to learn that we got the President's submission, \nbut there wasn't a VA report in it.\n  As a matter of fact, in December, when, as ranking member, my staff \ninquired with the VA what the balance of the Philippine equity fund \nwas, we were well under $198 million having been allocated. That was \nthe end of December. We only had 60 days left for people to actually \nprocess their applications before the cutoff date. I find it \nunbelievable that we would spend almost as much in the last 60 days as \nwe spent in the first 10 months, as people applied for this benefit.\n  There was no detailed information provided in the President's budget. \nAll that was there was an estimate that the administration expected \n$188 million to be expended on submitted claims. I turn to my colleague \nfrom Maine, but I think the President's budget came in in February or \nearly March, after the deadline. The President's budget said they are \ngoing to use $188 million, well short of the $198 million Congress had \nalready appropriated to the Philippine equity fund. At no point in the \nintervening months since the President submitted his budget were we \nnotified of a shortfall in the fund.\n  We see the pattern. The pattern is the White House said there was \nenough money. We had a surplus in there. The Secretary of the VA never \ntold the ranking member, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, the White House, or my staff that they were short money.\n  We will take up at another time with the Secretary of the VA his \nstatutory obligation to submit a report to the Congress, but now we are \nhere.\n  On May 7, Secretary Shinseki sent a letter to the chairman and \nranking member of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees \ninforming them, but not officially requesting, of a $67 million \nshortfall. Where did this come from? This is like ``Star Trek.'' Just \nout of the blue, it appears, 3\\1/2\\ months after the deadline for \nfiling. Well, if you look at the amount of disability claim backlogs at \nthe VA, you understand they don't process things very quickly, even for \nour veterans. But they have processed the Filipinos' a lot faster than \nthey have ours and, more importantly, they have reached out in a \nsupplemental spending bill. It is an emergency. A supplemental spending \nbill is for emergencies. How does this fit as an emergency? Tell me \nwhere this should not be offset? Why should the American taxpayer be \nrequired to go out and borrow this money?\n  I apologize. It is paid for. We are stealing it from the VA. We \nprobably borrowed it to give it to the VA, but now we are stealing it \nfrom the VA and giving it to the Philippine equity fund.\n  I find it interesting that we are rushing to meet this shortfall \nwithout understanding how exactly we went from being under budget to \nbeing grossly over budget. I say ``grossly.'' We allocated $198 \nmillion. The White House projected in February they were going to use \n$188 million. All of a sudden, we have to take another third in an \nemergency capacity to make sure they can meet the needs.\n  One other point I wish to make: There is clear language authorizing \nappropriations for the Philippine equity fund. Make no mistake. There \nis authorization language, clear authorization language. I quote from \nthe Recovery Act now, the stimulus package, in reference to the funding \nfor the Philippine equity fund:\n\n       It is authorized to be appropriated to the compensation \n     fund $198 million to remain available until expended to make \n     payments under this section.\n\n  So even in the underlying bill language, if the underlying bill \nlanguage is enacted, the VA has no legal obligation to spend it. They \nhave no legal authority to spend it--let me put it that way--because \nthe additional money hasn't been authorized. We authorized $198 \nmillion. For the VA to spend more, quite frankly, they do not have the \nauthority, as I read the law, and as I read the language quoted in the \nstimulus bill, the Recovery Act. This kind of oversight is what happens \nwhen matters are rushed through without appropriate vetting.\n\n  This week our Nation's debt went above $13 trillion. Spending is out \nof control, and there is no end in sight. As a nation, over the next 10 \nyears--if we did not borrow another penny--we owe $5.4 trillion in \ninterest payments to service the money we have borrowed. If we compare \nthat to the entire sovereign debt of the European Union, which is $12.7 \ntrillion, we owe almost 50 percent of the entire sovereign debt of the \nEuropean Union in interest payments over the next 10 years--not in \nreducing debt, servicing debt.\n  Although another $67 million to add to the Filipino fund might seem \nlike a drop in the bucket, I do not think it does to people in North \nCarolina: the soldiers at Fort Bragg, the marines at Camp Lejeune, the \nairmen at Seymour Johnson, the aviators at Cherry Point, the \nservicemembers who ship all the ammunition the U.S. military uses out \nof Sunny Point, the thousands of family members who rely on the health \ncare and the benefits.\n  We are experiencing an unemployment rate in North Carolina of 10.8 \npercent. Nationally, we are at about 9.9 percent. At a time when the \ntypical family in North Carolina is struggling to meet the obligations \nat the end of the month--meaning they buy what they need and not what \nthey want--what does the Congress do? The Congress says the hell with \nour veterans. Let's take money we have designated and put over here for \nconstruction and to build cemeteries and to do maintenance for our \nveterans--let's take $67 million of it and fund this pot of money that \neven the Secretary has not justified why they need it.\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\n  In a tough fiscal climate, tough choices must be made. I say to the \nPresident, I say to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, we \nhave been more than generous to the Philippines, to the Philippine \nveterans. But, Mr. Chairman, our needs must be met first--the needs of \nour veterans, the needs of our economy, the needs of the American \npeople, the protection of the fiscal integrity of this country.\n  America wakes up every day expecting us to change. Every day they \nwake up thinking: Maybe Congress will recognize the difficult financial \nsituation we are in--only to see us, in a week like this, where we are \ndesperately trying to borrow another $300 billion, and we claim it is \nan emergency.\n  This is not an emergency. If we owe it, it can wait. If we owe it, we \nshould pay for it; we should not borrow it. We should not steal it from \nthe VA. We should not steal it from our children and our grandchildren. \nWe should not steal it from the veterans. If we owe it, let's pay for \nit.\n  I had wished to call up this amendment. I hope before we end the \ndebate on this supplemental spending bill--but I do not know--I will \nput it this way: We will, before we end this supplemental spending \nbill, have an opportunity to vote on this because I will object to \nleaving before we will. I will not hold the majority or the minority \nMembers to the floor to hear me rant and rave again, I promise the \nchairman that. I have said my piece. But I hope they will show me the \ndignity of voting on it. I hope they prove to America this body still \nhas rules and that we follow those rules.\n  It is a germane amendment. It gets to the heart of one specific piece \nof it. Two people can disagree on whether it is an emergency. Two \npeople can disagree on whether it is a priority. But I think the one \nthing we can all agree on is we can never, ever pay our veterans \nenough. There is no amount of money, there is no service, there is no \nbenefit we can provide that satisfactorily takes the veterans of this \ncountry and thanks them appropriately. We are in this institution \nbecause of them, and when we do this future generations question why.\n  Today, I hope my colleagues question why, and when given an \nopportunity, vote in support of my amendment and strike this from the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, it was not my intention to rise, but \nafter listening to the remarks of the Senator from North Carolina, I \nfelt it obligatory that I say something to clarify the record.\n  I think it is well that we review a bit of the history of World War \nII. On July 26, 1941, the President of the United States, Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt, invited the Filipinos, issued a military order, and \nsaid: Join our forces in the Far East. If you do, at the end of the war \nyou will be entitled to, well, apply for citizenship and receive all \nthe benefits of a veteran of the United States. That was a promise made \nby the President of the United States in March of 1942.\n  After going through the horror of Bataan and Corregidor, the Congress \nof the United States passed a law doing exactly that: authorizing \nFilipinos who wished to be naturalized to do so; and upon \nnaturalization, a receipt of citizenship, they were entitled to all the \nbenefits.\n  Madam President, 470,000 volunteered, and many died as we know. Most \nof the men who marched in the Bataan Death March were not Americans; \nthey were Filipinos. But then, when the war ended, we did send one \nmember of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to Manila to take \napplications for citizenship. Before he settled down, he was recalled \nback to Washington. The Congress of the United States, in March of \n1946, repealed that law, denying the Filipinos and reneging on the \npromise we made.\n  When I took the oath as a soldier in World War II, after the oath, \nthe company commander told me there are three words that are precious: \n``duty,'' ``honor,'' and ``country.'' Duty to your country, never \ndishonor the country. Show your love for your country.\n  Well, in this case, it should be apparent to all of us what we did \nwas not right. We made a promise. We were honor bound to those men who \nserved and got wounded. The emergency is very simple: they are dying by \nthe dozens each day. They are old men. Their average age is 87. They do \nnot have too many months left in their lives. That is why it is in this \nsupplemental bill. If we wait another year, who knows how many will be \nleft?\n  I just wanted the record to be clear this is a matter of honor. We \nshould uphold our promises. We are complaining to other countries when \nthey violate a little portion of a treaty. This was a promise made by \nCongress and the President of the United States, and we reneged soon \nafter the war. It is so obvious. Would we have done that to other \ncountries?\n  Madam President, I am glad it is not coming up for a vote because I \nthink it would be a sad day if we voted it down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4253\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I left an important markup of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee because it was my understanding the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Boxer, wished to debate an amendment I \nhave pending before this body and she wanted to do so at either 3:30 or \n3:45. It is now almost a quarter after 4, and I am told the schedule of \nthe Senator from California has changed. I am very eager, having spent \nconsiderable time waiting for her on the Senate floor, to return to the \nmarkup. So I am going to give my comments now and try to anticipate the \narguments my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, will be making \nin opposition to the amendment I have offered. It is a little difficult \nto do it that way, but having waited for some time now, I do need to \nreturn to the committee's markup.\n  My bipartisan amendment is a common sense approach to protecting both \njobs and children's health, and it has to do with the new regulation \nthe EPA has put into effect as of April 22 that requires mandatory \ntraining for anyone who is involved in disturbing or removing lead-\nbased paint.\n  Let me say I support the intention of this rule. In fact, along with \nmy colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, I have done a great deal \nof work to try to reduce the exposure of our children to lead-based \npaint. He and I held joint hearings in Rhode Island and Maine because \nboth of our States have housing stocks that are older than the national \naverage and, thus, have considerable lead-based paints. So I understand \nhow important this issue is, and I support the rule.\n  Unfortunately, the EPA has completely botched the implementation of \nthis rule because of its inexcusably poor planning, and it did not \nensure there was an adequate number of trainers to provide the required \nclasses to ensure that contractors understand the requirements of the \nnew rule. That is why it is probably not surprising that there is a \nlong list of cosponsors of my amendment. They include Senators \nAlexander, Inhofe, Bond, Voinovich, Snowe, Begich, Gregg, Murkowski, \nCoburn, Thune, Corker, Brown of Massachusetts, Hutchison, Enzi and \nBarrasso, and I appreciate them joining me as cosponsors of this \namendment.\n\n  What my amendment would do is prohibit the EPA from using funds in \nthis bill to levy fines against contractors under its new lead paint \nrule through September 30.\n  Based on what I have seen in Maine, I believe the lion's share of \ncontractors are awaiting EPA's training classes. Unfortunately, while \nthey wait for EPA to deliver this training, they are at risk of being \nfined up to $37,500 per day, per violation. While I support EPA's rule \nbecause we must continue our efforts to safely rid toxic, lead-based \npaint from our homes, it is simply not fair to put these contractors at \nrisk of these enormous fines when it is EPA's fault that these \ncontractors have not been able to get the training that is required \nunder the new rule.\n  The fact is there are not enough trainers in place to certify the \ncontractors. Let me give my colleagues an example. In three States--\nLouisiana, South Dakota, and Wyoming--there are no trainers available. \nHow is that fair? In my State, as of last week, there were only three \nEPA trainers for the entire State to certify contractors, and as a \nresult just a little more than 10 percent of the State's contractors \nhave been certified.\n\n[[Page S4492]]\n\n  Well, what does that mean? That means individuals will be affected, \nnot just big contractors. It is your neighborhood painters; plumbers \nare affected; window replacement and door replacement specialists. It \naffects a wide variety of individuals involved in home renovations. \nThey are all affected. They can't get the courses. So that means they \ncan't do these jobs. Here is the ironic result. The ironic and tragic \nresult is that lead-based paint remains in these homes. It can't be \nremoved because the contractors aren't certified to remove it. So that \nis the irony--the delay of the removal of lead-based paint.\n  In a State such as Tennessee that has just undergone enormous \nflooding and is going to require extensive renovation and \nreconstruction, it is going to bring a lot of that work to a halt \nbecause for all of Tennessee there are only three EPA-certified \ntrainers. In a State such as Alaska--think how vast Alaska is--there \nare only three certified trainers as well. In Hawaii, there are two. In \nIowa, there is only one for the whole State. In the Presiding Officer's \nState of New Hampshire, there are only three--again, not nearly enough.\n  The rule carries a big penalty for contractors who do not get \ntrained. If contractors who perform work in homes built before 1978 are \nnot EPA certified, they face fines of up to $37,500 per violation, per \nday. Well, in your State and my State, that is more than many of these \npainters make in a year--in a year. And how unfair it is that it is the \nEPA's fault that in many cases these contractors are not certified. \nThey are not certified because they simply cannot get the courses.\n  Let me give my colleagues another example of the EPA's total \nmishandling of the planning for this rule. The EPA estimated that it \nonly needed to train 1,400 people in my State--1,400 people. In fact, \nthere are more than 20,000 individuals in the State of Maine who \nrequire training. The EPA assumes they are part of large firms and that \nonly one person at each firm needs to be certified. That is just not \nhow it works. In my State--indeed, I bet in most rural States--\ncontractors are often one or two people in a shop. They aren't these \nbig firms. The person who did work on my home replacing the windows \njust a couple of years ago--and I am glad he did it then before this \nnew rule went into effect--works either alone or with one or two other \npeople to assist him. That is very typical.\n  There is an assumption by the EPA that contractors specialize, that \nthey only do renovations in old homes or they do new home construction. \nThat isn't true at all, particularly not in this economic environment \nwhere the housing industry has been so hurt and depressed. The \ncontractors in my State are hustling to do whatever they can in order \nto get work and to put food on their table. They work in mixed \ncommunities with both older and newer homes. It is simply not fair to \nrequire them to give up working in older homes, particularly in a State \nsuch as mine which has some of the oldest housing in the Nation.\n  Here is another assertion by the EPA. The EPA asserts that they did \nplenty of outreach and that contractors should have known they needed \nto get training before April 22. Clearly, the EPA did not adequately \ntarget its outreach campaign. Writing to Home Depot doesn't do it. That \nis not sufficient outreach. In fact, the classes were all offered in \nthe southern part of my State, very far from people in Aroostook County \nin northern Maine, for example, where it could be a 5 or 6-hour drive \nin order to get the necessary training. When we begged the EPA for more \ntrainers and more help, it took them 7 weeks to even respond with some \nideas for getting more trainers in Maine, and even then their proposal \nshowed a complete lack of understanding of the geography of the State \nand the number of people who would need to be trained.\n  It also was frustrating because they offered some very expensive \nclasses. EPA, for example, offered a class for $200 in Waterville for \npeople living in Aroostook County. That is almost 5 hours away. So not \nonly were they going to be required to pay $200 for the course, but \nalso they would miss 2 days of work traveling back and forth. That is \ninexcusable, and that is the kind of insensitivity out of Washington \nthat makes people so alienated from government right now. It is exactly \nwhy people are so frustrated.\n  The EPA will point out the dangers of lead poisoning, and I could not \nagree more that lead poisoning is a terrible problem and that we have \nto do all we can to protect our children. But poor implementation of \nthis rule serves no one well, and in fact, as I pointed out, it means \nlead paint is going to remain in homes that otherwise would have been \nremediated or mitigated.\n  This rule is very strict. If you disturb just 6 square feet of paint, \nthen you have to comply with the new rule. So it doesn't just apply to \na large contractor doing an extensive renovation; it is going to apply \nif you are a carpenter replacing one window in a home or if you are a \nplumber who is helping to put in a new bathroom where there is lead \npaint or if you are a painter who is painting a new room or an old room \nin a house. So it has very wide application.\n\n  How the EPA so misjudged the number of people who would require \ntraining is beyond me. This is so frustrating because it did not need \nto happen this way and cause such hardship for our small business men \nand women who are struggling if they are in the construction business \nright now.\n  That is why my amendment--a bipartisan amendment with considerable \nsupport--has been endorsed by the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, our Nation's largest small business advocacy organization. In \nfact, the NFIB will consider a vote in favor of my amendment as an NFIB \nkey vote for this Congress. I want to make sure my colleagues recognize \nthat.\n  I wish to read a portion of the letter from NFIB. Again, as NFIB \npoints out:\n\n       The new EPA lead rule applies to virtually any industry \n     affecting home renovation including: Painters, plumbers, \n     window and door installers, carpenters, electricians, and \n     similar specialists . . . NFIB appreciates the intent of the \n     law . . . However, we continue to be concerned that the tight \n     enforcement deadline unfairly punishes contractors who have \n     not been able to become accredited through no fault of their \n     own.\n\n  That is the point. In my State, there are literally hundreds of \ncontractors who are on waiting lists to get convenient classes, and \nsome of them have been on these class waiting lists for as long as 2 \nmonths. So this is a real problem, and the high penalty for \nnoncompliance is simply unfair.\n  I would point out that this is the peak construction season, \nparticularly in Northern States such as ours, I say to the Presiding \nOfficer. We can't bring everything to a grinding halt because the EPA \ndid such poor planning in rolling out this new rule.\n  I also wish to point out that the amendment has been endorsed by the \nRetail Lumber Dealers Association and by the Window and Door \nManufacturers Association. It is endorsed by the National Home Builders \nAssociation. It is endorsed by a number of groups representing small \nbusinesses involved in the renovation of homes.\n  Again--because I can just imagine what is going to come about later \nwhen my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, comes to the floor--\nthis is not about repealing this rule. This is about giving more time \nfor the training, the mandatory classes to take place before the EPA \nsteps in and wallops these small businesses, these self-employed \npainters and carpenters and window installers and plumbers, with huge \nfines that could put them out of business simply because they have not \nbeen able to get the mandatory training due to the EPA's poor \nimplementation of this new rule.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It is a modest, \ncommonsense solution to a problem created here in Washington by \nofficials who are simply out of touch with what is going on in home \nrenovation businesses. I hope my colleagues will support it. All it is \ndoing is giving us a few more months to get people trained. I think \nthat it is reasonable. I ask for my colleagues' support.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Daily Digest editor proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4493]]\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, later we will be taking up an amendment \nI filed to the supplemental appropriations bill--amendment No. 4191--\nand at that time, with an agreement that is reached by all sides, I \nwill not be asking for a vote on that amendment and will be withdrawing \nit. I wanted to give the reasons why I will be doing so.\n  I was pleased that President Obama announced today that he would put \non hold the lease-sale 220 site that is off the coast of Virginia for \noffshore drilling. Let me take us back to March, when President Obama \nmade the announcement that certain parts of our coast--previously off \nlimits for offshore drilling--would now be allowed to go forward with \ndrilling. At that time, Senator Mikulski and I sent a letter, issued a \nstatement, making it clear we would resist any efforts to drill off of \nthe Virginia coast 50 miles from the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. We \nthought the risk of these drillings were too great with the amount of \noil that may have been there.\n  The President's announcement today takes that issue off the table, at \nleast temporarily. The amendment I offered to the supplemental \nappropriations bill which, of course, would have been in effect during \nthe use of the funds in the supplemental appropriations, would have \nprevented any of those funds from being used for drilling off the \nAtlantic or the straits of Florida. The President's announcement has \nnow taken care of my immediate concern that there could have been an \neffort to move forward on drilling off of the Virginia coast.\n  I want to go over the pluses and minuses of this, because I think it \nis an interesting dynamic here as to the benefits that could have been \ninvolved in drilling off of the Atlantic coast.\n  As I said before, the site that was selected is about 50 miles from \nthe mouth of the Chesapeake, about 60 miles from Assateague Island. If \nthere had been a spill, the prevailing winds, over 70 percent of the \ntime, come into the coast or along the coast. That means if we had a \nspill, that spill would have had dramatic impact on the Chesapeake Bay, \non Assateague Island, on the beaches of Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, \nVirginia, and probably the east coast of the United States, and could \nhave caused irreparable harm.\n  The potential oil that is in site 220 matches about 1 week of our \nNation's needs. So the risk-benefit here clearly dictates that we not \ndrill along the mid-Atlantic. And I would like to add one additional \nfactor, and that is there has been concern expressed by the Department \nof Defense as to moving forward with drilling off the shores of \nVirginia, because the Navy does operations within this area, and it \nwould have been an encroachment on the ability of the Department of \nDefense to move forward with its needs. In a time of war, we certainly \ndon't want to jeopardize the Defense needs.\n  So for all those reasons, the Senators from this region--Senator \nMikulski, myself, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Menendez--have been \narguing very strenuously against moving forward, and that is the reason \nwhy I filed amendment No. 4191. Fortunately, the President has removed \nthe immediate concern.\n  Of course, since his March announcement, we have seen the BP Oil \nepisode in the Gulf of Mexico--this horrific event. By the way, the \nlargest spill we had in the United States--the Exxon Valdez accidental \nspill--was 10.8 million gallons. We now believe the spill in the Gulf \nof Mexico currently is approaching 40 million gallons. So we are \ntalking about perhaps as much as three to four times the scope of what \nhappened with the Exxon Valdez.\n  We know the original estimates were wrong. We don't know the exact \nestimates. Some say it is even larger than that. But we do know that we \nhave now exceeded the Exxon Valdez as far as the amount of oil that has \ngone into the Gulf of Mexico and, of course, is traveling. It is \ntraveling, as Senator Nelson points out frequently, along the Loop \nCurrent that brings it around the Keys up the east coast of the United \nStates. So this is having a catastrophic environmental impact.\n  As I have said previously on the floor, the permits for the BP Oil \nsite never should have been granted. The exploration plans spelled out \nvery clearly that there was little risk of a spill, and that if they \nhad a spill, it would not affect our coast because they had proven \ntechnology to prevent that from happening. Well, they didn't have \nproven technology. The blowout preventers had failed on numerous \noccasions previously, and we know that they misrepresented the facts.\n  The point I am bringing up is that there is a need for significant \nchange in our regulatory system as it relates to going forward with \ndrilling, and the President is recognizing that today. He announced a \nmoratorium on deep water and he also announced a modification on what \nis happening in the Arctic. I think all that is the right step moving \nforward. It is the first step forward, to acknowledge we have a \nproblem. But I want to point out that the areas already available for \nexploration represent over 70 percent of our known reserves--I think \nover 80 percent on oil. So we are talking about a very little amount in \nnew areas. And we only have less than 3 percent of the world's \nreserves. We use 25 percent of the world's oil.\n\n  As the President said today, what happened in the Gulf of Mexico \nshould be a real awakening call to our Nation to go forward with an \nenergy policy to make us secure. We cannot drill our way out of this \nproblem. We have to develop renewable and alternative energy sources. \nWe need to be serious about conservation, and we need to look at ways \nthat we can be energy secure and improve our economic outlook by \ncreating jobs and also be friendly toward our environment.\n  For all those reasons, it makes absolutely no sense whatever to move \nforward with new explorations along the Atlantic coast.\n  Although I applaud the President's announcement today--it is a step \nin the right direction--what we need to do is take this site, lease \nsale 220, off the table permanently and take drilling in the Atlantic \npermanently off the table. I assure my colleagues I will be looking for \na way in which we can speak to this to provide the legislative \nauthority so drilling will not take place off the Atlantic coast. I \nknow Senator Feinstein is also working on amendments to make sure we do \nnot have any new permits issued until we have a regulatory system in \nplace that we all have confidence is independent and will protect the \nenvironment and safety of the American people.\n  The bottom line is that the American people have a right to expect we \nare going to do what is right for this country, that we are on their \nside and we are not just going to listen to what the oil industry \nwants. We are going to make sure we protect our environment and make \nsure we have an energy policy that makes sense for America.\n  I think the President took an important step forward today in his \nannouncements concerning taking this lease site, at least for the \nmoment, off the table so we are not threatened by exploration off the \nVirginia coast. That was the intent of my amendment. I am very pleased \nhe did that. But I hope this will lead this body to pass legislation to \npermanently protect the Atlantic coast because, frankly, oil spilled \nanywhere on the Atlantic coast will affect the entire coast.\n  We need to be mindful that we all are in this together. Let's work on \nresponsible policies for regulation to make sure our regulators are \ncontrolling the drilling that is taking place in the proper manner, and \nlet's work together on an energy policy that makes sense for this \nNation, that will make us energy secure and provide for America's \nfuture.\n  With that in mind, when the appropriate time comes to consider \namendment No. 4191, I want my colleagues to know why I will not be \nseeking action on that amendment. I believe the President's actions \nwill protect those of us on the east coast of the United States during \nthis immediate time, during 2010, so we will not have any drilling \ndone. I am satisfied that we have been able to protect our communities \nfrom drilling. But I urge us to get together to make sure that is \npermanent and that it is not changed when perhaps people's recollection \nof what happened in the Gulf of Mexico might not be quite as fresh as \nit is today, as we see the consequences of this environmental disaster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask to be recognized for 2 minutes.\n\n[[Page S4494]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4221 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, in 1 minute I am going to ask for \nunanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 4221, which is currently \npending on the legislation before us. After discussions with the staff, \nit is my understanding that the appropriations included in FEMA in this \nemergency legislation will, in fact, be available to those States that \nhave been approved for funds that did not get them in the last budget \nbecause funds ran out. If that is the case, the State of Georgia would, \nas my intent was, be recognized to be a beneficiary of that. Therefore, \nI ask unanimous consent that the Isakson amendment, No. 4221, be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the order now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Menendez amendment to the Reid amendment \nis the pending question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, would it be in order for me to speak \nagainst the Collins amendment, No. 4253, at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it would.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4253\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I hope we are going to defeat the \nCollins amendment, No. 4253. Let me explain what the amendment does. I \nwant to describe why it is wrong and why it should be defeated.\n  The purpose of the Collins amendment is to prohibit the EPA, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, from ensuring compliance with Federal \nsafeguards to protect pregnant women, infants, and children from lead \npoisoning related to repair and renovation work involving lead-based \npaint. I think everyone agrees--I don't think there is any dissent--\nthat lead is very dangerous and lead poisons children. We know it is \nimperative to remove the lead from the child's environment in order to \nmake sure they do not get brain damage.\n  This amendment is designed to stop the EPA from enforcing that very \nimportant safeguard of removing this lead even if businesses were \ncriminally negligent, even if businesses were willfully breaking the \nlaw's safeguards. If children were lead-poisoned and had permanent \nbrain damage as a result of inadequate care being taken to protect the \npublic health, EPA still couldn't enforce this law and get rid of the \nlead. Even if a child died as a result of severe lead poisoning, this \namendment says EPA cannot enforce the law here.\n  The reason that is given by Senator Collins for her amendment to \nprohibit EPA from enforcing this law to protect our kids from lead is \nthat there are not enough trainers available at EPA to train businesses \nso they are properly trained to do this work. Later on in this \nstatement, I will show why that is false. But let me say that we ought \nto know what we are getting into here if we start doing things like \nthis. Whose side are we on, anyway--the side of our families or the \nside of some businesses that do not want to do what has to be done and \nare using any excuse to get out of doing what needs to be done, which \nis to get rid of the lead.\n  On April 22, 2008, EPA issued a rule requiring the use of lead-safe \npractices to prevent lead poisoning. The rule requires one contractor \nin a renovation or repair job site to be certified in lead safe job \npractices. This one contractor can oversee or conduct the work. The \nrule covers projects at childcare facilities, schools, and homes that \nwere built before 1978, and any facility that contains lead-based \npaint.\n  The Bush administration's EPA promulgated this rule after then-\nSenator Obama worked to get the Agency to conduct the rulemaking. When \nthe Agency started the rulemaking in 2006, the EPA was a decade behind \nthe schedule Congress had set out. Imagine this: It took an extra 10 \nyears to get this regulation in place, and Senator Collins wants to \nstop the enforcement. This is a bad amendment.\n  Let me tell you about the public health threats EPA's rule is \ndesigned to protect. According to the CDC, the Centers for Disease \nControl, lead is a dangerous toxin that can harm almost every organ and \nsystem in the body, and there is no known safe level of lead in \nchildren's blood. About 250,000 U.S. children age 1 to 5 have blood \nlead levels greater than 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, \nthe level on which CDC recommends public health intervention. When \nchildren have that much lead in their bodies, they may have to undergo \npainful treatments to quickly reduce their blood lead levels. According \nto the EPA, lead can damage the nervous system, including the brain, \nwhich can harm mental development, and it can cause permanent injury to \nhearing and visual abilities.\n\n  Pregnant women, infants, and children are especially at risk from \nexposure to lead. Exposure before and during pregnancy can harm \nprenatal development and cause miscarriages. Large exposure to lead can \ncause blindness, brain damage, convulsions, and even death. The long-\nterm effects of lead exposure in children include higher school failure \nrates and reduction in lifetime earnings due to permanent loss of \nintelligence and other impacts.\n  Let me tell you, Madam President, this is a proven scientific fact. \nExposure to lead in children--in all of us is a real problem but \nespecially in children. If we are not on the side of the children in \nthis Senate, I don't know whose side we are on.\n  This is a very unwise amendment. According to the EPA, 40 percent of \nhomes have some lead-based paint, and annual renovation, repair, and \npainting projects may impact 1.4 million children under the age of 6. \nLead-based paint repair and renovation activities can significantly \nincrease the risk of elevated blood lead in our children. An EPA study \nfound that children living in residences during renovation and \nremodeling activities were 30 percent more likely to have elevated \nblood lead levels than children who lived elsewhere.\n  States from coast to coast recognize the threat lead poses to infants \nand children, and they recognize that trained individuals should do \nlead paint repair and renovation work.\n  In Maine, the State government recognizes that more than 60 percent \nof Maine homes may contain lead paint. Home renovations caused over \nhalf the childhood lead poisonings in Maine.\n  This is a statement from the Maine government:\n\n       It is very important that home repairs in an area with lead \n     paint be done safely and correctly. Improper removal of lead \n     paint can poison you and your children.\n\n  This is from the State of Maine. They go on to say:\n\n       Every year, hundreds of children in Maine are found to have \n     elevated blood levels. Most children are poisoned by lead \n     hazards in their homes. To protect yourself, your family and \n     any tenants, you can use a licensed lead abatement contractor \n     with workers who have been trained and certified in lead \n     abatement.\n\n  In Tennessee, we have a similar warning:\n\n       A common source of high-dose lead exposure to young \n     children is deteriorating paint in homes and buildings.\n\n  They say:\n\n       Hire a certified lead-based paint professional to remove \n     lead-based paint from your home.\n\n  In Oklahoma, they say:\n\n       Lead poisoning is the No. 1 environmental health hazard for \n     children. Remodeling a house covered in lead paint will \n     create dust and paint chips that can cause lead poisoning if \n     inhaled or ingested. Protect your family from lead during \n     remodeling.\n\n  The State says:\n\n       If you hire contractors, make sure they understand the \n     causes of lead poisoning and how to stay safe.\n\n  In my home State of California, this is what they say:\n\n       Lead in paint chips, dust, and soil cling to toys, fingers, \n     and other objects children put into their mouths. This is the \n     most common way children get lead poisoning.\n\n  Many construction professionals today still do not know about the \nharmful effects of lead. They may not even know that simple painting, \nremodeling, or renovation projects can cause lead poisoning.\n  I think it is very important to note that industry has had years to \nunderstand and prepare for this rule. EPA\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\nbegan the rulemaking in 2006, and contracting organizations and other \nstakeholders met and talked with the agency. EPA issued a final rule in \n2008. The rule did not go into effect until 2010.\n  EPA got hundreds of comments during the rulemaking process. The \nagency has joined with the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, \nthe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Ad \nCouncil to sponsor a nationwide public advertising campaign to raise \nawareness of the dangers of lead poisoning to children.\n  Advertisements are being distributed to more than 33,000 media \noutlets, and workers are already trained and more workers are receiving \ntraining in order to ensure compliance with this rule's safeguards.\n  Let me tell you, Senator Collins has stated on this floor that she \nsupports getting the lead out of our homes, that she supports training \nthe contractors. The reason she is stopping this--and make no mistake, \nstopping this program, which means more lead poisoning in our \nchildren--the reason is, she says, there is not enough trainers.\n  So we called EPA. I spoke to Senator Feinstein about this, and we \nfind no such thing. According to EPA, States across the Nation have \nmore than enough trainers to handle renovation needs at this point in \nthe year. In areas of States that may be harder to get to the agency \nhas traveling trainers who go from State to State giving classes.\n  EPA has stated the number of renovators needed to implement the rule \nduring the first full year will be achieved in the next 2 months. They \nwill have trained 363,000 renovators. This means training is ahead of \nschedule. It is ahead of needs since we are only halfway through the \nyear.\n  As of May 19, there are 223 accredited training providers offering \ntraining across the country; 119 are available to travel to provide \ntraining in any State--your State, my State, any State. Most of these \ntrainers are offering multiple training courses each week.\n  As of May 19, 2010, these training providers have offered over 12,000 \nrenovator certification classes and trained 200,000 to 250,000 \nrenovators. Further, 238 additional training providers have applied to \nbecome accredited. When approved, these trainers will more than double \nthe Nation's training capacity.\n  Let's take a look at Maine. According to EPA, this State is estimated \nto need 1,300 renovators trained in this first year that the Federal \nrule protecting people from lead poisoning is in effect. As of May 19, \nMaine has at least 2,686 trained renovators, and there have been 158 \nclasses provided in the State.\n  Again, there are 119 traveling providers who can travel anywhere in \nthe country to offer courses. EPA told Senator Collins' staff, and we \nfound this out from EPA, that the agency would send such trainers to \nnorthern Maine to offer classes in Bangor, where staff said there was a \nneed for more trainers.\n  EPA asked staff for contact information on the individuals who had \ncalled the Senator asking for assistance in getting trained. So far EPA \nhas not received a response. In Maine, believe it or not, there have \nbeen cancellations of training classes, and 32 classes have been \ncanceled. EPA believes cancellations occur because they are just not \nenrolling. So to come here and say there are not enough trainers, when \nher State has canceled training, just does not add up.\n  EPA's rules already provide exemptions for emergency situations. For \nexample, the recent floods in Tennessee have damaged many homes that \nmust now undergo renovation. On May 14, 2010, the EPA sent the State of \nTennessee a letter announcing that emergency exemptions from the \nagency's lead paint repair and renovation rule applied in 42 counties \nthat had experienced serious flooding. EPA stated:\n\n       It is permissible for individuals to perform immediate \n     activities necessary to protect their property and public \n     health. These actions may include the removal of surfaces \n     containing lead-based paint. Further, these actions need not \n     be performed by a certified individual. To the extent \n     necessary to alleviate the concerns associated with this \n     emergency.\n\n  So EPA is being very flexible. They are not saying to people who are \ntrying to recover from a flood: You need to remove the lead. If you \nneed to deal with your home, deal with it. Do not have this added \nworry. So they are flexible.\n  Lead hazard information: having a sign to warn people about lead dust \nhazards, containing lead dust in the work area by using such materials \nas plastic and tape, lead dust waste handling requirements and certain \ntraining and certification requirements. This also has been waived in \nthis Tennessee circumstance.\n  EPA has said some safeguards still apply to these renovations. But \nthey have exempted them from quite a few. They do not want to see our \nchildren exposed. EPA's rules require a simple, commonsense action such \nas using plastic and tape to control the migration of lead dust, the \nuse of HEPA vacuums that can be purchased at department stores to clean \nup dust, and a prohibition on certain actions that create extremely \nserious lead dust hazards. According to EPA, these safeguards add only \n$35 to the cost of renovation.\n  I have letters from public health organizations that oppose this \namendment. I also have a letter from the EPA explaining why it opposes \nthis amendment. I ask unanimous consent that these be printed in the \nRecord at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Center for Healthy Housing\n\n\n    Protect Women, Infants and Children from Lead Poisoning--Oppose \n                             Amendment 4253\n\n       The undersigned organizations and individuals oppose \n     Senator Collins' Amendment 4253 that would put over 1 million \n     children at risk of irreversible lead poisoning. The \n     amendment would prohibit EPA from spending funds under this \n     emergency supplemental appropriations act to enforce the \n     Agency's rule to require work practices that protect people \n     from health threats caused by repair and renovation work on \n     lead-based paint.\n       Even though the Act does not provide EPA with any funds to \n     enforce these important requirements, it will put every \n     Senator who votes for it on record as being against EPA \n     enforcing safeguards in the Agency's lead repair and \n     renovation rule. These protections are designed to prevent \n     lead poisoning--a devastating disease that has ravaged our \n     education, judicial, and health care system for far too long. \n     The amendment sets a horrible precedent and if it becomes \n     law, it would put the entire federal government on record \n     against enforcing the safeguards, which may have serious \n     consequences.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency published the \n     ``Renovate Right Rule'' to protect children from unsafe lead \n     exposure caused by renovations in older homes. Public health \n     organizations have been waiting 18 years for this rule to be \n     implemented and now Senator Collins is threatening to roll \n     back decades of lead poisoning prevention work. The rule \n     requires contractors to follow three simple procedures: \n     contain the work area, minimize dust, and clean up \n     thoroughly. This rule closes a major gap in lead poisoning \n     prevention--with only a modest $35 cost increase per \n     renovation job, according to a 2008 Bush Administration \n     analysis.\n     Please consider the following facts:\n       Lead remains the most significant environmental health \n     hazard to children, with over 250,000 children impacted. More \n     than one million children are at risk each year when homes \n     are renovated.\n       Lead is especially toxic for young children. It can cause \n     permanent brain damage, loss of IQ, behavior and memory \n     problems and reduced growth.\n       Among adults, lead exposure can result in reproductive \n     problems, high blood pressure, nerve disorders and memory \n     problems.\n\n     Countless children have suffered the consequences of lead \n     exposure due to the delays in finalizing the rule. Don't vote \n     for an amendment that will put you on record as being against \n     enforcing these important public health protections.\n           Sincerely,\n       Rebecca Morley, National Center for Healthy Housing, \n     Columbia, MD; Bill Menrath, Healthy Homes LLC, Cincinnati, \n     OH; Roberta Hazen Aaronson, Childhood Lead Action Project, \n     Providence, RI; Margie Coons, WI Division of Public Health, \n     Madison, WI; Melanie Hudson, Children's Health Forum, \n     Washington, DC; Yanna Lambrindou, Parents for Nontoxic \n     Alternatives, Washington, DC; Linda Kite, Healthy Homes \n     Collaborative, Los Angeles, CA; Shan Magnuson, Santa Rosa, \n     CA; Bay Area Get the Lead Out Coalition, CA; Fresno \n     Interdenominational Refugee Ministries, Fresno, CA; Jose A. \n     Garcia, lnquilinos Unidos, Los Angeles, CA; Rafael Barajas, \n     L.A.

Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Thank you for your interest in the \n     amendment proposed by Senator Collins that is aimed at \n     eliminating EPA's enforcement of various regulations that are \n     necessary to protect children from lead based paint \n     poisoning. The stated purpose of this amendment is to \n     ``prohibit the imposition of fines and liability under'' \n     various rules on lead paint, including the Lead Renovation, \n     Repair and Painting Rule.\n       We oppose the amendment on the grounds that it may set a \n     precedent that Congress seeks to prevent enforcement against \n     criminal actions with respect to the lead rules. The \n     amendment could be interpreted as seeking to stop EPA from \n     taking criminal enforcement action against those who \n     knowingly or willfully violate lead rules, even in egregious \n     cases causing lead poisoning in children. A real possibility \n     exists that a contractor who knowingly or willfully ignores \n     the new lead rules during a renovation would not be held \n     accountable under this language. Furthermore, such an \n     amendment could stop EPA from taking enforcement action \n     against those who improperly perform renovations. Such an \n     amendment could pose lead hazards from renovations to an \n     estimated 137,000 children under age 6 and to one million \n     individuals age 6 and older. Finally, there are 250,000 \n     people who have followed the requirements of the law to \n     become trained and certified. The amendment is inequitable \n     because it favors those who were slow to comply.\n       Overall, the amendment as written could be read as an \n     expression of the intent of Congress to block implementation \n     and enforcement of the rules on lead based paint. If you or \n     your staff have any further questions regarding our concerns \n     on the amendment, please let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stephen A. Owens,\n                                          Assistant Administrator.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think it is important to take a stand for our children. \nThis would completely shut down this important program. It would say it \nis put on hold, even in the worst circumstances.\n  The National Center for Healthy Housing sent a letter: ``Protect \nWomen, Infants and Children from Lead Poisoning--Oppose Amendment \n4253.''\n  Let me tell you, it is signed by some important organizations: The \nNational Center for Healthy Housing in Maryland; the Healthy Homes LLC, \nin Cincinnati, OH; Childhood Lead Action Project in Providence, RI; \nDivision of Public Health in Madison, WI; Children's Health Forum in \nWashington, DC; Parents for Nontoxic Alternatives, Washington, DC; \nHealthy Homes Collaborative, Los Angeles; and Bay Area Get the Lead Out \nCoalition, CA; Fresno Interdenominational Ministries in Fresno. The \nlist goes on and on, many from California.\n  Interstate Property Inspections, Inc., in Rochester, NY; Alameda \nCounty Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, Oakland, CA; Jackson, MI, a \nfacility manager says no to this amendment. The Coalition for Economic \nSurvival says no. Riverside, NJ, we have a letter from them. We have a \nletter from Kansas. We have more from Cleveland, from Minnesota, from \nFlorida, the American Management Resources Corporation; Healthy Homes \nCoalition in Michigan; Environmental Education Associates in Buffalo; \nCoalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning in Baltimore, MD. Here is an \ninteresting one. The Harry Reid Center for Environmental Studies in Las \nVegas, NV. We ought to make sure our leader knows they have taken a \nstand here.\n  The Rhode Island Lead Techs, in East Providence, and from Niagara \nCounty, Childhood Lead Poisoning Program.\n  This is where we stand. Finally, we have a rule in place, and it \nhappens to be that President Obama, when he was a Senator, pushed hard \nfor that rule. It made it through, and there has been long lead time. \nWe are ready to go.\n  Whenever there is a renovation now, and we know there is lead \ninvolved, we have to make sure somebody is trained.\n  EPA has the trainers. The fact that someone stands on the floor of \nthe Senate and says they do not flies in the face of what I read. We \nknow how many we have. We know there are many who would come on and go \nanyplace across the country. These training sessions take about 8 \nhours, and then the person is licensed to do this removal.\n  That is it. Let's not turn back the clock. Let's not go back to the \ntime that we did not know lead caused these problems. Lead is poison. \nLead is poison. We are ready to get it out of these old buildings. We \nare ready to do it, and I do not see why we should turn the clock back \nto another time and place and say we are doing it for the reason that \nthere are not enough trainers when there are enough trainers.\n  That is not right. So I will say at this time, I do not see anybody \nelse here. I hope we will vote down the Collins amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              memorial day\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on this upcoming final day in May we \nwill observe Memorial Day, and remember the men and women in uniform \nwho have loved this country and given their lives to defend it. \nMemorial Day is a time to honor their extraordinary sacrifice.\n  We have a proud tradition of service in my home State of Kentucky, \nhome to Fort Knox, Fort Campbell and many of our brave troops. Just a \nfew days ago soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division, based out of \nFort Campbell, cased their colors in preparation for deployment to \nAfghanistan. Training the local police force will be a major focus for \nthis mission, the fourth deployment for the division headquarters since \n9/11.\n  More than 10,000 men and women from the 101st are already deployed to \nAfghanistan, and by the end of August that number will reach 20,000.\n  In addition, about 3,500 soldiers from the Army's 3rd Brigade Combat \nTeam, based at Fort Knox, are preparing to deploy to Afghanistan soon, \nas are up to about 2,000 Kentucky Army and Air National Guard members.\n  Five soldiers from the 101st have died in Afghanistan since January. \nEvery soldier preparing to ship out faces that same risk, but that does \nnot deter them from duty and service. They are working to keep their \nfamilies back home and all Americans safe.\n  I have met with many of the family members of soldiers, sailors and \nmarines from Kentucky who gave their lives in service. I have let them \nknow that their loved ones will not be forgotten by this country. And \nthey are not forgotten in the U.S. Senate. We are honored to share this \nland with such brave heroes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I note that we faced a long discussion \nabout a bill that was just passed out of the Armed Services Committee. \nI, unfortunately, felt compelled to oppose it, but I appreciate working \nwith the Senator from Illinois as we discussed it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4173\n\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that we are going to vote on this \nemergency supplemental legislation, not having voted on the amendment I \noffered, along with Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, my Democratic \ncolleague. It received 59 votes a few weeks ago. It is designed to help \ncontain our rapacious tendency to spend, spend, spend. We give the \nphrase ``a drunken sailor spending'' a bad name the way we are spending \nin this Congress.\n  I had hoped we would get another vote on it. I am disappointed \nSenator\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\nReid and the leadership on the Democratic side took action to see that \na vote would not occur. I called it up very early in the process, and I \nam disappointed.\n  The amendment would have made it more difficult to break the budget \nand allowed more scrutiny for us before we violate it. The emergency \nsupplemental legislation that is before us violates the budget. Every \npenny of this is spending beyond the budget. It has items that are not \nwhat we think of as emergencies.\n  If our military men and women have a health problem and there is a \ncondition that requires us to take care of them, that takes extra \nmoney. We deal with these issues in the Armed Services Committee. But \nthat is not an emergency. Those kinds of things happen all the time. We \nare allocating $13 billion for an Agent Orange compensation plan that, \nI have to say, appears to me to not be written very tightly. Anyone who \nbasically served in Vietnam who has heart disease can apparently claim \nsome benefit under it.\n  I am not saying that is unjustified. It may be. What I will say is, \nit is not the kind of thing we should use emergency spending for when \nthe country is going in a wrong direction.\n  We will soon be voting on tax extenders. I want to send a warning out \nto my colleagues and to the people who are concerned about the state of \nthe American economy. I will quote some comments that have been said \nrecently.\n  Keith Hennessey, who is former director of the National Economic \nCouncil, wrote this:\n\n       House Democrats have modified their ``extenders'' bill and \n     appear to be bringing it to the floor for a vote today. \n     Monday's version would have increased the deficit by $134 \n     billion over the next decade. Today's version would increase \n     the deficit by $84 billion over the same timeframe. What hard \n     choices did the leaders make to cut the net deficit impact by \n     $50 billion? None. They simply extended the most expensive \n     provisions for a shorter period of time.\n       What did they do? There was a complaint they had $134 \n     billion in increased debt, and they were dealing with some \n     issues. They did not pay for them over a long enough time. \n     They just reduced it.\n\n  Mr. Hennessey goes on to say:\n\n       The new bill extends the unemployment insurance and COBRA \n     health insurance benefits through November 2010, rather than \n     December of 2010 in Monday's version.\n\n  They just reduced it one month to save a little money there and make \nthe bill look a little better. Does anyone doubt we will be coming back \nto extend it further in the future?\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       The Medicare ``doctors' fix'' would extend through 2011, \n     instead of through 2013 . . .\n\n  Which means that after this year, our physicians will be back here \ncomplaining about the impending 21, 22 percent cut in their Medicare \npayments. They do not get paid enough now. We cannot cut our physicians \n20 percent. They are going to quit practicing and stop doing Medicare \nwork.\n  What did they do when somebody said: You are increasing the debt too \nmuch? We will just pass the doctors fix through the end of this year \nand push it on to the next, instead of doing it through 2013 like they \nplanned.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office has to score the amendment \n     as written, so these two provisions are scored as ``saving'' \n     $50 billion relative to the Monday version. But just as it \n     was unreasonable to assume that the increased Medicare \n     spending for doctors would suddenly drop at the end of 2013, \n     it is similarly foolhardy it will stop [in the future]. They \n     are doing in this bill exactly what they did in the two \n     health care bills that were rammed through in March--shifting \n     some of the spending into future legislation to reduce the \n     apparent cost of the current bill.\n       Will it work again?\n\n  Well, we are going to see.\n  Mr. President, I would just make one more note. An editorial in \ntoday's New York Times titled ``Easy Money, Hard Truths'' by famous \nhedge fund manager David Einhorn, who lives and dies by Wall Street, \nmoving money, keeping up with interest rates, lays out our budget \nproblem very plainly in his column in the New York Times.\n\n       Before this recession it appeared that absent action, the \n     government's long-term commitments would become a problem in \n     a few decades. I believe the government response to the \n     recession--\n\n  And let me add, that is the extraordinary spending we have done in \nthe last few months--\n\n     has created budgetary stress sufficient to bring about the \n     crisis much sooner. Our generation--not our grandchildren's--\n     will have to deal with the consequences.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       According to the Bank for International Settlements, the \n     United States' structural deficit--the amount of our deficit \n     adjusted for the economic cycle--has increased from 3.1 \n     percent of gross domestic product in 2007 to 9.2 percent in \n     2010. This does not take into account the very large \n     liabilities the government has taken on by socializing losses \n     in the housing market. We have not seen the bills for bailing \n     out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and even more so the Federal \n     Housing Administration, which is issuing government-\n     guaranteed loans to noncreditworthy borrowers on terms easier \n     than anything offered during the housing bubble. Government \n     accounting is done on a cash basis, so promises to pay in the \n     future--whether Social Security benefits or loan guarantees--\n     do not count in the budget until the money goes out the door.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       A good percentage of the structural increase in the deficit \n     is because last year's ``stimulus'' was not stimulus in the \n     traditional sense. Rather than a one-time injection of \n     spending to replace a cyclical reduction in private demand, \n     the vast majority of the stimulus has been a permanent \n     increase in the base level of government spending--including \n     spending on government jobs.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       In 2008, according to the Cato Institute, the average \n     Federal civilian salary with benefits was $119,982, compared \n     with $59,909 for the average private sector worker; the \n     disparity has grown enormously over the last decade.\n\n  Inflation from our current high-spending culture is problematic as \nwell. According to Einhorn:\n\n       Government statistics are about the last place one should \n     look for inflation, as they are designed to not show much. \n     Over the last 35 years, government has changed the way it \n     calculates inflation several times. According to the Web site \n     Shadow Government Statistics, using the pre-1980 method, the \n     Consumer Price Index would be over 9 percent, compared with \n     about 2 percent in the official statistics today.\n\n  He goes on to say this:\n\n       At what level of government debt and future commitments \n     does government default go from being unthinkable to \n     inevitable, and how does our government think about that \n     risk? I recently posed this question to one of the \n     President's senior economic advisers.\n\n  Mr. Einhorn asked him a very tough question: Is a government default \non the horizon? Is it unthinkable or now is it on the way to being \ninevitable? And this is what Mr. Einhorn said the government adviser to \nPresident Obama said:\n\n       He answered that the government is different from financial \n     institutions because it can print money, and statistically \n     the United States is not as bad off as some countries. For an \n     investor, these promises do not inspire confidence.\n\n  So he goes on to warn about the danger of a crisis where the Treasury \nseeks to get people to buy our Treasury bills, to buy our bonds, and \nthis is what can happen. He said:\n\n       In the face of deteriorating market confidence, a rating \n     agency issues an untimely downgrade, setting off a rush of \n     sales by existing bondholders. This has been the experience \n     of many troubled corporations, where downgrades served as the \n     coup de grace. The current upset in the European sovereign \n     debt market is a prequel to what might happen here.\n\n  That is today's warning in the New York Times, and we should take it \nvery seriously.\n  The bill before us is irresponsible. It spends too much, it creates \ntoo much debt, and we should not have done it. We did not have to do \nit. And the bill that is coming up, the tax extenders, is also \nirresponsible. It spends too much money. We do not have to do it, and \nwe should not do it.\n  The American people understand this completely. They tell me about it \neverywhere I go. Are we in denial in this body? Do we think it is just \nbusiness as usual; that we can just continue to spend, spend, spend, \nborrow, borrow, borrow, and then presumably we will just print money \nand pay our debts, deflating our currency, eroding the value for the \ngood and decent people of this country who have worked hard and saved \nall their lives? This is not good. The American people are right. No \nwonder our ratings with the public are so low.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Imbalance of Regulatory Capture\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, one of my primary concerns in the debate \non\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\nWall Street reform has been that we should not write legislation that \nturns all of the major reform proposals over to the regulators. \nInstead, we should follow on the footsteps of our forebears from the \n1930s--those Senators of old who made the tough decisions and wrote \nbright-line laws which lasted for over 60 years, until they were \nrepealed. I also argued that we should not depend on regulators who had \nnot used powers they already possessed.\n  Instead, we passed a Senate bill that, in the area of bank \nregulation, primarily restates existing regulatory powers, provides \nsome general directional authority, and leaves us with the hope that \nour present regulators will devise and enforce rules that prevent \nanother financial crisis; that a systemic risk council of regulators \nwill be able to detect early warning signals of impending financial \ninstability; that the regulators will impose higher capital standards \non systemically significant banks; that the regulators will be able to \nresolve failing institutions, and so on, and so on, and so on.\n  Yesterday, a third reason for writing laws and not turning to \nregulators was brought home to me. It relates to how the Securities and \nExchange Commission is studying the incredibly unregulated growth of \nhigh-frequency trading.\n  I am deeply concerned by preliminary reports of the makeup of the SEC \npanels studying high-frequency trading after the ``flash crash'' of May \n6. On that day, the Dow Jones fell almost 1,000 points, temporarily \ncausing a $1 trillion drop in market value. I call on the SEC to make \nthose panels more balanced by adding individuals from outside Wall \nStreet who are truly sincere and knowledgeable about the further \nactions the SEC may need to take.\n  In just a few years' time, high-frequency trading has grown from just \n30 percent to 70 percent of the daily trading volumes of stocks. These \nblack box computers trade thousands of shares per second across more \nthan 50 market centers with no real transparency--no real \ntransparency--and therefore no effective regulation. If those \ningredients--no transparency, no regulation--sound familiar, it might \nbe because those are the same characteristics applied to over-the-\ncounter derivatives.\n  My concern about the opaque and unregulated nature of high-frequency \ntrading led me to write to SEC Chair Mary Schapiro last August 21, \n2009, calling for a comprehensive review of market structure issues. I \nwrote:\n\n       The current market structure appears to be the consequence \n     of regulatory structures designed to increase efficiency and \n     thereby provide the greatest benefits to the highest volume \n     traders. The implications of the current system for buy-and-\n     hold investors have not been the subject of a thorough \n     analysis. I believe the SEC's rules have effectively placed \n     ``increased liquidity'' as a value above fair execution of \n     trades for all investors.\n\n  On September 10, Chair Schapiro responded, saying she recognized the \nimportance of standing up for the interests of long-term investors and \nwould undertake a comprehensive review of market structure issues.\n  Because I had heard these concerns raised by credible voices, in a \nspeech on September 14, 2009, I predicted some of the events of last \nMay 6. At that time, I said:\n\n       Unlike specialists and traditional market-makers that are \n     regulated, some of these new high-frequency traders are \n     unregulated, though they are acting in a market-maker \n     capacity. If we experience another shock to the financial \n     system, will this new, and dominant, type of pseudo market \n     maker act in the interest of the markets when we really need \n     them? Will they step up and maintain a two-sided market, or \n     will they simply shut off the machines and walk away? Even \n     worse, will they seek even further profit and exacerbate the \n     downside?\n\n  On October 28, Senator Jack Reed convened a hearing in the securities \nsubcommittee on these issues. He graciously asked me to testify at the \nhearing, where I said in my first statement:\n\n       First, we must avoid systemic risk to the markets. Our \n     recent history teaches us that when markets develop too \n     rapidly--when they are not transparent, effectively regulated \n     or fair--a breakdown can trigger a disaster.\n\n  On November 20, I sent a letter to Chairman Schapiro summarizing some \nof the hearing testimony and called on the Commission to acted quickly \nto ``tag'' high-frequency traders and address the systemic risk they \npose. On December 3, Chairman Schapiro responded to my letter and wrote \nthat the SEC would issue a concept release in January and put forth two \nrule proposals that would, respectively, impose tagging and disclosure \nrequirements on high-frequency traders and address the risk of naked \naccess arrangements.\n  In January, the SEC did indeed issue a concept release, as well as a \nproposed rule banning naked access arrangements. Unfortunately, it was \nmonths later--April 14--before the SEC finally issued the ``large \ntrader'' rule requiring tagging of high-frequency traders. In that \nproposed rule, the SEC noted that the current data collection system is \ninadequate to recreate market events and unusual trading activity.\n  Now think about this. This was back on April 14, before the May 6 \nthing, and what she said was: In the proposed rule, the SEC noted that \nthe current data collection system is inadequate to recreate market \nevents and unusual trading activity. Is there any question why we don't \nknow yet what happened on May 6?\n  Then, on May 6, the disaster struck that I and others were worried \nabout. For 20 minutes, our stock market did not perform its central \nfunction: discovering prices by balancing buyers and sellers. And as \nthe SEC has noted--both before and after the ``flash crash''--it indeed \ndoes not have the data to discover easily the causes of the market \nmeltdown.\n  It is true that the SEC and CFTC have gone into overdrive since May \n6. Indeed, the staffs and Commissioners of both agencies have worked \nheroically around the clock to try to recreate and study the unusual \ntrading activity of that day. They have kicked into high gear and \nformed an advisory commission. They have quickly come together to \npropose two more possible rules: an industry-wide circuit breaker so \nthat if we ever again have another market ``flash crash,'' we won't see \nabsurd prices for some of our Nation's proudest company stocks, and \nalso a long overdue proposal to have a consolidated audit trail across \nmarket centers that will finally provide regulators with access to the \ninformation they need to police manipulation, understand trading \npractices, and reconstruct unusual market activity in a timely manner.\n  After weeks of helpful action by the SEC--when the industry itself \nwas helping the agencies to find band-aid solutions--now is not the \ntime to see the SEC continue with rulemaking by Wall Street consensus.\n  We may need further action, probably against the interests of those \nwho benefit from the current market design.\n  Further action only through industry-consensus is a prescription for \nno change.\n  This all brings me to why I became so concerned yesterday. As part of \nthe Commission's ongoing market structure review, the SEC has decided \nto hold a roundtable discussion on June 2--good idea.\n  I have learned preliminary reports about the make-up of the high \nfrequency trader panel.\n  Based on those reports, the panel is dramatically out of balance.\n  It appears as though it was chosen primarily to hear testimony that \nreinforces the top-line defenses of the current market structure--that \nhigh frequency trading provides liquidity and reduces spreads--rather \nthan what it should be doing, a deep dive into the problems that caused \nsevere market dislocation on May 6 and damaged our market's \ncredibility.\n  I have called on the SEC to add more participants to give the panels \nsome semblance of balance.\n  Frankly, I find the preliminary reports to be so stacked in favor of \nthe entrenched money that has caused the very problems we seek to \naddress that the panel itself stands as a symbolic failure of the \nregulators and regulatory system--that is, with the exception of a few \nbrave souls who have been invited to critique the conventional industry \nwisdom.\n  Let me read from the comment letters and statements of five of the \nexpected participants.\n  Not surprisingly, in comments to the SEC and members the industry \nmade prior to the unusual volatility of May 6, each of these five \nparticipants reported that--contrary to the concerns I and others had \nexpressed--they think the markets are running as smoothly as ever.\n  One of the expected panelists wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\n\n       [O]ver the past 18 months--since the height of the \n     financial crisis--the Commission has been very active with \n     rule making proposals. Nearly all of the issues that may have \n     contributed to diminishing investor confidence have been \n     addressed by Commission rule-making.\n\n  Ironic, after what happened on May 6.\n  That panelist also wrote:\n\n       We believe that the current national market system is \n     performing extremely well. For instance, the performance \n     during the 2008 financial crisis suggests that our equity \n     markets are resilient and robust even during times of stress \n     and dislocation.\n\n  Another expected participant wrote in an email sent widely that his \nexchange--\n\n     doesn't believe the equities markets are broken.\n       To the contrary, we would argue that the U.S. equity \n     markets were a shining model of reliability and healthy \n     function during what some are calling one of the most \n     challenging and difficult times in recent market history.\n\n  Another expected participant wrote:\n\n       Implementing any type of regulation that would limit the \n     tools or the effectiveness of automation available for use by \n     any class of investor in the name of ``fairness'' would turn \n     back the clock on the U.S. Equity market and undo years of \n     innovation and investment.\n\n  That is an interesting comment, because I have always believed that \nfairness was the hallmark and number one priority of U.S. markets. That \nis what people say. That is why people come to America. They don't come \nto invest in some casino game. Liquidity is important, but the key \nthing for our markets to be credible is fairness.\n  Another expected panelist sounded a similar note in a comment letter \nfiled before May 6.\n\n       All market regulation should be evaluated with respect to \n     its impact on the liquidity and efficiency of equity markets \n     for the benefit of investors . . . For example, certain \n     short-term traders and high frequency traders provide \n     liquidity to the markets. Although some of these short-term \n     traders may differ at times in their goals and overall \n     position vis-a-vis other types of investors, we believe, on \n     the whole, that the liquidity they provide is beneficial to \n     the markets.\n\n  I agree with that statement. Liquidity is vital to the strength and \nstability of our markets.\n  But on May 6, liquidity vanished, as some of the short-term traders \nleft the marketplace. And for those who didn't, we learned that the \nliquidity they provide was about 1/100th of an inch deep.\n  Finally, another panelist co-signed a letter stating:\n\n       We believe that any assessment of the current market \n     structure or the impacts of `high frequency trading' should \n     begin with the recognition that by virtually all measures, \n     the quality of the markets has never been better . . . .\n       The equity markets have also proven to be remarkably \n     resilient. Despite the significant stresses that occurred \n     during the recent financial crisis, U.S. equity markets \n     remained open, liquid and efficient every day, while other \n     less competitive and less transparent markets failed.\n\n  The SEC has picked one voice for the panel--Sal Arnuk of Themis \nTrading--who has been a vocal and intelligent critic of high frequency \ntrading.\n  He has valiantly raised questions about market structure and the \ntrading advantages that high frequency traders enjoy, but he is being \nasked to go up against six Wall Street insiders who will no doubt be \nprimed to argue against his position.\n  People wonder why Americans have such little faith in Washington, DC. \nTalk about a stacked deck.\n  I am particularly concerned by the upcoming SEC roundtable on high \nfrequency trading because it is reminiscent of the one that the SEC \nheld last September on ``naked'' short selling.\n  Naked short selling occurs when a trader sells a financial instrument \nshort without first borrowing it or even ensuring it can be borrowed. \nJust a reason on faith that it may be borrowed. What this means is \ntraders can sell something they do not own or have not borrowed. \nAmericans understand you cannot sell something you don't have.\n  After the SEC's repeal of the 70-year uptick rule in 2007, abusive \nshort selling facilitated the sort of self-fulfilling bear raids on \nstocks that we saw during the financial crisis.\n  Since coming to office last year, I have highlighted this serious \nproblem through a series of speeches and letters to the SEC. Along with \nseven other Senators, of both parties, I also called for pre-borrow \nrequirements and centralized ``hard locate'' system solutions.\n  In response to those concerns, the SEC held a roundtable last \nSeptember to examine these proposals.\n  Unfortunately, like the panel coming up, the panel was stacked with \nindustry representatives even though the industry had done virtually \nnothing to address what had become a glaring problem.\n  Listen to the lineup: Goldman Sachs, State Street, and the Depository \nTrust & Clearing Corporation DTCC, among others, participated.\n  Not surprisingly, these panelists were resistant to the hard-locate \nrequirement and other serious solutions, even while they generally \nacknowledged that there are bad actors who engage in naked short \nselling and don't comply with the current locate system.\n  DTCC even backed away from discussing the very proposal it had laid \nbefore the U.S. Senate.\n  I fear that an industry-stacked panel in the upcoming roundtable on \nhigh frequency trading will be more of the same and will once again \ndismiss fundamental reforms, ultimately leaving retail and long-term \ninvestors with half-measures or none at all.\n  Why? Because repeatedly we see that regulators are dependent almost \nexclusively for the information and evidence they receive about market \nproblems on the very market participants they are supposed to be \nconfronting about needed changes.\n  This is as true in other agencies--we filed the papers just last \nmonth and you can see it--like the agency charged with the oversight of \noil drilling--as it is at the SEC.\n  The regulators are surrounded--indeed they consciously choose to \nsurround themselves--by an echo chamber of industry players who are \nmaking literally billions of dollars under the current system.\n  Who speaks to the regulators on behalf of the average investor?\n  Who outside of the industry itself has access to the data that only \nthe industry controls?\n  Who other than the market players who have invested so much of their \ncapital into the very systems that profit and serve their own interests \nhas the analytical capability to lead the SEC in a different direction?\n  We must have evidenced-based rules in our system, we are told.\n  But when all the evidence comes from Wall Street, who is going to \nstop Wall Street from once again pulling the wool over the SEC's eyes?\n  The events of May 6 demonstrate that technological developments have \noutpaced regulatory understanding. If we are to ensure our markets are \nsafe from future failures--because the markets did fail their primary \nfunction on May 6th--regulators must catch up immediately.\n  Competition is critical in our markets and has led to many positive \ndevelopments. But with competition, we also need good regulation. Just \nlike we need referees on the field who will blow their whistles when \nthe game becomes rigged. In football, we don't let the players make up \nthe rules during the game.\n  So, we need action from our regulators, not negotiation. We need \nindependent leadership by the SEC, not management by consensus with \nWall Street.\n  Again, I call on the SEC to rebalance these panels. The Commission \nwill never be able to catch up if it hears mostly from those who will \nfight to maintain the status quo.\n  The SEC must hear from those who speak for long-term investors and \nothers who use our capital markets, not just from those who profit from \nhigh frequency trading.\n  The American people deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, because I was not allowed to offer my \namendment as part of the regular order, in a moment I will move to \nsuspend the rules to offer my amendment that will set a deadline to \ncomplete 700 miles of double layer fencing on our Southwest border, as \nis required by current law.\n  If any Member of the Senate stood up today and said that we should \nnot seal the oil leak in the gulf until we have a comprehensive plan to \nclean it up, we would all say that is absurd. Certainly we need to seal \nthat leak as quickly as possible to minimize the cleanup later.\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\nBut that is exactly the kind of logic the President and my Democratic \ncolleagues are using when it comes to immigration. They are insisting \nwe will not secure our borders until Republicans agree to a \ncomprehensive plan with some form of amnesty and road to citizenship \nfor those who have come here illegally. This is a debate we have had \nbefore and it was not settled here as much as it was out across \nAmerica.\n  Americans have said: Secure the border first. The big immigration \nbill we were trying to pass in 2006 failed because Americans finally \nconvinced Senators that our first job is to secure the border; \notherwise, any immigration policy is irrelevant.\n  At that time we made a promise to the American people and passed a \nlaw that we would build 700 miles of double layer fencing in areas \nwhere pedestrian traffic is the biggest problem. We have seen that \nwhere that has been implemented it has been effective. But, \nunfortunately, since 2006, even though we were promised this could be \ndone in a year or two, only 34 miles of double layer fencing has been \nbuilt since we passed this law. In other words, the Federal Government \nis ignoring its own law at the peril of the citizens in Arizona, Texas, \nand those all over the country. By not keeping our promises, by not \nenforcing the law, we have created devastation and war on our southern \nborder with Mexico.\n  Thousands of Mexicans have been killed. We encouraged drug cartels \nall over the world to ship their goods through our borders. Arms \ntrafficking, human trafficking--we have mass chaos on our border \nbecause we will not do what we know works.\n  The President is saying we have done over 90 percent of the fencing \nthat we promised, but this is the virtual fencing that the chief of \nborder security has said has been a complete failure. There are only 34 \nmiles of the 700 miles that we promised our country and put into law.\n  My amendment does not make new law. It just sets a deadline, that the \nfence we promised will be completed within the next year.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  Mr. President, I move to suspend the provisions of rule XXII, \nparagraph 2, including germaneness requirements for the purpose of \nproposing and considering my amendment, No. 4177.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order for \nSenator DeMint to be recognized. That has already happened so we don't \nhave to worry about that because he was recognized, because he has \nalready moved to suspend Senate rule XXII.\n  I appreciate his understanding and finishing his remarks as quickly \nas he did. The amendment he is offering is in regard to border fence \ncompletion. I ask the Senator, does he still need time to speak, \nadditional time?\n  Mr. DeMINT. If someone speaks against it, I will reserve 1 minute to \nrespond.\n  Mr. REID. I would like the agreement to indicate if someone speaks \nagainst the DeMint amendment, that he be entitled to equal time in \nopposition thereto.\n  I further ask unanimous consent there be no amendment in order to the \nDeMint motion to suspend; that upon the use or yielding back of the \ntime, the Senate then proceed to vote with respect to the DeMint motion \nto suspend; that if the DeMint motion to suspend is not agreed to, then \nno further amendment or motion on this subject of the DeMint motion be \nin order; that upon disposition of the DeMint motion, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Collins amendment, No. 4253, and there be 2 \nminutes of debate remaining prior to a vote in relation thereto, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled between Senators Boxer and \nCollins or their designees, with no amendment in order to the Collins \namendment; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Collins amendment; that upon \ndisposition of the Collins amendment, the Senate then consider the Burr \namendment, No. 4273, with an Inouye side-by-side amendment No. 4299; \nthat the amendments be debated concurrently for 8 minutes, equally \ndivided and controlled between Senators Inouye and Burr or their \ndesignees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote with respect to Inouye amendment No. 4299 to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to Burr amendment No. 4273; that upon \ndisposition of these two amendments, all remaining pending amendments \nbe withdrawn, with no further amendments in order except a managers' \namendment which has been cleared by the managers and leaders; and if \noffered, the amendment be considered and agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that all postcloture time be yielded \nback with no further intervening action or debate; the substitute \namendment, as amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time, and the Senate then proceed to vote on passage of the bill, \nas amended, without further intervening action or debate; that upon \npassage, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with \nthe House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with the \nAppropriations Committee appointed as conferees; provided further that \nthe cloture motion with respect to the bill be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can just say, before anyone says \nanything, if we complete this, these will be all of the votes for the \nevening and the week. We are waiting for the House to do action on the \nextenders package, a jobs bill. The latest information I have is that \nthey will not complete that until sometime late this evening. I have \nspoken to the Republican leader on several occasions. We are going to \nhave several days to take a look at this because I understand it is \ngoing to come to us in pieces, not all as one bill.\n  We will take a look at that. We will start to work on that the Monday \nwe get back. We are going to work to have a vote on that Monday we get \nback. I think it is June 7. We do not know what the vote will be on, \nbut we will have it on probably a nomination. We are trying to figure \nout what that will be. I do not think we will be ready to start any \nactual voting on the so-called extenders package.\n  The Republican leader and I have talked about that. There are certain \namendments that people have indicated they would like to offer to that. \nI think, frankly, it works better to allow people to offer amendments. \nThere is no reason to move forward on any procedural effort to curtail \nthat at this time.\n  The next work period is 4 weeks. That is all we have. We have so many \nthings to do, and we are going to do our best to get the extenders \ndone. We have a small business jobs matter that we need to move to. It \nis so important for our country's economy. We have talked about this \nfor months now.\n  We have a bipartisan food safety bill that we need to do. That would \nbe a good time to do that. And we have a number of other issues we will \ntry our best to work through as quickly as we can. I appreciate \neveryone's cooperation this week. This gives great relief to the \nPentagon. The House, that is supposed to complete their work on this \nbill today, did not.\n  So that is something we will have to take a look at, what they do, \nand get the conference completed as quickly as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The DeMint motion to suspend the rules is pending.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, pending what the House does, there will be \nsome unanimous consent requests offered on both sides as I understand. \nBut everyone should be aware of that later this evening maybe.\n  I do not have anyone here to speak on the DeMint amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has asked for \nthe yeas and nays. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be. \nIf there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \nDeMint motion to suspend the rules.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) \nand the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Chambliss).\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 45, the nays are \n52. Two-thirds of the Senators voting, a quorum being present, not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4253\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 4253, \noffered by the Senator from Maine.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified when I have 30 \nseconds remaining, which I am going to yield to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from California has misrepresented what my \namendment would do. It does not repeal or change the requirement that \nEPA has for people to be trained before they remove lead-based paint. \nBut the fact is, the EPA rolled out this new proposal, this new \nrequirement, without having the training courses available. It is not \nfair to slap huge fines on contractors when it is the EPA's fault the \nclasses have not been available. So this amendment just delays those \nfines until September 30 to allow more time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the worst natural disaster since the \nPresident took office was the recent flooding in Tennessee. There are \n13,000 painters, plumbers, carpenters in Nashville alone, who have \n11,000 structures to work on. They will get fined up to $37,500 a day \nif they disturb six square feet of lead paint in a home unless they get \nthis certificate, and there are only three EPA trainers in the entire \nState of Tennessee to train them. This is making it harder and more \nexpensive for people to get their homes fixed after the flood. Senator \nCollins has a reasonable amendment to give them until September to get \ntheir certification. Earlier today my colleague on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Senator Boxer, said that the EPA had granted a \nwaiver to Tennessee because of the President's disaster declaration for \n45 counties. Well that is true. However, the waiver means that if your \nbasement was flooded--and there was lead paint--then you could bulldoze \nthe house but not repair the basement. That's not the kind of relief we \nwere looking for in Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. President, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first, let me say to the Senator from \nTennessee, in his State all the counties that had flooding are exempt \nfrom this rule. I have the letter from the EPA, and I spoke with them \nabout it.\n  Secondly, let us not go back on this important issue. Lead is very \ndangerous, particularly for pregnant women, infants, and children. This \namendment would stop any funds in this bill from being used to enforce \nthe EPA's lead paint renovation program, which was put into place by \nPresident Bush's EPA.\n  There is a training program, and my friend from Maine says there are \nnot enough trainers. There are so many trainers that there are 119 of \nthem who are ready to travel to each and every State, and already they \nare ahead of the training. Mr. President, 360,000 people will be \ntrained in the next 2 months.\n  What this amendment does is rewards the contractors who did not get \nthe training and it hurts the others. I urge a strong ``no'' vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Amendment No. \n4253, which would prevent the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from \nenforcing its lead paint renovation rule.\n  As we all know, lead poisoning can lead to learning and behavioral \ndisorders so it is absolutely vital that all precautions are taken to \nprotect children from exposure to lead paint. EPA issued the Lead Paint \nRenovation Rule because more than one million of America's children are \nstill being poisoned by lead-based paint in their homes.\n  This new rule, which was finalized on April 22nd of this year, \nrequires that contractors receive lead paint abatement training and \ncertification from EPA to do work in certain facilities like homes, \nschools and day care centers.\n  I certainly appreciate the concerns that Senator Collins, Senator \nAlexander and other members have raised on behalf of contractors who \nhave had difficulty getting access to their required training \nparticularly in States like Tennessee that have recently experienced \nnatural disasters.\n  Two weeks ago when the Committee marked up this bill, I committed to \nSenators Collins and Alexander that my staff and I would work with \nthem, and with EPA, to see if their concerns could be addressed.\n  Our staffs worked with EPA for several days, but unfortunately, we \nwere not able to come to an agreement regarding an administrative \nsolution to this problem. However, I want to emphasize that EPA has \ngotten the message that Members are concerned, and they are taking \nsteps to improve the situation.\n  EPA had already indicated in an April 20, 2010 memorandum that it \ndoes not plan to take enforcement actions against firms who applied for \ncertification before the rule took effect on April 22nd and are just \nwaiting for their paperwork to be approved.\n  Now they are focusing on making more training opportunities \navailable. An estimated 250,000 contractors have already been trained, \nand EPA has committed to help make additional training classes \navailable in under-represented areas and areas affected by natural \ndisasters so that contractors in those areas aren't unduly impacted by \nthis rule.\n  EPA is also working to increase the number of training providers. As \nof May 19th, there were 223 accredited providers offering lead paint \nabatement training across the country, including 119 providers that \ntravel to multiple States.\n  EPA tells me that 238 additional training providers have also applied \nto become accredited. When approved, these trainers will more than \ndouble the nation's training capacity.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues continue to be concerned that \nEPA still has not done enough. However, this amendment is not the \nsolution we are looking for.\n  Supporters of this amendment have portrayed it as a common-sense \nsolution that simply allows contractors additional time to get lead \npaint abatement training required by the rule.\n  In reality, passing this amendment would put the United States Senate \non record as supporting efforts to prevent EPA from fining those who \nknowingly violate the provisions of the rule--even if those actions \nresult in lead poisoning of children.\n  A contractor who willfully takes no precautions to contain or confine \nlead contaminated paint chips would be given a reprieve. I am also \nconcerned that this amendment could excuse renovators from complying \nwith the most basic containment and cleanup measures.\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\n  I appreciate the concerns that my colleagues have raised. But this \namendment is simply a bridge too far. Loosening protections against \nchildhood lead poisoning is the wrong message to send.\n  That is why the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, \nLisa Jackson, and the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment and \nPublic Works, Senator Boxer, oppose this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing this amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Under the previous order, there will be 8 \nminutes of debate equally divided to run concurrently on amendment No. \n4273 to be offered by the Senator from North Carolina and amendment No. \n4299 to be offered by the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 4299 and 4273\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on May 7, Secretary Shinseki sent a letter \ninforming me that the Department underestimated the number of eligible \nFilipino veterans, especially those who have become U.S. citizens, in \ncalculating the amount needed for this program. More than 42,000 \napplications were received. Based on the actual applications received \nbefore the deadline, the Department has recalculated the estimates and \nidentified a shortfall of $67 million.\n  The provision included in this supplemental does not cost a dime. It \nsimply allows any savings, currently unobligated and not assigned to \nany ongoing project, which the VA realizes is the result of a favorable \ncontract environment, to be transferred to the Filipino Veterans Equity \nCompensation Fund and/or retained for authorized major medical facility \nprojects of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It does not mandate \nthis transfer. It simply gives the VA the flexibility should the \nDepartment want to transfer the funds for these purposes.\n  Just a reminder: In July of 1941 President Roosevelt invited the \nFilipinos to volunteer and join the American forces, and 470,000 \nvolunteered. In March of 1942 this Congress passed a law stating that \nFilipinos who volunteered may, after the war, apply for citizenship and \nreceive all the benefits of American citizenship. In March of 1946 this \nCongress reneged and repealed that law.\n  We must fulfill this commitment the country made to the Filipino \nveterans who fought so bravely under our command because to deny the VA \nauthority to transfer to this account would renege on our commitment \nand would send a dangerous signal that the Senate may not honor past \nand future commitments to veterans.\n  Is the amendment up for consideration?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It needs to be called up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4299\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 4299.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4299.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To allow unobligated balances in the Construction, Major \nProjects account to be utilized for major medical facility projects of \n    the Department of Veterans Affairs otherwise authorized by law)\n\n       On page 41, line 14, insert before the colon the following: \n     ``or may be retained in the `Construction, Major Projects' \n     account and used by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for \n     such major medical facility projects (as defined under \n     section 8104(a) of title 38, United States Code) that have \n     been authorized by law as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate''.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4273\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Burr] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4273.\n\n  Mr. BURR. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike section 901, relating to the transfer of amounts to \n            the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund)\n\n       On page 41, strike lines 10 through 24.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I have deep respect for the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. He said earlier this afternoon that President \nRoosevelt made a promise. I can tell my colleagues I had my staff go to \nthe Roosevelt Library. We didn't just leave it up to the study done by \nthe Senate. We can find no promise--no promise by President Roosevelt, \nno promise by General MacArthur, no promise by individuals who were \nintricately involved in the commitments at the end of the Second World \nWar in the Pacific. In fact, we did take care of those Filipinos who \nserved as scouts for the U.S. services, and they got full VA benefits.\n  What we are talking about--and this is not the purpose of this \ndiscussion--is a continuation, an addition to the Filipino equity fund. \nTwo years ago we passed legislation creating that fund. We appropriated \n$198 million, and we allowed 1 year from the enactment for any Filipino \nwho wanted to claim to, in fact, put in an application. That deadline \nwas February 16. At the end of December, my staff talked to the VA, and \nthey had obligated under $100 million.\n  The legislation at the time required the Secretary of the VA to \nsubmit in the President's budget this year a detailed report of the \nnumber of applications and, more importantly, a breakdown of how much \nmoney and to whom it went. That was not supplied in the President's \nsubmission to Congress.\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\n  When the President's budget came, the President's budget said they \nneeded $188 million, $10 million short of the $198 million we had \nalready appropriated. Now out of the clear blue sky, Secretary Shinseki \nsent a letter to the Appropriations Committee chairman and said: We \nneed another $67 million. Well, the deadline was February 16, before \nthe President's budget was constructed. There was no explanation as to \nwhat it is going to be used for and no understanding of to whom this \nmoney goes.\n  I want my colleagues to listen. What my amendment does is strike this \nfrom the bill. What Senator Inouye's amendment does is give the \nSecretary the option to leave the money where it is or to divert the \nmoney to the Philippine equity fund. I will assure my colleagues the \nSecretary will divert it. Where does it come from? It comes from \nalready appropriated money that is in the construction fund at the VA \nfor hospitals, for outpatient clinics, for national cemeteries, and for \nthe maintenance of the facilities for our veterans.\n  This is wrong. If there is an obligation we have to keep, it is to \nour veterans--ones who rely on the best facilities to deliver care to \nthem.\n  Once again, I ask my colleagues to vote against the Inouye amendment \nand vote for the Burr amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the Inouye amendment No. 4299.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \nchairman, Mr. Inouye, and vice chairman, Mr. Cochran, of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, as well as my colleague from Tennessee, Mr. \nAlexander.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who have recognized the needs of Rhode \nIsland, which is struggling to overcome the effects of the worst \nflooding in centuries in midst of the worst economic environment in \ngenerations. Indeed, Rhode Island was among the first States to sink \ninto recession. In the last 2 years it has consistently ranked among \nthe top three States in unemployment, with as much as 13 percent of the \nworkforce without jobs. As my colleagues know, Rhode Island has been \nfortunate for many decades until now to have avoided the kind of major \nnatural disaster damage that has affected so many other States. When \nthose disasters have occurred in other States, there has been no \nquestion about the support of the people of Rhode Island or our State's \ncongressional delegation for Federal disaster assistance. I am grateful \nthat in the midst of challenging fiscal environment that the committee, \non a bipartisan basis has included assistance for flood-impacted \nStates, specifically Rhode Island and Tennessee. I am particularly \ngrateful for the inclusion of additional community development block \ngrant, CDBG, and economic development assistance, EDA, grant funding, \nalong with a reduction of the non-Federal cost share for FEMA \nassistance. I also appreciate the challenge of including this funding \nwhile trying to stay within the President's top-line request for \nemergency funding. In the past, the committee has had greater \nflexibility in responding to emergencies, including in 2008 when over \n$20 billion was provided to States with major disasters in that year. \nGiven the comparatively limited funding available, I would like to ask \nthe chairman and vice chairman to help clarify the intent of the \nfunding included in the underlying bill, specifically that the intent \nwith respect tothe CDBG and EDA funding provided in the bill is to \nassist hard-hit communities in Rhode Island and Tennessee. I would\n\n[[Page S4506]]\n\nask my colleagues for their support in maintaining this position in \nnegotiations with the House on the final package.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island is correct \nabout the intent of the funding provided here. As the Senator knows, \nthe Appropriations Committee's capacity to provide additional funding \nfor disaster recovery is constrained by the President's top-line number \nfor emergency supplemental appropriations. Given the relatively modest \nfunding available in comparison to previous disaster supplemental \nappropriations bills, the intent is to focus CDBG and EDA assistance on \nRhode Island and Tennessee, where the underlying economic need is \ngreatest. We will work to clarify and maintain that position during \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I concur with the chairman. The scale of \nneed in both States is significant. While I know the committee would \nhave liked to accommodate a greater amount of funding for Tennessee and \nRhode Island, as well as other States, the need to stay within the top-\nline number in the administration's request has limited the amount of \nfunding available. Given the limited funding available, it is \nappropriate to focus on States where the underlying economic need is \ngreatest, and I will work to maintain the position described by the \nchairman.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the vice \nchairman for their comments and their work on this bill, particularly \nthe assistance they have worked to provide to my state. As my \ncolleagues know, the amount of property damage in Tennessee may be more \nthan $10 billion and is the worst natural disaster since President \nObama has been in office. While the funding in this bill is important \nand significant for Tennessee and Rhode Island, it represents only the \nbeginning of what is needed in my state, and I ask for the chairman and \nvice chairman's continuing support for additional funding for recovery \nefforts in Tennessee.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his \ncomments, and we will continue to work with him and the Senator from \nRhode Island to help address the needs of their States.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and vice chairman \nfor their commitment and the assistance they have already extended to \nmy State in this bill.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank also my colleagues for their \nassistance and look forward to working with them to secure passage of \nthis important bill.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 4251, as modified\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my as \nmodified amendment No. 4251 to printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This authority is not intended to be used to support site \ndevelopment or construction of permanent consulates or other such \nfacilities.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a heinous crime that \noccurred in El Salvador that has yet to be solved. On June 18, 2009, \nGustavo Marcelo Rivera, an activist and community leader from the city \nof San Isidro, Cabaas, was kidnapped. His tortured remains were found \non July 1 at the bottom of a dry well in the village of Agua Zarca. The \ncause of death apparently was asphyxiation, and evidence reportedly \nindicated that his kidnappers may have kept him alive for several days \nbefore murdering him.\n  It is my understanding that four suspects, gang members, have been \nidentified by the Attorney General's office as key suspects in the \ncrime. Apparently, the prosecutor's hypothesis is that Mr. Rivera was \nwith these gang members and was killed after a heated argument; in \nother words, that his death was a common crime, not a political \nassassination.\n  There is reason to suspect otherwise. Mr. Rivera was a well known \ncommunity leader. He was the founder and director of the Casa de la \nCultura in San Isidro, a member of the departmental board of the FMLN \nparty, and the director of the Association of Friends of San Isidro \nCabaas. He had been a defender of the environment, and he was outspoken \nin his opposition to industrial mining by the Canadian mining company \nPacific Rim in San Isidro. In addition, I am informed that during the \nJanuary 2009 municipal elections, Mr. Rivera and other leaders \ndenounced suspected electoral fraud in his municipality. As a result of \nhis activism, Mr. Rivera was the target of threats and accusations and \nsomeone reportedly tried to run over him with a car. In addition, the \nbrutal manner in which he was tortured and killed suggests that this \nwas a premeditated crime that may have been intended as a warning to \nother community activists.\n  Crimes like this are all too common in El Salvador today, and they \nconcern not only the Salvadoran people but those of us who follow \ndevelopments in that country. Rarely are competent investigations \nperformed, and almost never is anyone convicted and punished. Impunity \nis the norm.\n  I urge the Attorney General to conduct a thorough, transparent, and \ncredible investigation to ensure that not only those who tortured and \nkilled Mr. Rivera are brought to justice, but anyone who may have \nordered such a heinous crime is also prosecuted and punished. Democracy \nis fragile in El Salvador and it cannot survive without a functioning \njustice system and responsible judicial authorities who have the \npeople's confidence.\n  I have strongly supported assistance for El Salvador. In the \nsupplemental appropriations bill we have been debating this week, I \nincluded $25,000,000 for El Salvador to help rebuild schools, roads, \nand other infrastructure that was damaged or destroyed during Hurricane \nIda last November. Some 150 Salvadorans lost their lives in that \ndisaster. Those funds were not requested by the President in the \nsupplemental bill. I included them because I felt we should help El \nSalvador rebuild.\n  But I also feel strongly about justice in El Salvador, whose people \nsuffered from years of civil war during the 1980s. Human rights \ndefenders, journalists, and community activists are increasingly \nthreatened and killed. How the Rivera case is resolved will be a \nmeasure of whether the Government of El Salvador is serious about \ndefending the rights of its citizens who courageously speak out against \ninjustice, and upholding the rule of law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As the majority struggles in an attempt to pass another \nmassive deficit spending bill through Congress, biodiesel plants in \nIowa and 42 other States continue to lay off workers because the \nDemocratic-controlled Congress has not extended the biodiesel tax \ncredit. This is a simple and noncontroversial tax extension that will \nlikely reinstate more than 20,000 jobs nationwide and about 2,000 jobs \nin my State of Iowa alone.\n  These jobs have fallen victim to a tactic used by the Democratic \nleadership to hold this popular and noncontroversial tax provision \nhostage to out-of-control deficit spending here in Washington.\n  This past February I worked out a bipartisan compromise with Chairman \nBaucus to extend the expired tax provisions, including the biodiesel \ntax credit. However, the Senate majority leader decided to put \npartisanship ahead of job security for thousands of workers, and that \ncompromise did not move ahead.\n  So I am here again to try to put thousands of Americans back to work \nproducing a very clean and renewable fuel. Therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent to proceed to H.R. 4853; that my substitute, which contains a \n1-year extension of the biodiesel and renewable diesel tax credits for \nall of the year 2010, be agreed to, and the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and it is \nnot with great pleasure, I object to the request offered by my good \nfriend from Iowa. This provision he is seeking unanimous consent about \nis one of the provisions in the larger tax extenders bill that the \nHouse is working on and attempting to pass tonight. They are laboring \nmightily but so far have not been able to pass the extenders job \nlegislation that would contain the provision mentioned by the Senator \nfrom Iowa. This is the tax credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel. \nIt has created jobs. It is a good provision.\n  I might say to my friend, the jobs are now lost because it expired. \nIt expired the end of last year. We will extend this provision. We \nshould extend it and we will extend it. We are not able to extend it \ntonight by itself. Why? Because many other Senators have specific \nprovisions in the job extenders legislation that are particularly \napplicable to their States.\n  One I am particularly interested in is the property tax deduction, \nirrespective of whether the taxpayer itemized his or her deductions.\n  There will be a time, when we get back after the recess, to try to \nget these provisions passed so jobs are created. But we have to do it \ntogether as a package. We can't do it singly, separately, tonight. I \nwant to tell my good friend from Iowa I will work with him when we get \nback after the recess. For the time being I feel obliged to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4507-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4507-S4509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on the Executive Calendar, I ask unanimous \nconsent the Senate proceed to executive session to consider en bloc \nExecutive Calendar Nos. 427, 493, 494, 688, 500, 501, 521, 556, 581, \n588, 589, and a number of others that the minority, I am sure, is aware \nof, and it includes all nominations on the Secretary's desk in the Air \nForce, Army, Foreign Service, Marine Corps and Navy--these are military \npeople waiting to get their increases in rank. They have all been \ncleared and they need to be cleared so they can get their increases in \nrank--that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to \nreconsider be laid on the table en bloc, that no further motions be in \norder, that any statements relating to the nominations be printed in \nthe Record, that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction and the Senate resume legislative session.\n  These are nominees, as I said. First of all, they are military people \nwaiting for their increase in rank. But it is also people such as Brian \nHayes, a member of the NLRB; Mark Pearce, member of the NLRB, et \ncetera, et cetera.\n  Craig Becker, member of the NLRB; Anthony Coscia, Amtrak board of \ndirectors; Mark Rosekind, member of the NTSB. Here is David Lopez, \ngeneral counsel of the EEOC. Here is Michael Punke, Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative; Islam Siddiqui, Chief Ag Negotiator for the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative; Jeffrey Moreland, director of Amtrak; Carolyn Radelet, \nDeputy Director of the Peace Corps; Lana Pollack, Commissioner of U.S. \nInternational Joint Commission for the U.S. and Canada. And there are a \nnumber of others. I will not go through them all. They are a number of \npeople who need to be in place to make our government work and run. \nThat is who we are trying to ask unanimous consent that we can get them \nconfirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my good friend from \nIowa, the majority leader and I have been working on a package of \nnominations. Unfortunately, we are snagged over one particular \nnomination which has already been defeated by the Senate, and that was \nthe nomination of Craig Becker to be on the NLRB. The President then \nrecessed Mr. Becker and recessed a Democratic nomination to the NLRB \nbut not a Republican nominee to the\n\n[[Page S4508]]\n\nNLRB. There is a fundamental lack of equity and fairness involved, and \nthat has been a significant hindrance in coming to a consent agreement.\n  Obviously, before we leave we will clear the military nominations. \nThose are really not in dispute. But typically what happens here before \na recess, the majority leader and I get together and we try to work out \nas many of these as we can. To just clear the whole calendar involves, \nin addition, clearing judges who just got out of committee this week. \nWe have a way that we sequence those who have been acceptable to both \nsides.\n  In short, I have not seen every single name on the list of the \nSenator from Iowa, but it is simply not the way we are going to go \nforward, certainly not this evening.\n  Accordingly, I would now ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider en bloc the following list of \nnominations that I will send to the desk. This is a list of \napproximately 60 nominations from the Executive Calendar.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed en \nbloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Kentucky, fairness and equity? \nOK. Let's talk about fairness and equity. Let's talk about this. Mr. \nBecker was brought up in our committee last fall, along with Mark \nPearce and Mr. Brian Hayes. They all went through our committee--\nbipartisan. Mr. Enzi, the ranking Republican on our committee, voted \nfor that, and so did the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski.\n  The names were then forwarded to the Senate. They came to the Senate, \nand the leadership on the Republican side decided to filibuster--\ndecided to filibuster. We had an agreement to move this package forward \non the National Labor Relations Board.\n  Fairness and equity? Since 1985, we have never had a hearing for a \nmember to be on the National Labor Relations Board who wasn't nominated \nfor Chair because when the Republicans were in power, they would have \ntheir people, we would have ours, we would agree, and they would go \nthrough. That is what we did last fall with Mr. Becker and Mr. Pearce \nand Mr. Hayes. And I thought things were fine. That is the way we have \nalways done things. We agreed. We came out on the floor. And then the \nRepublican leadership decided to filibuster--decided to filibuster.\n  Well, what happened then was that at the end of the year--I want to \nset the record straight here--what happens is at the end of the last \nsession, there is always a unanimous consent to carry over the \ncalendar, the Executive Calendar, from one session to the next.\n  One Senator, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, objected to Mr. \nBecker. Under the rules of the Senate, then Mr. Becker had to go back \nto the White House and get renominated and sent back to the Senate.\n  The Republicans asked for a hearing on Mr. Becker. Now, mind you, we \nhave never had a hearing on one of these people since 1985. As the \nchair of the relevant committee, I did not have to have a hearing. But \nI decided, Mr. Becker has nothing to hide. He is willing to confront \nand answer all questions in open session. So I agreed to have a \nhearing.\n  I could have had a hearing on Mr. Hayes, also, the Republican, but I \nsaid: No, we do not have to do that.\n  So I had a hearing. We brought Mr. Becker before the committee, in \nopen session, to answer any questions anyone asked him. If I am not \nmistaken, I think only three people showed up to ask him questions. But \nwhat they did is they submitted questions in writing. The Republicans \nsubmitted 440 written questions to Mr. Becker, almost twice what they \ndid for Justice Sotomayor going on the Supreme Court. There were 440 \nwritten questions, and Mr. Becker obliged and answered all of those \nquestions. Well, the Republicans still objected--still objected.\n  Now the minority leader says he failed a vote in the Senate. That is \nnot true because there was a filibuster. We needed 60 votes to overcome \nthe filibuster. When we brought up Mr. Becker's name, he got 52 votes \non the Senate floor. Quite frankly, he would have had more, but there \nwere several Senators who were absent because of weather conditions. I \nknow who said on the Record that they would have supported him. So it \nis not quite right when the minority leader says Mr. Becker did not get \napproved on the Senate floor. He did. He just could not get the 60 \nvotes to overcome the Republican filibuster.\n  So, again, you know, Mr. Becker is well qualified. Even my Republican \ncolleagues freely admitted that in the committee, that he was well \nqualified. Do you know what their objection was? He comes from a union \nbackground. He comes from a union background. To the Republicans, that \nis a mortal sin. Well, if you are Catholic, you know what that means. \nThat is a mortal sin. That is unforgivable to Republicans to have a \nunion background.\n  As I said, he was willing to answer any questions. He did, in \nwriting. I have heard nothing--nothing from the Republican side \npointing to some answer he gave that would disqualify him from being on \nthe NLRB. They have simply drawn a line in the sand and said that \nbecause he has a union background, they are not going to support him \nand they are going to filibuster.\n  So here we are. We wanted to get through all of those nominations \ntonight. I read some of them. I did not read them all. Ambassador to \nthe Slovak Republic, Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Ambassador \nto Niger, Deputy Director of the Peace Corps--they will not let them go \nthrough. Why? Because of one person--Mr. Becker--who has a union \nbackground and they do not want him on the NLRB.\n  Well, Mr. Becker has a recess appointment. He did get a recess \nappointment from the President. But they will not let him get a full \nappointment by the President. And they are willing to stop everything, \nstop every nomination because of their objections to Craig Becker even \nthrough Craig Becker got 52 votes here on the Senate floor.\n  So when the minority leader talks about fairness and equity, well, I \nthink the fairness and equity is on this side of the aisle on this one. \nI am sorry to say that a lot of these people will not get their \nnominations. But, again, the Republicans do not care. They do not care. \nThey would just as soon the government stop everything.\n  Do they care whether we have enough people in the Peace Corps to run \nthe Peace Corps? They do not care. Do they care whether we have an \nAmbassador to the Slovak Republic? They do not care. Do they care if we \nhave members on the TVA, the Tennessee Valley Authority, board of \ndirectors? Obviously not. They have been holding up these nominees for \na long time. This is not the first time they have held up these \nnominees.\n  So fairness and equity? Well, I wish the minority side would show a \nlittle fairness and equity when it comes to decency and to abiding by \nagreements. We had an agreement. We had an agreement to move these \npeople through as a package. We did that in committee. That agreement \nwas broken by the Republicans, not by the Democrats.\n  I am sorry to have to take this time on the floor to correct my \nfriend from Kentucky on fairness and equity, but I think the public has \na right to know why we are where we are right now and who is \nresponsible for the fact that we cannot get nominations through here on \nthe Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was trying to get down here when Senator Harkin was \ncompleting his remarks, to join him, because I am as concerned as he is \nabout the impact of these nominations that still remain on our \nExecutive Calendar here at the Senate.\n\n[[Page S4509]]\n\n  This publication comes out on a daily basis to tell us which \nnominations have been sent to the floor of the Senate by the \ncommittees. They do not reach the floor of the Senate until a process \nis followed which involves nomination by the President of the United \nStates, an investigation of the nominee by agencies of the government \nand by our committees, and then consideration of those nominees.\n  Many committees have hearings where the nominees are called before \nthem. Questions can be asked. They certainly are in the Judiciary \nCommittee where I serve. Then, at the end of the day the committee \ndecides whether to submit this nominee's name for the consideration of \nthe full Senate.\n  So the fact that Senator Harkin came to the floor this evening is an \nindication of the frustration many of us feel about what has happened.\n  So far since President Obama took office last year, the Senate has \nhad rollcall votes on 51 nominations. There are others who have been \napproved without rollcalls. But of those 51 nominations which were \nsubjected to rollcall votes, 22 were confirmed with more than 90 votes \nand 18 were confirmed with 70 votes or more. That means that almost 80 \npercent of those nominees have passed with overwhelming support.\n  Many of those votes took place after lengthy delays. In other words, \nthese men and women who agreed to serve our Nation and to serve the \nPresident and made personal sacrifices to do that went through the long \nand arduous process, made it to the Senate calendar, and then had to \nwait. On average, the President's nominees have languished on this \nSenate calendar for over 105 days, with many taking much longer; more \nthan 3 months for those who were sent to the Senate floor. I know \nbecause some of these nominees are people I have met and worked with, \neven people I have recommended to the President. It is an uneasy \nfeeling to be nominated, to be waiting for your opportunity to serve in \npositions large and small, and then to be told, day after weary day, \nthat the Senate just did not get around to it.\n  This week the Executive Calendar contains more than 107 names of \nnominees. More than 85 percent of those nominees came through the \ncommittee process with overwhelming support. Point of comparison for \nthose who will say: The Republicans may be playing games now with \nnominations, but I am sure you Democrats did the same thing to \nPresident Bush.\n  Not true. At this time in President George W. Bush's Presidency, \nthere were exactly 13 nominees on the calendar. There are over 107 \nnominees on the calendar at this moment. There is no comparison.\n  It is time for the Republicans to stop abusing the Senate's \nresponsibility to provide advice and consent on the President's well-\nqualified nominees. If I take a look at some of these nominees, it is \ntroubling because they are overwhelmingly qualified for the jobs for \nwhich they have been recommended.\n  The Illinois nominees currently on the calendar include Craig Becker \nto be a member of the National Labor Relations Board. He was recess-\nappointed after waiting for 16 weeks on the calendar. Mary Smith to be \nAssistant Attorney General, she has been on the calendar for more than \n16 weeks. Gary Scott Feinerman, to be U.S. district judge for the \nNorthern District of Illinois, has been waiting 6 weeks. He is a man \neminently qualified who was passed out of the Judiciary Committee by \nvoice vote. Sharon Johnson Coleman, another nominee from Illinois to be \nU.S. district judge, again approved by voice vote unanimously, has been \nsitting on the calendar for 6 weeks. Robert Wedgeworth to be a member \nof the National Museum and Library Services Board, has been waiting for \n4 weeks; Carla D. Hayden, to be a member of the National Museum and \nLibrary Services Board, another 4 weeks; and Darryl McPherson, who we \nwould like to have serve as a U.S. marshal in the Northern District of \nIllinois. He was just sent to the calendar. This is an indication. In \nthe Northern District of Illinois, several years ago, we had the tragic \nmurder of the family of a U.S. district court judge. So when we talk \nabout filling the position of U.S. marshal in that particular district, \nit is because we know that there is a vulnerability for the men and \nwomen serving the government as judges, a vulnerability which resulted \nin a tragedy for one of our more celebrated and liked Federal judges in \nChicago.\n  Why would we hold up this man's nomination? Wouldn't we want the U.S. \nmarshal in place doing his job? It is an important responsibility \nadministratively, but it is equally important to protect the men and \nwomen in the judiciary. Why would we want to delay that when we have \nbeen through the tragic murder of a family in the Northern District of \nIllinois?\n  That is why I wanted to join Senator Harkin. We are leaving now for a \nlittle over a week over Memorial Day. Many of us will be back home for \nMemorial Day, then moving around in different places. This calendar \nwill sit here for another 10 or 12 days. The men and women whose names \nare in nomination will wait another 12 days or 2 weeks before they can \nbe considered. In the meantime, their lives are on hold. Their service \nto our country is delayed. The President's ability to put his team \ntogether has been diminished by this strategy from the Republican side.\n  Tonight Senator Harkin tried to move 51 of these nominees. Senator \nMcConnell objected. It is unfortunate, truly unfortunate, that we don't \nstep forward and give these men and women a chance to serve the \ngovernment and give the President a chance to have those in place who \nwill make his administration complete.

Mr. President, as the Senate recesses for Memorial Day, I \nwish the Republican leadership had worked with us to clear the \nnominations that have been pending on the calendar for far too long. \nThere is now a backlog of 26 judicial nominees awaiting final Senate \naction. Nineteen of the 26 were reported by the Judiciary Committee \nwithout a single negative vote from any Republican or any Democratic \nSenator on the committee. There is no reason, nor is there any excuse, \nfor the Senate not having promptly considered and confirmed those \njudicial nominees. Two other nominations received only one or as few as \nfour negative votes. That means that six of the seven Republicans voted \nin favor of Judge Wynn to the Fourth Circuit, and nearly half the \nRepublicans on the committee supported Jane Stranch's nomination to the \nFourth Circuit, as does Senator Alexander. Still Republicans refuse to \nenter into time agreements on those nominations, the four others or, \nfor that matter, any of the 26 judicial nominations they are stalling \nfrom consideration and confirmation.\n  The Senate is well behind the pace I set for President Bush's \njudicial nominees in 2001 and 2002. By this date in President Bush's \nPresidency, the Senate had confirmed 57 of his judicial nominees. \nDespite the fact that President Obama began sending us judicial \nnominations 2 months earlier than President Bush had, the Senate has \nonly confirmed 25 of his Federal circuit and district court nominees to \ndate.\n  Federal judicial vacancies remain over 100 around the country. Yet 26 \njudicial nominations considered and favorably reported by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee remain stalled awaiting final Senate action. The \nSenate should vote on all of them without further obstruction or delay.\n  Before the Memorial Day recess in 2002, there were only six judicial \nnominations reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee and awaiting \nfinal consideration by the Senate. They had all been reported within \nthe last week before the recess began. This year, by contrast, \nRepublicans have stalled nominations reported as long ago as last \nNovember. Only one of the 26 was reported close to this recess. The \nothers, more than two dozen, have all been languishing without final \naction because of Republican obstruction. This is not how the Senate \nshould act, nor how the Senate has conducted its business in the past. \nThis is new and it is wrong.\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Joseph Flynn, a \nconstituent and friend, on the occasion of his 90th birthday. It has \noften been said that our Greatest Generation is comprised of those \nAmericans who pulled the country out of the depths of the Great \nDepression and went on to lead the Allies to victory in World War Two. \nMy friend Joe Flynn is a quintessential member of that generation. One \nof 11 children born to immigrant parents in Chicago, he exemplifies the \nvirtues of love of family, devotion to country, generosity to \nneighbors, and unstinting hard work.\n  Growing up in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood, the guiding light of \nJoe's life was his mother, Mary. She instilled in him the moral \nfoundation that continues to guide him to this very day. Joe began his \nworking life while still a boy, hawking newspapers on Chicago street \ncorners and stocking shelves in the neighborhood grocery store. When \nJoe was just out of his teens, he, like so many other young men of his \ntime, faced the prospect of his country going to war and calling on him \nto do his part.\n  Except Joe didn't wait for his country to call--he enlisted in the \nArmy 2 months before the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  Joe spent the next 4 years in the Army serving as a medic in the \n941st Field Artillery. His unit landed on Omaha Beach shortly after D-\nday, was among the first American units to enter a liberated Paris, and \nsaw action at the Battle of the Bulge.\n  Despite all that, Joe--never one to complain--says that he had an \neasy war. His opinion is that the American men and women in uniform \ntoday are the ones with the tough duty. They are the ones that this old \nsoldier respects.\n  Coming home to a country at peace, Joe married his girlfriend, Martha \nTampa, herself a veteran of the Women's Army Corps. They raised six \nchildren: Tim, Joe, Anne, Martha, Deborah and Kevin. Joe and Martha had \nbeen married for more than 57 years when Martha passed away, but if you \nask Joe, he will no doubt tell you she is still very much alive in his \nheart.\n  To provide for his family, Joe worked at the A. Finkl & Sons steel \nmill. He supervised the loading of multiton pieces of machined steel \nonto trucks to keep America's industrial base supplied. He rose at 4:30 \na.m. to take a CTA bus to his job, and he often worked 60 hours or more \nto earn the precious overtime money his family needed to pay for their \nmortgage, their groceries, and their education.\n  As hard as Joe worked, when he got off the bus at night, he would run \na half mile home because he couldn't wait to see his family. After \ngreeting Martha and his kids, he would sit down and call his mother.\n  The people Joe loves are everything to him, and he now has nine \ngrandchildren and two great-grandchildren: Ryan, Meghan, Gwyneth, \nGillian, Dylan, Ashley, Brittney, Courtney, Caitie, Ethan and Oliver. \nHe also holds dear his children's spouses and significant others: Doug, \nCatherine and Bill.\n  Joe's politics are simple. Being a lifelong working man--who still \nmows his own lawn and cleans his own gutters--he believes that the \nworking men and women of the United States deserve their fair share of \nthe country's prosperity in the good times and its help in the hard \ntimes.\n  History doesn't often record people like Joe as being great men, but \nas his family will tell you, he is the greatest example of a good man \nthey know.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4510-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4510-S4511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SANCTIONS ON IRAN\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on May 25, Robert Kagan, a senior associate \nat the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote a column in \nthe Washington Post explaining that Russia's recent agreement to \ntighten sanctions on Iran is not as significant as the Obama \nadministration has claimed.\n  Dr. Kagan wrote that the Obama administration paid a high price to \nget Russia to agree to ``another hollow U.N. Security Council \nresolution'' and that the Russians ``sometimes used to say and do \nmore'' during the Bush administration. It is unclear to me what the \nadministration can point to as the fruits of the Russia reset, at least \nas far as the United States is concerned.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Dr. Kagan's column \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 25, 2010]\n\n                      A Hollow `Reset' With Russia\n\n                           (By Robert Kagan)\n\n       It took months of hard negotiating, but finally the \n     administration got Russia to agree to a resolution tightening \n     sanctions on Iran. The United States had to drop tougher \n     measures it wanted to impose, of course, to win approval. \n     Nevertheless, senior Russian officials were making the kinds \n     of strong statements about Iran's nuclear program that they \n     had long refused to make. Iran ``must cease enrichment,'' \n     declared Russia's ambassador to the United Nations. One \n     senior European official told the New York Times, ``We \n     consider this a very important decision by the Russians.''\n       Yes, it was quite a breakthrough--by the administration of \n     George W. Bush. In fact, this 2007 triumph came after \n     another, similar breakthrough in 2006, when months of \n     negotiations with Moscow had produced the first watered-down \n     resolution. And both were followed in 2008 by yet another \n     breakthrough, when the Bush administration got Moscow to \n     agree to a third resolution, another marginal tightening of \n     sanctions, after more negotiations and more diluting.\n       Given that history, few accomplishments have been more \n     oversold than the Obama administration's ``success'' in \n     getting Russia to agree, for the fourth time in five years, \n     to another vacuous U.N. Security Council resolution. It is \n     being trumpeted as a triumph of the administration's \n     ``reset'' of the U.S.-Russian relationship, the main point of \n     which was to get the Russians on board regarding Iran. All \n     we've heard in recent months is how the Russians finally want \n     to work with us on Iran and genuinely see the Iranian bomb as \n     a threat--all because Obama has repaired relations with \n     Russia that were allegedly destroyed by Bush.\n       Obama officials must assume that no one will bother to \n     check the record (as, so far, none of the journalists \n     covering the story has). The fact is, the Russians have not \n     said or done anything in the past few months that they didn't \n     do or say during the Bush years. In fact, they sometimes used \n     to say and do more. Here's Vladimir Putin in April 2005: ``We \n     categorically oppose any attempts by Iran to acquire nuclear \n     weapons. . . . Our Iranian partners must renounce setting up \n     the technology for the entire nuclear fuel cycle and should \n     not obstruct placing their nuclear programs under complete \n     international supervision.'' Here's one of Putin's top \n     national security advisers, Igor S. Ivanov, in March 2007: \n     ``The clock must be stopped; Iran must freeze uranium \n     enrichment.'' Indeed, the New York Times' Elaine Sciolino \n     reported that month that Moscow threatened to ``withhold \n     nuclear fuel for Iran's nearly completed Bushehr power plant \n     unless Iran suspends its uranium enrichment as demanded by \n     the United Nations Security Council''--which prompted the \n     Times' editorial page to give the Bush administration \n     ``credit if it helped Moscow to see where its larger \n     interests lie.'' Nine months later, of course, Russia \n     delivered the fuel.\n       It remains to be seen whether this latest breakthrough has \n     greater meaning than the previous three or is just round four \n     of Charlie Brown and the football. The latest draft \n     resolution tightens sanctions in some areas around the \n     margins, but the administration was forced to cave to some \n     Russian and Chinese demands. The Post reported: ``The Obama \n     administration failed to win approval for key proposals it \n     had sought, including restrictions on Iran's lucrative oil \n     trade, a comprehensive ban on financial dealings with the \n     Guard Corps and a U.S.-backed proposal to halt new investment \n     in the Iranian energy sector.'' Far from the comprehensive \n     arms embargo Washington wanted, the draft resolution does not \n     even prohibit Moscow from completing the sale of its S-300 \n     surface-to-air missile defense system to Tehran. A change to \n     the Federal Register on Friday showed that the administration \n     had lifted sanctions against four Russian entities involved \n     in illicit weapons trade with Iran and Syria since 1999, \n     suggesting last-minute deal sweeteners.\n       What is bizarre is the administration's claim that Russian \n     behavior is somehow the result of Obama's ``reset'' \n     diplomacy. Russia\n\n[[Page S4511]]\n\n     has responded to the Obama administration in the same ways it \n     did to the Bush administration before the ``reset.'' Moscow \n     has been playing this game for years. It has sold the same \n     rug many times. The only thing that has changed is the price \n     the United States has been willing to pay.\n       As anyone who ever shopped for a rug knows, the more you \n     pay for it, the more valuable it seems. The Obama \n     administration has paid a lot. In exchange for Russian \n     cooperation, President Obama has killed the Bush \n     administration's planned missile defense installations in \n     Poland and the Czech Republic. Obama has officially declared \n     that Russia's continued illegal military occupation of \n     Georgia is no ``obstacle'' to U.S.-Russian civilian nuclear \n     cooperation. The recent deal between Russia and Ukraine \n     granting Russia control of a Crimean naval base through 2042 \n     was shrugged off by Obama officials, as have been Putin's \n     suggestions for merging Russian and Ukrainian industries in a \n     blatant bid to undermine Ukrainian sovereignty.\n       So at least one effect of the administration's ``reset'' \n     has been to produce a wave of insecurity throughout Eastern \n     and Central Europe and the Baltics, where people are starting \n     to fear they can no longer count on the United States to \n     protect them from an expansive Russia. And for this the \n     administration has gotten what? Yet another hollow U.N. \n     Security Council resolution. Some observers suggest that \n     Iran's leaders are quaking in their boots, confronted by this \n     great unity of the international ``community.'' More likely, \n     they are laughing up their sleeves--along with the men in \n     Moscow.\n       Robert Kagan, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment \n     for International Peace, writes a monthly column for The \n     Post.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4511-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Memorial Day, which \nprovides us with an opportunity to take time out from our busy lives to \nremember and honor those men and women who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice to protect the United States and the liberties we hold dear.\n  Mississippians have a strong affinity for our national defense, with \nthousands of brave citizens volunteering to serve in the Armed Forces. \nWe also understand that, unfortunately, we will lose loved ones as part \nof that dedication.\n  The very first Memorial Day, originally known as Decoration Day, was \nobserved in 1868 by decorating the graves of Civil War soldiers, and \nsince then Americans have set aside a time each year to honor their \nfallen heroes.\n  Columbus, MS, proudly claims to be the birthplace of this tradition, \nbut Memorial Day wasn't officially established as a Federal holiday \nuntil 1971. In the nearly 234 years since we became an independent \nnation, Americans have fought in numerous wars, and many have given \ntheir lives in defense of the ideals that the United States represents.\n  As we gather this year to commemorate Memorial Day, we can reflect on \nall of the Mississippians who have perished protecting our Nation, \nwhether in battles long ago or in the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  Since the start of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom almost 10 years ago, more than 70 members of the Armed Forces \nwith close ties to Mississippi have died fighting in the wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Since Memorial Day last year, nine Mississippi \nsoldiers have died while serving the American people. Those valiant men \ninclude LCpl. Phillip P. Clark, 19, of Brandon, died May 18, 2010; SGT \nAnthony O. Magee, 29, of Hattiesburg, died April 27, 2010; Army PFC \nAnthony Blount, 21, of Petal, died April 7, 2010; SSG William S. \nRicketts, 27, of Corinth, died Feb 27, 2010; SFC Christopher D. Shaw, \n26, of Natchez, died Sept. 29, 2009; SGT Matthew L. Ingram, 25, of \nNewton, died Aug. 21, 2009; and SFC Alejandro Granado, 42, of Fairfax, \nVa., died Aug. 2, 2009. Mississippi Guard; SFC Severin W. Summers III, \n43, of Bentonia, died Aug. 2, 2009; and Army SSG Johnny Roosevelt Polk, \n39, of Gulfport, died July 31, 2009.\n  I honor them, and my heart goes out to the families of all the brave \nMississippi men and women in uniform who have died for our country. It \nis the endless support of families that motivates our service men and \nwomen to carry out their duties, and their dedication must not be \nforgotten this Memorial Day.\n  Congress is working diligently to provide our troops in Afghanistan \nwith the funds necessary to finish the job and come home safely. I \nunderstand the necessity of matching our soldiers' readiness with the \nmeans to complete their mission, and I am confident that the entire \nMississippi delegation and Congress continue to take that duty very \nseriously.\n  As a veteran of the U.S. Navy, I am particularly thankful for the \nbravery and dedication of those who have fought and died for our \ncountry in our defense. We are blessed to live in a country that \nprotects its citizens with such a fine, fighting force.\n  This Memorial Day, I encourage everyone to take a moment to remember \nthe courageous American soldiers who have given their lives for our \nNation and to thank their families. Our fallen warriors are true \nheroes, and we owe them our solemn gratitude for their service and \nsacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4511-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4511-S4512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. President, next week our Nation will observe Memorial Day, an \noccasion on which we honor the men and women who gave this country what \nPresident Lincoln called ``the last, full measure of devotion''--their \nvery lives. President Lincoln uttered those now timeless words at a \nceremony honoring thousands of Civil War troops who fell in a battle \nsurrounding a small town called Gettysburg. To this day, his words \nreflect, with unparalleled clarity, the heroic sacrifices that made, \nand have kept, this country safe and free. This Memorial Day we once \nagain honor those men and women.\n  How do we properly honor those who gave their lives while in military \nservice? Lincoln answered that question--``We honor them by dedicating \nourselves to the cause for which they gave themselves. We honor those \nwho died by ensuring, in Lincoln's words, that they ``shall not have \ndied in vain.'' We carry on, we remember them, and we remember to tend \nto their comrades and their families who live among us still.\n  The Senate's role in this important task, to honor veterans and their \nfamily members with the care and benefits they have earned, falls in \npart to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. I have had the honor of \nserving on that committee for 20 years, most recently as its Chairman. \nIn that capacity, I am pleased to report on the progress Congress has \nmade since last Memorial Day.\n  Last Memorial Day, Congress had good reason to be proud when looking \nback at recent gains for veterans and their families. Since 2007, we \nhave passed historic appropriations bills to properly fund VA, \nfollowing years of drastic underfunding. We passed the most substantive \nGI bill since World War II, which has already been put to use by \nhundreds of thousands of Americans. And we made wide-ranging reforms to \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs--overhauling its mental health care \nand suicide prevention programs, and enhancing cooperation and \ncollaboration between the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.\n  This Memorial Day, we can be proud of having done even more to help \nVA adapt to the needs of today's veterans and their families. I will \nfocus on two of the most significant bills--one which reformed the \nbroken funding process for veterans' health care, and the other, which \ncharts a course for VA where the needs of women veterans and family \ncaregivers receive special attention.\n  When I became chairman of the committee, the VA health care system \nhad endured many years of chronic underfunding, leading to health care \nrationing and budget shortfalls. While we succeeded in restoring VA's \nbudget to appropriate levels, we still had not addressed the underlying \nfunding process--a one-year-at-a-time appropriations process that led \nto funding delays in 20 of the last 23 years. To fix this broken \nsystem, I introduced the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and \nTransparency Act. This bill was designed to take the process of advance \nappropriations--funding a program one year ahead of the regular \nappropriations process--and apply it to the Nation's largest health \ncare system. At this time last year, that bill was still pending in \nCongress. Since then, our colleagues overwhelmingly chose to support \nthis legislation, and the President signed it into law. This change \nwill be felt in every State of the Union. At the one thousand-plus \npoints of care run by VA, administrators will know\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nwhat their budget will be for the current year and for the year to \ncome. The 6 million veterans who are projected to seek VA care will not \nhave to worry about whether their local VA clinic will have to go \nmonths without a proper budget, as they did in the past.\n  We now turn to the important task of overseeing the implementation of \nthe new law and standing by should VA or the Administration ask for \nappropriate funding. We are currently working on the first budget with \nadvance appropriations under the new authority, and I have been pleased \nwith what has been a smooth transition.\n  At this point last year, many other veterans' initiatives were \npending--for veterans in rural areas, for the caregivers of wounded \nwarriors, and for women veterans--to name a few. All of these \nproposals, along with others, were wrapped into one important package--\nthe Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act. While this was \na bipartisan bill from the beginning, its passage was far from assured. \nIsolated Members of Congress sought to block the bill at several \nstages, citing fears of cost and change. Resolute that it would be \nchange for the better and that its cost is, in fact, a cost of war, the \nsupporters of this bill prevailed last month when President Obama's \nsignature made it law.\n  This new law's many provisions where reviewed by this body before we \nvoted for them, so I will not again go into all of the details. \nInstead, I will highlight just a few of the changes in the new law:\n  For the families caring for wounded warriors, it brings an \nunprecedented permanent program to train, certify, and financially \nsupport them. With this important change, VA recognizes that the \nfamilies of disabled veterans should be treated as partners, not \nignored.\n  For a growing number of women veterans who served our Nation \nhonorably, it brings changes to help VA adapt to their needs. These \ninclude an authorization for VA to provide health care for a woman \nveteran's newborn child for up to one week; a mandate for VA to \nimplement a pilot program to provide child care and adjustment care to \nwomen veterans; and a requirement that VA train mental health providers \nto treat military sexual trauma.\n  For veterans in rural areas, the new law brings programs and reforms \nto break down barriers between them and the care they deserve. To name \na few, these include travel reimbursements for veterans treated at VA \nfacilities; grants for veterans service organization transporting \nveterans from remote areas; an expansion of telehealth options for \nveterans; and provisions promoting collaboration with community \norganizations and providers such as the Indian Health Services.\n  The bill makes other important changes, from eliminating copayments \nfor catastrophically disabled veterans to strengthening VA's ability to \nrecruit and retain first-class health care professionals. These \nvaluable changes and others are now law, thanks to the support of \nCongress and the President.\n  As I noted at the outset, these measures, which demonstrate \nCongress's gratitude to our troops abroad and veterans at home, are the \nbest way we can honor those who gave their lives in service to their \ncountry. While much remains to be done, as we pause this Memorial Day, \nwe can recall the significant changes over the past year.\n  I close by expressing once more my gratitude to the patriots who are \nwith us in the flesh and in spirit, and to the nation and the national \nideals that unite us all.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as you are aware, on Memorial Day \ncitizens across our great country pause to reflect on our fallen \nheroes. American hearts swell with pride as men and women everywhere \nstand just a little bit taller when hearing our National Anthem, and \nthey feel a lump in their throat at the sound of a bugle playing taps. \nWe stand proud and remember our Nation's sons and daughters who no \nlonger stand with us but whose names and memories remain forever \npreserved in our hearts. On Memorial Day, our Nation weighs and \nrespects the price of our freedom.\n  We can and we should learn from those Americans who went to war but \nnever returned home. For them, service meant accepting the risk that \nthey might not have a chance to enjoy the freedom their service \nprotects. They selflessly chose to serve anyway. For the fallen, honor \nmeant the privilege of wearing a U.S. military uniform and a chance to \nearn the respect that it garners around the world despite the risk that \nit might make them a target for those who mean us harm. For them, \nselflessness meant answering a call for help from a fellow soldier, \nwithout hesitation, even if chances were high that it would be their \nfinal act.\n  These timeless qualities of service, honor, respect, and selflessness \nform the bedrock of military service in a free society. On Memorial \nDay, we commemorate those who lived according to these principles so \nthat we might assemble in this Chamber and across the land as free \npeople, safe under the umbrella of protection that their brothers and \nsisters continue to provide around the world today.\n  It is appropriate that on Memorial Day, we should set aside our \ndifferences and unite as Americans--a unified nation with one common \nvoice to honor our fallen. Let us celebrate that we are a free nation, \na proud nation, a nation guided by principles and universal truths. And \nalthough we may disagree on many things, we do so peacefully and \nlawfully. Even in tough times such as these, we remain a beacon of \nlight around the world for those who can only imagine a life of freedom \nas they struggle to survive under the grip of tyranny and oppression. \nToday we remember the men and women who kept that beacon lit and \nconsider the gravity of their sacrifice.\n  As a nation, we must also remember that with every fallen soldier \nthere is a family left behind. We should appreciate with compassion and \nrespect their enduring sacrifice and provide for them the support and \ngratitude they deserve. Ours is a grateful nation.\n  Often quoted is our Declaration of Independence that proclaims ``all \nmen are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \ncertain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the \npursuit of Happiness.'' It is those who have answered that call to \nservice who ensured that our gift of liberty is not only unalienable, \nit is also enduring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4512-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4512-S4513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING DR. GEORGE TILLER\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, 1 year ago this week, Dr. George Tiller, \na provider of critical reproductive health services, was shot to death \nwhile at church in Wichita, KS. The anniversary of his death serves as \na solemn reminder of the violence that reproductive health \nprofessionals face today.\n  Unfortunately, like so many of his colleagues who treat women across \nthis country, Dr. Tiller faced years of constant harassment, \nintimidation and death threats. These acts of violence eventually \nculminated in his murder.\n  We know, however, that Dr. Tiller's murder is not an isolated \nincident. A pattern of intimidation, threats and violence against \nreproductive health providers exists in this country and must end.\n  Since 1993, eight clinic workers have been murdered in the United \nStates. During that time period there have been thousands of reported \nacts of violence against providers of reproductive health care \nincluding bombings, arsons, death threats, kidnappings and assaults. As \nthe Tiller murder demonstrates, we simply cannot tolerate any form of \nharassment and threats to health care providers and their patients.\n  I remember clearly 10 years ago tomorrow--May 28, 2000--when the \nConcord Feminist Health Center in my home State of New Hampshire was \nthe victim of an arson attack. The facility suffered extensive damage, \ncosting tens of thousands of dollars to repair. Thankfully, no one was \ninjured in the attack. It was not merely the cost of the repairs that \nwas so troubling--what was troubling was that this act of hate and \nintimidation left the community feeling fearful and uncertain. No one \nshould live with that fear and certainly not because they provide \ncritical health care services to women.\n  I recently heard the story about a reproductive health center \ndirector in Colorado who reports that he often wears a bulletproof vest \nin public. He said: ``I walk out of my office and the first thing I do \nis look at the parking garage that the hospital built two\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\ndoors away and see if there is a sniper on the roof. I basically expect \nto be shot any day. . . . It's a war zone. . . . It's very frightening \nand it ruins your life''.\n  Now, I recognize that there is a deep divide on the issue of \nreproductive freedom. And I recognize that there are many heartfelt \nfeelings on both sides of the aisle and even within my own caucus. But, \nno matter which side of this debate you are on, we should all be able \nto agree that violence is never the answer.\n  So today I urge all my colleagues to join me in condemning the kind \nof senseless violence that led to the death of Dr. George Tiller.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4513-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH MONTH\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize May as National \nCancer Research Month. This year, nearly 1.5 million Americans will be \ndiagnosed with cancer and more than 500,000 will die from the disease. \nOf course, when we talk about cancer, we are referring to more than 200 \ndiseases but taken together, cancer remains the leading cause of death \nfor Americans under age 85, and the second leading cause of death \noverall.\n  In my capacity as a member of the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, I have spent my career fighting \nalongside my colleagues to provide increased funding for medical \nresearch to ensure that organizations like the National Institutes of \nHealth have the ability to continue their critical lifesaving work. It \nremains my hope that, as the NIH continues to provide us with new and \ninnovative research and treatments, we will continue to provide them \nwith the resources they need.\n  As a person directly affected by cancer, I believe we must continue \nto strengthen our Nation's commitment to this lifesaving research for \nthe health and well-being of all Americans. The nation's investment in \ncancer research is having a remarkable impact. Discoveries and \ndevelopments in prevention, early detection, and more effective \ntreatments have helped to find cures for many types of cancers, and \nhave converted others into manageable chronic conditions. The 5-year \nsurvival rate for all cancers has improved over the past 30 years to \nmore than 65 per cent, and advances in cancer research have had \nsignificant implications for the treatment of other costly diseases \nsuch as diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, HIV/AIDS and macular \ndegeneration.\n  I take this opportunity not only to mention the value and importance \nof cancer research, but also to remember the people in my life who have \nbeen touched by this disease. Last year alone, we lost not only my \nsister Martha, but my dear friend Ted Kennedy to aggressive forms of \ncancer. Like many of my constituents whose lives have been touched by \ncancer, I think of them every day--and their battles strengthen my \nresolve to fight for better treatment and more cures.\n  I want to thank every one of my constituents who have come to my \noffice to meet with my staff and me about this disease. It is no secret \nthat cancer touches the lives of more Americans than those who are just \ndiagnosed with it--friends and family also face the difficulty of \nsupporting their loved ones through these hard times. I know how much \ntime, effort and resources they expend on these trips. Many of them are \nsick or in recovery, or taking care of very ill loved ones, yet they \nstill find the time to come down and share their stories with us, and I \nthank them for it. Their stories, anecdotes and struggles give a face \nto the people all across the country whose lives are touched by this \nimportant research, and hearing about them help us to do our jobs \nbetter. We could not have gotten health care reform passed without \ntheir constant efforts and support.\n  In commemorating May as National Cancer Research Month, we recognize \nthe importance of cancer research and the invaluable contributions made \nby scientists and clinicians across the U.S. who are working not only \nto overcome this devastating disease, but also to prevent it. I lend my \nsupport as a father of two girls, as a husband, and as a public servant \nto supporting those who struggle with this deadly disease and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me and do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4513-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4513-S4521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTER EMPOWERMENT (MOVE) ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, since becoming chairman of the Committee \non Rules and Administration with jurisdiction over Federal elections, I \nhave come to have a better appreciation for and deeper understanding of \nthe obstacles and barriers that our military men and women serving \nabroad and at home and U.S. citizens living in foreign lands encounter \nwhen they try to vote.\n  As I explained at a Rules Committee hearing held in May of 2009, \nevery couple of years around election time, there is a great push to \nimprove military and overseas voting. But as soon as the election is \nover, Congress all too often forgets the plight of these voters.\n  But last year, Congress delivered. Our motive was simple--we wanted \nto break down the barriers to voting for our soldiers, sailors, and \ncitizens living overseas. On a bipartisan basis, we agreed that it was \nunacceptable that in the age of global communications, many active \nmilitary, their families, and thousands of other Americans living, \nworking, and volunteering in foreign countries cannot cast a ballot at \nhome while they are serving or living overseas. For our military, what \nespecially moved us to act was the fact that they can fight and put \ntheir life on the line for their country, but they can't choose their \nnext commander-in-chief. This shouldn't happen--not in the United \nStates of America where elections are the bedrock of our democracy.\n  With the 2010 elections less than 7 months away, a new law is on the \nbooks. The provisions of the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment \nAct, MOVE Act, of 2009 were incorporated in Public Law 111-84, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of 2010. This law will make it \neasier for members of our Armed Forces and citizens living abroad to \nreceive accurate, timely election information and the resources and \nlogistical support to register and vote and have that vote count.\n  Mr. President, a legislative history of the MOVE Act is as follows:\n\n                 Background and Purpose of the MOVE Act\n\n       American citizens believe voting is one of the most \n     treasured of our liberties and a right to be defended at any \n     cost. It is therefore unacceptable that our military men and \n     women serving abroad and at home, who put their lives on the \n     line every day to defend this right, often face obstacles in \n     exercising their right to vote.\n       Empirical evidence confirms that members of the military \n     and citizens living overseas who have attempted to vote \n     through the absentee balloting procedures that has been in \n     place for the last 30 years were often unable to do so. The \n     reasons were many, including insufficient information about \n     military and overseas voting procedures, failure by States to \n     send absentee ballots in time for military and overseas \n     voters to cast them, and endemic bureaucratic obstacles that \n     prevent these voters from having their votes counted. While \n     the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, \n     UOCAVA, enacted in 1986, created a Federal framework for both \n     military and overseas citizens to vote it was clear that, in \n     order to break down these barriers to voting, UOCAVA was in \n     need of an overhaul.\n       A history of congressional efforts to aid military and \n     overseas voters highlights the obstacles faced by these \n     voters. In 1942, the first Federal law was enacted to help \n     military members vote in Federal elections. The Soldier \n     Voting Act of 1942 was the first law to guarantee Federal \n     voting rights for servicemembers during wartime. It allowed \n     servicemembers to vote in elections for Federal office \n     without having to register and instituted the first iteration \n     of the Federal Post Card Application for servicemembers to \n     request an absentee ballot. Though this was a commendable \n     first effort by Congress, the 1942 law's provisions only \n     applied during a time of war, and barriers to voting \n     remained. In 1951, President Truman commissioned a study from \n     the American Political Science Association on the problem of \n     military voting. Recognizing the difficulties faced by \n     military members serving overseas during World War II and the \n     Korean War in trying to vote, President Truman wrote a letter \n     to Congress that called on our legislators to fix the \n     problem. In response, Congress passed the Federal Voting \n     Assistance Act, FVAA, in 1955 which recommended--but did not \n     guarantee--absentee registration and voting for military \n     members, Federal employees serving abroad, and members of \n     service organizations affiliated with the military. In 1968, \n     FVAA was amended to cover U.S. citizens temporarily living \n     outside of the United States, thus increasing the number and \n     scope of U.S. citizens that fell within the law's purview. In \n     1975, the Overseas Citizens\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\n     Voting Rights Act at last guaranteed military and overseas \n     voters the right to register and vote by absentee procedures. \n     In 1986, Congress enacted UOCAVA as the primary military and \n     overseas voting law, incorporating the expansion of rights \n     granted under prior Federal legislation and making several \n     significant advances to improve military and overseas voting. \n     UOCAVA has been the operational voting framework provided to \n     military and overseas voters.\n       UOCAVA's main provisions placed several mandates on States. \n     First, States must allow members of the uniformed services, \n     their families, and citizens residing overseas to register \n     and vote by absentee procedures for all elections for Federal \n     office including all general, primary, special and runoff \n     elections. Second, States are required under UOCAVA to accept \n     and process all valid voter registration applications \n     submitted by military and overseas voters--as long as the \n     application is received no less than 30 days prior to an \n     election. Third, UOCAVA created the Federal write-in absentee \n     ballot, FWAB, a failsafe backup ballot for Federal general \n     elections.\n       Congress has amended UOCAVA several times over the last 24 \n     years. The 1998 amendments included certain reporting \n     requirements on States to provide information on military and \n     overseas voting participation; and the 2001 amendments \n     required States to accept the Federal Post Card Application, \n     FPCA, as a combined voter registration and absentee ballot \n     request form, and gave voters the opportunity to request that \n     the FPCA be a standing absentee ballot request for each \n     subsequent Federal election in the voter's State that year. \n     In 2002, the Help America Vote Act, HAVA, modified this \n     provision to allow voters to automatically request an \n     absentee ballot through the FPCA for the two subsequent \n     regularly scheduled Federal election cycles after the \n     election for which the FPCA was originally submitted. HAVA \n     also added a number of substantive provisions to UOCAVA, \n     including a provision to give voting assistance officers the \n     time and resources to provide voting guidance and information \n     to active duty military personnel, a mandate that the \n     Secretary of each branch of the Armed Forces provide \n     information to service personnel regarding the last date that \n     an absentee ballot can reasonably be expected to arrive on \n     time, and a requirement that States identify a single office \n     for communication with UOCAVA voters. Finally, Congress \n     amended UOCAVA in 2004 to allow military personnel to use the \n     Federal write-in absentee ballot, or FWAB, from within the \n     territorial United States.\n       Despite these improvements over the years, evidence \n     revealed that significant barriers to voting continued for \n     military and overseas citizens. Registration among military \n     voters has been shown to be substantially lower than among \n     other voting-eligible U.S. citizens. According to testimony \n     submitted by hearing witnesses, in 2006, the registration \n     rate among military personnel was 64.86 percent compared to a \n     registration rate of 83.8 percent for the general voting age \n     population. According to one survey of military and overseas \n     voters conducted after the 2008 election, of those overseas \n     voters who wanted to vote but were unable to do so, over one-\n     third--34 percent--could not vote because of problems in the \n     registration process. The same survey found that even among \n     experienced overseas voters, nearly one-quarter--23.7 \n     percent--experienced problems during the registration \n     process. Military and overseas voters have had to deal with a \n     lack of information about registration procedures and a slow, \n     cumbersome registration process that often turns into the \n     first roadblock to voting.\n       Military and overseas voters also have trouble even when \n     they have been able to properly register. The Congressional \n     Research Service, CRS, found that during the 2008 election \n     military personnel and overseas citizens hailing from the \n     seven States with the highest number of deployed soldiers \n     requested 441,000 absentee ballots. Of these, 98,633 were \n     never received by local election officials. Further, survey \n     data shows that two out of every five military and overseas \n     voters, 39 percent--who requested an absentee ballot in 2008 \n     received it from local election officials in the second half \n     of October or later--much too late for a ballot to be voted \n     and mailed back in time to be counted on election day. \n     Sending absentee ballots too late to have the opportunity to \n     actually vote is an unacceptable situation for military and \n     overseas Americans.\n       Finally, some States reject ballots from military and \n     overseas voters for reasons unrelated to voter eligibility, \n     including unnecessary notarization requirements and criteria \n     such as the paper weight of the ballot or ballot envelope. As \n     many as 13,500 ballots were rejected from military and \n     overseas voters from the seven States with the greatest \n     number of troops deployed overseas.\n       These numbers are totally unacceptable. These barriers \n     effectuate rampant disenfranchisement among our military and \n     overseas voters. Congress has a compelling interest to \n     protect the voting rights of American citizens, and it is \n     especially incumbent upon Congress to act when those very \n     individuals who are sworn to defend that freedom are unable \n     to exercise their right to vote.\n       The need for sweeping improvement was clear. The Military \n     and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act is a complete renovation \n     of UOCAVA that brings it into the twenty-first century and \n     streamlines the process of absentee voting for military and \n     overseas voters through a series of common sense, \n     straightforward fixes.\n       First, it allows military and overseas voters to request, \n     and when so requested, requires States to send, registration \n     materials, absentee ballot request forms, and blank absentee \n     ballots electronically. It ensures that military and overseas \n     voters have at least 45 days to receive and complete their \n     absentee ballots and return them to election officials. The \n     legislation also requires that absentee ballots from overseas \n     military personnel be sent through expedited mail procedures, \n     making it faster and easier to send voted ballots back to \n     local election officials. In addition, it prevents election \n     officials from rejecting overseas absentee ballots for \n     reasons not related to voter eligibility, like paper weight \n     and notarization requirements.\n       Second, the MOVE Act expands accessibility and availability \n     of voting resources for military and overseas voters. It \n     shores up the Federal Voting Assistance Program, or FVAP, an \n     organization within the Department of Defense, DOD. Under the \n     provisions of MOVE, FVAP will make a number of improvements \n     to its voter education efforts for our military and other \n     Americans living and working abroad and serve as the central \n     administrative office for carrying out the Federal \n     responsibilities under UOCAVA and MOVE. It also increases the \n     usability and accessibility of the FWAB. This failsafe ballot \n     allows military and overseas voters to vote even when they \n     face a situation where they don't receive a State-issued \n     ballot in time. In addition to all these improvements, the \n     legislation advances voter registration for our military by \n     directing each of the Secretaries of the military departments \n     to designate offices in military installations where soldiers \n     and their families can register to vote, update their \n     registration information, and request an absentee ballot.\n       The MOVE Act also aims to secure future voting rights for \n     military and overseas voters. It increases accountability for \n     future elections by directing the Department of Defense to \n     regularly report to Congress on their activities for \n     implementing the programs and requirements under MOVE, \n     including information on ballot delivery success rates. It \n     also authorizes the Defense Department to create a pilot \n     program testing new technologies for the future benefit of \n     military and overseas voters.\n       The enactment of the provisions of the MOVE Act brings to \n     an end a system that could ever allow a quarter of ballots \n     requested by U.S. troops to go missing. It instead aims to \n     ensure that every single military and overseas vote be \n     counted.\n\n\n             Committee Hearing and Consideration at Markup\n\n       The Committee on Rules and Administration held a hearing on \n     May 13, 2009, which I chaired entitled ``Hearing on Problems \n     for Military and Overseas Voters: Why Many Soldiers and Their \n     Families Can't Vote.'' The first panel consisted of one \n     witness, Gail McGinn, Acting Under Secretary for Personnel \n     and Readiness for the Department of Defense. Testifying on \n     the second panel were Patricia Hollarn, board member of the \n     Overseas Vote Foundation and former supervisor of elections \n     in Okaloosa County, FL; Donald Palmer, director of the \n     Division of Elections at the Florida Department of State; LTC \n     Joseph DeCaro, active duty member of the U.S. Air Force, on \n     his own behalf; Eric Eversole, former attorney at the \n     Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Voting Rights \n     Section, adviser to the McCain-Palin campaign, and former \n     member of the Navy's Judge Advocate General Corps from 1999-\n     2001; and Robert Carey, executive director of the National \n     Defense Committee.\n       The hearing focused on the reasons why so many military and \n     overseas voters find it difficult or impossible to \n     effectively cast their ballots, with special attention paid \n     to recommendations from the witnesses who possess extensive \n     experience with the military and overseas absentee voting \n     process. The hearing opened with a discussion of the \n     preliminary results from a study of military and overseas \n     voting in 2008 conducted by the Congressional Research \n     Service. The findings showed that in several of the largest \n     military voting States, up to 27 percent of the ballots \n     requested by military and overseas voters were not counted \n     for one reason or another.\n       Letters from soldiers serving abroad who wanted to cast \n     ballots in 2008 but were unable to do so were shared. One \n     letter from a soldier in Alaska concisely summarized the \n     problem underscored by the hearing: ``I hate that because of \n     my military service overseas, I was precluded from voting.''\n       Gail McGinn, Acting Under Secretary for Personnel and \n     Readiness at the Department of Defense, testified in detail \n     about the logistical and administrative challenges facing \n     military and overseas voters. Ms. McGinn identified time, \n     distance, and mobility as the chief logistical barriers to \n     these voters. She said, ``Our legislative initiatives for \n     states and territories to improve ballot transit time are, \n     first, provide at least 45 days between the ballot mailing \n     date and the date that ballots are due; give state chief \n     election officials the authority to alter elections \n     procedures in emergency situations; provide a state write-in \n     absentee ballot to be sent out 90 to 180 days before all \n     elections; and expand the use of electronic transmission \n     alternatives for voting material.'' Ms. McGinn further \n     pointed out that 23 States do not provide the minimum of a \n     45-day round trip for military and overseas absentee ballots. \n     Patricia Hollarn, board member of the Overseas Vote \n     Foundation and\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\n     former supervisor of elections in Okaloosa County, FL, \n     testified about her personal experience with local election \n     officials who, she said, had a lot of confusion about the \n     proper absentee balloting procedures they needed to provide \n     for overseas citizens and military personnel. She echoed Ms. \n     McGinn in recommending that States and local jurisdictions \n     provide a minimum of 45 days for absentee ballots to be \n     delivered to overseas voters, completed, and returned before \n     the state's deadline. She also emphasized the logistical \n     challenge facing the U.S. Postal Service and military mail \n     service with respect to the speedy delivery of overseas \n     ballots.\n       Donald Palmer, director of the Division of Elections for \n     the Florida Department of State, testified about Florida's \n     experience serving its military and overseas voters. Mr. \n     Palmer said that providing 45 days for ballot transmission \n     and delivery, as Florida does, is ``prudent'' and \n     ``absolutely necessary, when relying solely on the mail \n     service.'' Mr. Palmer also discussed Florida's experience \n     using technology, including e-mail, fax, and the Internet, to \n     communicate with military and overseas voters and transmit \n     balloting materials to and from Americans abroad. Mr. Palmer \n     testified about an invitation from the Department of Defense \n     for Secretaries of State to travel to the Middle East and see \n     firsthand how soldiers receive their absentee ballots. \n     Florida Secretary of State Kurt Browning relayed to Mr. \n     Palmer that soldiers abroad many times do not have access to \n     fax machines and often use e-mail as a primary source of \n     communication and expressed their desire to be able to use \n     email or the internet to transmit balloting materials to \n     local election officials. Mr. Palmer also detailed pilot \n     programs in Florida which have used new technologies to \n     facilitate ballot transmission from abroad. He also described \n     Florida's efforts to work with the U.S. Postal Service to \n     reduce error rates in ballot delivery and to use intelligent \n     code technology to track absentee ballots while in the \n     Continental United States.\n       United States Air Force LTC Joseph DeCaro, testifying on \n     his own behalf, described his personal experiences with \n     absentee voting while serving abroad in 2004. His experience \n     illustrates the burdens facing uniformed servicemembers \n     overseas who want to vote:\n\n       Every moment I spent researching and coordinating with \n     state-side resources to be able to cast my ballot was against \n     any personal time off. The mission is and always must be the \n     main focus. Being deployed is difficult enough as it is . . . \n     I think every American should do what they can to cast their \n     ballot and make their voice heard. As with many other \n     citizens, I will continue to do this, but there should be a \n     better way in which [service personnel can] cast their ballot \n     while deployed.\n\n       Lieutenant Colonel DeCaro also lamented that he had no way \n     of knowing whether the ballot he mailed to his local election \n     office would ever reach its destination.\n       Eric Eversole, former attorney at the Department of Justice \n     Civil Rights Division, Voting Rights Section, began his \n     testimony by arguing that ``when it comes to the military \n     members' right to vote, we seem to forget their sacrifices \n     and we deny them the very voting rights that we ask them to \n     defend.'' He cited statistics which showed that only 26 \n     percent of Florida's deployed servicemembers were able to \n     successfully request an absentee ballot in 2008. He also \n     echoed prior testimony that States should mail out absentee \n     ballots to military and overseas voters at least 45 days \n     before the local deadline to have the ballot count. Mr. \n     Eversole testified about the need for improvements in the \n     Federal Voting Assistance Program. Mr. Eversole strongly \n     advocated for military personnel to receive appropriate \n     voting information and voter registration materials when they \n     move or deploy to a new installation or port. In response to \n     a question I asked, Mr. Eversole also testified that certain \n     offices at the Department of Defense should be designed as \n     voter registration agencies under the National Voter \n     Registration Act.\n       Robert Carey, executive director of the National Defense \n     Committee, testified about his own experience taking a leave \n     of absence from his duty as a member of the U.S. Navy \n     Reserves and flying back to New York City at his own expense \n     in order to vote in the 2004 election. He cited research \n     showing that only 26 percent of the ballots requested by \n     overseas soldiers in 2006 were successfully cast. Mr. Carey \n     emphasized that insufficient time was the chief reason for \n     these statistics, arguing that States too often send out \n     ballots too late for military voters to complete and return \n     them in time to be counted. He pointed to a study conducted \n     by the Pew Center on the States, Pew, which found that 23 \n     States do not provide enough time for military and overseas \n     voters to successfully cast their ballots. Mr. Carey also \n     recommended that ballots be sent out at least 60 days before \n     they were due.\n       Several organizations submitted statements for the hearing \n     record. Pew submitted a copy of its 2009 study of military \n     and overseas voting, No Time to Vote, for the committee \n     record. In its accompanying letter, Pew highlighted several \n     recommendations for reform from the study, including \n     ``sending out overseas absentee ballots sooner, eliminating \n     notary and witness requirements and harnessing technology to \n     allow for the electronic transmission of ballots and election \n     materials to voters overseas.''\n       The Overseas Vote Foundation, OVF, submitted a copy of its \n     2008 post-election survey for the record. The survey included \n     data obtained from over 24,000 overseas voters and over 1,000 \n     local election officials. Among OVF's key findings was that \n     more than half, 52 percent, of those overseas military voters \n     who tried but could not vote were unable to because their \n     ballots were late or did not arrive. OVF also found that \n     despite concerted efforts, less than half of UOCAVA voters \n     were aware of the Federal write-in absentee ballot.\n       Democrats Abroad submitted a statement for the record \n     emphasizing the difficulties for military and overseas voters \n     stemming from the patchwork of varied State and local \n     regulations, a lack of awareness of the Federal write-in \n     absentee ballot, and general inability to effectively \n     communicate with local election officials from abroad.\n       Tom Tarantino, legislative associate with Iraq and \n     Afghanistan Veterans of America, submitted a statement for \n     the record including testimony about his own experience as a \n     voting assistance officer, citing the lack of sufficient \n     training about how to effectively educate soldiers about \n     absentee balloting procedures. Mr. Tarantino recommended \n     improving the voting assistance officer program and suggested \n     that the Department of Defense be required to ensure safe and \n     timely passage of military ballots to their home districts.\n       The Federation of American Women's Clubs Overseas submitted \n     a statement for the record in which it recommended that \n     States send overseas absentee ballots at least 45 days before \n     the deadline and that voter materials, including ballots, not \n     be rejected for reasons unrelated to voter eligibility.\n       Everyone Counts submitted a ``white paper'' for the record \n     comparing the effectiveness of various voting technologies \n     for military and overseas voters.\n       Alex Yasinac, dean of the School of Information and \n     Computer Sciences at the University of South Alabama, \n     submitted a statement for the record analyzing various \n     technological solutions to improve overseas absentee voting. \n     Dr. Yasinac suggested the creation of a technological pilot \n     program for overseas voters, including the use of virtual \n     private networks, cryptographic voting systems, and document \n     delivery upload systems to ensure secure electronic \n     transmission of balloting materials.\n\n\n                        Introduction of the Bill\n\n       I introduced S. 1415, the MOVE Act of 2009, on July 8, \n     2009, and was joined by Senators Saxby Chambliss and Ben \n     Nelson as original cosponsors. After the bill's introduction, \n     56 additional Senators joined as cosponsors. The bill was \n     referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                   Committee Consideration at Markup\n\n       S. 1415 was considered by the Senate Rules Committee at a \n     markup held on July 15, 2009. The committee adopted three \n     amendments which I submitted on behalf of Senator John \n     Cornyn, who had introduced separate legislation on improving \n     military voting that was pending at the time in the Rules \n     Committee. Senator Cornyn joined in this endeavor by \n     contributing his knowledge and expertise on military voting \n     to the MOVE Act. Senator Robert Bennett, ranking member of \n     the Rules Committee, introduced an amendment with several \n     provisions intent on improving the effectiveness of the MOVE \n     Act.\n       The first amendment, which I submitted on behalf of Senator \n     Cornyn, strengthened the bill by ensuring that overseas \n     military personnel can mail their marked absentee ballots to \n     their local election offices with confidence that those \n     ballots will be received and counted by directing the \n     Presidential designee to work with the U.S. Postal Service to \n     provide expedited delivery services for ballots that are \n     collected before a prescribed deadline. The provision \n     provides ample discretion for the Presidential designee to \n     extend that deadline for collection of ballots, allowing the \n     Presidential designee to permit a longer transit time for \n     completed ballots to be delivered to local election \n     officials. To ensure Department of Defense accountability \n     under this section, the amendment directed the Presidential \n     designee to submit reports to the relevant congressional \n     committees to explain the procedures implemented to provide \n     the expedited mail delivery and inform the committees of the \n     number of military overseas ballots successfully and \n     unsuccessfully delivered to local election offices in time. \n     Finally, the amendment included language requiring the \n     Presidential designee to ensure, to the greatest extent \n     allowable, that the privacy of military servicemembers and \n     security of their ballots are protected during the delivery \n     process.\n       The second amendment, which Senator Cornyn and I worked on \n     together, fortified the bill by expanding voter registration \n     opportunities, services, and information for military and \n     overseas voters. It also required the Department of Defense \n     to provide voting information and an opportunity for \n     servicemembers to register and update voting information \n     during certain points in service and provided the Secretary \n     of Defense flexibility to designate certain pay, personnel, \n     and identification offices as voter registration agencies. In \n     addition to voter registration, the amendment required \n     written information to be provided to servicemembers on \n     absentee ballot procedures. Finally, the amendment contained \n     reporting requirements for the Department of Defense to \n     evaluate its voter support services and send Congress its\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\n     recommendations for improving those programs.\n       The third amendment was technical in nature and altered no \n     substantive provisions of the bill.\n       Ranking Member Bennett offered a package of amendments \n     modifying several provisions of the bill. First, the \n     amendment clarified that States may delegate the obligations \n     under the MOVE Act to local jurisdictions. Some local and \n     State election administrators contacted the Rules Committee \n     to express concern because they thought that the MOVE Act \n     could be interpreted to require States, instead of \n     localities, to take administrative responsibility for running \n     elections for UOCAVA voters. Though there was no intent to \n     shift routine administrative responsibility of elections to \n     States, for the sake of clarity in the bill, I supported this \n     amendment. While clarifying that the MOVE Act can be \n     administered and implemented at the local level, the \n     amendment did not modify or otherwise alter the ultimate \n     responsibility of MOVE Act compliance, which remains with the \n     State. Accordingly, States retain the responsibility to \n     ensure local jurisdictions' compliance with UOCAVA and MOVE \n     and thus the State will continue to be the focus of any \n     potential enforcement actions that need to be taken by the \n     Attorney General.\n       Senator Bennett's amendments also modified provisions of \n     the MOVE Act which had originally required States to transmit \n     balloting materials ``by mail, electronically, or by \n     facsimile.'' The text of the amendment instead read to \n     require transmission of balloting materials ``by mail and \n     electronically.'' This change clarified the requirement on \n     State and local election administrators that, in addition to \n     mail, they must provide at least one method of fast and \n     effective electronic means of transmitting balloting \n     materials to U.S. citizens overseas and uniformed \n     servicemembers. It is important to note that Bob Carey during \n     his testimony before the Rules Committee on May 13, 2009, \n     testified that ``[R]ecent research by the National Defense \n     Committee indicates that fax transmission is not an effective \n     option for military personnel, especially those suffering the \n     greatest disenfranchisement in this process.'' However, at \n     the same time, the amendment's language clarified that \n     election administrators may provide multiple means of \n     electronic communication in order to ensure speedy \n     transmission of information, registration and balloting \n     materials.\n       Senator Bennett's amendments also reinforced the privacy \n     and security provisions of the original legislation by \n     directing States to protect, to the extent practicable, the \n     integrity of the voter registration and absentee ballot \n     process through procedures that shield identity and personal \n     data.\n       The amendments also simplified the timing provisions of the \n     original legislation by mandating that whenever a State \n     receives an absentee ballot request at least 45 days before a \n     Federal election it must send out an absentee ballot not \n     later than 45 days before the election. With respect to valid \n     ballot applications received after 45 days prior to such an \n     election, States are required to transmit a validly requested \n     absentee ballot in accordance with State law and as \n     expeditiously as possible. However, the amendment did not \n     impact the 30-day requirement under UOCAVA. At the same time, \n     the amendment removed language from the original version of \n     the bill which would have required States to accept and count \n     absentee ballots received up to 55 days after the date on \n     which an absentee ballot was transmitted or the date on which \n     the State certified an election, whichever was later. The \n     negotiated modification placed a 45-day mandate on States to \n     promptly respond to military and overseas absentee ballot \n     requests.\n       The amendments also strengthened Department of Justice \n     oversight of absentee voting by uniformed services and \n     overseas voters by requiring the Presidential designee to \n     consult with the Attorney General before approving any \n     hardship exemptions from States unable to comply with the \n     bill's timing provisions. This will help ensure a unified \n     governmental response to State compliance with the MOVE Act.\n       Finally, the amendments repealed subsections (a) through \n     (d) of Sec. 104 of the Uniformed and Overseas Absentee Voting \n     Act, which allowed military and overseas absentee ballot \n     applicants to indicate on their Federal Postcard Application \n     form that their application should be considered a continuing \n     application for an absentee ballot through the next two \n     regularly scheduled general elections. Given the highly \n     mobile nature of military and overseas voters, there was a \n     concern among States that this provision of UOCAVA required a \n     large number of ballots to be sent to old and outdated \n     addresses. Election officials reported receiving a large \n     number of these continuing absentee ballots as ``returned \n     undeliverable,'' thus artificially inflating the number of \n     failed ballots, and potentially wasting State resources. \n     Repealing these sections addressed those concerns. This \n     amended section does not prohibit States from providing \n     continuing applications for absentee ballots, or accepting \n     ballots received under such continuing applications. This \n     amended section also does not prohibit States from \n     considering a Federal Postcard Application submitted for a \n     primary election to carry over to the general election in \n     that same election cycle.\n       The committee agreed to all of the proposed amendments and \n     adopted them by voice vote. The committee then voted to \n     report S. 1415, the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment \n     Act, as amended. The committee proceeded by voice vote, and \n     all members present became cosponsors of the legislation. S. \n     1415, as amended, was ordered reported to the Senate.\n\n\n      Passage by the Senate of the MOVE Act provisions in the DOD \n                           authorization bill\n\n       On July 22, 2009, I offered Senate amendment No. 1764 to S. \n     1390, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n     2010, on the Senate Floor.\n       Senator Cornyn spoke in support of this amendment that day:\n\n       Our military servicemembers put their lives on the line to \n     protect our rights and our freedoms. Yet many of them still \n     face substantial roadblocks when it comes to something as \n     simple as casting their ballots and participating in our \n     national elections . . . This important amendment contains \n     many other commonsense reforms suggested by other Senators \n     and will help end the effective disenfranchisement of our \n     troops and their families. Our goal has been to balance \n     responsibilities between elections officials and the \n     Department of Defense, and I believe this amendment \n     accomplishes that goal.\n\n       On July 23, 2009, I urged my colleagues to support the MOVE \n     Act amendment to the DOD authorization legislation:\n\n       Now, if [our soldiers] can risk their lives for us we can \n     at least allow them to vote. They take orders from the \n     commander-in-chief. They are the first people who ought to be \n     allowed to elect and vote for a commander-in-chief. And if we \n     can deploy tanks and high-tech equipment and food to the \n     front lines, we can figure out a way to deliver ballots to \n     our troops so they can be returned and counted. And that, Mr. \n     President, is what the MOVE Act does.\n\n       Senator Bennett spoke in support of the amendment:\n\n       Now, then the legislation was introduced in its original \n     form, I raised concerns with Senator Schumer about some of \n     its provisions. He worked with me and my staff to address \n     these concerns and the amendment that we have before us today \n     effectively does so. That's why I'm pleased to now be a \n     cosponsor of the bill. The difficulties our service personnel \n     face in voting and the Senator from New York has described \n     them, and I believe this amendment deals with them in a \n     proper fashion.\n\n       Senator Chambliss also spoke in support of the amendment:\n\n       [N]ot since the passage of the Uniform and Overseas Voting \n     Act in 1986 have we proposed such significant legislation \n     designed to help the men and women of the military who time \n     and time again are called upon to defend the rights and \n     freedoms that we Americans hold so sacred. Unfortunately, our \n     military's one of the most disenfranchised voting blocs we \n     have and today we have the opportunity to correct this.\n\n       Senator Nelson also added comments in support:\n\n       We owe it to our men and women in uniform to protect their \n     right to vote. And for military and overseas votes, that \n     right is only as good as their ability to cast a ballot and \n     have it counted. For years, we have known of the obstacles \n     these brave Americans face in exercising their right to vote, \n     often when far from home and in harm's way. I firmly believe \n     this legislation will make a huge impact in empowering our \n     military and overseas voters to have their votes counted no \n     matter where they find themselves on election day.\n\n       Senate amendment No. 1764 to S. 1390 was agreed to by voice \n     vote on July 23, 2009. The Senate took up H.R. 2647 on July \n     23, approved an amendment that substituted the text of S. \n     1390, then passed the bill by unanimous consent and requested \n     a conference with the House. A Senate-House conference was \n     held, and the House passed the conference report to H.R. \n     2647, H. Rept. 111-288, on October 8, 2009, and the Senate \n     passed it on October 22, 2009. H.R. 2647 was signed by the \n     President on October 28, 2009, and became Public Law 111-84.\n\n\n                           The MOVE Act Today\n\n       The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act of 2009 is \n     a response to an unacceptable situation--the \n     disenfranchisement of Americans serving and living abroad who \n     are unable to vote because of logistical and geographic \n     barriers.\n       The MOVE Act brings to an end a system that in the past \n     allowed a quarter of the ballots requested by U.S. troops to \n     go unreturned. It does so by insisting that every military \n     and overseas vote be counted. Congress recognized that those \n     who fight to defend America's freedom often face the greatest \n     obstacles in exercising their right to vote. Congress acted \n     to break down the challenges and barriers to voting faced by \n     these citizens with passage of the provisions of the Military \n     and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act.\n       Most of the MOVE Act provisions will be in place for the \n     November 2010 general elections. States started implementing \n     measures and procedures to comply with the MOVE Act almost \n     immediately after passage of Public Law 111-84. At the \n     Federal level, the Department of Defense has been in \n     consultation with the Attorney General to develop and \n     promulgate regulations to administer the waiver process. As \n     the 2010 Federal election approaches, the States and the \n     Department of Defense are making every effort to\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\n     ensure that military and overseas voters have every \n     opportunity to register, vote, and have their vote counted.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section of \nthe MOVE Act provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2010 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Section-by-Section Analysis of the MOVE Act in the NDAA\n\n       The following is an explanation of each provision of the \n     bill, what it does, and how it improves the ability of \n     military and overseas voters to register, vote, and have \n     their votes count in elections. It should be noted that in \n     conference, there were two major substantive changes in the \n     MOVE Act provisions as passed by the Senate.\n       One, the section on ``Findings'' was stricken. The \n     ``Findings'' section provided an explanatory foundation for \n     MOVE and why it was critical for its provisions to be \n     enacted. It highlighted the fundamental nature of the right \n     to vote; the logistical, geographical, operational, and \n     environmental barriers that create obstacles for military and \n     overseas voters to exercise their right to the franchise; the \n     central role shared by States and the Department of Defense \n     in overseeing and facilitating military and overseas voting; \n     and the need for the relevant State, local, and Federal \n     government entities to work together to ensure the ability of \n     military and overseas voters to have their ballots count.\n       Two, the responsibilities attributed to the Department of \n     Defense in ensuring military voters can effectively register \n     to vote was changed in conference from the Senate-passed \n     version. The reason for this change is explained in the \n     summary of Section 583.\n     Section 575. Short title.\n       Title: ``Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act''.\n     Section 576. Clarification regarding delegation of State \n         responsibilities to local jurisdictions.\n       This section clarifies that while the MOVE Act contains a \n     number of mandates on the States with respect to military and \n     overseas absentee voting, States remain free to delegate \n     those responsibilities to local officials as they did under \n     UOCAVA. In effect, this provision puts States on notice that \n     the MOVE Act does not intend to and does not in fact take \n     administrative control of military and overseas voting out of \n     the hands of local officials. Compliance with MOVE's \n     mandates, however, ultimately remains a State responsibility, \n     and States will continue to be the main entity against which \n     the provisions of MOVE and UOCAVA will be enforced should \n     enforcement by the Department of Justice become necessary.\n     Section 577. Establishment of procedures for absent uniformed \n         services voters and overseas voters to request and for \n         States to send voter registration applications and \n         absentee ballot applications by mail and electronically.\n       This section amends UOCAVA to require States to allow \n     military and overseas voters the choice of requesting voter \n     registration applications and absentee ballot applications \n     either by mail or electronically. It mandates that the \n     voter's choice of mail versus electronic extends to the mode \n     of delivery of both the voter registration and absentee \n     ballot applications. States must give all UOCAVA voters the \n     option of receiving their applications by mail or \n     electronically. To ensure military and overseas voters have \n     an opportunity to choose their desired delivery method, \n     States must provide a way for voters to designate their \n     preferred method of delivery, and States are required to send \n     these materials in accordance with the voter's designation. \n     If no delivery preference is indicated, States are to \n     transmit these materials according to applicable State law \n     or, in the absence of such law, by mail. The requirements of \n     this section apply to all general, special, primary, and \n     runoff elections for Federal office.\n       Allowing military and overseas voters to request and \n     receive voter registration and absentee ballot applications \n     electronically requires States to establish at least one \n     means of electronic communication for military and overseas \n     voters to use. States are free to establish multiple means of \n     electronic communication if they wish. In addition to using \n     the electronic format to give voters the option of requesting \n     and receiving voter registration and absentee ballot \n     applications, it is also to be used to provide any other \n     related voting, balloting, and election information requested \n     by or otherwise provided to the voter.\n       In addition to email and the Internet, this provision \n     contemplates the use of fax machines as a legitimate means of \n     electronic transmission. This gives States an additional \n     method of electronic communication. However, it is important \n     to note that the Rules Committee received testimony regarding \n     the challenges of solely relying on fax technology for \n     military and overseas voting. Robert Carey, the Executive \n     Director of the National Defense Committee pointed out in his \n     written testimony that ensuring the privacy of a faxed \n     absentee ballot is difficult. He also cited research \n     indicating that only 39% of junior enlisted personnel had \n     daily access to a fax machine. This provision therefore \n     contemplates the use of fax technology as States gradually \n     transition to more accessible forms of transmission for \n     military and overseas voters through internet and email \n     usage.\n       Information about how to communicate with States \n     electronically, including any official designated email, web \n     addresses, and phone numbers, should be readily accessible \n     and is required to be included with any informational or \n     instructional materials that accompany balloting materials \n     sent to military and overseas voters.\n       The provisions of this section are a direct response to \n     evidence gathered by the Rules Committee that showed lengthy \n     mail transit times for voting materials, including \n     registration forms and absentee ballot applications. This was \n     a fundamental reason why so many of these voters did not have \n     enough time to vote, and it showed the difficulty military \n     and overseas voters have in communicating efficiently and \n     effectively with State and local election officials. Taking \n     advantage of modern technology is an important part of the \n     solution to the ``no time to vote'' problem. The testimony of \n     Lieutenant Colonel Joseph DeCaro at the Rules Committee's May \n     2009 hearing, in which he repeatedly expressed his gratitude \n     for internet connectivity while serving in Air Force and \n     described how he was able to use email to quickly communicate \n     with local election officials, is particularly instructive. \n     Lt. Colonel DeCaro testified that postal mail can sometimes \n     take up to three weeks to reach its destination.\n       Compliance with this provision of the law may save States a \n     substantial amount of money. Using a multiplier of $12.95 for \n     a 1 oz. United States Postal Service Priority Mail \n     international flat-rate mailing, States can potentially save \n     as much as $1,295,000 for every 100,000 military and overseas \n     voters that utilize electronic transmission methods of \n     sending voter registration and ballot request materials.\n       This section also directs the Federal Voting Assistance \n     Program of the Department of Defense to maintain and make \n     available an online repository of State contact information \n     with respect to Federal elections for use by military and \n     overseas voters. The repository should include contact \n     information for all the relevant State and local election \n     officials in each State, including any designated email and \n     Internet addresses and phone and fax numbers instituted to \n     comply with the provisions of this law.\n       Finally, this section contains additional provisions \n     directing States, to the extent practicable, to ensure the \n     integrity of the voter registration and absentee ballot \n     request process, as well as the protection of personal data.\n     Section 578. Establishment of procedures for States to \n         transmit blank absentee ballots by mail and \n         electronically to absent uniformed services voters and \n         overseas voters.\n       This section amends UOCAVA to require States to establish \n     procedures for transmitting blank absentee ballots to \n     military and overseas voters both by mail and electronically \n     for all general, special, primary, and runoff elections for \n     Federal office. States are to use the preferred method of \n     transmission identified by the voter and institute a \n     procedure for allowing the voter to designate whether their \n     preferred delivery method is by mail or electronic delivery. \n     As in the previous section, if no delivery method is \n     specified, States should follow applicable State law or, in \n     the absence of such law, should deliver the blank absentee \n     ballot to the voter by mail.\n       Additionally, this section contains the same language with \n     respect to election integrity and voter privacy as the prior \n     section, and the same rationale for the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of electronic transmission also applies to this \n     section with equal force.\n     Section 579. Ensuring absent uniformed services voters and \n         overseas voters have time to vote.\n       This section amends UOCAVA to require States to transmit \n     validly requested absentee ballots to military and overseas \n     voters not later than 45 days before an election for Federal \n     office, if a ballot request form is received by the relevant \n     local election official at least 45 days before the election. \n     In a circumstance when the absentee ballot request is \n     received less than 45 days before the election, States must \n     transmit a validly requested absentee ballot in accordance \n     with State law and in as practicable a manner as possible \n     that expedites the ballot's transmission so that the voter \n     receives the ballot with enough time to cast the ballot and \n     to have it counted. If States receive an absentee request \n     less than 45 days before the election that contains an \n     electronic delivery designation and related contact \n     information, the State can expedite the blank ballot by \n     electronic means. Of course, the UOCAVA voter still may \n     request his or her ballot to be sent by mail. States may not \n     be able to send the ballot electronically if the State lacks \n     the necessary information, for example a correct email \n     address or facsimile number.\n       The language ``validly requested'' in the MOVE Act refers \n     to how this provision interacts with the pre-existing UOCAVA \n     statute. Under Sec. 102a(2) of UOCAVA, each State is required \n     to ``accept and process, with respect to any election for \n     Federal office, any otherwise valid voter registration \n     application and absentee ballot application from an absent \n     uniformed services voter or overseas voter, if the \n     application is received by the appropriate State election \n     official not less than 30 days before the election.'' The \n     language ``validly requested'' in MOVE refers to applications \n     that are received by local election\n\n[[Page S4518]]\n\n     officials in accordance with Sec. 102a(2). It should be noted \n     that although UOCAVA requires election officials to accept \n     and process applications up to at least 30 days before an \n     election under Sec. 102a(2), States are of course free under \n     UOCAVA to shorten that time period to less than 30 days to \n     give military and overseas voters more time to send in their \n     applications. In such circumstances, the language ``validly \n     requested'' also refers to ballots that are requested in time \n     under the more permissive State law.\n       Also relevant here is that UOCAVA, as amended by the MOVE \n     Act, creates a 15-day ``gap'' in which a State might receive \n     an absentee ballot application from a military or overseas \n     voter less than 45 days in advance of an election, and thus \n     cannot comply with the 45-day rule under MOVE, but is still \n     required to accept and process the application due to the 30-\n     day rule under Sec. 102a(2). To ensure that military and \n     overseas voters whose applications are received during this \n     15-day gap are given enough time to vote, the MOVE Act \n     directs States to transmit such ballots ``in accordance with \n     State law,'' which is a directive for States to deliver \n     ballots in accordance with any procedures that may exist \n     under State law for transmitting ballots to UOCAVA voters, \n     and in as practicable a manner as possible that expedites the \n     ballot's transmission. This shall not supersede the MOVE \n     requirement that UOCAVA voters be able to designate their \n     preferred method of ballot delivery (mail or electronic) and \n     the State's obligation to comply. State law may allow state \n     election officials to fulfill requests that arrive less than \n     30 days before the election.\n       The ``time to vote'' provision was at the top of the list \n     for potential reforms of military and overseas voting at the \n     May 2009 Rules Committee hearing, with witnesses for both the \n     Majority and the Minority endorsing such a measure. The \n     original draft of the MOVE Act contained a 55-day mandate, \n     under which States were required to send out ballots 45 days \n     before an election and accept ballots up to 10 days after the \n     election or by the State's certification date, whichever was \n     later. This original provision was a response to complaints \n     that certain jurisdictions refuse to count ballots from \n     UOCAVA voters when those ballots are sent to States on or \n     before Election Day but do not reach State or local election \n     officials until after the polls have closed. However, there \n     were concerns that this post-election requirement would \n     intrude on States' ability to certify their elections in a \n     manner that complies with their respective State laws or \n     constitutions. Therefore the bill was modified to require \n     that ballots be sent out at least 45 days before Election \n     Day. The consensus recommendation emerged for a 45-day \n     requirement following the hearing because it provides \n     sufficient time for UOCAVA voters to request, receive and \n     cast their ballots in time to be counted in the election for \n     Federal office and better accommodates the laws of a number \n     of states.\n       However, recognizing that circumstances may arise that \n     prevent States from complying with the mandate to send \n     ballots 45 days before Election Day, the MOVE Act also \n     includes procedures whereby States can apply for a waiver \n     from that provision. Waivers are submitted to the \n     Presidential designee who, after consultation with the \n     Attorney General, will decide whether to approve or deny the \n     waiver request. If approved, the waiver is valid only for the \n     election for which the State requested it. MOVE does not \n     contemplate permanent waivers. Nor does MOVE contemplate \n     ``automatic'' renewals of waivers--a waiver that is approved \n     for one election is not automatically valid for or applicable \n     to the State's next election. The reason is to protect UOCAVA \n     voters from situations where a State's plan is approved by \n     the Presidential designee, but ultimately proves insufficient \n     to serve as a substitute for the 45-day rule. For example, if \n     a waiver is granted for an election because the Presidential \n     designee determines that the comprehensive State plan will \n     give military and overseas voters enough time to vote, but \n     evidence subsequently shows that, in practice during the \n     election cycle, the State plan did not provide enough time to \n     vote, a future waiver request with a similar State plan may \n     not be granted just because it had been approved for the \n     prior election. However, if a waiver is approved and the \n     State plan is proven effective, a similar State plan \n     resubmitted in a subsequent election cycle may be approved \n     again. The key is that the State plan must provide adequate \n     substitute procedures so that UOCAVA voters are given an \n     opportunity to vote that is at least as sufficient as if the \n     State complied with the 45-day rule. In some cases, the State \n     waiver plan may provide even greater protection for UOCAVA \n     voters, and such plans would serve the interests of the \n     UOCAVA voters and the intent of the law. Thus state plans \n     that offer protection for UOCAVA voters that is better than \n     or equal to the 45-day provision and procedures that go \n     beyond other minimum requirements for state assistance for \n     those voters could merit repeated waivers.\n       This section mandates that the Presidential designee can \n     only approve or reject a waiver after consulting with the \n     Attorney General, since the Attorney General is the office \n     that enforces UOCAVA and the provisions of the MOVE Act, and \n     there should be coordination between the two entities. \n     Consultation between the Presidential designee and Attorney \n     General will promote consistency so that election officials \n     do not receive mixed messages about the viability of waiver \n     requests.\n       The Presidential designee may only grant a waiver if a \n     specific standard is met, which is laid out in the MOVE Act. \n     First, the Presidential designee may grant a waiver if one or \n     more of the following circumstances exist to prevent a State \n     from complying with the 45-day rule: (1) the State has a late \n     primary election date, making it impossible to send validly \n     requested ballots to voters 45 days before the election; (2) \n     the State has suffered a delay in generating ballots due to a \n     legal contest, such as a contested primary; or (3) the \n     State's Constitution prohibits the State from complying with \n     the 45-day rule. These are the only three circumstances under \n     which a waiver request may be sought under MOVE.\n       In addition to a finding that at least one of these \n     circumstances exists, the waiver request itself must include, \n     in writing, the following: a recognition of the need to \n     provide overseas voters with enough time to vote; an \n     explanation of the hardship that prevents the State from \n     transmitting absentee ballots 45 days before the election; \n     the number of days prior to the Federal election that the \n     State will transmit absentee ballots to military and overseas \n     voters; and a comprehensive plan ensuring that military and \n     overseas voters are able to receive and return requested \n     absentee ballots in time to be counted. The plan must include \n     the specific steps the State will take to ensure military and \n     overseas voters have time to receive, mark, and submit their \n     ballots in time to have them counted, an explanation of how \n     the plan serves as an effective substitute for the 45-day \n     rule, and relevant information that clearly explains how the \n     plan is sufficient to substitute for the 45-day rule in a \n     manner that allows enough time to vote. States are free to \n     use innovative methods to ensure their comprehensive plan \n     gives military and overseas voters enough time to vote.\n       Testimony before the Rules Committee supported the practice \n     of some States that accept and count UOCAVA ballots after \n     Election Day as one way of protecting the voting rights of \n     their UOCAVA voters. This can be an acceptable option for \n     states whose constitution and laws allow it and who want that \n     flexibility. States must be mindful that even when they count \n     UOCAVA ballots after an election, those voters may not be \n     aware of that procedure. Therefore, a state should ensure \n     that voters get ballots with enough time to vote and inform \n     them of the state's procedures for receiving and counting \n     ballots.\n       To summarize, the Presidential designee can issue a waiver \n     only if one or more of three exigent circumstances exists: a \n     prohibitively late primary date; a legal contest that results \n     in a delay in generating ballots; or a conflict with a \n     State's Constitution. In addition, the Presidential designee \n     makes a determination that the State requesting the waiver \n     has submitted an acceptable plan, containing all necessary \n     information, which provides military and overseas voters with \n     enough time to receive, mark, and submit their absentee \n     ballots in time to have that ballot count in the election. \n     The Presidential designee must consult with the Attorney \n     General before approving a waiver request, since the Attorney \n     General is charged with enforcing and ensuring State \n     compliance with the provisions of UOCAVA and MOVE.\n       Waiver requests must be submitted by the chief State \n     election official to the Presidential designee not later than \n     90 days before the Federal election for which it is \n     requested, and the Presidential designee must approve or deny \n     the waiver not later than 65 days before the election. If the \n     hardship at issue is a legal challenge arising in a way that \n     makes compliance with the 90-day deadline impossible, the \n     State must submit the waiver request as soon as possible and \n     the Presidential designee will approve or reject it not later \n     than 5 business days after its receipt. It is certainly \n     possible that DOD in consultation with DOJ, rather than \n     rejecting a waiver request, might request the State to make \n     modifications in the waiver request that would allow the \n     waiver to be granted.\n       A waiver approved by the Presidential designee is valid \n     only for the Federal election for which the State requested \n     it and cannot be used by a State for any subsequent Federal \n     election. If a State wishes to request a waiver for a \n     subsequent Federal election, it must submit another waiver \n     request.\n     Section 580. Procedures for collection and delivery of marked \n         absentee ballots of absent overseas uniformed services \n         voters.\n       This section amends UOCAVA by directing the Presidential \n     designee to develop and implement procedures for collecting \n     marked absentee ballots, including the Federal write-in \n     absentee ballot, from absent overseas uniformed services \n     voters, and facilitating their delivery in a manner that \n     ensures that the ballots are received by the appropriate \n     election officials in time to be counted.\n       This provision was a response to evidence gathered by the \n     Rules Committee about the unpredictable nature of serving \n     overseas. At the Rules Committee hearing in May 2009, Eric \n     Eversole, formerly an attorney with the Department of Justice \n     Civil Rights Division's Voting Rights Section, testified that \n     an expedited mail delivery system would reduce the ballot \n     delivery time. In circumstances, such as unforeseen military \n     action, where overseas military personnel might be prevented \n     from sending in time to be counted, an expedited mail \n     delivery system would compensate for those numerous,\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\n     unforeseen factors. This requirement also is supported by the \n     statement from Tom Tarantino, Legislative Associate with Iraq \n     and Afghanistan Veterans of America, that the Department of \n     Defense should be responsible for collecting overseas \n     servicemembers' absentee ballots to ensure their delivery, \n     and to make certain that military voters serving overseas are \n     able to return their ballots in a timely and predictable \n     fashion because to do so is ``the most immediate step that \n     Congress can take in protecting the voting rights of service \n     men and women.'' This provision also incorporates language \n     similar to a legislative initiative introduced by Senator \n     Cornyn, who has advocated for DOD to take a direct role in \n     providing expedited ballot delivery.\n       This section directs the Presidential designee to establish \n     procedures for collecting absentee ballots from overseas \n     military voters, and to facilitate their delivery so they are \n     received by local election officials in time to be counted. \n     The Presidential designee must work in conjunction with the \n     U.S. Postal Service to provide expedited mail delivery for \n     all absentee ballots from overseas military members. These \n     ballots will be collected up until noon on the seventh day \n     preceding the date of the upcoming election for expedited \n     transmittal. This section also gives the Presidential \n     designee flexibility to change that deadline if remoteness or \n     other factors associated with military service, such as being \n     located in a combat zone, warrant collecting and transmitting \n     ballots prior to the regular deadline to ensure the ballots \n     can be counted in time.\n       Finally, this section mandates that all ballots sent by \n     military members overseas have to be postmarked by the \n     Military Postal Service with the date the ballot was mailed. \n     In accordance with existing law, it must be carried free of \n     postage. Without a postmark, election officials have been \n     unable to tell when a ballot was mailed, increasing the \n     likelihood of uncounted votes from military personnel. This \n     provision addresses the postmark problem and eliminates the \n     risk of a ballot not being counted for this reason.\n       In carrying out this provision, the Presidential designee \n     is charged with the responsibility of making certain that \n     overseas military voters are aware of the expedited mail \n     procedures and deadlines involved. The Presidential designee \n     shall do this in a number of ways within his discretion, such \n     as making information available via the Global Military \n     Network, through easily accessible websites frequently used \n     by military members, and in the informational forms made \n     available to military members during critical points in \n     service, such as the administrative in-processing at a new \n     installation or base. A later section of MOVE requires the \n     Presidential Designee to create online information portals \n     and use the Global Military Network to inform military voters \n     of voter registration information and absentee ballot rights.\n       In drafting this legislation, the Rules Committee \n     considered a direct mandate on the Department of Defense \n     which would have required that absentee ballots be \n     transmitted to the appropriate election officials by a date \n     certain. In consultation with the Department of Defense, \n     however, personnel of that agency responsible for overseeing \n     absentee voting for overseas military personnel expressed \n     concern that complying with such a provision would be beyond \n     its control. Absentee ballots mailed from abroad enter the \n     domestic mail system once those ballots reach the United \n     States and are no longer under DOD control. This section \n     recognizes that reality, while at the same time solidifying \n     the DOD's role in expediting transit times for these ballots \n     so they can reach local election officials in time to be \n     counted.\n       This section includes three supplemental provisions. First, \n     it directs the chief State election official in each State, \n     working alongside local officials, to develop a free access \n     system whereby all military and overseas voters can track \n     whether or not their absentee ballots have been received by \n     the appropriate election official. This language was \n     suggested by Lt. Col. Joseph DeCaro and others, to ensure \n     that UOCAVA voters know their ballots are similarly situated \n     to domestic absentee voters. Receipt of the UOCAVA ballot by \n     the local election official marks the most important hurdle \n     for overseas voters: getting the completed ballot back to the \n     election office.\n       Second, it mandates that those soldiers who cast ballots at \n     locations under the jurisdiction of the Presidential \n     designee, such as military installations, are able to cast \n     their ballots as privately and independently as possible. \n     Ensuring the privacy of all voters is important, and military \n     voters should be able to vote in a private and independent \n     manner.\n       Third, it directs the Presidential designee to ensure, to \n     the extent practicable, that absentee ballots in the \n     possession or control of the Presidential designee remain \n     private. Again, absentee ballot procedures should protect the \n     privacy of the voters, to the extent practicable.\n       This section only requires expedited mail procedures for \n     overseas service personnel and not all UOCAVA voters. In \n     crafting the legislation, the Rules Committee staff was \n     concerned about the challenges facing non-military overseas \n     voters seeking timely return of their ballots to State \n     election officials. Unfortunately, the problems inherent in \n     engaging every foreign, nonmilitary post office to provide \n     such assistance made this expansion of the expedited mail \n     requirement impractical at the present time. Additionally, \n     several of the challenges justifying the provisions of this \n     section, such as the sporadic lack of postmarks on military \n     mail and unpredictable conditions associated with service, \n     are pervasive problems faced by overseas military personnel. \n     However, under this section State officials are required to \n     develop the tracking system for absentee ballots from both \n     military and overseas voters. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph \n     DeCaro of the United States Air Force testified at the Rules \n     Committee's May 2009 hearing about his frustration at not \n     knowing whether his ballot had been received by State \n     officials. The tracking provision addresses this concern. The \n     Help America Vote Act already requires a free access system \n     to notify voters about whether or not their provisional \n     ballots have been counted. The MOVE Act absentee ballots are \n     not provisional ballots. However, it should not be too \n     difficult for State election officials to develop a system \n     that military and overseas voters can use to get information \n     about the status of their ballots that is similar to the \n     system mandated under HAVA for provision ballots. This will \n     allow those voters to complete FWAB ballots if it becomes \n     clear their ballot was not received in a timely fashion.\n     Section 581. Federal write-in absentee ballot.\n       This section amends UOCAVA to expand the availability and \n     accessibility of the Federal write-in absentee ballot and to \n     promote its use among military and overseas absentee voters.\n       The FWAB functions as a failsafe ballot for military and \n     overseas voters. It allows them to submit this ballot to \n     local election officials in every State in circumstances \n     where they have not received a requested ballot in time from \n     their respective election officials. However, information \n     gathered during Congressional hearings clarified the fact \n     that awareness of the FWAB among military and overseas voters \n     is very low, and therefore an underutilized resource. At the \n     May 2009 hearing on military voting problems held by the \n     Elections Subcommittee of the House Committee on \n     Administration, Gunnery Sergeant Jessie Jane Duff (Ret.) \n     testified that she had never heard of the FWAB despite a \n     twenty-year career as a marine.\n       Under this section, the Presidential designee is required \n     to adopt procedures to promote and expand the use of the FWAB \n     as a back-up measure. As part of this effort and required by \n     other sections of MOVE, the Presidential designee shall take \n     steps to make servicemembers aware of its existence and \n     function, by promoting it through the Global Military Network \n     and at critical points of service (example: such as the \n     administrative check-in of soldiers at a new base or \n     installation).\n       This section also expands the availability and utilization \n     of the FWAB in two significant ways. First, it expands the \n     mandatory availability of the FWAB as a failsafe ballot from \n     use only in general elections, under the original UOCAVA \n     statute, to also include special, primary, and runoff \n     elections for Federal office. This is an important expansion \n     of its use, because special, primary and runoff elections \n     generally have shorter time periods between the time when \n     ballots are made available to voters and Election Day.\n       Second, this section directs the Presidential designee to \n     expand and promote the use of the FWAB as a back-up ballot. \n     As part of this effort, the law directs the Presidential \n     designee to use technology to develop a system under which a \n     military or overseas voter can enter his or her address or \n     other appropriate information, and the system will generate a \n     list of all candidates for Federal office in the voter's \n     jurisdiction. The voter will now have the information needed \n     to fill out the FWAB and submit it to his or her election \n     official. Such technology has already been developed through \n     a partnership between the Pew Center on the States and the \n     Overseas Vote Foundation, as noted in Pew's No Time to Vote: \n     Challenges Facing America's Overseas Military Voters report \n     submitted for the record for the Rules Committee's May 2009 \n     hearing.\n     Section 582. Prohibiting refusal to accept voter registration \n         and absentee ballot applications, marked absentee \n         ballots, and Federal write-in absentee ballots for \n         failure to meet certain requirements.\n       This section amends UOCAVA by prohibiting States from \n     rejecting registration applications, ballot request \n     applications and ballots for reasons unrelated to voter \n     eligibility. The section is a response to evidence gathered \n     by the Rules Committee highlighting the unfortunate practice, \n     in certain jurisdictions, of rejecting absentee ballots and \n     other election materials for immaterial reasons. In his \n     testimony at the May 2009 Rules Committee hearing, Robert \n     Carey of the National Defense Committee recommended \n     eliminating notarization requirements for UOCAVA voters. That \n     recommendation was echoed by representatives of the Pew \n     Center on the States and the Overseas Vote Foundation. While \n     the original draft of MOVE in S. 1415 also eliminated witness \n     requirements in UOCAVA ballots, that provision was removed \n     through committee negotiations. Any witness requirements that \n     may be imposed by States should allow flexibility to ensure a \n     voter can easily complete an absentee ballot. Any complex \n     witness requirements make it more difficult for military and \n     overseas voters to complete and cast an absentee ballot.\n       The first provision of this section prohibits States from \n     rejecting otherwise valid voter\n\n[[Page S4520]]\n\n     registration applications, absentee ballot applications \n     (including the official post card form prescribed under \n     UOCAVA), and marked absentee ballots submitted by military \n     and overseas voters solely on the basis of notarization \n     requirements, restrictions on paper type, and restrictions on \n     envelope type. In some cases, the need to photocopy a ballot \n     may result in a completed absentee ballot on different paper. \n     No jurisdiction should reject a properly completed form \n     simply because of the paper used.\n       The second provision contains similar prohibitions on \n     rejecting the FWAB. It prohibits States from rejecting marked \n     FWAB ballots solely because of notarization requirements, \n     restrictions on paper type, and restrictions on envelope \n     type.\n     Section 583. Federal Voting Assistance Program (``FVAP'').\n       This section amends UOCAVA to improve the Federal Voting \n     Assistance Program for military voters. These provisions \n     increase the availability of materials containing information \n     on absentee voting procedures for military voters, as well as \n     expand the overall awareness of such procedures.\n       The section directs the Presidential designee to take two \n     major steps to meet this end--first, to create an online \n     portal of information where our military can access \n     information about registration and balloting procedures in \n     their respective States; and second, to establish a program \n     using the Global Military Network, an email network that \n     reaches out to virtually every member of our military, to \n     notify servicemembers 90, 60, and 30 days prior to each \n     election for Federal office of voter registration information \n     and resources, the availability of the Federal postcard \n     application, and the availability of the FWAB as a fail-safe \n     ballot.\n       It should be noted that the sponsors of the MOVE Act \n     acknowledged that the Department of Defense already had a \n     number of regulations in place to try to assist \n     servicemembers in exercising their right to vote. Therefore, \n     a provision was included to clarify that the provisions of \n     MOVE were not meant to eliminate any other duties or \n     obligations promulgated by the DOD that are not inconsistent \n     or contradictory with the MOVE Act.\n       The section mandates that not later than 180 days after \n     passage of the MOVE Act, the Secretary of each military \n     department of the Armed Forces must designate offices on \n     military installations under their jurisdiction to provide \n     comprehensive voter registration services for troops and \n     their families. The office will serve as a clearinghouse for \n     providing servicemembers the opportunity to receive \n     information on the following: voter registration and absentee \n     ballot procedures, information and assistance with \n     registering to vote in their States, information and \n     assistance with updating the individual's voter registration \n     information, including instructions on how to use and submit \n     the Federal postcard application as a change of address form, \n     and information and assistance with requesting an absentee \n     ballot from the voter's local election official.\n       The section gives priority to individuals transitioning \n     through critical points in their service, such as individuals \n     who are undergoing a permanent change of duty station, \n     deploying overseas for at least six months, returning from an \n     overseas deployment of at least six months, or who otherwise \n     request assistance related to voter registration. These \n     resources are required by this section to be provided at \n     least during the administrative processing associated with \n     these points in service. By detailing exactly which points in \n     time servicemembers are to receive such information, this \n     section ensures that these voter resources can be most easily \n     and efficiently provided to our troops. As a result, their \n     ability to participate in Federal elections will be \n     dramatically increased.\n       The Secretary of each military department (or the \n     Presidential designee) is required to take steps to make the \n     availability of these resources known to military voters \n     through outreach efforts that include the availability of the \n     designated voter registration offices and the time, location, \n     and manner in which military voters may access such \n     assistance. The Presidential designee and Secretaries of \n     military departments are free to undertake a variety of \n     methods to satisfy this provision, including the requirements \n     in other sections of MOVE to inform servicemembers of the \n     ballot collection and expedited delivery procedures.\n       Finally, this section allows the Secretary of Defense to \n     authorize the Secretaries of the military departments of the \n     Armed Forces to designate offices on military installations \n     as voter registration agencies under Sec. 7(a)(2) of the \n     National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA).\n       Under the provisions of the MOVE Act as passed by the \n     Senate, the offices designated to provide voter registration \n     assistance were required to be uniformly deemed voter \n     registration agencies under the NVRA. In the conference \n     committee for the NDAA, this requirement was changed from \n     mandatory NVRA designation to giving the Secretaries the \n     option of designating the voter registration offices as NVRA \n     agencies.\n       There are good reasons for designating these voting \n     assistance offices as voter registration agencies under the \n     NVRA. Designation provides a minimum, uniform standard by \n     which these offices must provide voter registration \n     assistance and ensures such assistance is effective. First, \n     pursuant to Sec. 7(a)(4)(A) of the National Voter \n     Registration Act, such offices must provide mail voter \n     registration forms, assistance in completing voter \n     registration application forms, and acceptance of such forms \n     for transmittal to State officials. The Federal postcard \n     application can be used for this purpose because it is an \n     acceptable voter registration form under the NVRA. Second, \n     under Sec. 7(d), accepted registration forms have to be \n     transmitted to State officials within 10 days of acceptance, \n     or if accepted, within 5 days before the last day for \n     registration to vote in an election, not later than 5 days \n     after the date of acceptance. Furthermore, any individuals \n     providing registration assistance in such an office are \n     prohibited from doing the following: seeking to influence an \n     applicant's political preference or party allegiance; \n     displaying any political preference or party allegiance; \n     making any statement to the applicant that would discourage \n     registration; or making any statements with the purpose or \n     effect of leading the applicant to believe that a decision to \n     register has any bearing on other services provided at that \n     office. The NVRA sets a uniform standard by which these \n     offices must provide voter registration by ensuring an \n     expansive provision of voter registration assistance and \n     protecting against inadequate assistance and deficiencies in \n     registration services. Without the opportunity or ability to \n     register in an effective way, our military cannot vote.\n       While some have expressed concern with requiring DOD to run \n     an NVRA voter registration agency, this is not a new role for \n     the Department of Defense. The Department is already \n     responsible, and has been for well over a decade, for \n     administering the NVRA at designated offices. More than 6,000 \n     military recruitment offices are currently required to \n     provide information, registration assistance, and \n     opportunities to register to vote in conformance with the \n     NVRA. Further, these offices would only be required to \n     provide the necessary voting assistance to individuals who \n     are seeking other appropriate services at the military \n     recruitment offices and not to any person who may happen to \n     walk in and request it.\n       Nor are these offices required to operate as stand-alone \n     voter registration agencies. Similar to other State \n     government agencies operating NVRA-designated voter \n     registration agencies, such as State social service offices, \n     Departments of Motor Vehicles, and the like, DOD can provide \n     voter registration services in offices that have a different \n     primary function such as pay, personnel, and identification \n     offices.\n       Following the passage of the MOVE Act, it is notable that \n     Chairman Schumer and Senator Cornyn sent a letter on December \n     4, 2009 to Secretary Gates requesting that he make the \n     determination, which he authorized to do under the NVRA, that \n     the Department of Defense would be designated as a ``voter \n     registration agency'' under the Act. In a letter back to \n     Senators Schumer and Cornyn, dated December 16, 2009, the \n     Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn, III, agreed to \n     ``designate all military installation voting assistance \n     offices as NVRA agencies.''\n       Finally, the Secretary of Defense is required to prescribe \n     regulations relating to the administration of this section, \n     which must be prescribed and implemented by the November 2010 \n     Federal elections.\n     Section 584. Development of standards for reporting and \n         storing certain data.\n       This section amends the UOCAVA statute to direct the \n     Presidential designee to work with the Election Assistance \n     Commission and the chief State election official of each \n     State to develop standards for reporting data on the number \n     of absentee ballots transmitted to and received from overseas \n     voters, as well as other data the Presidential designee \n     determines to be appropriate. States are required to report \n     this data as the Presidential designee, in accordance with \n     the standards developed by the Presidential designee under \n     this section. The Presidential designee is directed to store \n     such data, and should make that data publically available as \n     appropriate under the law.\n     Section 585. Repeal of provisions relating to use of single \n         application for all subsequent elections.\n       This section repeals Sec. 104(a)--Sec. 104(d) of the UOCAVA \n     statute. These provisions required States, once they \n     processed an official post card form received by military and \n     overseas voters, to send an absentee ballot to that voter for \n     each Federal election held in the State through the next two \n     regularly scheduled general elections for Federal office, \n     provided the voter indicated he/she wished the State to do \n     so. It has been reported by State and local officials that \n     this section of UOCAVA has led to inefficiency as blank \n     absentee ballots are sent to voters who have moved or are no \n     longer registered in the same location where they originally \n     registered. Because some military and overseas voters in \n     particular tend to be highly mobile, it is reported that this \n     provision was difficult to implement effectively. The \n     Committee responded by eliminating this federal mandate. \n     States, however, are free to continue absentee programs that \n     they find effective and convenient for voters, whether they \n     be domestic or overseas voters.\n     Section 586. Reporting requirements.\n       This section amends UOCAVA to include additional \n     requirements for reporting information to the Congressional \n     committees of jurisdiction, including the Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Armed Services, and \n     the Senate\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\n     Committee on Rules and Administration, and the House \n     Committee on Appropriations, the House Committee on Armed \n     Services, and the House Administration Committees.\n       The first provision is a requirement for the Presidential \n     designee to submit a report to these committees not later \n     than 180 days after the enactment of the MOVE Act. The report \n     is to include (a) the status of the implementation of the \n     procedures on collection and delivery of absentee ballots \n     from overseas military personnel, including specific steps \n     taken in preparation for the November 2010 general election; \n     and (b) an assessment of the Voting Assistance Officer (VAO) \n     Program of the Department of Defense, including an evaluation \n     of effectiveness, an inventory and full explanation of any \n     programmatic failures, and a description of any new programs \n     to replace or supplement existing efforts.\n       The Voting Assistance Officer (VAO) program is administered \n     by the Department of Defense to provide military personnel \n     with person-to-person guidance in understanding absentee \n     voting procedures and helping overseas military personnel \n     with the absentee voting process. However, the Rules \n     Committee gathered evidence during the drafting of this \n     legislation indicating the need for improvements in the VAO \n     program. Tom Tarantino, Legislative Associate with Iraq and \n     Afghanistan Veterans of America, submitted written testimony \n     that he had been poorly trained when he served as a VAO. A \n     report from the Department of Defense Inspector General \n     revealed that in 2004, voting assistance officers made \n     contact with only 40%-50% of military voters. Also, it was \n     made known to the Rules Committee that serving as a VAO is \n     often seen as a low-level military assignment, so it is not \n     given much priority in practice. The reporting requirements \n     established under this section will provide the new FVAP \n     chief with the time to assess existing programs and suggest \n     improvements, all with the goal of providing more overseas \n     and military voters with the information and support \n     necessary for them to exercise their right to vote.\n       The second reporting requirement is an annual report to \n     Congress, due no later than March 31 of each year. In this \n     report, the Presidential designee must include the following: \n     (a) an assessment of the effectiveness of the FVAP program, \n     including an examination on the effectiveness of the new \n     responsibilities established by the MOVE Act; (b) an \n     assessment of voter registration and participation by \n     overseas military voters; (c) an assessment of registration \n     and participation by non-military overseas absentee voters; \n     and (d) a description of cooperative efforts between State \n     and Federal officials. The report should also include a \n     description of the voter registration assistance provided by \n     offices designated on military installations utilized by \n     servicemembers and a description of the specific programs \n     implemented by each military department of the Armed Forces \n     to designate offices and provide assistance. Finally, the \n     report should include the number of uniformed services \n     members utilizing voter registration assistance at the \n     designated offices.\n       When the annual report is issued in years following a \n     general election for Federal office, it should include a \n     description of the procedures utilized for collecting and \n     delivering marked absentee ballots, noting how many such \n     ballots were collected and delivered, how many were not \n     delivered in time before the closing of polls on Election \n     Day, and the reasons for non-delivery.\n       These reporting requirements are a direct consequence of \n     the interest of Congress in initial compliance with the MOVE \n     Act and with its routine implementation over time. These \n     reports will provide a key indicator of how effective \n     absentee voting procedures are for overseas Americans in case \n     additional reform is needed in the future.\n     Section 587. Annual report on enforcement.\n       This section amends the UOCAVA statute to require the \n     Attorney General to send a report to Congress no later than \n     December 31 of each year regarding what actions the \n     Department of Justice has taken to enforce UOCAVA and the \n     MOVE Act amendments to UOCAVA.\n       Since UOCAVA's passage in 1987, the Justice Department has \n     filed 35 compliance suits against the States. Congress should \n     be updated on a regular basis on efforts made to comply with \n     federal military and overseas voting statutes. These reports \n     will provide the Rules Committee and other Congressional \n     committees with a key tool for oversight, in anticipation of \n     the Justice Department playing a key role in overseeing the \n     implementation and enforcement of the MOVE Act.\n     Section 588. Requirements payments.\n       This section amends the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of \n     2002 to establish a new funding authorization, in addition to \n     the funding authorizations already in place under HAVA, \n     intended to be used only to meet the new requirements under \n     UOCAVA imposed as a result of the provisions of and \n     amendments made by MOVE. The language of the MOVE Act \n     indicates that separate from a HAVA requirements payment; \n     Congress has authorized, and can specifically appropriate \n     funds for requirements payments ``appropriated pursuant to \n     the authorization under section 257(a)(4) only to meet the \n     requirements under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens \n     Absentee Voting Act imposed as a result of the provisions of \n     and amendments made by the Military and Overseas Voter \n     Empowerment Act.'' The appropriation would specifically \n     reference a MOVE requirements payment. That MOVE requirements \n     payment can be used only to meet the requirements of the MOVE \n     Act. Nothing in this section impacts the ability of States to \n     receive and spend funds on the traditional HAVA requirements \n     payment program.\n       States must describe in their State plan how they will \n     comply with the provisions and requirements of and amendments \n     made by MOVE. Under amendments made in conference committee, \n     chief State election officials may access MOVE requirements \n     payments without providing the 5% match upfront. This section \n     was amended in contemplation of providing funding for those \n     States whose legislatures do not meet on an annual basis.\n       Further, States may choose to use the original funding \n     authorizations under HAVA, those adopted as part of the \n     original HAVA statute, to fund MOVE related compliance \n     efforts so long as the State meets all of its other \n     obligations under HAVA. The provisions of the MOVE Act can \n     certainly be considered an activity ``to improve the \n     administration of elections for Federal office'' under the \n     HAVA requirements payments language.\n     Section 589. Technology pilot program.\n       This section gives the Presidential designee the authority \n     to establish one or more pilot programs under which new \n     election technologies can be tested for the benefit of \n     military and overseas voters under the UOCAVA statute. The \n     conduct of the program will be at the discretion of the \n     Presidential designee and shall not conflict with any \n     existing laws, regulations, or procedures.\n       Mindful of security concerns, the Rules Committee included \n     several items for the Presidential designee to consider in \n     crafting this pilot program. These include transmitting \n     electronic information across military networks, \n     cryptographic voting systems, the transmission of ballot \n     representations and scanned pictures of ballots in a secure \n     manner, the utilization of voting stations at military bases, \n     and document delivery and upload systems. There may be many \n     positive developments made by DOD pilot programs that can \n     assist in expedited voting procedures for military and \n     overseas voters. Security and privacy, of course, are \n     essential components to any pilot program.\n       Under this section, the Presidential designee is required \n     to submit to Congress reports on the progress of any such \n     pilot programs, including recommendations for additional \n     programs and any legislative or administrative action deemed \n     appropriate.\n       This section directs the Election Assistance Commission \n     (EAC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology \n     (NIST) at the Department of Commerce to work with the \n     Presidential designee in the creation and support of such \n     pilot programs. The bill requires the EAC and NIST to provide \n     the Presidential designee with ``best practices or \n     standards'' regarding electronic absentee voting guidelines. \n     In particular, the MOVE Act directs the EAC and the NIST to \n     work to develop best practices which conform with the \n     electronic absentee voting guidelines established under the \n     first sentence of section 1604(a)(2) of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (P.L. 107-107), as \n     amended by Sec. 507 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (P.L. 108-375). The \n     Committee staff contemplates that NIST will be helpful in \n     addressing the election integrity and security concerns \n     involved in developing electronic voting systems, as \n     illustrated by NIST report entitled ``Threat Analysis on \n     UOCAVA Voting Systems'' of December 2008 (NISTIR 7551).\n       This section also directs that, if the EAC has not \n     established electronic absentee voting guidelines by not \n     later than 180 days after enactment of the MOVE Act, then the \n     EAC is to submit to Congress a report detailing why it has \n     not done so, a timeline for the establishment of such \n     guidelines, and a detailed accounting of its actions in \n     developing such guidelines. This should provide to Congress \n     and the public a roadmap on progress made, as well as the \n     next steps the EAC plans to take.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4521-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4521-S4522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE ARKANSAS AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

In \nparticular, I recognize the members of the 188th Fighter Wing, who are \nreturning home throughout May after a 2 month deployment overseas.\n  The airmen spent 2 months at Kandahar Airfield in southern \nAfghanistan, flying 12 to 16 flights a day. Their day-and-night \noperations supported the ground troops who were fighting enemy \ninsurgents. The work in Afghanistan was the unit's first combat \ndeployment using A-10s. The unit flew F-16s until April 2007, including \nduring their 4 month deployment in 2005 to Balad Air Base in Iraq.\n  Along with all Arkansans, I honor these servicemen and women for \ntheir bravery, and I am grateful for their service and sacrifice.\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\n  More than 11,000 Arkansans on active duty and more than 10,000 \nArkansas reservists have served in Iraq or Afghanistan since September \n11, 2001.

Mr. President, I rise today to remember the life of \nSenator Craig Thomas.\n  Senator Thomas passed away on June 4, 2007. On that day, the people \nof Wyoming lost a native son. His presence back home is still missed.\n  One week from tomorrow will be the third anniversary of Craig's \ndeath. A column recognizing Craig's life and the Craig and Susan Thomas \nFoundation will be circulated across Wyoming next week. It reminds us \nof Craig's toughness, his love for Wyoming, and his commitment to \nchallenging young people to succeed.\n  It is an appropriate tribute to Senator Thomas. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Craig Thomas--A Life's Work Goes On\n\n                           (By Gale Geringer)\n\n       It's hard to believe that June 4th marks the third \n     anniversary of Senator Craig Thomas' death in 2007.\n       Craig's wisdom and dedication to Wyoming people is dearly \n     missed.\n       The passion he had for making Wyoming an even better place \n     lives on strong when we need it most. In these economic \n     times, when some young people have an especially tough time \n     with financial or family issues, Craig Thomas' dedication to \n     our future is an example we need to remember.\n       Craig was compassionate but it came with toughness. He \n     respected young people and so expected a lot of them. He \n     encouraged our youth to succeed and he approached that from \n     the standpoint of a Captain in the United States Marine \n     Corps. He taught personal responsibility and self reliance. \n     He believed in being on time and ready to learn or work.\n       Craig motivated thousands of young people, urging them to \n     be the best they can be, whatever their circumstances. He \n     didn't come from money and didn't place a lot of value on \n     pedigrees. He believed each individual had it within him/\n     herself to rise above hardships and become productive, \n     contributing members of society but he also recognized that \n     everyone learns at a different level.\n       So for kids who might have fallen through the cracks, or \n     were in the middle or bottom of their class, what a welcome \n     inspiration they could find in Craig Thomas.\n       The Craig and Susan Thomas Foundation is born directly from \n     that ethic and from the life-long experience and caring \n     counsel of his wife, Susan.\n       The Foundation, now in its third year, continues to fulfill \n     a promise and helps young people try for that second, third, \n     even fourth chance at education and life fulfillment.\n       With scholarships to Wyoming's community colleges, the \n     University, vocational and technical schools or online \n     education, the Craig and Susan Foundation is changing lives. \n     The Foundation believes that it doesn't matter where students \n     are from, what their grade point average was, or whether they \n     had excelled in something before. It matters that today they \n     want to try and know that someone cares.\n       In addition to its other programs, the Foundation also \n     gives annual leadership awards to adults who work to support \n     at-risk youth in Wyoming, mentoring, educating or counseling \n     children to achieve their goals.\n       One scholarship recipient, who is finishing his second year \n     in college, tells this story, ``My early years were spent in \n     various stages of poverty, abuse and neglect. I spent my teen \n     years in foster/legal guardian care situations. I am and will \n     remain drug free. I choose my circle of friends wisely. Now \n     I'm majoring in Business Management at LCCC where I am \n     getting good grades. It is very expensive and I need help. I \n     ask for your assistance in helping me to make the very best \n     of my life. College expenses are the greatest obstacle \n     between me, my education and my success as a self-reliant, \n     valuable member of my community.''\n       To date, 53 scholarships have already been awarded, \n     including five to students who are older and have been able \n     to improve their job prospects because they've obtained \n     degrees or certificates.\n       The idea is simple. Our children deserve an opportunity to \n     build happy and successful lives for themselves regardless of \n     power or place.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nFoster Care Month, a time to recognize and shine a light on the needs \nof our foster children in Arkansas and across the U.S. and to highlight \nthe countless men, women, and families who work tirelessly on their \nbehalf.\n  Arkansas has more than 3,500 children in foster care. It is \nimperative that we ensure their safety and well-being and work to find \nthem a permanent family to provide the love and support they need and \ndesire. That is why I have introduced my Child Welfare Workforce Study \nAct, which will help identify the barriers that prevent children and \nfamilies from accessing the essential services they need. It will also \nbetter ensure that necessary steps are taken to recruit and retain a \nquality and experienced workforce that can effectively address the \nneeds and risks of our Nation's most vulnerable children and the \nfamilies that provide them care.\n  With thousands of children in Arkansas seeking nothing but a safe and \nstable family to provide them comfort and security, we have a \nresponsibility to ensure that families are adequately prepared to \nprovide them with the care and supervision they deserve. These families \nshould be appropriately supported and equipped with the resources they \nneed.\n  Our current system is burdened by the ongoing challenges of \nrecruiting and retaining enough families to care for and welcome these \nchildren into their homes, and experienced caseworkers to effectively \nmanage their cases. We have children slipping through the cracks, and \nthat is simply unacceptable. We need to create an environment that best \nprovides for the well-being of these children and that most effectively \nhelps them find a loving and permanent home.\n  I have also introduced the Resource Family Recruitment and Retention \nAct, which establishes much-needed standards of consistency in agency \nand state policies for foster and adoptive care. It also calls on \nagencies to follow best practices proven to increase and retain the \nnumber of foster, adoptive and kinship parents. These practices include \nefforts to allow foster parents to actively participate and have input \nin the case-planning and decisionmaking process regarding the child; to \nreceive complete and timely responses from the agency; and to receive \nsupport services and appropriate training that will enhance the skills \nand ability of resource parents to meet their children's needs. \nFinally, the bill establishes a grant program to better allow states to \ndevelop innovative methods of education and support for families.\n  As lawmakers, it is our role to honor the critical role that foster \nfamilies play in the lives of foster youth and provide them with the \nservices and the support they need. Foster children seek nothing more \nthan a safe, loving and permanent home, and resource families often \nhelp address this need. By strengthening efforts to recruit and retain \nthese families, we also enhance our best recruitment tool, and retain \nprospective adoptive resources.\n  As members of this body, we have an obligation to do right by those \nwhom we represent each and every day. We also have a moral obligation \nto do everything we can on behalf of the most vulnerable in our \nsociety. For the over 500,000 children in foster care and the many \nthousands of families who have provided them with the love and support \nthey desperately need, it is the least we can do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4522-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4522-S4523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                EARMARKS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, with all of the recent talk of \nearmarks,\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\nI want to share an op-ed that I wrote for the Nashville Tennessean and \nappeared in that paper on May 19 about the importance of asking \nCongress to fund Tennessee projects. Following is the text of that \narticle:\n\n       In 2007, the Corps of Engineers told me that two big flood \n     control dams on the Cumberland River system were near \n     failure. I asked for and Congress approved $120 million to \n     begin repairing Center Hill and Wolf Creek Dams.\n       During the recent flood, these repairs kept water levels \n     higher behind these dams, which in turn kept millions of \n     gallons out of the Cumberland River. According to the Corps, \n     if Wolf Creek Dam had failed, flooding in Nashville would \n     have been 4 feet higher. My $120 million appropriation \n     request was called an ``earmark.''\n       Here is another ``earmark.'' In 2003, 40 Clarksville \n     community leaders visited me in Washington. They and the \n     commander of the 101st Airborne, GEN David Petraeus, wanted \n     new housing for soldiers returning from Iraq. This was their \n     top priority, but the money was not in President George W. \n     Bush's budget. Over 3 years, I asked for $196 million. \n     Congress approved. By 2007, when the most-deployed troops in \n     America came home, new housing was ready.\n       Some say abolishing such earmarks will help solve \n     Washington's out-of-control spending. I say this is a hoax, \n     for two reasons:\n       1. Abolishing earmarks doesn't reduce the Federal debt one \n     penny. If I ask for a Tennessee project and Congress \n     approves, other spending in the budget is reduced by an equal \n     amount. This debate over earmarks is a sideshow. The main \n     show is the Democratic budget that would double the Federal \n     debt in 5 years and triple it in 10. The way to control \n     Federal spending is, first, to limit growth of discretionary \n     spending to 2 percent a year--40 percent of the budget--and, \n     second, to slow down automatic entitlement spending--most of \n     the rest of the budget. Earmarks total 1 percent of all \n     spending--and, again, earmarks add zero to total spending.\n       2. Under article I of the U.S. Constitution, only \n     Congress--not the President--appropriates funds. When \n     Tennesseans come to see me about making Center Hill and Wolf \n     Creek Dams safe or improving housing at Fort Campbell, my job \n     is not to give them President Obama's telephone number.\n       Some appropriations are vital.\n       Then, you might ask, why all the fuss? Because some Members \n     of Congress have abused earmarks. Some ask for silly ones. \n     Some ask for too many. Two were convicted of taking campaign \n     contributions in exchange for recommending projects. Perhaps \n     a senator is more likely to vote for a bill that includes his \n     or her appropriations amendment--but this can be said about \n     any amendment to any bill.\n       My view is that if you have a couple of bad acts on the \n     Grand Ole Opry, you don't cancel the Opry, you cancel the \n     acts. That is why some Congressmen lose elections and some \n     are in jail. That is why Congress ended middle-of-the-night \n     earmarks and even required its Members to attest that \n     appropriations do not benefit them or their families. That is \n     why 2 years ago I voted for a 1-year moratorium on earmarks \n     to encourage more reforms. Now I am cosponsoring Senator Tom \n     Coburn's legislation to put all earmarks on one Web site to \n     make them easier to find. Tennessee projects already are on \n     my Web site.\n       Some specific appropriations are vital to our State, and to \n     our country. The Human Genome Project was an earmark. The \n     Manhattan Project that won World War II was an earmark.\n       It might be easier for me to say, ``OK, no more earmarks.'' \n     Then I wouldn't have to explain them in articles like this. \n     But how would I explain to Clarksvillians why soldiers \n     returning from Iraq didn't get new housing or to Nashvillians \n     why the water was 4 feet higher during the flood? Make no \n     mistake: If I had not asked, there would not have been enough \n     Federal money for that housing or to repair those dams.\n       Just last week, the President asked for specific \n     appropriations for the gulf coast oilspill, but not for \n     flooding in 52 Tennessee counties. I did ask, and the Senate \n     Committee approved. I did not want Washington to overlook the \n     worst natural disaster since the president took office just \n     because Tennesseans are cleaning up and helping one another \n     instead of complaining and looting. Sometimes the job I was \n     elected to do includes asking Congress to fund worthwhile \n     Tennessee projects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4523-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW BERGER\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding \ncontributions of one of my staff members, Matthew Berger, during his \nnearly 5 years of service to the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship and to the people of this country. Matthew has decided \nto begin a new professional chapter in his life, and when he leaves the \nSenate this month, there will be a noticeable void in my staff.\n  Matthew began his work with the committee in September 2005, starting \nas a special assistant to the staff director and quickly transitioning \nto become a professional staff member the next year. In his role as \nprofessional staff, Matthew became my principal adviser on economic \nmatters, and he helped me develop legislation and policy ideas on a \nhost of issues, from the annual Federal budget process to Social \nSecurity and pensions. For the last 2 years, Matthew has served as \neconomist and press secretary for my committee staff, a far-reaching \nrole that afforded him the ability to display his many talents, \nincluding his strong writing style and vast knowledge of all matters \npertaining to the Nation's financial system.\n  Over the past several years, Matthew has played a critical role in \nassisting me to develop and introduce legislation on a variety of \nissues. His research efforts were crucial in my developing the Home \nOffice Tax Deduction Simplification Act in both the 110th and 111th \nCongresses, as well as numerous amendments to a variety of bills, \nincluding the recent financial regulatory reform legislation. Matthew \nwas my lead staff member for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nas well as for the yearly budget resolution, and as such, he is \ncertainly well versed in the Senate amendment process. Matthew's \nefforts to promote my legislative priorities frequently helped me \nattract a broad coalition of cosponsors. Matthew has also helped me \ndraft detailed editorials for several national and local Maine \npublications.\n  Prior to joining my committee staff, Matthew spent 5\\1/2\\ years \nworking on tax issues for Deloitte Tax LLP and developing a solid \nunderstanding and knowledge of our Nation's tax policy, making him a \ntremendous asset as soon as he began his work on the Hill. As a \nnational tax manager, Matthew advised numerous clients on the impacts \nof tax law, helping them anticipate and adjust to any changes in the \nlaw. During his time at Deloitte, Matthew authored several articles and \nportions of books, and contributed frequently to Tax News & Views, one \nof the company's publications for its clientele. Additionally, he was \ninstrumental in the design, launch, and management of Tax News & Views: \nHealth Care Edition, which highlighted recent judicial, regulatory, and \ntax developments regarding health care. Matthew also served as a \nresearch assistant at the Hoover Institution during his time at \nStanford University, where he earned his degree in economics.\n  Matthew's next endeavor takes him to the National Multi Housing \nCouncil, where he will be the vice president of tax. I am confident \nthat they will benefit greatly from Matthew's unparalleled knowledge of \nthe Tax Code, as well as his admirable work ethic and tremendous \ndedication to what he does. They will also be getting a true team \nplayer--someone who establishes and cultivates strong relationships \nwith his colleagues. And despite the whirlwind Senate schedule, Matthew \nfrequently found the time on Monday evenings to platoon at first base \nfor my office's softball team, ``Snowe Business.''\n  Over the past 5 years, I have been consistently impressed by \nMatthew's passion for public service. I am grateful for his incredible \nwillingness to work long hours to help me prepare for hearings and \nmeetings, and I am indebted to him for his involvement in helping shape \nsome of the most significant domestic legislation of our lifetimes. \nFrom the economic stimulus legislation we passed last February to the \nfinancial regulatory reform bill we completed just last week, Matthew \nhas been a key asset in a number of considerable policy matters during \nhis time on the Hill. I will miss his tremendous contributions to my \noffice and his remarkable analytical skills and institutional \nknowledge. While I am sad to see him leave, I wish both he and his \nbeautiful wife LaNitra the best in their incredibly bright futures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4523-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4523-S4524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WALTON GRESHAM, III\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. Gresham has been exceptional in helping legislators on \nthe Federal, State, and local levels understand the difficult issues \nconfronted by the LP-Gas business.

Mr. President, I speak in memory of a great \nAmerican, a champion of human rights, and a personal hero of mine, \nWhitney Harris.\n  Whitney Harris, who passed away last month at the age of 98, was the \nlast surviving Nuremberg prosecutor. He served alongside my father \nduring the trials of Nazi war criminals, and was the lead prosecutor in \nthe very first of those trials, which resulted in the conviction of the \nman who led the Nazi Security Police, including the dreaded Gestapo. \nAnd he was part of the team that brought to justice the former \ncommander of the concentration camp at Auschwitz. Whitney's work earned \nhim the Legion of Merit.\n  I, of course, got to know Whitney through my father. Men like them \nwho took part in that unique episode in world history carried with them \nboth the honor that comes with such good work and the burden that comes \nwith confronting evil at such close range. My father's resulting \npassion to continue doing good works was so strong that it inspired not \njust his public service, but also my own. And while so many have spent \nthe decades since World War II attempting to come to terms with what \nthey saw, Whitney Harris has done incredible work helping all of us to \nunderstand what it all meant.\n  He believed that the United Nations should create a permanent \ninternational war crimes tribunal because he knew that the Holocaust \nwas merely the most egregious manifestation of the evil that man is \ncapable of inflicting.\n  Whitney wrote a poem once that he read at a Holocaust Observance Day \nceremony. It read, in part: ``A thousand years have passed. What was \nthe number killed at Auschwitz? It matters not. Twas but a trifle in \nthe history of massacre of man by man.''\n  The work he did at Nuremberg is enough to cement Whitney Harris's \nplace among the great legal giants and the great defenders of humanity \nof his generation. But his work since his speaking, his writing, his \nteaching represent an invaluable contribution to future generations.\n  To his beloved wife Anna and his wonderful family, I join Whitney's \nmany admirers in sharing your sense of loss at his passing and your \npride in his many accomplishments.\n  He lived a life in service to the world. And the world is better for \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4524-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF NORFORK\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I recognize the residents \nof Norfork in my home State of Arkansas as they commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of their town's founding.\n  In conjunction with the annual ``Pioneer Days'' festival, Norfork \ncelebrated its historic milestone with events throughout the community, \nincluding a Dutch oven cook-off, music, a Civil War re-enactment, a 5K \nwalk/run, food, games, and a photo exhibit showing local scenes, \npioneers and historic sites. These events symbolize the history, \nheritage, and community spirit that define Norfork and its citizens.\n  With a population of 484, Norfork claims four sites on the National \nRegister of Historic Places. Probably the best known is the 1829 Jacob \nWolf House, a territorial courthouse and the oldest remaining public \nstructure in Arkansas. I was proud to help authorize a study to \ndetermine the feasibility of naming the Jacob Wolf House a park within \nthe National Park System.\n  Also on the National Register are the Davis House, a 1928 pyramid-\nroofed cottage; the Horace Mann school complex, including the main \nschool building constructed by the Works Progress Administration in \n1936; and the North Fork Bridge, a steel deck truss span built 70 feet \nabove the river in 1937.\n  I salute the residents of Norfork for their efforts to maintain the \nbeauty and history of their community.

These men and women work tirelessly to provide safe, secure \nhomes for families who would not otherwise be able to afford them.\n  Under the leadership of CEO Bill Plunkett, Habitat for Humanity of \nPulaski County celebrates two milestones this year: its 20th \nanniversary and construction of its 100th home. Habitat built its first \nhome in Little Rock in 1990. More than 75 families in Pulaski County \nown homes built and financed with Habitat, and more homes are under \nconstruction.\n  I commend the efforts of Habitat for Humanity, which works to \neliminate substandard housing while providing simple, decent housing to \nqualified low-income families. In addition to building homes, Habitat \nbuilds a spirit of community and cooperation among its volunteers, \nsupporters and beneficiaries.\n  Habitat for Humanity of Pulaski County also partners with other \ncommunity development organizations to rebuild neighborhoods. For \nexample, Habitat and the Argenta Community Development Corporation are \ncurrently building and rehabilitating a home in the HOLT neighborhood \nin North Little Rock. As a result of their activity, the city of North \nLittle Rock recently built a children's park in this neighborhood.\n  Along with all Arkansans, I congratulate the entire Habitat team for \ntheir efforts to help our central Arkansas families in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4524-5", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4524-S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LINDOL ATKINS, JR.\n\n Mr. SANDERS.

For more than 35 years, Lindol Atkins has \nprovided spirited\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\nand dedicated leadership in representing municipal employees in \nBurlington. As a former mayor of Burlington, I can attest firsthand \nthat Mr. Atkins has distinguished himself as an indomitable leader of \nworkers' rights efforts in the State of Vermont.\n  Lindol Atkins began his fight to improve the rights and protections \nof Burlington city employees back in 1968 when he joined AFSCME. \nElected president of AFSCME Local 1343 in 1970, Lindol continued his \nmission to advance the rights of workers by skillfully handling all \ngrievance and arbitration cases. As the lead negotiator for the union, \nhe also led many successful contract campaigns that ultimately improved \nemployees' wages and working conditions. In 2005, Mr. Atkins retired as \npresident of the Burlington AFSCME local, but rather than slow down and \nenjoy his well-earned rest he continued his leadership role within the \nlabor movement by being elected president of the Vermont State Labor \nCouncil, AFL-CIO.\n  A husband and father of 12, Lindol Atkins has the enviable ability to \nbe able to do many things well--a wonderful and necessary quality in \none with such a deep devotion to the labor movement as well as to his \nlarge, loving family. Indeed, it is the dedicated and remarkable people \nlike Lindol Atkins who have kept America moving forward. His \nunparalleled commitment to civic values has been a major factor in \nearning Vermont its well-deserved reputation for social justice and \nprincipled community leadership. Lindol has received many awards for \nhis work guiding Vermont's labor movement, with the capstone being the \npresentation of this year's AFL-CIO Presidential Lifetime Achievement \nAward.\n  The quality of life in Vermont, and in our Nation, is strengthened by \nindividuals such as Lindol Atkins, Jr., whose quest to better working \nconditions for men and women in his community has brought a great sense \nof solidarity to not just the people of Vermont, but the entire Nation. \nI commend his loyalty and great contributions to the labor movement, to \nVermont, and to the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4525-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING SHAIN'S OF MAINE\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

Over the years, Shain's has continued \nto grow and now operates a restaurant and a thriving wholesale \ndivision. It has been reported that Shain's dishes out as much as 3,000 \nquarts of ice cream a day in winter and 10,000 quarts a day in summer! \nShain's credits the hard work and loyalty of its employees with their \nability to keep up with the tremendous demand for its product. Shain's \nemployees speak fondly of the atmosphere and fun working environment at \nShain's and also boast about some of the ``sweet'' perks working at \nthis small business, which include: free ice cream, breaks whenever the \nemployees want, and the occasional half-filled quart of ice cream to \ntake home.\n  In order to attract new customers, Shain's markets its products by \nsending out samples to restaurants and other establishments that sell \nice cream. Shain's has always taken pride in its superior quality and \nservice, and attributes those same virtues with the company's longevity \nand success today. Shain's commitment to the customer and ability to \nrespond to the needs of its loyal fans has allowed Shain's to grow \ntremendously throughout its existence. Indeed, Shain's currently \ndelivers its 100 flavors of ice cream to 300 independent stores and 100 \nice cream stands. Its Sanford location offers customers creative \nsundaes--including its famed Wipeout Sundae, including four ice cream \nflavors, four toppings, whipped cream, and cherries--as well as a \nvariety of frappes, floats, sherbets, and frozen yogurts.\n  One particular ice cream concoction has become wildly popular among \nMainers because of its connection to the local minor league baseball \nteam. The Portland Sea Dogs, Maine's AA affiliate of the Boston Red \nSox, offer one of Shain's delicious creations, the classic Sea Dog \nBiscuit, at their home games. The Sea Dog Biscuit is Shain's take on \nthe traditional ice cream sandwich, featuring vanilla ice cream and two \ngiant chocolate chip cookies. It is this kind of creativity and clever \nmarketing that allows Shain's to differentiate itself from other, \nlarger ice cream companies.\n  This marvelous story of a successful small business is a reminder to \nus all that caring for customers and valuing your employees can result \nin long term success in any industry. As countless tourists travel to \nVacationland this summer, I am certain that many will be searching for \na cool treat to satisfy their sweet tooth, and Shain's of Maine will \nstand ready with scoops in hand! I congratulate Shain's of Maine for \nits ongoing dedication to providing delicious ice cream for Mainers and \ntourists alike, and I wish the company many more years of success to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4525-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4525-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4525-4", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY OF THE UNITED STATES OF \n                             AMERICA--PM 58\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 108 of the National Security Act of 1947, as \namended (50 U.S.C. 404a), I am transmitting the National Security \nStrategy of the United States.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 27, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4525-5", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill, which was previously signed by the Speaker of \nthe House:\n\n       H.R. 5139.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Graham, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Merkley, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Sanders, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Carper, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \n        Begich, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 3434. A bill to provide for the establishment of a Home Star \nRetrofit Rebate Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Home Star Energy \nRetrofit Act of 2010 and to recognize the original cosponsors of the \nbill: Senator Warner, Senator Graham, Senator Snowe, Senator Sanders, \nSenator Brown of Massachusetts, Senator Merkley, Senator Stabenow, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Carper, Senator Pryor and \nSenator Harkin. This innovative legislation will save consumers money, \ncreate American skilled labor jobs, and reduce home energy consumption.\n  If enacted, HOME STAR will build on existing policies and initiatives \nthat have already proved effective. The program is supported by a broad \ncoalition of over 600 groups including construction contractors, \nbuilding products and mechanical manufacturers, retail sales \nbusinesses, environmental groups and labor advocates.\n  HOME STAR will provide point-of-sale instant savings to encourage \nhomeowners to install residential energy upgrades such as air sealing, \ninsulation, and high efficiency furnaces and water heaters.\n  HOME STAR incorporates a two-tiered approach that will offer \nflexibility to homeowners when choosing efficiency improvements to \ninstall. Under the Silver Star program, rebates averaging $1,000 will \nbe offered for the installation of each eligible energy-saving measure \nsuch as new insulation and high-efficiency heating and cooling systems, \nup to maximum of $3,000 per home. Under the Gold Star program, there \nwill be performance-based grants of $3,000 for a 20 percent reduction \nin home energy consumption and $1,000 for each additional 5 percent of \nverified energy reduction as determined by a comparison of the energy \nconsumption of the home before and after the retrofit.\n  In addition to the short-term rebate programs in Home Star, our \nrevised bill includes longer term efficiency tax policies to maintain \nthe momentum for energy efficient home retrofits. These performance-\nbased energy improvement tax credits will encourage the continuation of \nGold Star-type whole home retrofits.\n  HOME STAR will create American jobs in the construction industry, \nwhich has lost 1.6 million jobs since December 2007, with unemployment \nrates topping 25 percent in some regions. HOME STAR leverages private \ninvestment to create a strong market for home energy retrofits, and \nwill put hundreds of thousands of unemployed Americans back to work as \nwell as stimulating demand for building materials produced by American \nfactories.\n  Finally, HOME STAR will reduce home energy consumption and dependence \non foreign oil. HOME STAR helps Americans pay for cost-effective home \nimprovements, create permanent reductions in household energy bills, \nand reduce our national carbon footprint. Residential energy efficiency \nimprovements covered by the HOME STAR program reduce energy waste in \nmost homes by 20 to 40 percent. When combined with low-interest \nfinancing, these retrofits can be cash-flow positive upon project \ncompletion. An initiative with a potential to retrofit over 3 million \nhomes, HOME STAR will achieve significant reductions in building-\nrelated greenhouse gas emissions while generating long-term energy \nsavings for American consumers and reducing energy usage by an amount \nequal to four 300 megawatt power plants.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3434\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Tester, \n        Mr. Bennet, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 3438. A bill to promote clean energy infrastructure for rural \ncommunities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 1935, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nsigned the Rural Electrification Act to bring electricity to the \nsparsely-populated rural areas of our vast Nation. Today, with advances \nin renewable energy from the sun, the wind, water, and geothermal \nenergy beneath the Earth's surface, our rural communities are ready to \nproduce clean, renewable electricity and sell it to cities and towns. \nJust as our national highway system grew out of the network of farm \nroads to bring agricultural products to market, our electric \ntransmission system needs connections to rural areas to bring our \nabundant rural renewable energy resources to load centers. For example, \nNye and Lincoln counties in Nevada have the potential to generate more \nsolar and wind energy than their small populations can use. Without \ntransmission to connect these rural areas to load centers, they cannot \nfully develop their local renewable energy industry and are losing out \non important opportunities to create jobs and diversify their \neconomies.\n  That is why I am introducing two bills today to give rural \ncommunities more options to finance the clean energy infrastructure we \nneed to develop our rich renewable resources. These two bills would \nhelp rural communities fund clean energy infrastructure, which will \ncreate many short and long term jobs and attract badly needed \ninvestment in rural Nevada's struggling economy. While Nevada is in an \nespecially good position to benefit from this bill, I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators Ensign, Harkin, Tester, Michael Bennet, and \nKlobuchar whose states also have renewable energy resources stranded by \na lack of transmission.\n  Existing government loan and tax-exempt bond programs are available \nto finance rural renewable generation, but not to finance the \nconnections between that generation and the high-voltage\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\ntransmission system that carries electricity to load centers. These \nproposed bills would provide three ways to finance important \ntransmission for rural renewable generators--through the USDA Rural \nUtilities Service, through modifications to the Clean Renewable Energy \nBond, CREB, program, and through modifications to the Exempt Facility \nBonds program.\n  As we have seen with the electric and telephone infrastructure \nfinanced by the USDA Rural Utilities Service since 1935, energy \ninfrastructure is crucial to economic development for rural \ncommunities. Natural gas pipelines crisscross rural communities, but \nsmall towns near these pipelines lack natural gas today. Some of these \ntowns, including some in Nevada, have plans for natural gas \ndistribution systems and local economic development that depend on \naccess to natural gas. Federal programs to provide loans, loan \nguarantees, or tax-exempt bonds do not fit these plans.\n  The USDA does not currently finance these types of projects. My bill \nwould allow the USDA to finance natural gas systems to connect rural \ncommunities to natural gas pipelines. Access to natural gas will \nprovide these communities with a clean, efficient energy source, and \nencourage economic development.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3438\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide high-quality public charter school options \nfor students by enabling such public charter schools to expand and \nreplicate; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to improve educational opportunities for struggling students. \nThe All Students Achieving Through Reform Act, or All-STAR Act, would \nprovide Federal resources to the most successful charter schools to \nhelp them grow and replicate.\n  Last week, I visited the KIPP Ascend Charter School in Chicago. You \nmight have heard of the KIPP charter schools. The first KIPP school was \nfounded in Texas by two Teach for America teachers. Mike Feinberg and \nDave Levin wanted to start a school that would inspire high achievement \nfor students living in disadvantaged communities. The 82 KIPP schools \nnationwide focus on high expectations, an intense academic curriculum, \nexpanded school days and years, parental involvement, and high quality \nteachers. The results are impressive. While less than one in five low-\nincome students attends college nationally, KIPP's college \nmatriculation rate stands at more than 85 percent for students who \ncomplete the 8th grade at KIPP. More than 90 percent of KIPP alumni go \non to college-preparatory high schools. Collectively, they have earned \nmillions of\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\ndollars in scholarships and financial aid since 2000.\n  I saw this success when I visited Chicago's KIPP school. Students at \nKIPP Ascend are actively engaged in learning and their teachers are \nenergetic and inspiring. The students there are outscoring their peers \nin other Chicago Public Schools, and 100 percent of the 8th graders who \nhave graduated from KIPP Ascend have been accepted to college-\npreparatory high schools.\n  Right now there is only one KIPP school in Chicago, but there should \nbe more. The bill I am introducing today with Senator Gregg would help \nmake that possible. Currently, federal funding for charter schools can \nonly be used to create new schools, not expand or replicate existing \nschools. My bill would create new grants within the existing charter \nschool program to fund the expansion and replication of the most \nsuccessful charter schools. Schools in Chicago, like KIPP and Noble \nStreet, that have achieved amazing results with their students will be \nable to apply for federal grants to expand their schools to additional \ngrades or replicate the model to a new school. Successful charters \nacross the country will be able to grow more easily, providing better \neducational opportunities to thousands of students.\n  The bill also incentivizes the adoption of strong charter school \npolicies by states. We know that successful charter schools thrive when \nthey have autonomy, freedom to grow, and strong accountability based on \nmeeting performance targets. The bill would give grant priority to \nStates that provide that environment. The bill also requires new levels \nof charter school authorizer reporting and accountability to ensure \nthat good charter schools are able to succeed while bad charter schools \nare improved or shut down.\n  This bill will improve educational opportunities for students across \nthe Nation. Charter schools represent some of the brightest spots in \nurban education today, and successful models have the full support of \nthe President and Secretary Duncan. We need to help these schools grow \nand bring their best lessons into our regular public schools so that \nall students can benefit. This bill has the support of more than 25 \neducation organizations including some of the Nation's highest \nperforming charter networks like KIPP and Green Dot. Supporting the \ngrowth of successful charter schools should be a part of the \nconversation when we take up reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. I thank Senator Gregg and Representative Polis \nin the House for joining me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3441\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require small business training for contracting \nofficers; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today, during National \nSmall business Week, along with my colleague Senator Cardin, to \nintroduce the Small Business Training in Federal Contracting \nCertification Act. This vital piece of legislation builds upon the \nSmall Business Contracting Revitalization Act, S. 2989, which passed \nunanimously out of the Small Business Committee on March 4, and would \nrequire the development of small business training for contracting \nofficials. The bill we introduce today would take an additional step by \nrequiring contracting officials to successfully complete small business \ntraining prior to receiving certification in Federal contracting.\n  During these devastating economic times, with small business owners \nstruggling to retain jobs, much less create new jobs, it is paramount \nthat small businesses have a fair opportunity to contract with Federal \nAgencies, because the Federal Government is the largest buyer of goods \nand services in the world, spending over $500 billion in fiscal year \n2009 alone. I remain frankly dismayed by the myriad ways the Federal \nGovernment has time and again egregiously failed to meet its statutory, \ngovernment-wide small business ``goaling'' requirements that 23 percent \nof all Federal procurement dollars must be allocated to small \ncontracting firms. This legislation would help the Federal Government \nto meet--and even exceed--its 23 percent goal, because it would require \ninvesting time and training in contracting officials who make the \nultimate determination on contract awards be trained in small business \nprocurement issues.\n  Contracting officials have a great deal of responsibility. They \nprovide the Federal government with expertise when buying goods and \nservices to enable agencies to achieve their mission by fairly and \nreasonably obligating taxpayer dollars while simultaneously addressing \nour Nation's socio-economic needs. I have heard from constituents and \nothers in the contracting community that contracting officials do not \nunderstand their duty to provide opportunities to small businesses to \nthe maximum extent practicable. So, it is imperative that we provide \ncontracting officials the tools they need to bolster small business \nparticipation in Federal contracting--to include training on small \nbusiness government contracting set-aside programs, understanding size \nstandards and the North American Industry Classification System codes \nand how they apply to the contract award process, conducting market \nresearch, as well as all of the Small Business Administration's \nresources and programs available to them.\n  Small businesses are the engine of our economy and in this time of \neconomic hardship, the Federal Government must provide our Nation's \nentrepreneurs with every opportunity to succeed. Federal contracting \ncan be an instrumental part of a larger strategy for broadening small \nbusinesses' customer base and creating jobs. In my leadership capacity \non the Senate Small Business Committee, I have long been a champion of \nremoving barriers to small businesses seeking entry into the Federal \nmarketplace. Through the years, I have introduced numerous bills that \ncombat contract bundling, mandate recurrent small business size \nstandard adjustments, ensure equal opportunity to compete for Federal \ncontracts among the various socio-economic small businesses groups, and \nreduce fraud and abuse in SBA's small business contracting programs.\n  The Federal Government's inability to consistently meet all of its \nsmall business contracting goals is unjustifiable. Only one category of \nsmall business contracting goals--small disadvantaged businesses--has \nbeen met, while the goals for the three other programs--historically \nunderutilized business zones, HUBZone, small businesses, women-owned \nsmall businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses--\nhas never been achieved. It is inconceivable as to why this remains a \nproblem year after year, especially since contracts awarded using \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act dollars have demonstrated that \nattainment of these goals is possible.\n  In conclusion, I believe that requiring certification training for \nFederal contracting officers will help the Government meet the \nstatutory small business contracting goals and will increase small \nbusiness access to Federal contracts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3444\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nan above-the-line deduction for certain professional development and \nother expenses of elementary and secondary school teachers and for \ncertain certification expenses of individuals becoming science, \ntechnology, engineering, or math teachers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to increase tax fairness for America's primary and secondary \nschool teachers.\n  Our public school teachers are some of the unheralded heroes of our \nsociety. These women and men dedicate their careers to educating the \nyoung people of America. School teachers labor in often difficult and \neven dangerous circumstances. In most places, including in my home \nstate of Utah, the salary of the average public school teacher is \nsignificantly below the national average.\n  For a variety of economic and organizational reasons, schools across \nthe nation are experiencing difficulties in recruiting teachers--\nespecially in the fields of math and science. There are at least two \nsources to this problem. First, schools are experiencing high levels of \nturnover related to retirement, relocation, and attrition. Second, \nthere is an insufficient supply of new qualified math and science \nteachers coming in to the schools to compensate for the turnover.\n  As a result of these factors, 31 percent of secondary schools across \nthe nation report difficulties in filling math and science faculty \npositions. This teacher recruitment problem is especially troubling \nbecause it disproportionately affects small schools in urban and rural \nareas, especially those with limited access to funding.\n  Unfortunately, the problems of retention and recruitment of public \nschool teachers are exacerbated by the unfair tax treatment these \nprofessionals currently receive under our tax law. Specifically, \nteachers are greatly disadvantaged by the lack of deductibility of the \ntotal amount of out-of-pocket costs of classroom materials that \npractically all teachers find themselves supplying, as well as by the \ninability to deduct their professional development expenses. Let me \nexplain.\n  As with many other professionals, most elementary and secondary \nschool teachers regularly incur expenses to keep themselves current in \ntheir fields of knowledge. These include subscriptions to journals and \nother periodicals as well as the cost of courses and seminars designed \nto improve their knowledge or teaching skills. For example, in order to \nbe certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, \nNBPTS, a teacher must pay a fee of $2,500. Expenditures like these are \nnecessary to keep our teachers up to date on the latest ideas, \ntechniques, and trends so that they can provide our children with the \nbest education possible.\n\n  Furthermore, almost all teachers find themselves spending not \ninsignificant amounts of money to provide basic classroom materials for \ntheir students. Because of tight education budgets, most schools do not \nprovide 100 percent of the material teachers need to adequately present \ntheir lessons. New teachers in their first and second years are \nespecially susceptible to a large financial burden as they must start \nfrom scratch in establishing a curriculum and classroom for their \nstudents.\n  I realize that employees in many fields incur expenses for \nprofessional development and out-of-pocket expenses. In many cases, \nhowever, these costs are reimbursed by the employer. This is seldom the \ncase with school teachers. Other professionals who are self-employed \nare generally able to fully deduct these types of expenses.\n  Under the current tax law, unreimbursed expenses for all employees \nare deductible generally, but only as miscellaneous itemized \ndeductions. However, there are two practical hurdles that effectively \nmake these expenses non-deductible for most teachers. The first hurdle \nis that the total amount of a taxpayer's deductible miscellaneous \ndeductions must exceed 2 percent of gross income before they begin to \nbe deductible.\n  The second hurdle is that the amount in excess of the 2 percent \nfloor, if any, combined with all other deductions of the taxpayer, must \nexceed the standard deduction before the teacher can itemize. Only \nabout one-third of taxpayers have enough deductions to itemize. The \nunfortunate effect of these two limitations is that, as a practical \nmatter, only a small proportion of teachers are able to deduct their \nprofessional development and out-of-pocket supplies expenses.\n  Let me illustrate this unfair situation with an example. Let us \nconsider the case of a first-year teacher in Utah, whom we will refer \nto as Michelle. Michelle is newly married. She and her husband together \nexpect to earn $48,000 this year. As a brand-new teacher, Michelle has \nnone of the classroom decorations, materials, or curriculum aides that \nveteran teachers have accumulated. In an effort to quickly collect some \nnecessary items for her classroom, a new teacher like Michelle will \nprobably spend close to $1,500 of her own money. She will not be \nreimbursed for any of these expenses by the school district.\n  Under current law, Michelle's expenditures are deductible, subject to \nthe two limitations I mentioned. The first limitation is that her \nexpenses must exceed 2 percent of her and her husband's joint income \nbefore they begin to be deductible. Two percent of $48,000 is $960. \nThus, only $540 of her $1,500 total expense is potentially deductible--\nthat portion that exceeds $960.\n  As a married taxpayer, Michelle's standard deduction this year is \n$11,400. Her total itemized deductions, including the $540 in qualified \nmiscellaneous deductions for her professional expenses and out-of-\npocket classroom supplies, will fall far short of the standard \ndeduction threshold. Therefore, not even the $540 of the original \n$1,500 in out-of-pocket costs is deductible for Michelle. What the \nfirst limitation did not block, the second one did, and Michelle gets \nno deduction at all for these expenses under the current law.\n  The entry-level employees in the teaching field are the first- and \nsecond-year teachers like Michelle, who receive the lowest relative \nsalary and yet often incur the greatest school-related expenses. These \nexpenses place a heavy burden on our teachers and can act as a \nsignificant barrier to entry to the teaching profession. Many of these \nnew teachers are renting and fresh out of college, and are thus very \nunlikely to be able to itemize their deductions. Therefore, without the \nability to itemize, the teachers with the greatest need of tax relief \nare the ones least likely to receive it.\n  This problem is not isolated to first-year teachers. Veteran \neducators, like Kristen Adamson, also an elementary school teacher in \nUtah, have also expressed their concerns about this tax inequity. \nKristen is preparing for a class of 35 fifth-graders next year--the \nmost she's ever had. She, like most teachers, feels that it is her duty \nto provide all of her students with the materials they will need to \nsuccessfully complete their school work. There are few careers that I \nknow of in which employees take similar initiative.\n  This year, due to limited state funding, Kristen will be forced to \nchoose between a class set of colored pencils or a class set of \ncrayons. Whatever the district does not provide, Kristen will be forced \nto purchase herself. Further, the school district provides only one\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\nnotebook per student, but her pupils require a minimum of four each to \norganize their work. With 35 students, these costs can add up very \nquickly. Kristen typically does not have enough deductions to itemize \nand therefore, like most teachers, will receive little or no tax \nrelief.\n  As you can see, public school educators are at a marked disadvantage \nunder the current tax law, and they deserve better treatment. Not only \nis the situation morally unacceptable, it is aggravating to our teacher \nretention and recruitment problems.\n  I have been fighting to pass legislation that will help alleviate \nthis long-standing problem for almost a decade. In 2001, I first \nintroduced the Tax Equity for School Teachers Act. This legislation \nwould have provided an unlimited tax deduction for the out-of-pocket \nexpenses school teachers incur to acquire necessary training and \nmaterials.\n  Rather than being available only to those who are able to itemize \ntheir deductions, this bill would have made these expenses ``above-the-\nline'' deductions, meaning they would be deductible whether or not the \nteacher itemized on their tax return.\n  Unfortunately, only a part of this bill was enacted. The 2001 tax act \nincluded an above the-line deduction for $250 for the costs of \nclassroom expenses. While this was a step in the right direction, it \nwas essentially a symbolic gesture as teachers typically spend far more \nthan $250 on school-related expenses. This deduction has expired and \nhas been renewed several times, but it expired again at the end of last \nyear. It is not clear when Congress is going to extend it.\n  The bill I am introducing today would do three things. First, it \nwould reinstate the above-the-line deduction for teachers' out-of-\npocket expenses for classroom supplies, make it permanent, and remove \nthe $250 cap. Second, it would provide an unlimited deduction for the \nprofessional development expenses for school teachers. Finally, to \nassist in the recruitment of teachers in the most-needed fields, it \nwould provide an unlimited deduction for the cost of professionals in \nthe fields of math, science, and technology to certify to become public \nschool teachers.\n  Under my bill, first-year teacher Michelle would be allowed to deduct \nall $1,500 of her professional development and classroom supplies \nexpenses, whether she itemized or not. Similarly, Kristen would be able \nto deduct all of the expenses she incurred to provide materials for her \nstudents. This would help provide tax equity and a measure of much-\nneeded tax relief for scores of underpaid professionals. It would also \nhelp retain current public school teachers and attract new ones to the \nfield.\n  Some might argue that such a generous deduction would be giving \nteachers preferential treatment. I disagree. Most organizations provide \ntraining and supplies for their employees that are fully deductible to \nthe organization and non-taxable to the employee. Yet, public teachers \npay for training out of their own pocket, as is the case with NBPTS \ncertification.\n  Others may question the wisdom of my bill granting an unlimited tax \ndeduction. Why not place a limit or cap on the amount that may be \ndeducted, some might ask. Again, I respectfully disagree with such \ncritics. It is important to keep in mind the difference between a tax \ndeduction and a tax credit. My bill calls for tax deductions, which \nessentially act as a cost-sharing arrangement between the teacher and \nthe government. Deductions reduce the amount of income that is subject \nto tax. A credit, on the other hand, is a dollar-for-dollar reduction \nin the amount of tax that is due.\n  With a tax deduction, a public school teacher is not receiving a cash \nsubsidy or reimbursement for his or her expenses. Rather, he or she is \nmerely obtaining a reduction in the amount of income that is taxed. \nThus, the most benefit a teacher would receive under my bill would be a \n35 percent reduction in the cost of professional development, supplies, \nor certification expenses. For the vast majority of teachers, the \namount would be far less than 35 percent, because they are in lower tax \nbrackets. This means that the teacher is still responsible for paying \nfor the biggest portion of these costs. In other words, this bill does \nnot provide an incentive for teachers to spend unnecessary funds; it \nsimply provides a discount for teachers who use their common sense and \nspend their money appropriately. If anything, this deduction is not \ngenerous enough, but it would go a long way toward providing help for \nthese dedicated professionals.\n  Support for mathematics and science education at all levels is \nnecessary to improve the global competitiveness of the United States in \nscience and energy technology. I endorse the efforts of some of my \ncolleagues to encourage more of our best and brightest students who \nchoose these fields of study. Sup ort for qualified STEM teachers, \nScience, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, is equally \nimportant. If we are successful in increasing the supply of STEM \nstudents, we will need to take drastic measures to increase the already \nstrained supply of STEM teachers. This bill would provide incentives \nfor these professionals to enter the teaching profession by allowing \nexpenses in connection with teacher licensing and certification to be \nfully deductible, above the line, the same as professional development \nand supplies expenses of teaching professionals.\n  This bill would provide modest tax relief for teachers who, for too \nlong, have been treated unfairly under our tax laws. It would alleviate \nsignificant barriers to entry to the teaching profession and would help \nsolve some of our teacher recruitment and retention problems. Our \nteachers deserve whatever help we can provide. It is time that Congress \nrecognized this unfairness and corrected it. I thank the Senate for the \nopportunity to address this issue today, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3445\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

                              \n      By Mr. UDALL of New Mexico:\n  S. 3446. A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to advance \nthe health and wellbeing of schoolchildren in the United States through \ntechnical assistance, training, and support for healthy school foods, \nlocal wellness policies, and nutrition promotion and education, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to express \nsupport for S. 3307, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, and to \nintroduce two pieces of legislation that I hope will be included in the \nfinal reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act that is passed by this \nbody.\n  I commend Chairman Lincoln and Ranking Member Chambliss for their \nsuccessful efforts to produce a bipartisan and fully paid for Child \nNutrition Reauthorization bill--a bill that won unanimous support in \nthe Agriculture Committee where it passed this past March.\n  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 is critically important to \nthe health, well-being, and even education of our nation's children. It \nseeks to confront the challenges of hunger and obesity that are \nincreasingly pervasive in our youth. Specifically, the act reauthorizes \nour nation's major Federal child nutrition programs administered by the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, including the National School \nLunch and Breakfast Programs, the Special Supplemental Nutrition \nProgram for Women, Infants and Children, WIC, the Child and Adult Care \nFood Program and the Summer Food Service Program.\n  Totaling $4.5 billion in additional funding over the next 10 years, \nthe Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act is the largest new investment in \nchild nutrition programs since their inception--and it is completely \npaid for by off-sets in other USDA programs. This added funding will \nallow for an increase in reimbursement rates for school meals, which is \nan important provision since current reimbursement rates fall short of \nthe funding schools need in order to provide nutritious meals with \nfresh fruits and vegetables to students. The bill also makes mandatory \nthe funding authorized in the Child Nutrition Act to help schools \nestablish school gardens and source local foods through ``farm to \ncafeteria'' efforts.\n  Beyond funding, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act makes enrollment \ninto the free school meals program automatic for foster children and \nfor students already enrolled in Medicaid. The bill further promotes \nthe establishment of school wellness policies, and allows the USDA to \nset school nutrition standards for all foods, including those sold a la \ncarte, in vending machines and during special events such as \nafterschool sports.\n  While this bill, combined with the President's request of $10 billion \nfor child nutrition programs over the next 10 years, represents a huge \nstep toward a healthier population of young people, I believe there is \nroom for even more improvement. To this end, I am today introducing the \nChild Nutrition Enhancement Act, and the Ensuring All Students Year-\nRound, EASY, Access to Meals and Snacks Act. These two bills will help \nschools ramp up their nutrition and health programs, and ensure that \nkids have access to food, even on weekends and holidays when they \ncannot get meals at school. These bills also enjoy House support, with \nRepresentatives Polis and Larsen already having introduced companions \nin that chamber.\n  The Child Nutrition Enhancement Act would expand the Team Nutrition \nNetworks program, a USDA program that provides grants to school \ndistricts to support State Wellness and Nutrition Networks in schools \nthat conduct nutrition education and enhance school wellness. To allow \nthis expansion, the bill includes mandatory funding at a level of 1 \ncent per reimbursable meal through National School Lunch Program, Child \nand Adult Care Food Program, and Summer Food Service Program, totaling \napproximately $70 million per year. Such funding would be used for \nState staff and programs, formula-based grants and USDA administration.\n  The Ensuring All Students Year-round Access to Meals and Snacks Act \nwould allow local government agencies and private nonprofit \norganizations to feed children meals and snacks 365 days-a-year through \nthe Summer Food Service Program, whether it be after school, on \nweekends and school holidays, or during the summer. School supplemental \nfood providers find that children often go hungry on weekends and \nschool holidays because their main source of nutrition is the free \nschool lunch program. This bill would allow food service programs to \nfill in the gaps on holidays and weekends when kids are likely to miss \nmeals, and ease the administrative burden of food service programs by \nallowing year round meals and snacks through the Summer Food Service \nProgram, rather the current requirement to switch back and forth \nbetween the Summer Food Service Program and other child nutrition \nprograms such as the Child and Adult Care Food Program.\n  With September 30th as the looming deadline for reauthorization of \nthe Child Nutrition Act, I call on my colleagues and the leadership in \nthe Senate to expedite the debate and passage of the Healthy, Hunger-\nFree Kids Act. I look forward to working with the Agriculture Committee \nand the Senate leadership to include the Child Nutrition Enhancement \nAct, and the EASY Access to Meals and Snacks Act in the final bill, and \nto complete the legislative process for this important reauthorization.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3447. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \neducational assistance for veterans who served in the Armed Forces \nafter September 11, 2001, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am introducing today the proposed Post-9/\n11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010. This \nmeasure is designed to make a number of modifications to the new \nprogram of educational assistance which became effective on August 1, \n2009.\n  As one of three remaining Senators who benefited from the original GI \nBill\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\nfollowing World War II, I know firsthand the value of an education and \nof the critical role that this important veterans benefit played in my \nlife. That was why I was especially pleased to join with the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, in achieving enactment \nof the new Post-9/11 GI Bill in 2008.\n  Now, with ten months of experience under the new program, I believe \nit is time to look at what improvements and modifications need to be \nmade in order for the program to reach its potential. I note at the \noutset that this will not be a simple process. Nor will it be quickly \nand easily accomplished. There are issues that we can readily see need \nto be addressed. There are others, however, that are only just now \ncoming to our attention as the program is implemented and veterans, \nservicemembers, and their families begin to receive benefits under the \nprogram.\n  I will highlight some of the provisions that are contained in the \nbill I am introducing today:\n  It would make members of the National Guard and Reserve programs who \nwere inadvertently omitted from inclusion fully eligible for benefits.\n  It would make all types of training--including vocational programs, \nOJT and apprenticeship training, flight, all types of non-college \ndegree training and more--eligible for benefits under the new program. \nBy doing this, individuals would not need to make an irreversible \ndecision as to whether or not to receive benefits under the old \nMontgomery GI Bill or under the new program.\n  It would eliminate the complicated, confusing and, in some cases, \ninequitable calculation of State-by-State tuition and fee caps to \ndetermine benefits for individuals enrolled in degree programs. \nBasically, it would provide that eligible individuals enrolled in \ndegree-granting programs of study at public institutions anywhere in \nthe United States would pay little, if any, out of pocket costs for \ntheir education. For students enrolled in other institutions of higher \nlearning, benefits would be paid based on a national average cost of \neducation which would be indexed and increased annually.\n  It would provide for a modified living allowance to be paid in the \ncase of an individual pursuing a program of education solely through \ndistance learning. Individuals who currently are studying through a \ncombination of distance and classroom training would continue to \nreceive benefits as they do now.\n  It would make a book allowance award of up to $1,000 available to \nindividuals enrolled while on active duty and their spouses.\n  It would allow individuals enrolled in VA's program of rehabilitation \nand training under chapter 31 of title 38 who also have eligibility for \nthe new chapter 33 program to elect the program from which to receive \ntheir subsistence allowance. This would mean that a service-connected \ndisabled OEF/OIF veteran would not need to elect to training under the \nnew GI Bill and forego the valuable counseling and support services \navailable under chapter 31 in order to receive an increased living \nallowance.\n  It would modify the manner in which the living allowance is \ncalculated to reflect the rate at which training is pursued.\n  It would ensure that the same period of active duty cannot be used to \nestablish eligibility for more than one program of education.\n  This is not a complete recitation of all the provisions contained in \nthe measure I am introducing today. In addition, I do not expect that \nevery provision of the measure will necessarily be supported by all the \nstakeholders involved in this important issue. Indeed, I imagine there \ncould be some who will be critical of some provisions in the proposal \nand will come forward to offer improvements and modifications.\n  What my measure is intended to do, is to serve as a starting point to \nmove forward in this important yet very complicated and complex \nendeavor. I strongly believe that whatever is done in this connection \nmust not be done in a piecemeal manner. We need a full and deliberative \nconsideration of all the issues in order to craft the best possible \napproach to delivering these important benefits to our Nation's \nveterans and those who are serving in uniform.\n  I look forward to working with all our colleagues and others on these \nissues in the days ahead. As I noted, this will not be done quickly or \neasily but this measure will serve as a focus for our discussions and \ndecisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require publicly traded coal companies to include \ncertain safety records in their reports to the Commission, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is time to take mining companies' \nsafety records out of the darkness and bring some much-needed \ntransparency and accountability to the industry.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that would require any publicly-\ntraded mining company to include critical mine safety information in \nits annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, SEC.\n  Shareholders have a direct interest in the safety record of any \ncompany they invest in--because safety has as much of an impact on a \ncompany's long-term financial health as its mining production.\n  But today, this safety information is not uniformly reported across \nthe industry. My bill fixes this inconsistency and gives investors the \ninformation they need to hold corporate management responsible for the \nsafety record of a company.\n  That is what my bill is all about: providing shareholders with \nstandard information that can be used to measure and compare safety \nrecords across the industry. Specifically, my legislation would require \nany publicly-traded mine company to report the following information in \ntheir annual and quarterly filings with the SEC:\n  The total number of significant and substantial violations of \nmandatory health or safety standards;\n  The total number of failure to abate orders issued under section \n104(b) of the Mine Act;\n  The total number of citations and orders for unwarrantable failure of \nthe\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\nmine operator to comply with mandatory health or safety standards under \nsection 104(d) of the Mine Act;\n  The total number of flagrant violations under section 110 of the Mine \nAct;\n  The total number of imminent danger orders issued under section \n107(a) of the Mine Act;\n  The total dollar value of Mine Safety and Health Administration, \nMSHA, proposed penalties and fines;\n  A list of the regulated worksites that have been notified by MSHA of \na Pattern of Violation or a Potential to have a Pattern of Violations \nunder section 104(e) of the Mine Act;\n  Any pending legal action before the Federal Mine Safety and Health \nReview Commission.\n  Any mining related fatalities.\n  In addition, any publicly-traded mining company must immediately \ndisclose to the SEC if it receives a shutdown order under section \n107(a) of the Mine Act, imminent danger, or receives notice that a mine \nsite has a potential or actual pattern of violations.\n  I have always said that, first and foremost, this is about a company \ndoing the right thing to develop a true culture of safety. That \nincludes everyone, from the miner at the coal face to the Chairman of \nthe Board.\n  If we are serious about making that culture a reality, shareholders \nneed to be informed about safety too.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Udall of New Mexico):\n  S. 3452. A bill to designate the Valles Caldera National Preserve as \na unit of the National Park System, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would transfer administrative jurisdiction of the Valles Caldera \nNational Preserve from the Valles Caldera Trust to the National Park \nService. I am pleased that my colleague from New Mexico, Tom Udall, is \ncosponsoring the bill.\n  Between the New Mexico communities of Jemez Springs and Los Alamos, \nlies the Valle Grande, a magnificent valley surrounded by foothills and \nforested mountains. When standing in this valley, visitors begin to \nrealize they are actually inside a larger bowl-shaped formation. This \nis the Valles Caldera--one of only three supervolcanoes in the United \nStates. The oldest of the three--having formed 1.25 million years ago--\nthe Valles Caldera is also the smallest. Yet the caldera rim spans more \nthan 100,000 acres in area whose violent eruption created a volcanic \nash plume that stretched from northern Utah to central Kansas. Because \nof its relatively small size as compared to the two other \nsupervolcanoes in the U.S.--Yellowstone, WY, and Long Valley, CA, the \nValles Caldera provides visitors with excellent opportunities to learn \nabout large volcanic eruptions and their impacts on surrounding \nlandscapes while they stand in a single space to experience one of the \nworld's best examples of an intact resurgent caldera. In 1975, the \nValles Caldera received formal recognition as an outstanding and \nnationally significant geologic resource when it was designated a \nNational Natural Landmark.\n  As is the case in many parts of New Mexico, the geologic history of \nthe Valles Caldera is inextricably linked to our State's cultural \nhistory. For example, the people of Jemez Pueblo chose the area as the \nbest site to establish their community. The Valles Caldera and the \nadjacent Jemez Mountains provided the Pueblo with an ample food and \nwater supply, natural defenses, and weapon-making materials present in \nthe many obsidian quarries found in the area. In fact, the obsidian was \nof such high quality that spearheads made from these quarries have been \ndiscovered as far away as eastern Mississippi and northern Mexico. \nNeedless to say, the Valles Caldera and the peaks that formed within it \nare sacred and highly revered by Jemez Pueblo and many other nearby \ntribes and pueblos.\n  The volcanic ash dispersed by the volcano's eruption also had a \nlasting impact on the history of migration and settlement by Ancestral \nPuebloan people in the region. As the ash and pumice settled, it formed \nlayers of sediment, and over time, rivers helped to carve these layers \ninto deep canyons. Archeologists have found evidence of nomadic tribes \nfollowing large mammals into the region, and Ancestral Puebloans built \nhomes alongside and into the soft canyon walls. Many of these awe-\ninspiring settlements are protected in Bandelier National Monument, \nwhere the National Park Service educates visitors about how the unique \nvolcanic history of the Valles Caldera made these settlements possible.\n  There is no question that this area is worthy of Federal protection, \nand efforts to preserve this area were proposed as early as 1899. \nHowever, it was only ten years ago that the Federal government was \nfinally able to acquire this property for the American people. At that \ntime, Senator Domenici and I were successful in passing the Valles \nCaldera Preservation Act which authorized the acquisition of the \nproperty and established an experimental framework for the management \nof the Preserve for a period of 20 years. The legislation established \nthe Valles Caldera Trust, composed of a nine-member board of trustees, \nwhose members are appointed by the President and have particular \nexpertise in fields important to the management of the Preserve. The \nbill also directed the Trust to manage the Preserve in a manner that \nwould achieve financial self-sustainability after fifteen years. Five \nyears thereafter, the Trust would be Although the individual members \nhave done their best to fulfill the original legislative directives, \ntime has shown in my opinion that this management framework is not the \nbest suited for the long-term management of the Preserve.\n  Part of the experimental management framework was a requirement that \nthe Valles Caldera Trust manage the Preserve in a manner that would \nachieve financial self-sustainability while providing for public access \nand protection of the Preserve's natural and cultural resources. This \nhas proved to be a virtually impossible mandate to satisfy. Since its \ninception, the Preserve has not received adequate funding under the \ncurrent arrangement and is unlikely to in the foreseeable future. In \naddition, most members of the board and outside observers believe the \nTrust will be unable to achieve the financial self-sustainability \nrequirements called for by the original Act. The Trust has also \nindicated an infusion of approximately $15 million may be necessary to \ncomplete construction and deferred maintenance costs on the Preserve. I \ndo not believe this funding will be forthcoming under the current \nmanagement and budgetary framework. Moreover, much of the funding \nresponsibility has been laid on the shoulders of Congress to provide \nthe necessary annual funding that is not included in the President's \nannual budget. This arrangement is not sustainable in my opinion, and \nthe existing statutory termination of the trust is looming.\n  With that said, the trust and its executive staff have made valuable \nprogress in various areas of management. One prime example is the \nscience and education program established by the Trust. Through the \nscientific activities on the preserve, the trust has been able to adapt \nits management based on the ecological demands of the caldera. The \ntrust has promoted the scientific research of flora and fauna on the \npreserve and the impacts of climate change in the Jemez Mountains to \ncite a few of their ongoing activities. It is my belief that the \ntransition in management should allow for the retention of the best \nmanagement practices that the Trust has achieved.\n  Many New Mexicans have told me that they would like the preserve to \nbe managed by an agency that will expand visitation and recreational \nopportunities while also ensuring the protection of the preserve's \nunique resources. Simply put, while my constituents eagerly want more \naccess, they have stated clearly and directly--``Don't overrun it.''\n  I believe the National Park Service is best suited to manage the \npreserve while ensuring its long-term conservation.\n  The National Park Service's mission supports the activities called \nfor most by my constituents, including expanded recreational \nopportunities, scientific study, and the interpretation of the natural \nand cultural resources in the preserve. As I discussed earlier, the \nPreserve provides a world-class opportunity for the interpretation of \nthe geologic history of this unique area and of the fascinating \ngeologic and cultural history that binds the Valles\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nCaldera and Bandelier National Monument.\n  Under our proposed legislation, management of the Valles Caldera \nNational Preserve will be transferred to the National Park Service to \nbe administered as a unit of the National Park System. The bill directs \nthe Park Service to manage the Preserve to protect and preserve its \nnatural and cultural resources, including its nationally significant \ngeologic resources. Hunting and fishing would continue to be allowed, \nand grazing would also continue to be permitted. The National Park \nService would also be directed to establish a science and education \nprogram utilizing the best practices created by the trust, as I \ndiscussed earlier.\n  The legislation would maintain the existing character of the preserve \nwhile strengthening protections for tribal, cultural, and religious \nsites and providing access by pueblos to the preserve. In addition, in \nconsultation with the surrounding pueblos, restrictions will be put in \nplace on the development and motorized vehicle use on the sacred \nvolcanic domes within the preserve, similar to the current restrictions \non Redondo Peak, the highest peak within the preserve.\n  I would like to emphasize that in no way is this legislation a \ncriticism of the good work and valuable accomplishments made by the \nBoard Members of the Valles Caldera Trust and the preserve staff. \nHowever, I believe having the preserve managed by the National Park \nService--an agency with a mission protecting natural, historic, and \ncultural resources while also providing for public enjoyment of those \nresources--is more appropriate for the long-term future of the Valles \nCaldera. In my view, the desire for increased public access, balanced \nwith the need to protect and interpret the Preserve's unique cultural \nand natural resources, would be best served by National Park Service \nmanagement of the preserve.\n  It is my strong belief that transferring management of the Valles \nCaldera National Preserve to the National Park Service will be the best \nway to ensure the protection and enjoyment of the preserve over the \nlong term. I urge my colleagues to support the bill as it is considered \nin the Senate.\n  The Los Alamos County Council and Los Alamos Chamber of Commerce have \nsubmitted resolutions in support of National Park Service management of \nthe preserve. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these \nresolutions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Incorporated County of Los Alamos Resolution No. 10-05\n\n       A resolution supporting congressional actions to facilitate \n     the transfer of management of the Valles Caldera National \n     Preserve from the Valles Caldera Trust to the National Park \n     Service under the U.S. Department of the Interior to be \n     managed as a preserve, per the findings of the December 2009 \n     updated report on the NPS 1979 new area, study that confirmed \n     the Valles Caldera National Preserve's ability to meet the \n     feasibility requirements of the National Park System.\n       Whereas, the enabling legislation PL106-248 created the \n     Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP) from a unique parcel \n     of land in north-central New Mexico, and by creating the \n     Valles Calderas Trust as a wholly-owned government \n     corporation to manage the preserve, the Valles Caldera \n     Preservation Act of 2000 established a 20-year public-private \n     experiment to operate the preserve without continued federal \n     funding; and\n       Whereas, the Trust is charged with protecting and \n     preserving the scientific, scenic, geologic, watershed, fish, \n     wildlife, historic, cultural, and recreational values of the \n     Preserve and achieving financial self-sufficiency by 2015, \n     while operating the Preserve as a ``working ranch;'' and\n       Whereas, the GAO analyzed documents and financial records, \n     and interviewed staff and stakeholders to determine the \n     Trust's progress since 2000, the extent to which the Trust \n     has fulfilled its obligations as a government corporation, \n     and the challenges the Trust faces to achieve the \n     Preservation Act goals, the results of which are published in \n     an October 2009 Report to Congressional Committees, \n     concluding that ``The Trust Has Made Progress but Faces \n     Significant Challenges to Achieve Goals of the Preservation \n     Act;'' and\n       Whereas, the national significance of the geological \n     resources of the Valles Caldera was formally recognized in \n     1975 when the area was designated a National Natural \n     Landmark; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service (NPS) has existed since \n     1916 and has a proven record for successfully managing 89 \n     million acres of sensitive and historically important public \n     lands in America; and\n       Whereas, Senator Jeff Bingaman and Senator Tom Udall, on \n     June 24, 2009 requested that the NPS undertake a \n     reconnaissance study of the Valles Caldera National Preserve \n     to assess its potential for inclusion in the NPS as a \n     National Preserve; and\n       Whereas, the NPS completed ``An Updated Report on the NPS \n     1979 New Area Study'' published on December 15, 2009 which \n     includes the following conclusion based on the findings: ``. \n     . . the feasibility of the Valles Caldera for inclusion in \n     the national park system has been enhanced since 1979. The \n     national significance and suitability of the site for \n     inclusion in the system is confirmed;'' and\n       Whereas, the report concludes that ``current uses within \n     the VCNP are generally compatible with those in other \n     preserves or parks in the national park system, and there is \n     untapped potential for enhancing public enjoyment;'' and\n       Whereas, the report further concludes that ``a single \n     management entity for Valles Caldera and Bandelier would \n     enhance communication, and integration of management programs \n     that require a regional approach, such as fire management, \n     law enforcement, and emergency response would facilitate \n     comprehensive management of resource issues that affect both \n     the Preserve and Bandelier National Monument;'' and\n       Whereas, the report states that ``the national information \n     system and audience for sites within the National Park System \n     would [result in] increases in regional and national public \n     use of the area . . . [and] result in increased retail sales \n     for recreation and convenience goods locally, as well as \n     increased volume of recreational, tourist, and other \n     services; and\n       Whereas, the VCNP adjoins Los Alamos County lands and is \n     treasured by residents and visitors as a valuable natural, \n     historical, recreational and educational resource; and\n       Whereas, Los Alamos County is recognized and marketed as \n     the primary gateway to the VCNP, providing support services \n     such as lodging, restaurants, shopping and additional \n     cultural and recreational experiences to tourists from around \n     the world who seek out this unique, north-central New Mexico \n     attraction; and\n       Whereas, management of this resource directly affects Los \n     Alamos County's economic development initiatives, \n     particularly in the area of tourism marketing; and\n       Whereas, the majority of the members of public who \n     submitted comment via meeting and e-mail expressed their \n     desire for the National Park Service to assume land \n     management and operations for the Valles Caldera National \n     Preserve; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service policies require a \n     general management plan process that engages the public in a \n     collaborative effort to identify preferred uses, restrictions \n     and management practices, while allowing temporary public \n     access to the Valles Caldera National Preserve; and\n       Whereas, the County respectfully requests that the enabling \n     legislation include language to expedite the management plan \n     process, where possible, in order to move from planning and \n     temporary access to implementation. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Council of the Incorporated County of Los \n     Alamos, That the County of Los Alamos supports the transfer \n     of the Valles Caldera National Preserve to the U.S. \n     Department of the Interior's National Park Service to be \n     managed as a preserve. Los Alamos County requests to be \n     notified and involved in the process at every opportunity; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That if legislation to transfer the Preserve is \n     not enacted in 2010 Congress consider action to modify the \n     year 2000 enabling legislation to remove obstacles \n     restricting the Valles Caldera Trust's ability to effectively \n     manage the Preserve to meet the public's access priorities\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Los Alamos Commerce &\n\n\n                                            Development Corp.,\n\n                                   Los Alamos, NM, April 27, 2010.\n\n     Subject: Comment Concerning Future Management of Valles \n         Caldera.\n\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Please accept our organization's \n     comment on the question of the future management of the \n     Valles Caldera property. Our organization operates several \n     programs having strong interest in this matter. The Los \n     Alamos Chamber of Commerce is an association of about 300 \n     businesses, organizations, and individuals interested in \n     positive community and economic development and our Los \n     Alamos Meeting and Visitor Bureau program operates visitor \n     centers in Los Alamos and White Rock and is an important \n     resource for understanding visitation and tourism in our \n     area.\n       We believe that the most desirable management option \n     coinciding with the interests of the Los Alamos community is \n     for the Valles Caldera to become a National Park managed by \n     the National Park Service. This option presents several \n     advantages:\n       The National Park Service option is by far the best from \n     the standpoint of promoting visitation and tourism to the \n     area. The NPS ``arrowhead'' is a powerful brand that far \n     exceeds those of forest service and the Valles Caldera Trust \n     in terms of attracting interest and visitation.\n       The NPS mission of ``safeguarding America's special \n     places'' stands in contrast with the role of the Forest \n     Service in consumptive use of resources. In contrast with the \n     VCNP Trust, the NPS works with small businesses\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\n     to provide concession opportunities whereas the VCNP is \n     motivated to develop captive services that do not provide \n     such opportunities. These attributes of the NPS are best \n     aligned among the three management options with our \n     community's interests in realizing economic benefit from \n     visitation and tourism.\n       In our experience in Los Alamos County, the involvement of \n     the NPS in our community has far exceeded that of the other \n     proposed management entities. Based on this experience, we \n     believe that it is more likely that the NPS would be \n     interested in working closely with our community for mutual \n     benefit.\n       Please note that we do not expect the Valles Caldera to \n     become ``Los Alamos-centric'' in any of the scenarios. We \n     think that Los Alamos is a natural eastern gateway to the \n     Valles and the Jemez Mountains just as we recognize that \n     Jemez Pueblo and Jemez Springs are natural western gateway \n     communities. We understand that it will be important for \n     whatever management entity that is selected to reach out in \n     both of these directions. We encourage that as general input \n     regardless of the choice that is made.\n       We think that there is an opportunity to collaborate with \n     the selected entity on a joint visitor center (or centers) in \n     Los Alamos County. Such a facility would be a natural first \n     stop for visitors to Los Alamos and would feature not only \n     the Valles Caldera, but also Bandelier National Monument, the \n     Bradbury Science Museum, the Los Alamos Historical Museum, \n     the Pajarito Environmental Education Center, area Pueblos, \n     and area recreational attractions. We are currently the \n     operator of the visitor center here and we would welcome the \n     opportunity to collaborate on a joint visitor center. We \n     believe that this would enhance the visitor experience as \n     well as enable economies of operation.\n       Thank you for listening to and accepting our input. Our \n     organization stands ready to assist the selected management \n     entity for the Valles Caldera.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kevin Holsapple,\n                                               Executive Director.\n       On behalf of the Board of Directors of LACDC.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, today I join Senator Bingaman \nin introducing a bill to designate the Valles Caldera National Preserve \nas a unit of the National Park System. Known as the Valle Grande, this \nicon of the Jemez Mountains is one of the largest volcanic calderas in \nthe world. The vast grass-filled valleys, forested hillsides, and \nnumerous volcanic peaks make the Valles Caldera a treasure to New \nMexico, and a landscape of national significance millions of years in \nthe making.\n  Volcanic activity began in the Jemez Mountains about 10 million years \nago. This activity reached a climax about 1.5 million years ago with a \nseries of explosive rhyolitic eruptions that dropped hundreds of meters \nof volcanic ash for miles surrounding the caldera, and gave the \nsurrounding area its distinctive landscapes of pink and white tuff \noverlaying the black basalts of the Rio Grande Rift. In the millennia \nfollowing the Caldera's explosive creation, natural processes of \nerosion and weathering carved vibrant canyons and left pinion topped \nmesa stretching like fingers away from the massive caldera. As the \ngreat valley was drained of magma, and later a caldera lake, it filled \nwith the diversity of plants and wildlife that makes the area so \nvaluable to biologists and ecologists today. With such resources and \nnatural beauty, it is no wonder that for millennia people have also \nbeen an integral part Valle Grande.\n  For generations innumerable, the Valles Caldera has been a part of \nlife for the Pueblo Tribes of northern New Mexico. Today, the caldera \ncontinues to have important cultural and religious significance, \nsomething that must and will be respected and protected as the preserve \nmoves into the management of the National Park Service.\n  In recent centuries, the Valles Caldera has been often in private \nownership beginning with Spanish settlers who introduced livestock to \nthe grassy valleys that continue to fatten elk and cattle in the summer \nmonths. Recognizing the unique national significance of the caldera, \nthe Federal Government finally purchased the area in 2000 through the \nValles Caldera Preservation Act, which I was proud to help shepherd \nthrough Congress with Senator Bingaman and then-Senator Domenici. The \nsubsequent creation of the Valles Caldera National Preserve included \nthe creation of a board of directors and the Valles Caldera Trust to \nmanage the area. The legislation also included mandates for stakeholder \ninvolvement and eventual financial self-sufficiency of the preserve.\n  As Senator Bingaman and I take steps today to begin a transition of \nthe Valles Caldera into the National Park System, I want to applaud the \ndecade of work that both the Board of Trustees and the Valles Caldera \nTrust have dedicated to the preserve. I especially want to highlight \nthe contributions of individual employees who have been on the ground \nin the caldera, day after day, developing research programs that \nutilize the unmatched natural resources of the caldera, managing cattle \ngrazing and expanding the livestock program to include cutting edge \nscientific research, and extending educational opportunities in the \ncaldera to students from across state and the country.\n  With the heavy mandate of self-sufficiency looming and the annual \nstruggle to get sufficient funding for the caldera, Senator Bingaman \nand I are proposing a new direction forward. As a new unit of the \nNational Park Service, the National Preserve will have a sustainable \nfuture with greater access to the public.\n  Since 1939, the National Park Service has conducted numerous studies \nof the Valles Caldera. In each, the Park Service consistently deemed \nthe area of significant national value because of its unique and \nunaltered geology, and its singular setting, which are conducive to \npublic recreation, reflection, education, and research. With this \nlegislation the Secretary of Interior is directed to continue the \nlongstanding grazing, education, and hunting programs that so many New \nMexicans value as a once-ina-lifetime opportunity. By utilizing the \nresources and skills within the National Park Service, I believe the \nValles Caldera National Preserve will continue to prosper as a natural \nwonder full of significant geology, ecology, history, and culture.\n  The Valle Grande is truly that: a great valley that so very many New \nMexicans value and feel connected to. The future of the preserve is of \nutmost importance to us in New Mexico, and also has significance \nnationally. I look forward to working with Senator Bingaman and all of \nthe stakeholders who care about the future of this preserve to ensure \nthat this legislation emerges from the legislative process with \nimprovements that are supported by my colleagues in the Senate and--\nmost importantly--by the people of New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4553-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4553-S4554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 541--DESIGNATING JUNE 27, 2010, AS ``NATIONAL POST-\n               TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. CONRAD submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a Senate resolution \nto designate June 27, 2010, as National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \nAwareness Day. That date was inspired by the birthday of North Dakota \nNational Guard Staff Sergeant Joe Biel. Staff Sergeant Biel served two \ntours of duty in Iraq as a Trailblazer, part of a unit responsible for \nroute clearance operations. Each day, Joe's mission was to go out with \nhis unit every day to find and remove Improvised Explosive Devices and \nother dangers from heavily traveled roads to make it safe for coalition \nforces and Iraqi civilians to travel. As a result of those experiences, \nJoe suffered from PTSD and, tragically, took his own life in April \n2007. There is absolutely no doubt that Joe Biel is a hero who gave his \nlife for our country.\n  I learned of Joe's story because friends from his platoon, the 4th \nPlatoon, A Company, of the North Dakota National Guard's 164th Combat \nEngineer Battalion, have organized an annual motorcycle ride across the \nstate of North Dakota in his memory. The Joe Biel Memorial Ride serves \nas a reunion for the 164th, a memorial for a lost friend, and a beacon \nto those suffering from PTSD and other mental issues across the region. \nThe key point made to me by the event's organizer, Staff Sergeant Matt \nLeaf, is that we have to raise awareness of this disease so that the \nlives of servicemembers, veterans, and other PTSD sufferers can be by \ngreater awareness of and treatment for this disorder.\n  For many, the war does not end when the warrior comes home. All too \nmany servicemembers and veterans face PTSD symptoms like anxiety, \nanger, and depression as they try to adjust to life after war. We \ncannot sweep these problems under the rug. PTSD is real. The Department \nof Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have made significant \nadvances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD and its \nsymptoms, but many challenges yet remain. More must be done to inform \nand educate veterans, families and communities on the facts about this \nillness and the resources and treatments available. That is why SSG \nLeaf and his fellow Trailblazers started the Joe Biel Memorial Bike \nRide. And that is why I am introducing this Resolution. These efforts \nare about letting our troops--past and present--know it's okay to come \nforward and say they need help. It's a sign of strength, not weakness, \nto seek assistance. It is my hope that this message will be heard. In \nthe words of SSG Leaf, ``maybe if we all take a minute to listen, we \ncan stop one more tragedy from ever happening again.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter about Joe Biel \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Joe Biel Memorial Bike Ride\n\n       On April 26th 2007 we lost one of the best soldiers the \n     United States Military and the North Dakota Army National \n     Guard had ever had the privilege of enlisting. Staff Sergeant \n     Joseph Arthur Biel took his own life in Devils Lake North \n     Dakota surrounded by his peers superiors and some of his best \n     friends. He shot himself in the mouth while these people \n     looked on and his last words were ``tell everybody I love \n     them'' the shot was heard as far away as Fargo North Dakota. \n     Specialist David Young was on the phone with SSG Matthew Leaf \n     while standing directly in front of SSG Biel as he pulled the \n     trigger. This was the most horrific and worst day of our \n     lives. Tears did not stop for 3 days as Joe's platoon (4th \n     platoon A Company 164 Combat Engineers) deployed upon the \n     small town of Devils Lake North Dakota. Everybody was asking \n     one question ``Why?''\n       Why we failed Joe Biel? Why we did not understand PTSD? Why \n     so many of us have problems when we return from overseas? Why \n     nobody wants to listen? Why nobody understands? Why we are \n     afraid to talk about it? Why we think nobody cares? Why can't \n     I get help? Why will nobody listen to me? These are the \n     questions that race through our minds after this tragedy. We \n     deserve and have earned the right to be understood. The \n     answer is too simple. PTSD is real and it needs to be \n     addressed now. With the help of fellow veterans, spouses, \n     loved ones, the V.A. and our Government.

Res. 542\n\n       Whereas on June 20, 1782, the bald eagle was officially \n     designated as the national emblem of the United States by the \n     founding fathers at the Second Continental Congress;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is the central image of the Great \n     Seal of the United States;\n       Whereas the image of the bald eagle is displayed in the \n     official seal of many branches and departments of the Federal \n     Government, including--\n       (1) the Office of the President;\n       (2) the Office of the Vice President;\n       (3) Congress;\n       (4) the Supreme Court;\n       (5) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (6) the Department of Defense;\n       (7) the Department of Justice;\n       (8) the Department of State;\n       (9) the Department of Commerce;\n       (10) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (11) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (12) the Department of Labor;\n       (13) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (14) the Department of Energy;\n       (15) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n       (16) the Central Intelligence Agency; and\n       (17) the Postal Service;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of--\n       (1) the spirit of freedom; and\n       (2) the democracy of the United States;\n       Whereas, since the founding of the Nation, the image, \n     meaning, and symbolism of the bald eagle have played a \n     significant role in the art, music, history, commerce, \n     literature, architecture, and culture of the United States;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is prominently featured on the \n     stamps, currency, and coinage of the United States;\n       Whereas the habitat of bald eagles exists only in North \n     America;\n       Whereas, by 1963, the population of bald eagles that nested \n     in the lower 48 States had declined to approximately 417 \n     nesting pairs;\n       Whereas, due to the dramatic decline in the population of \n     bald eagles in the lower 48 States, the Secretary of the \n     Interior listed the bald eagle as an endangered species on \n     the list of endangered species published under section \n     4(c)(1) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1533(c)(1));\n       Whereas caring and concerned individuals from the Federal, \n     State, and private sectors banded together to save, and help \n     ensure the recovery and protection of, bald eagles;\n       Whereas, on July 20, 1969, the first manned lunar landing \n     occurred in the Apollo 11 Lunar Excursion Module, which was \n     named ``Eagle'';\n       Whereas the ``Eagle'' played an integral role in achieving \n     the goal of the United States of landing a man on the Moon \n     and returning that man safely to Earth;\n       Whereas, in 1995, as a result of the efforts of those \n     caring and concerned individuals, the Secretary of the \n     Interior listed the bald eagle as a threatened species on the \n     list of threatened species published under section 4(c)(1) of \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(1));\n       Whereas, by 2007, the population of bald eagles that nested \n     in the lower 48 States had increased to approximately 10,000 \n     nesting pairs, an increase of approximately 2,500 percent \n     from the preceding 40 years;\n       Whereas, in 2007, the population of bald eagles that nested \n     in the State of Alaska was approximately 50,000 to 70,000;\n       Whereas, on June 28, 2007, the Secretary of the Interior \n     removed the bald eagle from the list of threatened species \n     published under section 4(c)(1) of the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(1));\n       Whereas bald eagles remain protected in accordance with--\n       (1) the Act of June 8, 1940 (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.) \n     (commonly known as the ``Bald Eagle Protection Act of \n     1940''); and\n       (2) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.);\n       Whereas, on January 15, 2008, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     issued 3 limited edition bald\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\n     eagle commemorative coins under the American Bald Eagle \n     Recovery and National Emblem Commemorative Coin Act (Public \n     Law 108-486; 118 Stat. 3934);\n       Whereas the sale of the limited edition bald eagle \n     commemorative coins issued by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     has raised approximately $7,800,000 for the nonprofit \n     American Eagle Foundation of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee to \n     support efforts to protect the bald eagle;\n       Whereas, if not for the vigilant conservation efforts of \n     concerned Americans and the enactment of strict environmental \n     protection laws (including regulations) the bald eagle would \n     probably be extinct;\n       Whereas the American Eagle Foundation has brought \n     substantial public attention to the cause of the protection \n     and care of the bald eagle nationally;\n       Whereas November 4, 2010, marks the 25th anniversary of the \n     American Eagle Foundation;\n       Whereas the dramatic recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles--\n       (1) is an endangered species success story; and\n       (2) an inspirational example for other wildlife and natural \n     resource conservation efforts around the world;\n       Whereas the initial recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles was accomplished by the concerted efforts of numerous \n     government agencies, corporations, organizations, and \n     individuals; and\n       Whereas the continuation of recovery, management, and \n     public awareness programs for bald eagles will be necessary \n     to ensure--\n       (1) the continued progress of the recovery of bald eagles; \n     and\n       (2) that the population and habitat of bald eagles will \n     remain healthy and secure for future generations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 20, 2010, as ``American Eagle Day'';\n       (2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle commemorative coins \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury as a means by which to \n     generate critical funds for the protection of bald eagles; \n     and\n       (3) encourages--\n       (A) educational entities, organizations, businesses, \n     conservation groups, and government agencies with a shared \n     interest in conserving endangered species to collaborate and \n     develop educational tools for use in the public schools of \n     the United States;

Res. 544\n\n       Whereas in 2003, United States beef exports to China, \n     Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam \n     were valued at $3,300,000,000.\n       Whereas after the discovery of 1 Canadian-born cow infected \n     with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) disease in the \n     State of Washington in December 2003, China, Japan, Hong \n     Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam, among others, \n     closed their markets to United States beef;\n       Whereas for years the Government of the United States has \n     developed and implemented a multilayered system of \n     interlocking safeguards to ensure the safety of United States \n     beef, and after the 2003 discovery, the United States \n     implemented further safeguards to ensure beef safety;\n       Whereas a 2006 study by the United States Department of \n     Agriculture found that BSE was virtually nonexistent in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the internationally recognized standard-setting \n     body, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), has \n     classified the United States as a controlled risk country for \n     BSE, which means that all United States beef and beef \n     products from cattle of all ages is safe for export and \n     consumption;\n       Whereas China continues to prohibit imports of all beef and \n     beef products from the United States;\n       Whereas Japan has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of beef and beef products from cattle less than 21 \n     months of age, but has not yet opened its market for all \n     United States beef and beef products from cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas Hong Kong has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of deboned beef from cattle less than 30 months of \n     age, but has not yet opened its market for all United States \n     beef and beef products from cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas Taiwan has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of deboned and bone-in beef and certain offal \n     products from cattle less than 30 months of age and has \n     agreed to open, but has not yet opened, its market for all \n     United States beef and beef products from cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas South Korea has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of beef and beef products from cattle less than 30 \n     months of age and has agreed to open eventually, but has not \n     yet opened, its market for all United States beef and beef \n     products from cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas Mexico has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of deboned and bone-in beef and certain offal from \n     cattle less than 30 months of age, but has not yet opened its \n     market for all United States beef and beef products from \n     cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas Vietnam has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of beef and beef products from cattle less than 30 \n     months of age, but has not yet opened its market for all \n     United States beef and beef products from cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas between 2004 through 2009, United States beef \n     exports declined due to these restrictions, causing \n     significant revenue losses for United States cattle \n     producers, for example, United States beef exports to Japan \n     and South Korea averaged less than 15 percent of the amount \n     the United States sold to Japan and South Korea in 2003;

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today will \nextend the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act of \n2004, ACPERA, for an additional 10 years. This legislation ensures that \nthe Justice Department will have the tools it\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\nneeds to effectively prosecute criminal antitrust cartels for years to \ncome. I thank Senator Kohl for his hard work in securing passage of \nthis important legislation.\n  I have long supported vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws. \nACPERA provides a necessary complement to the Justice Department's \nhighly successful corporate leniency program by limiting civil damages \nrecoverable against a party who submits an application for leniency. \nWithout this legislation, potential leniency applicants could be \ndeterred from self-reporting antitrust violations that otherwise would \nresult in significant criminal prosecutions.\n  I would have preferred that ACPERA be permanently reauthorized. Even \nso, a 10-year extension ensures that the Justice Department can still \nprovide applicants with certainty that the rules of the game will not \nsuddenly shift underneath them. ACPERA's incentives are critical to the \nJustice Department's criminal antitrust enforcement efforts, and I look \nforward to continuing to work to provide the Antitrust Division to \nensure it has the resources necessary to protect consumers.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read three times and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements relating to the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 543) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 545\n\n       Whereas, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of \n     the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n     conducted an investigation into Wall Street and the financial \n     crisis of 2008, examining the role of mortgage lenders, bank \n     regulators, credit rating agencies, and investment banks in \n     causing the crisis;\n       Whereas, the Subcommittee has received requests from \n     federal and state government entities for access to records \n     of the Subcommittee's investigation;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     can, by administrative or judicial process, be taken from \n     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate is needed for the promotion \n     of justice, the Senate will take such action as will promote \n     the ends of justice consistent with the privileges of the \n     Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of \n     the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee \n     on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, acting \n     jointly, are authorized to provide to law enforcement \n     officials, regulatory agencies, and other entities or \n     individuals duly authorized by federal, state, or foreign \n     governments, records of the Subcommittee's investigation into \n     Wall Street and the financial crisis of 2008, examining the \n     role of mortgage lenders, bank regulators, credit rating \n     agencies, and investment banks in causing the crisis.\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 542) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 542\n\n       Whereas on June 20, 1782, the bald eagle was officially \n     designated as the national emblem of the United States by the \n     founding fathers at the Second Continental Congress;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is the central image of the Great \n     Seal of the United States;\n       Whereas the image of the bald eagle is displayed in the \n     official seal of many branches and departments of the Federal \n     Government, including--\n       (1) the Office of the President;\n       (2) the Office of the Vice President;\n       (3) Congress;\n       (4) the Supreme Court;\n       (5) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (6) the Department of Defense;\n       (7) the Department of Justice;\n       (8) the Department of State;\n       (9) the Department of Commerce;\n       (10) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (11) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (12) the Department of Labor;\n       (13) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (14) the Department of Energy;\n       (15) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n       (16) the Central Intelligence Agency; and\n       (17) the Postal Service;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of--\n       (1) the spirit of freedom; and\n       (2) the democracy of the United States;\n       Whereas, since the founding of the Nation, the image, \n     meaning, and symbolism of the bald eagle have played a \n     significant role in the art, music, history, commerce, \n     literature, architecture, and culture of the United States;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is prominently featured on the \n     stamps, currency, and coinage of the United States;\n       Whereas the habitat of bald eagles exists only in North \n     America;\n       Whereas, by 1963, the population of bald eagles that nested \n     in the lower 48 States had declined to approximately 417 \n     nesting pairs;\n       Whereas, due to the dramatic decline in the population of \n     bald eagles in the lower 48 States, the Secretary of the \n     Interior listed the bald eagle as an endangered species on \n     the list of endangered species published under section \n     4(c)(1) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1533(c)(1));\n       Whereas caring and concerned individuals from the Federal, \n     State, and private sectors banded together to save, and help \n     ensure the recovery and protection of, bald eagles;\n       Whereas, on July 20, 1969, the first manned lunar landing \n     occurred in the Apollo 11 Lunar Excursion Module, which was \n     named ``Eagle'';\n       Whereas the ``Eagle'' played an integral role in achieving \n     the goal of the United States of landing a man on the Moon \n     and returning that man safely to Earth;\n       Whereas, in 1995, as a result of the efforts of those \n     caring and concerned individuals, the Secretary of the \n     Interior listed the bald eagle as a threatened species on the \n     list of threatened species published under section 4(c)(1) of \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(1));\n       Whereas, by 2007, the population of bald eagles that nested \n     in the lower 48 States had increased to approximately 10,000 \n     nesting pairs, an increase of approximately 2,500 percent \n     from the preceding 40 years;\n       Whereas, in 2007, the population of bald eagles that nested \n     in the State of Alaska was approximately 50,000 to 70,000;\n       Whereas, on June 28, 2007, the Secretary of the Interior \n     removed the bald eagle from the list of threatened species \n     published under section 4(c)(1) of the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(1));\n       Whereas bald eagles remain protected in accordance with--\n       (1) the Act of June 8, 1940 (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.) \n     (commonly known as the ``Bald Eagle Protection Act of \n     1940''); and\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\n       (2) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.);\n       Whereas, on January 15, 2008, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     issued 3 limited edition bald eagle commemorative coins under \n     the American Bald Eagle Recovery and National Emblem \n     Commemorative Coin Act (Public Law 108-486; 118 Stat. 3934);\n       Whereas the sale of the limited edition bald eagle \n     commemorative coins issued by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     has raised approximately $7,800,000 for the nonprofit \n     American Eagle Foundation of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee to \n     support efforts to protect the bald eagle;\n       Whereas, if not for the vigilant conservation efforts of \n     concerned Americans and the enactment of strict environmental \n     protection laws (including regulations) the bald eagle would \n     probably be extinct;\n       Whereas the American Eagle Foundation has brought \n     substantial public attention to the cause of the protection \n     and care of the bald eagle nationally;\n       Whereas November 4, 2010, marks the 25th anniversary of the \n     American Eagle Foundation;\n       Whereas the dramatic recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles--\n       (1) is an endangered species success story; and\n       (2) an inspirational example for other wildlife and natural \n     resource conservation efforts around the world;\n       Whereas the initial recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles was accomplished by the concerted efforts of numerous \n     government agencies, corporations, organizations, and \n     individuals; and\n       Whereas the continuation of recovery, management, and \n     public awareness programs for bald eagles will be necessary \n     to ensure--\n       (1) the continued progress of the recovery of bald eagles; \n     and\n       (2) that the population and habitat of bald eagles will \n     remain healthy and secure for future generations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 20, 2010, as ``American Eagle Day'';\n       (2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle commemorative coins \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury as a means by which to \n     generate critical funds for the protection of bald eagles; \n     and\n       (3) encourages--\n       (A) educational entities, organizations, businesses, \n     conservation groups, and government agencies with a shared \n     interest in conserving endangered species to collaborate and \n     develop educational tools for use in the public schools of \n     the United States; and\n       (B) the people of the United States to observe American \n     Eagle Day with appropriate ceremonies and other activities.\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 543) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 543\n\n       Whereas Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic disorder \n     that occurs in approximately 1 out of every 15,000 births;\n       Whereas Prader-Willi syndrome is the most commonly known \n     genetic cause of life-threatening obesity;\n       Whereas Prader-Willi syndrome affects--\n       (1) males and females with equal frequency; and\n       (2) all races and ethnicities;\n       Whereas Prader-Willi syndrome causes an extreme and \n     insatiable appetite, often resulting in morbid obesity;\n       Whereas morbid obesity is the major cause of death for \n     individuals with the Prader-Willi syndrome;\n       Whereas Prader-Willi syndrome causes cognitive and learning \n     disabilities and behavioral difficulties, including \n     obsessive-compulsive disorder and difficulty controlling \n     emotions;\n       Whereas the hunger, metabolic, and behavioral \n     characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome force affected \n     individuals to require constant and lifelong supervision in a \n     controlled environment;\n       Whereas studies have shown that individuals with Prader-\n     Willi syndrome have a high morbidity and mortality rate;\n       Whereas there is no known cure for Prader-Willi syndrome;\n       Whereas early diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome allows \n     families to access treatment, intervention services, and \n     support from health professionals, advocacy organizations, \n     and other families who are dealing with the syndrome;\n       Whereas recently discovered treatments, including the use \n     of human growth hormone, are improving the quality of life \n     for individuals with the syndrome and offer new hope to \n     families, but many difficult symptoms associated with Prader-\n     Willi syndrome remain untreated;\n       Whereas increased research into Prader-Willi syndrome--\n       (1) may lead to a better understanding of the disorder, \n     more effective treatments, and an eventual cure for Prader-\n     Willi syndrome; and\n       (2) is likely to lead to a better understanding of common \n     public health concerns, including childhood obesity and \n     mental health; and\n       Whereas advocacy organizations have designated May as \n     Prader-Willi Syndrome Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports raising awareness and educating the public \n     about Prader-Willi syndrome;\n       (2) applauds the efforts of advocates and organizations \n     that encourage awareness, promote research, and provide \n     education, support, and hope to those impacted by Prader-\n     Willi syndrome;\n       (3) recognizes the commitment of parents, families, \n     researchers, health professionals, and others dedicated to \n     finding an effective treatment and eventual cure for Prader-\n     Willi syndrome; and\n       (4) expresses support for the designation of a National \n     Prader-Willi Syndrome Awareness Month.\n\n  The resolution (S. Res 544) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 544\n\n       Whereas in 2003, United States beef exports to China, \n     Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam \n     were valued at $3,300,000,000;\n       Whereas after the discovery of 1 Canadian-born cow infected \n     with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) disease in the \n     State of Washington in December 2003, China, Japan, Hong \n     Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam, among others, \n     closed their markets to United States beef;\n       Whereas for years the Government of the United States has \n     developed and implemented a multilayered system of \n     interlocking safeguards to ensure the safety of United States \n     beef, and after the 2003 discovery, the United States \n     implemented further safeguards to ensure beef safety;\n       Whereas a 2006 study by the United States Department of \n     Agriculture found that BSE was virtually nonexistent in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the internationally recognized standard-setting \n     body, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), has \n     classified the United States as a controlled risk country for \n     BSE, which means that all United States beef and beef \n     products from cattle of all ages is safe for export and \n     consumption;\n       Whereas China continues to prohibit imports of all beef and \n     beef products from the United States;\n       Whereas Japan has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of beef and beef products from cattle less than 21 \n     months of age, but has not yet opened its market for all \n     United States beef and beef products from cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas Hong Kong has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of deboned beef from cattle less than 30 months of \n     age, but has not yet opened its market for all United States \n     beef and beef products from cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas Taiwan has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of deboned and bone-in beef and certain offal \n     products from cattle less than 30 months of age and has \n     agreed to open, but has not yet opened, its market for all \n     United States beef and beef products from cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas South Korea has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of beef and beef products from cattle less than 30 \n     months of age and has agreed to open eventually, but has not \n     yet opened, its market for all United States beef and beef \n     products from cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas Mexico has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of deboned and bone-in beef and certain offal from \n     cattle less than 30 months of age, but has not yet opened its \n     market for all United States beef and beef products from \n     cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas Vietnam has opened its market for United States \n     exporters of beef and beef products from cattle less than 30 \n     months of age, but has not yet opened its market for all \n     United States beef and beef products from cattle of all ages;\n       Whereas between 2004 through 2009, United States beef \n     exports declined due to these restrictions, causing \n     significant revenue losses for United States cattle \n     producers, for example, United States beef exports to Japan \n     and South Korea averaged less than 15 percent of the amount \n     the United States sold to Japan and South Korea in 2003; and\n       Whereas, while China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South \n     Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam remain important trading partners \n     of the United States, unscientific trade restrictions are not \n     consistent with their trade obligations: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) sanitary measures affecting trade in beef and beef \n     products between the United States and China, Japan, Hong \n     Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam should be \n     based on science;\n       (2) since banning United States beef in December 2003, \n     China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and \n     Vietnam have, to varying degrees, failed to comply with \n     internationally recognized scientific guidelines with respect \n     to United States beef and beef products;\n       (3) China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, \n     and Vietnam should fully comply with internationally \n     recognized scientific guidelines;\n       (4) China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, \n     and Vietnam should open their markets to United States \n     exporters of all beef and beef products from cattle of all \n     ages, consistent with OIE guidelines; and\n       (5) the President should continue to insist on full access \n     for United States exporters of\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\n     beef and beef products to the markets in China, Japan, Hong \n     Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/27/senate-section/article/S4562-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n         AND A CONDITIONAL RECESS OR ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
