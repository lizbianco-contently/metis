Madam President, since I last asked unanimous consent to \nhave confirmed three important nominations--one, the top intelligence \nofficial at the Department of Homeland Security, the other a top \nintelligence official at the State Department, and the third the \nhighest ranking member of the entire Pentagon--I said three and there \nare actually four I asked unanimous consent on, and the fourth is an \nindividual who would be the U.S. Representative to the Conference on \nDisarmament. All these positions are dealing with these programs the \nUnited States should be involved in, but we had an objection from the \nRepublicans.\n  There are people out there, evil people, trying to do damage to our \ncountry every day, every week, every month, every hour. It is hard for \nme to comprehend that people with impeccable records, such as Philip \nGoldberg, an appointee of President Bush to be Ambassador to Bolivia, \nwho has an outstanding record of doing things for our country, is being \nobjected to as being the person assigned by the White House and \nSecretary Clinton to be in charge of intelligence at the State \nDepartment.\n  Caryn Wagner, who is eminently qualified, I have never heard anything \nsuggested that there is anything wrong with her background or \nqualifications. Yet there is objection to her being the person who \ndeals with the safety of our homeland.\n  Laura Kennedy is the woman nominated to be the U.S. Representative to \nthe Conference on Disarmament. We are a nuclear power, and the United \nStates doesn't have anybody at these conferences.\n  Finally, GEN Clifford Stanley to be Under Secretary of Defense. This \nman would be the third highest ranking person at the Pentagon. One of \nthe things he is responsible for is making sure all our troops around \nthe world have everything they need. He is responsible for making sure \nthe 30,000 people who are headed for Afghanistan can go to Afghanistan \nwhen deemed ready to go by the Pentagon. That is his job. There is no \none to do that. I can't imagine anybody objecting to that, but they \nhave done so.\n  There isn't enough time in the world--the Senate world, at least--to \nmove cloture on every one of these. We have spent all this week on two \npeople.\n\n[[Page S452]]\n\nToday is Thursday. I know we were interrupted yesterday because of the \nretreat, but we have spent all day on Monday, Tuesday, and now Thursday \non two nominees, one to be the Solicitor at the Department of Labor--\nthat is the lawyer for the entire Department of Labor--and the one we \nare working on today is to have someone run the General Services \nAdministration. The Federal Government is the largest real estate \nholder in the world, and the General Services Administration manages \nthat. Yet we have no one to run that.\n  So we have had to file cloture. Everyone within the sound of my voice \nunderstands it takes a long time to do that. We have to lay it down, \nfile cloture, 2 days, 30 hours. It is not right, and I hope we can get \nmore cooperation.\n  I have been someone who has tried hard not to have the President do \nrecess appointments, but what alternative do we have? What alternative \ndo we have? We have on the calendar dozens of people who are being held \nup--dozens--and I have only picked out a few; these very sensitive \npeople, dealing with the safety and security of our country. I think it \nis without explanation why this is happening.\n\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the following \nnominations, en bloc, and we proceed to executive session, Calendar No. \n561, GEN Clifford Stanley to be Under Secretary of Defense; Calendar \nNo. 603, Laura Kennedy to be U.S. Representative to the Conference on \nDisarmament; Calendar No. 614, Philip Goldberg to be Assistant \nSecretary of State for Intelligence and Research; Calendar No. 615, \nCaryn Wagner to be Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security; that the nominees be confirmed en \nbloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, any \nstatements relating to the nominations appearing at the appropriate \nplace in the Record as if read, and the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nam going to have to do that, I wish to indicate Senator Shelby has been \nin discussions with the administration over an issue with which I am \nnot terribly familiar, and I believe that is the genesis of his \nobjection. He is not able to be here at the moment to state his \nposition. Maybe in discussions with him, we can make some progress on \nthese, sooner rather than later, but for the moment I am constrained to \nobject on his behalf.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I understand the objection of the Senator, \nthe Republican leader, but I don't know what my friend, Senator \nShelby--and I say that because he is my friend--I don't know what \nproblems he has. Whatever it is, I would almost bet a lot it is nothing \nthat would be comparable to holding up these extremely sensitive \npositions keeping our country safe. I think it is outlandish, and I \ncan't imagine this is the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S452-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the \nfollowing nomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of M. Patricia Smith, of \nNew York, to be Solicitor for the Department of Labor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 20 minutes of debate, equally divided and controlled between \nthe Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, and the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nEnzi, or their designees.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise, again, in opposition to the \nnomination of Patricia Smith to serve as the Solicitor of the Labor \nDepartment. As I noted on Monday, the Framers crafted a system of \nchecks and balances to ensure that each government branch has a means \nto review the actions of other branches. In the Senate, one of those \nchecks is our constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on \nexecutive branch nominations.\n  The leader earlier talked about the amount of time it takes for \ncloture on people. It does take quite a while, but it is part of the \nprocess. I can tell you, when there is a hearing on a person, if there \nare 270 questions to start with and the other people in a similar \nposition have a couple dozen questions, you know there is a little bit \nof a problem that could develop with that one person, depending on how \nthey answer or don't answer the questions.\n  This isn't something new. This isn't something that happened just \nthis year. I was chairman of the HELP Committee for 2 years and then \nranking member for 2 years. During that time, President Bush had an \nappointment as the FDA Commissioner that was stopped. We never even got \nhim to the floor. We had an MSHA Director--I think it was the first \nMSHA Director--who worked in a mine. That was the mining safety person. \nWe had a Surgeon General and others. Then the schedule was set up so \nthere were no recesses so there couldn't be recess appointments. So \nthis is an ongoing matter and both sides should take note of that and \nask the person making the nominations to come up with reasonable \nnominations, not people who have an agenda already set out that will \nresult in the kind of conflicts we have had on some of these \nnominations.\n  This advice and consent is a responsibility I take seriously. \nNominees before the Senate must be qualified and present their \ncredentials to us completely and honestly. Senators have an obligation \nto confirm nominees who possess the strength of character and \nexperience required for a position of public trust. I rarely oppose \nPresidential nominees and to date have supported over 50 nominees \nreviewed in the HELP Committee since the President was inaugurated. I \nbelieve the President is ultimately responsible for the conduct of his \nadministration, so he has a right to select his team, up to a point.\n  New York commissioner of labor Patricia Smith's long record of public \nservice--which my colleagues in the majority have discussed in detail--\nwould ordinarily have made her a bipartisan choice to lead one of the \nmost important offices in the U.S. Labor Department. Unfortunately, her \nmisleading testimony to the HELP Committee has caused me to lose \nconfidence in her nomination.\n  I spoke on Monday about the specific factual inconsistencies, and on \nTuesday I discussed a number of other concerns about Ms. Smith's agency \nand a program she created and implemented in New York. I have also \nposted a 41-page report detailing my concerns with Ms. Smith's \nnomination on the HELP Committee Web site.\n  The report found that Ms. Smith misled the HELP Committee over the \ncourse of several months.\n  That report may be found at http://help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/\n2010_02_011.pdf.\n\n[[Page S453]]\n\n  The majority acknowledges that there are factual inconsistencies \nbetween what Ms. Smith said before the HELP Committee and official \ndocuments from the State of New York. The suggestion that the rationale \nfor these inconsistencies lies in the fact that Ms. Smith was busy \nrunning a large agency and cannot really be held accountable for this \nsmall program is simply not supported by the facts. Official documents \nshow the following: Ms. Smith named the program. She personally met \nwith the union organizer and community organizing advocates developing \nit with her subordinates in November 2008. She personally met with the \nfive trade associations concerned about the program. She personally \npromoted the program in speeches, internally to her staff and to the \nmedia.\n  Ms. Smith was involved in close to 100 communications about the \nprogram, either being referenced or as a sender or recipient. Moreover, \nshe admits her program was the topic of numerous personal discussions \nshe had with the New York Governor's Office:\n\n       Beginning in the late fall of 2008, I also discussed the \n     pilot on numerous occasions with Jeff Mans, the Deputy \n     Secretary to the Governor for Labor and Financial Regulation. \n     I have no written notes from the conversations and can not \n     tell you on what days the discussions took place as I speak \n     with Mr. Mans at least three times a week and there was never \n     a conversation specifically devoted to the pilot. The purpose \n     of the conversations was to apprise him of the Labor \n     Department's ideas for the pilot and to get the approval of \n     the Governor's office. . . . I had a telephone conversation \n     with the Assistant Counsel David Weinstein of the Governor's \n     counsel's office, and Deputy Secretary Mans, on February 4th. \n     I answered questions about how the program operated.\n\n  I have heard the suggestion from the other side of the aisle that \nbecause the program does not appear illegal or immoral, Ms. Smith \nshould get a pass for her factual inconsistencies. However, the \nquestion of whether Wage and Hour Watch was ethical or legal is \nirrelevant to whether Ms. Smith's testimony was inaccurate or \nmisleading.\n  The majority also argues there was a possible breakdown between Ms. \nSmith and her deputy that caused the misleading testimony. Ms. Smith, \nhowever, has worked with her deputy for more than five years. Moreover, \nif confirmed, Ms. Smith would be in charge of legal compliance for a \nDepartment whose budget projects spending ten times what she oversees \nin New York--$104.5 billion in 2010. Leaving aside the extensive \ndocumentation showing she was heavily involved in this program, I ask \nmy colleagues: why would we consider expanding her responsibility \ntenfold when she has been unable to oversee her subordinates \neffectively in New York?\n  In August, I noted my concerns to President Obama, and offered my \nassistance in ensuring a qualified replacement would be confirmed \nquickly. I also joined nine Republican HELP Committee members in urging \nChairman Harkin to refrain from approving this nominee in committee and \nmade the same offer of assistance in ensuring a qualified replacement \nis given a swift review and confirmation. I was forced to insist on a \nfull debate on her nomination, which advanced on a party-line vote this \npast Monday.\n  It is clear that Ms. Smith's statements misled the committee. It is \nalso apparent that each inconsistent statement in effect downplayed \nconcerns held by Republican members. Most disturbing, however, is that \nher written committee responses suggest Ms. Smith knew her testimony \nwas misleading as early as July 2009 but did not correct the problem \nuntil contacted by a. majority staff in September--more than 2 months \nlater.\n  I strongly believe that confirming someone as a head legal officer \nfor a Cabinet agency under these circumstances sends the wrong message \nto the American people and the career staff she will oversee. I am also \nparticularly disappointed that such a controversial nominee is being \nforced through before newly elected Senator Scott Brown is sworn in. \nThese sorts of actions may be part of the reason public confidence in \nCongress and the government is so low.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have listened again to my friend, and \nhe is my friend. We worked together on a lot of issues, and we will \ncontinue to work together on issues. I have listened to Senator Enzi's \ncomments, and I was thinking, is there anything new here? We have heard \nall this before, on and on and again. No matter how many times you \nrepeat it, it just doesn't seem to hold much water.\n  I grant Ms. Smith made two mistakes in her testimony, two mistakes \nwhen she appeared before the committee--which she corrected. One of \nthose had to do with the origins of the program. When she was asked \nabout this, she thought at that time that the program really had kind \nof originated among her staff. What she found out was that some of her \nstaff had been talking to outside groups about this. The idea seemed to \ncome from just a meeting of different people, but both within her \nagency and outside, so Ms. Smith corrected that. That is hardly a cause \nfor her not assuming this position. Again, why would she want to \nmislead the committee on that when there was nothing wrong with it? So \nthe idea came from an outside group--so what? It doesn't make any \ndifference. She was just trying to answer honestly where she thought \nthe idea had originated within her agency. So, again, she corrected \nthat, as we let people do.\n  The second one had to do with the expansion of the program. I read \nthe testimony, I read the record more than once on that. She has \nanswered that in writing back. It was a question by Senator Burr about \nwhether she had plans for expansion, something like that. She said no \nto that.\n  What she meant to say--and when she reread it, she answered in \nwriting--she had not authorized an expansion of the program. Yes, she \nhad discussions with her staff and maybe others about, if the pilot \nprogram actually worked and was successful, yes, they would plan to \nexpand it. But they had to get the pilot program through first to see \nwhat went wrong, what went right, does it need to be changed, does it \nneed to be modified before there can be an expansion. So, again, she \ncorrected the record on that, saying she had not authorized an \nexpansion of the program at that point.\n  Again, there were two minor mistakes corrected in writing. That is \nhardly a cause for denying her this position. As I pointed out \nyesterday, we correct the Record all the time around here when we speak \non the Senate floor because maybe I made a mistake in what I really \nwanted to say, I didn't say it correctly. I probably should not say \nthis, but sometimes reporters don't kind of get the nuance of what we \nwanted to say, perhaps, and how we wanted say it. So we correct the \nRecord all the time. It is done all the time around here between what \nyou say and what you read in the Congressional Record because human \nbeings make mistakes. So, again, hardly a cause for denying Patricia \nSmith this position.\n  Again, I daresay I have not heard anyone question her qualifications. \nShe is eminently well qualified for this position. As I said the day \nbefore yesterday--and I put in the Record a number of letters from \nbusiness groups in New York supporting her, saying she was fair and \njudicious, worked with them. She has run the department of labor in New \nYork--I think an $11 billion agency with about 4,000 employees. No one \nhas ever questioned her ability to run that agency.\n  We have heard: Well, if she didn't know what was going on with this \nlittle $4,000 pilot project, then she can't run an agency. You know, \nagain, we always delegate to staff--especially if you have large stuff \nand you are running big things--about little things like that that they \ncan do.\n  Again, I heard my friend say she knew about this program. Of course \nshe knew about the program, she knew about the pilot program. Frankly, \nI think she was kind of excited about the program to see whether it \nwould work and if it was a legitimate, good program that would work to \nhelp inform people of their rights under the law. Surely, my friend is \nnot saying that is something that should not be done--help people, \ninform them of their rights, or to report violations of the law. \nSurely, no one is saying no one, if they see a violation of the law, \nshould\n\n[[Page S454]]\n\nnot report it. But that is what this Wage Watch was supposed to do.\n  She made it clear in her statement of January 2009--in her statement, \nnot staff's statement but her statement and her e-mail to her \nsubordinates--that this was not an investigative arm, they were not \nreplacing staff, this was merely an informational group, and also to \nsee if there were any violations of law, to report it. Surely, no one \ncan say that is not a legitimate function of volunteer groups.\n  Again, we are here to vote on final passage of the nomination of \nPatricia Smith for Solicitor of the Department of Labor. I am glad we \ncan finally bring this to a close. It has gone on too long. We have \nbeen considering it on the floor since Monday, postcloture. In all that \ntime, there has been very little by way of debate. We have only had two \nRepublican Members come to this floor to speak and explain why they \noppose this critical nomination.\n  There is nothing new about Patricia Smith that we have learned since \nMonday. Indeed, nothing has emerged that we didn't know when we voted \nher out of committee back in September. We know she is well qualified, \nextremely. Everyone acknowledges this. She has an impressive record of \naccomplishments at the New York Department of Labor. She is strongly \nsupported by local leaders and even the local business community. \nAgain, this, too, is undisputed. And as I said, she corrected in \nwriting these two errors she made when she testified before the HELP \nCommittee last year.\n  In the 4 months that have passed since the Republicans first \nthreatened to filibuster her nomination, we have not learned one new \npiece of information that can change anyone's mind about whether she is \na qualified candidate to serve as Solicitor of Labor. All the last 4 \nmonths of delay has achieved is to keep her out her job and hamper the \nDepartment of Labor's ability to perform its important function.\n  That is not what this process is supposed to be about. This \ngovernment cannot function if we, as Senators entrusted with the \nimportant power to advise and consent on Presidential nominations, \nabuse that power--I repeat, abuse that power by using extraordinary \nprocedural tactics to block the nominations of qualified people. The \nfilibuster, as I understand it, was supposed to be reserved for extreme \ncases when there are critical public policy issues at stake, where the \ncountry may be divided on them. It is not supposed to be a routine \ndelay tactic for every nominee the minority party disagrees with or \nthat one person--not the entire group but one person--disagrees with.\n  The American people are getting fed up, and they should be. We cannot \neven get routine business conducted around here anymore. American \nfamilies are sitting around the kitchen table worried about a lot of \nthings--about their health care, about their kids' education, and more \nthan anything, about their jobs--if they don't have one, about when \nthey are going to get one, and if they have one, can they keep it. How \nthey are going to pay their bills if they become unemployed? We can't \nhelp them, we can't help the families of America by spending day after \nday of time here in quorum calls, with the lights on, the electricity \nrunning, people here, and we do nothing, we just sit here because the \nRepublican side has engaged in a filibuster. Playing these procedural \ngames does not advance our country one bit.\n  We can, however, help our families by attacking the jobs problem with \nevery weapon in our arsenal, and that includes a fully staffed and \nstrong Department of Labor. While I am sorry it has come to this, this \nlong filibuster and all these days wasted, I am glad this process has \ncome to an end. It is time to vote so we can let Patricia Smith get to \nwork, so we can get back to the business here of helping our families \nacross America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, what is the time situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming has 2 \nminutes 40 seconds. The Senator from Iowa has 34 seconds.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, this argument about using the filibuster--\nI have to say that both sides have used the same cloture techniques. I \nthink if you check with the Bush nominees, we usually withdrew those \nand put someone else in. Of course, that had something to do with the \nrelative size of the majorities.\n  But the problem here is with how the program was run. We keep talking \nabout whether it was legal. It probably was legal, but there are some \nthings done there that I don't think the average person wants done to \nthem. The Wage and Hour program was to recruit and train union \norganizers and public interest groups to go into businesses with \ncompliance literature and interview employees to discover violations of \nthe wage and hour law. It was expanded to include OSHA.\n  The State of New York gives participants materials to disseminate and \nofficial cards identifying them and their group as part of a program \nfor when they enter businesses and speak with the employers and \nemployees. As part of this process, union and community organizers were \ndirected to gather personal telephone numbers, vehicle license plates \nand home addresses of business owners, as well as details about the \nemployees working there. Labor organizers and community activists were \nallowed to use this information for their own organizing activities. \nState identification cards were provided to the individuals, but the \nState conducted no background check on those they trained and provided \nidentification cards. Is that the kind of program we would expect Ms. \nSmith to federalize if she became a Solicitor?\n  A deep concern to me is how Ms. Smith described the decision not to \nconduct vetting or background checks for the Wage and Hour Watch \nparticipants who could collect this personal information. When \nquestioned about it, she explained there is no formal vetting process \nfor the New York State Department of Labor to partner with an entity. \nThey did not consider the possibility of background checks on the \ngroups, but ultimately rejected the idea after inquiring as to why the \nNeighborhood Watch groups were subjected to background checks. The \ndepartment was informed that the groups participating in this more \nsensitive crime prevention partnership are not subject to a check. But \nthere is a major difference in the way they work. The National \nSheriff's Association Neighborhood Watch Program, unlike the Wage and \nHour, is purely an observe and report program. Calling the police about \nsuspicious activity in a public area is different than investigating \nthe wages and hours of individual employees and recording their \npersonal contact information.\n  So for these reasons, and the ones I have given on previous \noccasions, and that Senator Isakson has given and members of the \ncommittee have expressed, I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me put one thing to rest here. No one on Wage Watch \nwas authorized to enter any business unless the business owner agreed \nto that. The only exception is if the public was allowed. Sure, they \ncould go into a department store or a restaurant or someplace such as \nthat where the general public went. But they could not go into any \nbusiness without the business owner's permission, and they could do \nnothing other than what the general public can do right now.\n  We need more people doing what these volunteers were doing and making \nsure that people's rights are respected.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, the Senate will finally have an \nup-or-down vote on the nomination of Patricia Smith to be Solicitor \nGeneral for the Department of Labor. Earlier this week the Senate voted \nto invoke cloture and end the 15th filibuster of President Obama's \nnominations to fill important posts in the executive branch and the \njudiciary. That number does not include the many others who have been \ndenied up or down votes in the Senate by the anonymous obstruction of \nRepublicans refusing to agree to time agreements to consider even \nnoncontroversial nominees.\n  Every single Republican Senator who voted on Monday voted against \ncloture and to keep filibustering this well-qualified nominee. Every \nsingle Republican voted to obstruct the Senate from doing the business \nof the American\n\n[[Page S455]]\n\npeople. Wasn't it just a few years ago that Republicans were demanding \nup or down votes for nominees, and contending that filibusters of \nnominations were unconstitutional? Not a single Republican voted for \ncloture and to stop the filibuster of this nomination.\n  The obstruction and delay does not stop there. Since 60 Members of \nthe Senate voted to invoke cloture and bring the debate to a close, \nRepublican Senators have insisted on delaying the vote for several \nadditional days. This afternoon, that up-or-down vote finally takes \nplace.\n  After the Senate is finally able to consider the Smith nomination, we \nwill then have the opportunity to end the filibuster of another \nnomination, that of Martha Johnson to head the General Services \nAdministration, GSA. Her nomination has been stalled on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar since June 8 due to the opposition of a single \nRepublican Senator over a dispute with GSA about plans for a Federal \nbuilding in his home State. The will of the Senate and the needs of the \nAmerican people are held hostage by a single Senator.\n  Overall, as of this morning, there were more than 75 judicial and \nexecutive nominees pending on the Senate Executive calendar, many being \nheld up for purely political purposes.\n  Yesterday, at the Democratic Policy Committee's issue retreat, I \nasked President Obama if he will continue to work hard to send names to \nthe Senate as quickly as possible and to commit to work with us, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, to get these nominees confirmed. So far \nsince taking office, the President has reached across the aisle working \nwith Republicans and Democrats to identify well-qualified nominations. \nYet even these nominations are delayed or obstructed. The President \nresponded by stating:\n\n       Well, this is going to be a priority. Look, it's not just \n     judges, unfortunately, Pat, it's also all our federal \n     appointees. We've got a huge backlog of folks who are \n     unanimously viewed as well qualified; nobody has a specific \n     objection to them, but end up having a hold on them because \n     of some completely unrelated piece of business.\n       On the judges front, we had a judge for the--coming out of \n     Indiana, Judge Hamilton, who everybody said was outstanding--\n     Evan Bayh, Democrat; Dick Lugar, Republican; all recommended. \n     How long did it take us? Six months, six, seven months for \n     somebody who was supported by the Democratic and Republican \n     senator from that state. And you can multiply that across the \n     board. So we have to start highlighting the fact that this is \n     not how we should be doing business.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Let's have a fight about real stuff. Don't hold this woman \n     hostage. If you have an objection about my health care \n     policies, then let's debate the health care policies. But \n     don't suddenly end up having a GSA administrator who is stuck \n     in limbo somewhere because you don't like something else that \n     we're doing, because that doesn't serve the American people.\n\n  I could not agree more with President Obama. This should not be the \nway the Senate acts. Unfortunately, we have seen the repeated use of \nfilibusters, and delay and obstruction have become the new norm for the \nRepublicans in the Senate. We have seen unprecedented obstruction by \nSenate Republicans on issue after issue--over 100 filibusters last year \nalone, which has affected 70 percent of all Senate action. Instead of \ntime agreements and the will of the majority, the Senate is faced with \na requirement to find 60 Senators to overcome a filibuster on issue \nafter issue. Those who just a short time ago said that a majority vote \nis all that should be needed to confirm a nomination, and that \nfilibusters of nominations are unconstitutional, have reversed \nthemselves and now employ any delaying tactic they can.\n  The Republican practice of making supermajorities the new standard to \nproceed to consider many noncontroversial and well-qualified \nnominations for important posts in the executive branch, and to fill \nvacancies on the Federal courts, is having a debilitating effect. \nDespite the fact that President Obama began sending judicial nominees \nto the Senate 2 months earlier than President Bush, last year's total \nwas the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the first year of a \nPresidency since 1953, a year in which President Eisenhower only made \nnine nominations all year, all of which were confirmed. The number of \nconfirmations was even below the 17 the Senate Republican majority \nallowed to be confirmed in the 1996 session. The Senate could have \nconsidered and confirmed another 10 judicial nominees that had all been \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Only 12 of President \nObama's judicial nominations to Federal circuit and district courts \nwere confirmed all last year, less than half of what we achieved during \nthe second half of President Bush's first tumultuous year.\n  We have confirmed only two more judicial nominees so far this year. \nRepublicans have objected to consideration of the nomination of Joseph \nGreenaway of New Jersey to the Third Circuit, a nomination reported \nunanimously from the Senate Judiciary Committee last October. His would \nbe the next judicial nomination to consider and confirm, but Senate \nRepublicans object.\n  Even after years of Republican pocket filibusters that blocked more \nthan 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees, Democrats did not \npractice this kind of obstruction and delay in considering President \nBush's nominations. We worked hard to reverse the Republican \nobstructionism. In the second half of 2001, the Democratic majority in \nthe Senate proceeded to confirm 28 judges. By this date during \nPresident Bush's first term, the Senate had confirmed 31 circuit and \ndistrict court nominations compared to only 14 during President Obama's \nfirst two years. In the second year of President Bush's first term, the \nDemocratic majority proceeded to confirm 72 judicial nominations, and \nhelped reduce the vacancies left by Republican obstructionism from over \n110 to 59 by the end of 2002. Overall, in the 17 months that I chaired \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first term, the \nSenate confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees.\n  We continued to be fair and continued working to reduce judicial \nvacancies even during President Bush's last year in office. With \nDemocrats again in the majority, we reduced judicial vacancies to as \nlow as 34, even though it was a Presidential election year. When \nPresident Bush left office, we had reduced vacancies in nine of the 13 \nFederal circuits.\n  The Republican Senate minority has resumed its strategy to put \npartisan politics ahead of the needs of the American people for courts \nthat can provide justice. Last year was worse than the 1996 session \nwhen they allowed confirmation of only 17 judicial nominees. The years \nof demands from Republican Senators for up-or-down votes for every \nnominee apparently only applied to those nominated by a Republican \npresident.\n  As matters stand today, judicial vacancies have spiked again as they \ndid due to Republican obstruction in the 1990s, and are again being \nleft unfilled. We started 2010 with the highest number of vacancies on \narticle III courts since 1994, when the vacancies created by the last \ncomprehensive judgeship bill were still being filled. While it has been \nnearly 20 years since we enacted a Federal judgeship bill, judicial \nvacancies are nearing record levels, with 102 current vacancies and \nanother 21 already announced. If we had proceeded on the judgeship bill \nrecommended by the Judicial Conference to address the growing burden on \nour Federal judiciary, as we did in 1984 and 1990, in order to provide \nthe resources the courts need, current vacancies would stand over 160 \ntoday. That is the true measure of how far behind we have fallen. \nJustice should not be delayed or denied to any American because of \noverburdened courts and the lack of Federal judges. The rule of law \ndemands more. The American people deserve better.\n  Among the nominees ready for Senate approval are nine Federal \njudicial nominees reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Two would \nfill vacancies on the Third Circuit, three would fill vacancies on the \nFourth Circuit, and there are nominees to fill vacancies on the First, \nSecond and Sixth Circuits, as well as a district court nominee to \nWisconsin. The delay in considering them is also part of this effort to \ndelay and obstruct. Judge Greenaway, about whom Senators Lautenberg and \nMenendez spoke again this week, was reported by unanimous consent back \nin October, four months ago. Nobody has come forward to explain why his \nnomination is being stalled. He is a good judge. Senator Sessions \npraised him at his confirmation hearing. Judge Greenaway is one\n\n[[Page S456]]\n\nof the many outstanding judicial nominations reported by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that remain stalled on the Senate Executive \nCalendar. They should have been confirmed last year and would have but \nfor Republican objection. When considered, they will be confirmed but \nnot before being needlessly delayed for months.\n  They insisted on debate on the nomination of Judge Gerard Lynch, who \nwas confirmed with more than 90 votes. Republicans insisted on hours of \ndebate for the nomination of Judge Andre Davis, who was confirmed with \nmore than 70 votes. Senate Republicans unsuccessfully filibustered the \nnomination of Judge David Hamilton last November, having delayed its \nconsideration for months. For at least 2 additional months, Judge \nBeverly Martin's nomination was stalled because Republicans would not \nagree to consider it before January 20. Judge Martin had the strong \nsupport of both of her home State Republican Senators, Senator \nChambliss and Senator Isakson, and the highest possible rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. \nStill, Republicans delayed her consideration.\n  None of the nine Federal circuit and district court nominations \npending as of this morning on the Senate Executive Calendar should be \ncontroversial. Six were reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwithout a single dissenting vote. One had 1 negative vote, one had 3 \nnegatives votes and the nominee from Tennessee supported by Senator \nAlexander had 4 negatives votes but 15 in favor, including three \nRepublicans. We have wasted weeks and months having to seek time \nagreements in order to consider nominations that were reported by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee unanimously and who are then confirmed \nunanimously by the Senate once they were finally allowed to be \nconsidered. That obstruction and delay continues.\n  The American people deserve better. The cost will be felt by ordinary \nAmericans seeking justice in our overburdened Federal courts. President \nObama has reached across the aisle and worked with Republican Senators, \nincluding Senators Lugar, Martinez, Shelby, Sessions, Thune, Alexander, \nBurr, Chambliss and Isakson. I wish Senator Republicans and the Senate \nRepublican leadership would reconsider their tactics of obstruction and \ndelay and work with us and with the President.\n  The Republican minority must believe that this partisan playbook of \nobstruction will reap political benefit for them and damage to the \nPresident. But the people who pay the price for this political \ncalculation are the American people who depend on the government being \nable to do its job. I hope that Republican Senators will rethink their \npolitical strategy and return to the Senate's tradition of promptly \nconsidering noncontroversial nominations so that we can work together \nto regain the trust of the American people.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

JOHNSON TO BE ADMINISTRATOR, GENERAL SERVICES \n                             ADMINISTRATION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 2 hours of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the Johnson nomination, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the leaders or their designees.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Martha N. Johnson, of \nMaryland, to be Administrator, General Services Administration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues in the \nstrongest terms to vote for cloture on the nomination of Martha Johnson \nto be Administrator of the General Services Administration. The point \nof cloture is to allow this critical agency to finally have a permanent \nleader. It would be the first time in nearly 2 years and could \npotentially save America's taxpayers billions of dollars in the \nbargain.\n  Let me give a few examples of what is at stake, which is to say what \nthe General Services Administration can do for us. Last year, Federal \nagencies bought $53 billion worth of goods and services, and they did \nso through contracts negotiated by the General Services Administration, \nthe GSA. Having GSA negotiate these procurements lets the individual \nagencies focus on their core missions, doing what we or previous \nCongresses created them to do. It also allows the Federal Government to \nleverage our buying power because if the buying is occurring from one \ncentral agency, we can get, in conventional terms, volume discounts, \nleading to lower costs and, therefore, savings to the taxpayers.\n  We need strong leadership at GSA to ensure these savings are a \nreality. For example, in 2007, GSA awarded the NETWORX contracts to \nprovide telephone network and information technology services to all \nFederal agencies. That is a program estimated to be valued at, at \nleast, $68 billion in the course of its 10-year lifetime. These \ncontracts will allow agencies to take full advantage of the new \ntechnologies their colleagues in the private sector use every day to \nincrease efficiency and lower costs. But without a permanent \nAdministrator at GSA, agencies have been slow to move to the NETWORX \nservices, costing taxpayers more than $150 million to date and an \nadditional $18 million every month.\n\n  Given GSA's wide responsibilities in providing information technology \nand telecommunications services, I am concerned that we lack a \nconfirmed Administrator at a time when we are also trying, of course, \nto strengthen our cyber-defenses. Government Web sites, such as private \nWeb sites, are constantly under attack. GSA needs to play and can play \na very important role in ensuring that our Federal IT systems are \nresistant to those cyber-attacks. Furthermore, because of the \ngovernment's buying power, GSA's purchases will have a natural positive \nspillover effect in the private sector.\n  In other words, GSA, by its own requirements associated with \npurchases, can drive technologies that then become more available to \nthe general public, and I am thinking here specifically of technologies \nthat can defend\n\n[[Page S457]]\n\nagainst cyber-attack on private companies as well as on public Web \nsites.\n  Here is another example about another function of the GSA. GSA is \neffectively the government's landlord, with 8,600 buildings and assets \nunder its control that are valued at more than $500 billion. It is one \nof the largest, if not the largest, property management organizations \nin the world.\n  Another of GSA's roles is to help other agencies dispose of buildings \nand property they no longer need. Across the government, these numbers \nare both stunning and unsettling. There are different agencies that own \nthousands of buildings worth about $18 billion that are not being used.\n  Every day I hear Members come to the floor saying we need to work \nhard to trim the fat from the Federal budget so we can cut the deficit. \nI agree. Yet the GSA--the very agency established to help make \ngovernment operations more cost efficient--has been languishing without \na leader for over half a year and I think in that sense is losing some \nopportunities to save some money.\n  What is frustrating is that a hold has been placed on this nominee \nfor reasons that have nothing to do with her qualifications or her \npersonal history. That is why I am glad Senator Reid filed a cloture \nmotion and we have forced this nomination to the floor. It is \nimportant, in a totally nonpartisan way, that we get a full-time \nAdministrator in here at GSA.\n  Martha Johnson's nomination received the unanimous support of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in June of last \nyear--more than half a year ago. So that says she had total bipartisan \nsupport in our committee based on her experience and qualifications, \nand I am confident she has wide bipartisan support in the full Senate \nas well. I hope and trust we will see that when the vote occurs on \ncloture and final confirmation at around 3 o'clock.\n  I hope this nomination is a call to action and common sense--and not \nonly bipartisan cooperation but the cooperation of every Member here \nwho has the right to hold up nominations but ought to think about the \npublic interest and the national interest when they do this--that we \ncannot continue the practice of holding nominees ``hostage,'' as \nPresident Obama said yesterday, for reasons that are parochial and \nunrelated to the nominee's ability to do the job they have been \nnominated for. I think these kinds of actions damage the Senate as an \ninstitution and further reduce the public's respect for how we do our \nbusiness.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues at this point how well qualified this \nnominee is. To begin with, Ms. Johnson is a former Chief of Staff of \nthe GSA. So she already knows the agency inside and out and will be \nready to roll up her sleeves and get to work on day one--no on-the-job \ntraining needed. This is crucial both to the efficiency and morale of \nan agency that has not had a permanent Administrator since April of \n2008--almost 2 years. April 2008 was the time when the former Director \nwas asked to resign by the previous administration. GSA has since been \nrun by five acting Administrators who could not act with the same \nauthority as a Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed person in \nthat top job.\n  But both before and after her government service, Martha Johnson's \ncareer shows a quite extraordinary mix of work in the public, private, \nand academic sectors that we should want in government service. Ms. \nJohnson holds a BA in economics and history from Oberlin College and an \nMBA from Yale Business School. She also taught some classes during this \ntime.\n  After graduating from Yale, Ms. Johnson began her career in the \nprivate sector as a manager at Cummins Engines Company. She then had a \nseries of other management positions in the private sector and was \nasked by President Clinton to become Associate Deputy Secretary of \nCommerce, and then Chief of Staff of GSA from 1996 to 2001.\n  Since leaving government service in 2001, Ms. Johnson has served as a \nvice president for the Council for Excellence in Government--a \nnonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing the \neffectiveness of government at all levels--and, most recently, she \nserved as a vice president for Computer Sciences Corporation.\n  This is an extraordinarily experienced and qualified nominee, and \nthat is why I think she deserves--and I think will receive--broad \nbipartisan support when this matter comes to a vote at around 3 \no'clock.\n  It is past time for GSA to finally have a permanent Administrator, \nand we happen to have a nominee here who is remarkably well suited for \nthe job. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote ``yes'' on cloture, \nand then we can have a final vote and get this able person on the job \nworking for the American people and I think help us not only manage the \nFederal Government's activities better but to save billions--literally \nbillions--of dollars for the American taxpayers.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I would yield, if I might, to my friend and colleague from Louisiana \nwhatever time she needs to speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank the Senator \nfrom Connecticut for yielding the remainder of his time. I understand \nhe has an hour under his control, and I intend to take the full measure \nof the hour that is left, first speaking in favor of the nominee who he \nhas so eloquently described in terms of her background and experience \nand the arguments he is making about trying to bring more civility and \nbipartisanship to this body and the importance of getting some of these \nvery important Federal officials appointed so government can work \nbetter and more efficiently.\n  It has been my pleasure to serve with the chairman now for several \nyears on the Homeland Security Committee, and I am familiar with the \nwork he and his ranking member, Susan Collins, the Senator from Maine, \nhave done together. They have shown a real example of bipartisanship, \nand I would hope his calls for this nominee to move forward without \ndelay and not be held up would be heeded.\n\n\n                         Louisiana FMAP Formula\n\n  Mr. President, I am on the floor to speak about a different subject, \none that is very important to the State of Louisiana and the people of \nour State--an issue that has been mischaracterized for months now in \nall sorts of venues--and I thought taking an opportunity today, for a \ncouple of hours, to go through the request by the State of Louisiana \nfor a change or realignment of our FMAP formula, the formula that funds \nour Medicaid system, would be good to do.\n  It is good to do for several reasons, the most important of which is \nnot to bring up this subject again for further review to try to clear \nanything that people have said about me. I have been in public office \nnow for 30 years. People have said all sorts of things about me as a \npublic official. I would venture to say every Member of this body has \nbeen called some very choice names. That is actually not why I am here, \nto defend myself. The Record will do that.\n\n  What I am here to do is to defend the people of Louisiana and to \nexpress clearly and strongly why and how our delegation came forward, \nunited in a very public way, to press our case here in Washington--the \nonly place this can be fixed--why we felt as a delegation, strongly \nunited Democrats and Republicans, to press this case to the Federal \nGovernment to get some immediate and necessary and urgent relief for \nthe people of our State.\n  I make no apologies for leading this effort. I do not back up an inch \nfrom the yearlong effort we have undertaken. I am here today because I \nactually do not have any idea at the moment what will happen to the \nhealth care bill we have worked on for the better part of a year. I do \nnot know if we are going to have a bill. I do not know if it is going \nto be the Senate version or the House version. I do not know if it is \ngoing to be a bill passed by 60-plus people or more on the Senate side \nand a wide majority in the House. I do not know if there is going to be \nreconciliation that is used. Those discussions are happening actually \nright now above my pay grade.\n  But what is in my pay grade, what I actually do get paid to do here, \nis to represent the people of Louisiana, and I intend to do that for \nthe better part of this hour and for the rest of the day because there \nhas been some great misunderstanding about this in the national media--\nnot much in the mainstream media but on the fringes; but\n\n[[Page S458]]\n\nsometimes those fringes can be quite loud, and I would like to try my \nbest to silence them a little bit at this point. The mainstream media \nhas been, for the most part, taking their time to understand, and I \nappreciate it.\n  I most certainly appreciate the newspapers in my State that actually \nknow more about this than any media outlets. They would because they \nhave covered it longer, have editorialized generally in my favor and \nthe favor of our delegation that has stood strong, except two members \nwho have folded on this issue.\n  So I want to start to try to take everyone through chronologically \nthe timeframe. First of all, I have been, and the State of Louisiana \nhas been, criticized for a ``secret'' deal, for something that happened \nat the very end of the process that people did not know about.\n  I wish to call everyone's attention to a Times-Picayune headline--\nthis is the newspaper in New Orleans--a Times-Picayune headline, dated \nJanuary 11, 2009. We are in February of 2010, so this was a year ago. \nThis was a year ago. I also would call to the attention of my critics \nthat this date is actually almost 2 weeks before President Obama was \never sworn into office, just to remind people.\n  This meeting, called by my Governor, who is a Republican Governor, \nhappened in a public place, in the Governor's mansion in Baton Rouge \nand five members of our delegation were there, and the entire \ndelegation was represented. It was reported at length in several \npapers. In the Times-Picayune, this is the headline: ``Jindal reviews \nwish list with LA delegation; aid for recovery, health care stressed.'' \nThis is the other headline: ``Governor Jindal Stresses Urgent Need for \nFederal Government to Fix Faulty FMAP Rate.'' Let me repeat that: \n``Governor Jindal Stresses Urgent Need for Federal Government to Fix \nFaulty FMAP Rate.'' Not special FMAP rate, not FMAP rate problems that \nevery State is fixing, but faulty FMAP. I will explain why we think it \nis faulty in a minute.\n\n  ``The Advocate,'' August 29. This was in July. These meetings \ncontinued through the year: Jindal, Republican Governor; Landrieu, \nDemocratic Senator, Pushed for Federal Funding Fix.\n  So I wish to put my critics on notice. I am going to submit letters \nand documents and these articles. Nothing about this effort was secret. \nNothing. If there is one Member of this body, either the junior Senator \nfrom Louisiana, or the great Senator from Arizona, or any other Senator \nwho would like to come and talk to me about this ``secret'' effort, I \nwould look forward to hearing their comments on the floor of this \nSenate sometime today because I am staying here today until 6 or 7 \no'clock, until we go out of session tonight. I thought it would be good \nto spend the better part of the day.\n  If anyone, if any Senator, wants to come down and say they thought \nthis was some kind of secret arrangement, I think the editors of our \nnewspapers would be very interested since they have been reporting on \nit since the first meeting on January 11, 2009.\n  Secondly, I wish to show a letter signed by our entire delegation to \nmake another point. My critics have said: Oh, there she goes again, \nSenator Landrieu, just running off on her own making all sorts of \nterrible things and making the State of Louisiana look bad.\n  I have spent 30 years of my life trying to represent the people of my \nState and make them look good. Even when they were wrong, I have \ndefended them. When they were right, I praised them. When I was wrong, \nI apologized; and when I was right, I was very proud of my work. \nNever--never--in my life have I ever or will ever throw the people of \nmy State under a bus to save my reputation or my job.\n  I know who I am inside. I don't need anyone to remind me of the \ngoodness I have inside. My parents do that. My husband does that. My \nchildren do that for me every day. I most certainly don't need anyone--\nand I don't need this job badly enough; maybe some people do, I don't--\nto throw the people of my State under a bus to protect myself \npolitically.\n  I wish to show everyone a letter dated May 4, and I am going to read \nevery single signature because I am actually proud to lead this \ndelegation. I only have one Democrat besides myself, but other than \nabout one member of this delegation, we have some pretty extraordinary \nleaders. I am proud of them. Some are very conservative and some are \nvery liberal and some are in the middle. We have a very diverse \ndelegation.\n  I signed this letter; Rodney Alexander signed this letter, a member \nof the Appropriations Committee; Charlie Melancon signed this letter, a \nMember of Congress; Bill Cassidy is a Member from Baton Rouge; David \nVitter, the Senator; Charles Boustany from Lafayette; Steve Scalise \nfrom Jefferson Parish; and John Fleming from Shreveport and Joseph Cao, \na Vietnamese-American Member of Congress from the New Orleans area \nsigned this letter.\n  This was made public. Actually, some Members put out their own press \nreleases. The letter is to Secretary Sebelius, who was finally sworn in \nafter being held up for months:\n\n       We write to you today to follow up on an April 9 letter \n     your office received from Louisiana Secretary Alan Levine.\n\n  That is our Secretary.\n\n       While many states will face challenges to their Medicaid \n     programs in the coming years, we believe that Louisiana's \n     case is unique.\n\n  We believe Louisiana's case is unique.\n\n       As you may be aware, our state is still rebuilding from \n     Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 as well as Hurricanes \n     Gustav and Ike in 2008, including the rehabilitation of the \n     health care system in the New Orleans area. These extensive \n     recovery efforts have inflated Louisiana's per capita income, \n     but they were only temporary and do not accurately reflect \n     the increases to incomes in industries not related to the \n     hurricane recovery.\n       Since the FMAP formula per capita to calculate how much \n     each state will receive, we are greatly concerned that the \n     post hurricane per capita income increase would significantly \n     impact our State's FMAP allocation. We ask that you meet with \n     Secretary Levine to develop a solution to the unique problem \n     that our state is facing.\n\n  This is an example of one letter--I have many others--signed by our \nentire delegation asking the officials here, from the White House to \nKathleen Sebelius to other powerful Members, to please look at \nLouisiana's situation because ours alone among the 50 States was \nunique, and I will explain why in a minute.\n  So the fact that this was a secret is a lie. The fact that it wasn't \nsupported by our delegation is a lie.\n  Now I wish to explain what our problem is, and this map explains it--\nor chart--better than I can. As anyone knows how this Federal formula \nworks for Medicaid, Medicaid is a voluntary program to a certain extent \nthat States can enter into to cover their very poor. The Federal \nGovernment says: If you want to do that, if you are a wealthy State, we \nwill pick up 50 percent of your effort. If you are a moderately wealthy \nState, we will pick up 60 percent of your effort. And if you are one of \nthe poorest States in the Union--not that Louisiana isn't an \nextraordinary State, but we have high poverty relative to other States, \njust like Mississippi and Alabama, West Virginia. We know who our \ncohorts are. We have been at this a long time.\n  For us, the Federal Government says: If you try to cover your poor, \nwe will pick up 70 percent for you, which is the right thing to do. The \nFederal Government should help the poorest States a little bit more \nthan the wealthier States. It is actually what is taught in the Bible. \nI wish we would follow it a little bit more around here.\n  So for years, this is what has occurred. In 1999, the Federal \nGovernment paid 70 cents of every dollar. You can see, basically, that \nit is done by an income calculation. Because our income--we have gotten \na little bit richer here, you can see, a little bit richer, a little \nbit poorer, a little bit richer. But all of a sudden, because of a \nunique set of circumstances that happened because of Katrina and Rita \nand Ike and Gustav--not because of any politics here but because of \nhurricanes and levee breaks and a catastrophic flood and an influx of \nFederal dollars that came to help, which we are grateful for--our \ncalculations were terribly distorted and skewed when the new \ncalculation was made. As a result, the Federal Government's portion \nwould have fallen to 63 percent. So from an average of about 70, we \nwould have fallen to 63 percent. That doesn't sound\n\n[[Page S459]]\n\nlike a lot, but it would have meant about a $400 million to $600 \nmillion--very roughly, $400 million to $600 million difference.\n  Either the people of my State would have had to cut $400 million to \n$600 million out of programs today or they would have had to raise $400 \nmillion to $600 million in taxes. That is a lot of money even in \nWashington where we throw around $1 billion and $1 trillion like it is \nnothing.\n  I can promise you, there are people sitting around their kitchen \ntables in Louisiana way down in Tibido and way up in Mansfield, LA, \nthinking: Where are we going to come up with $500 million? This is \nterrible, Senator. We didn't do anything. We are not that much richer. \nWe are actually still struggling from the recovery. Does anyone in \nWashington understand that we did not get--we are not 40 percent richer \nthan we were 2 years ago? Does anybody know up there that we are still \nstruggling with this recovery?\n  I assured them I knew, and our delegation knew, and that I knew some \npeople who might be understanding. I mentioned to them actually that I \nwould bring this to Harry Reid, I said, because he is a good man. He \nhas a good heart. I thought if I explained this to him and to Kathleen \nSebelius, who is a very good Secretary, and got their staffs to look at \nit, perhaps they would agree with us that we needed some special \nassistance. I thought there might be one person--one person with a \nheart on the other side of the aisle. I still think there may be. But, \nI said, let's just try.\n\n  So our delegation went to work and, lo and behold, then we have a \nhealth care bill coming along. It is a bill that some people like and \nsome people don't, but it is most certainly germane to my subject. It \nis most certainly germane to my subject.\n  So I say: This is nice. I know we are going to be on health care. \nLet's see what we can do to get this in this health care bill. I don't \nknow what the bill is going to look like. I don't know if I can vote \nfor it when it finally comes. I don't even know if I am going to be for \nit. But it is a health care bill. This is a health care amendment.\n  Some people have actually criticized me and said: You know, the \nSenator put it on the wrong bill. The Senator discussed this at the \nwrong time. The Senator has ruined the efforts of the State to get help \nbecause she asked for this amendment.\n  Was I supposed to ask for it on a transportation bill? Was I supposed \nto ask for a Medicaid fix on a jobs bill? Was I supposed to ask for it \non a lands bill? Forgive me for asking for a health care amendment on a \nhealth care bill.\n  So I did. We pursued it openly, we pursued it bipartisanly, and we \npursued it intelligently and smartly on the health care bill. And I \nassured my Republicans privately and publicly: I know you are not for \nthe bill. You don't have to vote for the bill. I may not vote for the \nbill. I didn't know I was going to vote for the bill until the very \nend. I am going to talk about why I decided to vote for the bill.\n  I said: But no matter how we vote on this bill, let's really make a \ncase as strong as we can that this should be fixed. We basically agreed \nto do that, and the record will show that.\n  So at some point later, as the debate moved over to the Senate, I was \nasked to present, on any number of occasions, just as every Senator was \nasked, what are the things that I think are the most important in this \nhealth care bill as we begin the debate. I wasn't on the HELP \nCommittee. I am not on Finance. So those of us not on HELP and not on \nthe Finance Committee submitted our documents, which I am going to \nrelease today to the leader, and said: These are the things that we \nthink are most important.\n  This was always on that list. I am proud it was on the list, but what \nI want people to realize is it wasn't the only thing on the list. It \nwasn't the first thing on the list. It wasn't on the list in any letter \nor correspondence that said if this doesn't get on, I am not voting for \nthe bill. In every correspondence, in every public meeting, and in \nevery private meeting, I pressed for this issue, but never did I say at \nany time that if this wasn't in the bill, I wouldn't vote for it, or if \nit was in the bill that I would vote for it because I don't believe in \nthat.\n  As strongly as I feel about this provision and the merits of it, I \nwould never have asked my colleagues--I did ask my colleagues to \nunderstand a few other things, and they can tell you that I said this \nin any number of meetings and, unfortunately, some of them were locked \nup with me for days. So they actually got to hear this over and over \nagain.\n  I said: I cannot vote for this bill unless it drives down costs. I \ncannot vote for this bill if there is a government-run, public delivery \nsystem. I will not vote for this bill if there is an employer mandate. \nI can only vote for this bill if it extends coverage to people who \ndon't have it in a way they can afford it where they have choices in \nthe private sector.\n  I said that speech 100 times in my State. I was on the radio. I was \non this floor. My colleagues have heard it any number of times. I said \nto my colleagues: If you are going to cover children who can stay on \ntheir parents' insurance--if the underlying bill, whether it comes from \nthe Senate or the House, is going to cover children up to 26 years old, \nwhich is a very good reform--something I think the American people \nsupport, and most certainly the people in my State would love to be \nable to do until they are 26--I said I would be hard-pressed to vote \nfor bills if you left out children who don't have parents. Since I am \nthe cochair of the adoption caucus and cochair of the foster care \ncaucus, with Chairman Grassley, I felt very empowered to speak those \nwords to the leaders here. Part of my job that I have taken on myself \nis to try to represent children in foster care. I don't do a very good \njob every day, and sometimes I don't do the job I should do for them. I \ntry my best. When we are in those meetings, when they have no one \nspeaking for them--they most certainly don't have any money to hire a \nlobbyist. They most certainly have no parents here advocating for them. \nBut I said if you are going to put that in the bill so every child in \nAmerica gets to stay on their parents' health insurance until they are \n26--do you all realize we have 22,000 children who graduate or come out \nof our foster care system who don't have any parents? I said: What are \nwe going to do for them? They said: We don't know. We think we will \nleave them out. I said: If you want my support for this bill, that has \nto be in there.\n  I said that on the floor and in meetings. This was not in that \nconversation. This was. We need it. We believe we have a $400 million \nto $600 million fix. We would love you to fix it all. We would love the \nfull $600 million, but we would appreciate whatever you can do to help \nus. Frankly, the reason we should fix it is not only will it be good \nfor Louisiana, but by chance if any other State--when the earthquake \nhits Memphis, and it will some day, or when it hits California, and it \nwill some day--do you know what. If this is in the law, they will not \nhave to pay double for their Medicaid 3 years after that disaster \nbecause there will be this adjustment that says, if your rates are \narbitrarily or artificially distorted by the fact that you have an \nincrease in public assistance coming into your State, we will not count \nyou as having a 40-percent increase in income. It will help. Contrary \nto what the Senator from Arizona says, it doesn't just affect \nLouisiana. For the time being, it does, but in the future it would \naffect a lot of other States. That is the right thing to do.\n  Nobody should be punished for having a disaster. Why would you punish \nthat? This money--this $400 million is to protect the poorest children \nin my State--children who lost their parents in floods, lost \ngrandparents in floods, children who lost siblings in the floods, \nchildren who are still not back in their houses. Why would we punish \nthese children, these disabled people, the poor people on Medicaid \nbecause the Federal Government's levees broke? Why would we do that? I \ndon't think we want to.\n  I am not going to stand by silently while the people of Louisiana are \ncriticized for asking for something in a public way, describing our \nsituation, expressing that we are unique among the States in this, and \nasking for assistance. I think the White House understands this. I know \nthat Kathleen Sebelius understands this. I am most certainly confident \nthe leadership on the Democratic side understands it. I\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\nam very interested in what the Republican leadership has to say about \nthis. They have been very quiet.\n  If this isn't the place to ask for it, where is the place? I would \nlike to go there. If this isn't the time to ask for it, what is the \ntime? This budget is being crafted right now by my legislators--not 2 \nyears from now but right now. They are either going to know they have \n$350 million to work with or they are not. They are either going to \nraise $350 million on the backs of my people who can hardly pay the \ntaxes they are paying now or they are going to cut off more from the \nelderly, the poor or the disabled who rely on Medicaid. So if this \nisn't the time, when would I come?\n  To close, because I have a few more minutes, I am going to leave with \nthe one statement my Governor made publicly on this for the record. \nBeing in public office takes more than being intelligent, more than a \nfancy resume--it takes guts. Some people have more of those than \nothers. This is what my Governor said on November 20 to CNN:\n\n       The bill is awful, but it is unfair to criticize Senator \n     Landrieu or the rest of our delegation for fighting to \n     correct this injustice to Louisiana. Our entire delegation is \n     working together across party lines to correct this flawed \n     formula.\n\n  This is the one statement he made. I see my colleague from Missouri \nhere to speak about other matters. I am going to rest for a moment. I \nwill be on this floor until 6 o'clock today. I am not leaving. If any \nSenator from the Democratic side or the Republican side wants to debate \nme on any aspect of this, I kindly ask them to let's get this over with \ntoday. I look forward to seeing them. I will be here until 6 o'clock. \nIf they don't come, then I hope they will keep their mouths shut about \nsomething they know nothing about.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to shed some light on the situation \ngoing on at the General Services Administration, the GSA, a tangled \nmess of bureaucracy I have been fighting for the last 5 years. In the \npast, I worked very cooperatively with GSA, but for some reason, \nsomehow, they have gotten themselves and us into a situation that is \nuntenable.\n  Yesterday, the President accused me of holding hostage the nominee to \nbe Administrator, Martha Johnson. I feel no joy in holding up this \nnominee, but the hostage I am concerned about is not the one looking \nfor this distinguished position in Washington. Instead, the hostages I \nam worried about are the 1,000 people working in a Federal office \nbuilding dump in Kansas City at the mercy of an agency that refuses to \nact to remedy a problem they acknowledge exists. Again, the hostage, \nwith due respect, is not Martha Johnson; the hostages are the 1,000 \nKansas City workers at the Bannister Federal Complex.\n  As Senators, we have a few tools at our disposal to carry out our \nresponsibilities. One of these important responsibilities is oversight \nof the Federal Government. One of those tools is to force the Senate to \ndebate and actually vote on an issue rather than be just a rubberstamp \nto the administration.\n  While he has criticized me for using this oversight tool, the \nPresident wielded it himself when he was a Senator in this very \nChamber.\n  Senator Reid, our distinguished leader, shares some responsibility in \ndelaying Martha Johnson's confirmation. You see, the Johnson nomination \nactually passed out of committee in May. Was she ever called up for a \nvote? No, because until July--when I formally placed a hold on the \nnominee--the Senator from Nevada, according to Congress Daily, delayed \nher confirmation to ensure that taxpayer dollars were still being used \nto send Federal employees to Las Vegas.\n  Senator Reid has his priorities regarding the delay on this \nnomination, and I have mine. He wants more Federal employees able to \ncome to Las Vegas, and I certainly understand his reason; it is very \nimportant for his State. I want Federal employees in Kansas City to \nwork in a building with a roof that doesn't leak and doesn't have other \nrisks of contamination.\n  Some are complaining about the delay of this nominee. The truth is, \nthe majority leader could have confirmed Martha Johnson in May, June or \nJuly. In addition, he waited until Thursday to file cloture, and he \ncould have picked any date in the last 7 months to do so, but he waited \nuntil last Thursday. We had thought we made progress, and every time we \nthought we made progress, somebody in the administration pulled back \nthat small step of progress.\n  There are many reasons why a Senator might wish to place a hold on a \nnominee that are related to our oversight responsibilities. I think it \nis important to have debates such as this not only when the \nqualifications of the nominee are at stake but when a Federal \nbureaucracy stops being responsive and serving of the people in the \ncommunities in which they work. That is the real issue.\n  Martha Johnson's qualifications are not in doubt. But as you will \nhear, the GSA is not being responsible to the people of Kansas City \nand, most specifically, to the Federal workers there.\n  The history goes back about 5 years. It is part of a larger plan to \nmove all tenants out of the dilapidated Bannister Federal Complex. GSA \ninitiated a plan to construct a new building in downtown Kansas City in \norder to move the jobs out of the complex. That was a long time ago, \nand at the time they were looking for a lease-to-own process.\n  The community of Kansas City--the leadership, elected officials, the \nemployees, and Kansas City's financial community--had worked with the \nGSA to get a building--a new building to replace the Bannister Federal \nComplex.\n  The existing building, by any stretch of the imagination, is \nextremely expensive to operate, will be sparsely occupied, is not \nconducive as a good workplace, and must be replaced.\n  After 3 years, the plan brought together, with GSA's participation, \nthe leadership of the Kansas City community at all levels, from the \nmayor to the council, to the business community, the Finance Committee \nthat was going to put up the money. They came together, and they got a \ncommitment that financing would be available to construct on a lease-\nconstruction basis.\n  What happened? With no warning, GSA called up the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee the week of the markup, when it was supposed to \nbe approved, and effectively put their own hold on the project they \ndeveloped and approved, citing GSA's shift away from proceeding on a \nlease-construction basis.\n  For anyone following the project, this latest move by GSA was very \ndifficult to understand. After all, 3 months earlier, in June of 2008, \nGSA was holding roundtables with real estate developers on the value of \nlease-construction plans and telling them how they could seek and \npursue such projects.\n  In scrapping their own plan, GSA ensured that after all other tenants \nvacated the inefficient, 5.2-million-square-foot complex, more than \n1,000 Federal employees would be stuck working there.\n  That is about 5,000 square feet per employee. This nonsensical plan \nwould cost taxpayers $13 million to $15 million annually just to \nmothball unused space and operate shared heating and cooling equipment. \nThat is $13,000 to $15,000 a year per employee for the unused space.\n  GSA was so convinced this was the best path forward that for 9 \nmonths, they even went so far as to conduct an analysis to justify the \ncontinued use of the Bannister Complex. But then, in a 60-day analysis, \n``GSA concludes that the Bannister Complex should be a mid-term hold \n(approximately 15 years).'' This translates into nearly 10 years of \ncontinuing to run a complex at 20-percent capacity. Does that make \nsense? I cannot figure any building manager, any responsible party in \nthe private sector or in government who thinks that works out. It does \nnot take a mathematician to figure out the numbers. They are not good \nfor the taxpayers. Put pencil to paper on that. Pencil it out. Anybody \ncan do that. However, yet again, GSA decided to change its mind in \nSeptember of 2009. This time, GSA agreed to their original position \nthat a new building in Kansas City was GSA's ``preferred option.''\n  Bear with me. I know this is getting confusing because we have been \nconfused.\n\n[[Page S461]]\n\n  Imagine how the Kansas City community feels after being jerked around \nfor 5 years, where we sat down and worked with the staff, and a very \nhelpful staff decided--laid out the path forward. That sounds like a \ngood idea. Everybody at home was on board. The Kansas City community \nwas on board, the officials, and we said, fine. Then somebody in the \nadministration, whether GSA or above, put a halt to every one of those \nsteps forward--every single one of them. Every time they laid out \nsomething, nothing happened. We are beginning, quite honestly, to feel \nlike Charlie Brown. Every time we get ready to kick the football, \nsomebody in the administration moves it.\n  Where are we now, now that the GSA went back to their original \nobjective that they earlier rejected? Unfortunately, we are not one \nstep closer to a new building for these workers. GSA has still taken no \naction, still has put nothing on paper, has made no commitments.\n  Is there a way forward? What is their way forward? Let the people of \nKansas City know what you are going to do, how you are going to do it, \nand when you are going to do it. We cannot even find that out from \nthem. There is no official plan out of GSA. GSA clearly agrees that the \nnew Federal building is needed, so it should not be asking too much for \nsomebody who represents them and the community to be told their plan. \nYet they have stubbornly refused to produce one.\n  I met with Ms. Martha Johnson. I have worked with the PBS \nCommissioner. They are fine people, wonderful people. I think they are \nvery qualified. But I have asked repeatedly that GSA come up with an \nofficial plan to move Kansas City forward. They refused. Bureaucracy \nhas broken its word once again, and I want a chance to tell my \ncolleagues what they have done.\n  My bottom line, the reason I am on the floor today opposing this \nnomination is quite simple: As Missouri's senior Senator, my job is to \nfight on behalf of the people who sent me here. My job is to make sure \nbureaucrats in Washington do their job and serve the people across the \nNation and in Kansas City.\n  GSA continues to ignore the Kansas City community. My efforts have \nalways been about keeping 1,000 jobs in Kansas City, not blocking one \nposition in Washington.\n  But my colleagues should be aware that there is more bad news at this \nvery same Bannister Federal Complex. At the same time GSA has been \nunwilling to move forward on a new building, they have also apparently \nbeen unresponsive to the ongoing health concerns of their employees and \ntenants at the Bannister Federal Complex. In the next day or so, tests \nwill come back on the levels of trichloroethylene, or TCE, a dangerous \ncarcinogen, at the Bannister Complex. These tests were called for after \na local TV station reported unexplained illnesses afflicting Bannister \nworkers and a possible link to toxins, such as TCE and beryllium, at \nthe complex. While the pending results of these tests are of great \nconcern--they are of great concern to the employees and their families, \nbut most of all, we are hearing from parents whose children were in a \ndaycare center at the complex. They want to know to what their children \nmight have been exposed.\n  These scares and reports are coming more and more frequently to us \nfrom the Bannister Complex. It is alarming that I learned about this \ninformation not from GSA but from the media. Based on media reports, \nthe implications for the health of these workers could be very serious, \nso I have called for an investigation. I even asked the inspector \ngeneral of GSA to get to the bottom of these alarming health \nallegations.\n  I will work with the proper authorities on all levels of government--\nthe Environmental Protection Agency, the Missouri Department of Natural \nResources, the Missouri Department of Health, the Agency for Toxic \nSubstances and Disease Registry--to uncover any additional information. \nIt goes without saying that I will demand more transparent and \ncomprehensive testing throughout the Bannister Complex. For the safety \nof the workers, we need to know what is going on, what is happening at \nBannister, what has gone on in the past, who knew about it, why they \ndid nothing about it, and how to move immediately to protect those \npotentially at risk.\n  The bottom line is that these workers deserve answers. The situation \nat GSA tells the American people that all they can expect out of \nWashington right now is business as usual, keep going forward, don't \nlisten to the people we are supposed to serve, a government that is out \nof touch with their concerns and slow to act. I do not support business \nas usual. For these reasons, I will vote against the nomination and ask \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                   Department of Defense Nominations\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to express my \nfrustration and my dismay at the roadblocks which have been placed in \nthe way of Senate nominations for key positions at the Department of \nDefense. These obstructions take place at a time when these nominees--\nthere are four of them--are critically needed by the Department of \nDefense. We are a nation at war. Our national security interests \nrequire us to end these obstruction tactics and immediately fill these \nfour positions with highly qualified patriots.\n  Each of these nominees has been favorably reported to the Senate by \nunanimous vote from the Committee on Armed Services. They responded to \nextensive advance policy questions. They appeared at a hearing of our \ncommittee. Nobody has informed me of any concern about the \nqualifications of any one of these four nominees. Yet there is an \nobjection here on the floor of the Senate every time these nominations \nare considered for confirmation. If any Senator has a concern about any \nof these four Defense Department nominees, I wish they would let me \nknow about those concerns so we can address those concerns. We have \nheard from nobody. We have unanimous approval by the Armed Services \nCommittee of four Defense nominees. They have been sitting on our \ncalendar since December 2--over 2 months--while these positions go \nunfilled and we are in the middle of two wars.\n  One of these nominees is retired Marine Major General Clifford \nStanley. He was nominated to be Under Secretary of Defense for \nPersonnel and Readiness. This position is critically important. It is \nresponsible for our military readiness. It is responsible for our total \nforce management. It is responsible for military and civilian personnel \nrequirements that need to be filled. This position is responsible for \npay and benefits. Let me repeat this. The pay and benefits of our \nmilitary personnel is the responsibility of the person who has been \nnominated for this position, and he has been sitting waiting for \nconfirmation for 2 months. What kind of a message is this to the men \nand women who put on the uniform of this country? Military and civilian \npersonnel training is the responsibility of this office, military and \ncivilian family matters, exchange, commissary, nonappropriated fund \nactivities, personnel requirements for weapons support, National Guard \nand Reserve personnel matters, and health care for the military and \ntheir families.\n\n  General Stanley was the first African-American regimental commander \nin the Marine Corps. He has served with honor and distinction. He is \nnow retired. We are lucky we can get someone such as General Stanley to \ncome back into public service to fill this position. Yet there has been \na hold on his nomination since December 2.\n  The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff have both made personal appeals to me and to other Members, \nincluding, I think, the leadership of this body, to confirm General \nStanley so he can perform those essential duties which I have outlined. \nHis nomination, again, was unanimously supported by our committee. Our \ndistinguished Presiding Officer is a wonderful member of our committee. \nNo one, again, has brought any problem with this nomination to my \nattention. No one has said he is not qualified. I think there is \nunanimous consensus that he is extraordinarily well qualified.\n  While we have servicemembers, who have volunteered to serve, and \ntheir families under great stress, they are fighting for our interests \nin two wars, we have a critically important person\n\n[[Page S462]]\n\nwho is awaiting confirmation for a position which affects every one of \ntheir lives. It is unconscionable that these roadblocks were placed in \nthe way of these nominees.\n  Another critical nomination is that of Frank Kendall III, who was \nnominated to be Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and \nTechnology. The individual confirmed to this position is responsible \nfor assisting the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology \nand Logistics in supervising Department of Defense acquisition, \nestablishing policies for acquisition, including the procurement of \ngoods and services, research and development, developmental testing, \nand contract administration.\n  We have all these problems with contracts, with testing, with \ndevelopment, with cost overruns. We reformed our law now so that we \nhave much better acquisition rules in place to try to see if we can't \nget rid of some of these cost overruns.\n  We have a nominee to fill the position of Deputy Under Secretary of \nDefense for Acquisition and Technology, and our friends on the other \nside of the aisle--someone over there--have a hold on his nomination \nfor, I know, no reason related to his qualifications. There has been no \nissue about his qualifications, about any of the four of these \nnominees. Again, we have a critical position. As I indicated, \nparticularly we have acquisition reform which we just adopted. It is so \nessential to control the cost of our national defense. Mr. Kendall's \nnomination, like General Stanley's nomination, has been before this \nSenate since December 2, over 2 months.\n  Another nomination is that of Erin Conaton to be the Under Secretary \nof the Air Force. We all know her. She is on the staff of the House \nArmed Services Committee. Nobody has raised an issue about her. We are \nlucky to have her. Yet there is a hold from the other side of the aisle \nfor some unspecified reason, nothing to do with her. But here she is in \na position which is so important to the Air Force.\n  If designated by the Secretary, the Under Secretary of the Air Force \nserves as the Department of Defense Executive Agent for Space. She also \nserves as the chief management officer of the Air Force--we have all \nthese problems, and our Presiding Officer knows about the problems of \nauditing and knows about the management and the business problems we \nhave in our defense units. He knows it from experience in the Senate. \nHe knows from his own personal life experience how important this is. \nAnd we cannot get the woman--who probably is as knowledgeable about \nthis subject as anyone, based on all of her years over at the House \nArmed Services Committee--we cannot get her off the Senate calendar.\n  Terry Yonkers has been nominated to be Assistant Secretary of the Air \nForce for Installations and Environment. This Assistant Secretary is \nresponsible for overall supervision for all matters relating to Air \nForce installations, environment, and logistics, including planning, \nacquisition, sustainment and disposal of Air Force real property and \nnatural resources, environmental program compliance, energy management, \nsafety and occupational health of Air Force personnel.\n  These are important, vital positions to the well-being of our men and \nwomen in uniform. It is unconscionable that one or more people on the \nother side of the aisle continue to put holds on these nominations. \nThey cannot find any problem with their qualifications because there is \nnone. It is just endless holds, endless filibuster threats, endless \nroadblocks that stop these and so many other nominations. But these are \nDefense Department nominations in the middle of two wars, and these \nroadblocks have to be removed.\n  I hope we will take up all four of these nominations immediately. We \nhave servicemembers volunteering to risk their lives in defense of the \nNation. The least we can do--the least we can do--as a Senate is to \nconfirm nominees for the critical positions to lead the Department of \nDefense.\n  Again, finally--and I know my great friend from Illinois is sitting 3 \nfeet away from me and has made the same suggestion, as he has pressed \nso hard to get these roadblocks removed--if anybody has a problem with \nthese nominees, would they please come to the floor and tell us. They \ncan tell us, hopefully, publicly, but they could tell us privately. We \nhave heard nothing. These nominees--all four of them--were unanimously \napproved in the Armed Services Committee. So we don't know of any \nproblem. We know their qualifications, and they are extraordinary in \nevery one of their cases.\n  This filibustering that is going on around here and the threat of \nfilibustering and the constant roadblocks that are thrown up in front \nof these nominees is unconscionable. It goes beyond anything I have \never seen around here in 32 years. We all know there are people who \nobject to nominees, but, hopefully, usually because they have an \nobjection against something the nominee has done or said. In this case, \nthere is nothing like that. This is some unrelated matter, apparently, \nwhich has caused somebody to hold them hostage while they try to \nextract some concession out of somebody.\n  It seems to me, as a body, we simply have to find a way where we can \nget our nominations back on a reasonably decent track. I say that, with \ngreater emphasis, when in the middle of two wars we have four essential \nnominees.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would tell the Senator I am not 100 percent pure. I \nhave held up a nomination in the past, but I always state my purpose. \nThe two I can recall immediately were to get agencies to do things they \nsaid they would have done long before and, in fact, they did them and I \nreleased my hold immediately. It was issuing a report. It wasn't a \nmatter of filling a job or a project or something such as that. So it \nhas been done. But I think if it is done with transparency and in a \ntimely way, we can live with it. In this situation, we are seeing our \nExecutive Calendar stacked with nominations.\n  There was one in particular, which I spoke about the other morning, \nthat struck me--Dr. Stanley, who is trying to take a position with, if \nI am not mistaken, manpower and readiness.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In charge of it; right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. For the Department of Defense. If I remember correctly, \nthis gentleman has served 33 years in the U.S. Marine Corps, was a \nmajor general, and he was the first African-American regimental \ncommander in the history of the U.S. Marine Corps. It is clear he is \nqualified. There is no question about his patriotism and love of this \ncountry. The fact he would go through this process--let them go through \nevery aspect of every corner of his life to prepare him for this \nnomination--and then be held up on the floor by the Senator from \nAlabama, I would ask the Senator: When he was considered before your \ncommittee, did anyone question this man's ability or his service to our \nNation?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Quite the opposite. His references were superb. Not only \nwas there no objection raised, it was quite the opposite. We were \ndelighted he was willing to come out of retirement and serve. This is a \nreal find. These nominees are performing a real public service, in many \ncases taking a lot less money in pay than they could get in the private \nsector.\n  I agree with my good friend from Illinois too. Many of us--I will not \nsay all of us--including myself, have placed holds on nominations. That \nis not unusual. But usually there is some reason you have that you are \nwilling to disclose and you want to take up with the nominee or you \nwant some report that has not been filed that was promised. You want \nsomething that relates to the nominee. The objections here, the \nroadblocks here have nothing to do with these nominees. There is no \nobjection to these nominees.\n  I see my good friend from Vermont has come to the floor. He has to \nlive with this a lot more than I have to with this. This is probably 20 \npercent of my time. He has roadblocks in front of the Judiciary \nCommittee nominees that take up probably more than half Senator Leahy's \ntime.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If my two friends will yield on that point, it has gone \nway beyond anything I have seen in my 35 years in the Senate, by either \nDemocrats or Republicans. It is ridiculous.\n  I will give one example--not my committee, but I mentioned it the \nother day. During the height of the H1N1 flu, every morning you could \npick up the\n\n[[Page S463]]\n\npaper or hear of children--little children--dying while there was an \nanonymous hold by the Republicans on the Surgeon General. You would \nthink, particularly at a time such as that, you would want to have \neverybody you could have there. This was blocked for months and months \nand months. Finally, the hold was lifted and she was confirmed \nunanimously.\n  We have had judges supported by both parties, and the nominations \nhave come out of the committee. The distinguished deputy majority \nleader is a member of the committee, and he knows they have come out \nunanimously. Yet they are held up for months. We finally vote cloture, \nwaste 3 days of the public's time--at a cost of tens of thousands, \nhundreds of thousands of dollars--only to then have a vote and it be \nvirtually unanimous.\n  I mean, this is being childish. It goes beyond misusing a \nparliamentary procedure. It becomes childish.\n  I thank my two colleagues for letting me speak to this.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Vermont is going \nto take the floor, but I would ask for his indulgence.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Farewell to Senator Kirk\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in my era in politics, one of the most \nfrightening things you could ever hear when you were about to go into \nan event was when the host of that event called you to the side and \nsaid: You will be speaking following Ted Kennedy. That was the worst \nnews you could receive. No one in the world wanted to follow Ted \nKennedy. He was that good and well loved and a man who had given his \nlife to public service and to the State of Massachusetts.\n  Well, our friend, Paul Kirk, who is seeing his tenure in the Senate \ncome to an end either today or this week had the unfortunate \nresponsibility to follow that great man. But if there was ever a person \nwho could stand and take the job, it was Paul Kirk. He came to the \nSenate not just as a former staffer of Senator Ted Kennedy after \nSenator Kennedy passed away but as truly a very close friend of Senator \nKennedy.\n  On the day he was sworn in, Senator Paul Kirk of Massachusetts said \nhe assumed his duties feeling ``the profound absence of a friend'' but \na ``full understanding of his devotion and understanding of public \nservice.''\n  Paul Kirk promised to be a voice and a vote for the causes which \nSenator Kennedy believed in, and for 4 months and 10 days he has \nhonored that promise to his old friend and to the people of \nMassachusetts.\n  I will tell you that Paul Kirk, in his short time here, has served \nwith dignity and integrity. We thank him and his wife Gail, who made a \npersonal sacrifice to let her husband come and take up this \nresponsibility for this important chapter in his life and this \nimportant chapter in the history of the Senate.\n  I think it is fair to say Paul Kirk never dreamed he would be a \nSenator. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1964. He worked as an \nassistant district attorney in Massachusetts. He came to Washington in \n1968 and worked on Senator Robert Kennedy's Presidential campaign. He \nconsidered quitting politics, as many people did, after Robert \nKennedy's political assassination. But Ted Kennedy convinced him to \npick up the fallen standard and carry on Bobby's work.\n  For the next 8 years, Paul Kirk worked in this Senate as one of Ted \nKennedy's closest aides. He was with Senator Kennedy in 1980, when the \nlast of the Kennedy brothers ran for President. I remember that so well \nas the downstate coordinator of the Ted Kennedy for President campaign \nin Illinois.\n  In 1985, Paul Kirk took on the challenge of chairing the Democratic \nNational Committee in the middle of the Reagan era--quite a political \nchallenge for any Democrat. He served as cochairman of the Commission \non Presidential Debates, and he has been chairman of the John F. \nKennedy Library Foundation since 1992.\n  Paul Kirk is a good fellow, with a great sense of humor. I can tell \nyou what has been said about him. He has never been known for \nexcitement. One friend said of Paul Kirk several years ago: Behind that \nquiet exterior is a quiet interior. He is that sort of person--soft \nspoken but effective. He may not speak in a lion's roar, as Ted Kennedy \ndid, but his reverence for America and his belief in this great Nation \nand his sense of justice is just as strong. On the Saturday before \nThanksgiving, during the historic effort to break the filibuster on \nhealth care reform, Senator Paul Kirk came to the floor and told the \nstory of a young woman from Somerville, MA, who had finished college, \nprepared for graduate school, and who suffered organ failure. In many \nStates, that woman might have quickly found herself in a critical state \nand in medical debt and surely she wouldn't have been able to find \ninsurance.\n  But because of Massachusetts's first in the Nation, near universal \nhealth care program, Paul Kirk told us that young woman could still \nobtain affordable health care, even though she now has what is \ncharacterized as a preexisting condition that will require her to be on \nmedication for the rest of her life.\n  Senator Kennedy was proud of what Massachusetts, his home State, had \nachieved in health care. Ensuring that Americans in every State had \ndecent, affordable health care, Paul Kirk said, was the ``cause of his \nlife.'' It has been Senator Kirk's consuming goal in the Senate, and I \nhope it will soon become a reality. We are too close to a solution on \nhealth care--and the need is too great--for us to stop now.\n  In 1968, when Ted Kennedy became majority whip--the position I now \nhold in the Senate--then-majority leader Mike Mansfield welcomed him to \nthe leadership by saying: ``Of all the Kennedys, the Senator is the \nonly one who was and is a real Senate man.'' Part of what made Ted \nKennedy a real Senate man was his personality and his inexhaustible \npatience and optimism. Part of it was his knowledge of how the Senate \nworks and part was his great staff.\n  The Kennedy staff has always been known as the A-Team in the Senate. \nThey are smart, they are talented, they are dedicated, and after they \nleave Ted Kennedy, they go places unimaginable for most staffers \nbecause they are so highly regarded. Some have been with Senator \nKennedy for decades and continue with Senator Kirk, including the \nlegendary Carey Parker, the Senator's chief speech writer; Michael \nMyers, whom I know well from his activities on the floor, the Senator's \nstaff director on the HELP Committee, who worked so hard on health care \nreform. He has been amazing.\n  I wish to thank all the staffers for Senator Kirk, and previously for \nSenator Kennedy, for carrying on that standard of justice and fairness. \nI thank them as a group for their service to Massachusetts and to \nAmerica. It is because of them, and countless others whom Senator \nKennedy touched, myself included, we have been enlisted in the Kennedy \ncauses and the Kirk causes with a great deal of pride.\n  A special thank-you to the Kennedy family--especially Vicki, Kara, \nTed, and Patrick, Caroline and Curran--for sharing so much of the man \nthey loved with the Nation he loved.\n  Finally, I wish to welcome to the Senate--and in a short time he will \ncome to be sworn in--Senator Scott Brown. As Senator Kennedy would have \nsaid, if he were here: failte. He was always eager to reach across the \naisle and find solutions to the problems we face. I look forward to an \nopportunity to do the same with Senator Brown in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see my friend from Wyoming on the floor, \nand he has been recognized, but I ask unanimous consent that when he \nfinishes, I be recognized for 10 minutes to speak about Vermonters who \nhave been in Haiti helping with the devastation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of Senator \nBond's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     New Climate Change Allegations\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, there has been significant attention \ngiven to efforts by the United Nations to establish a global climate \nchange agreement. The effort has been based, in\n\n[[Page S464]]\n\nlarge part, on information contained in reports prepared by the United \nNations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n  Supporters repeatedly cite figures and conclusions in the U.N. \nreports to justify a complete overhaul of the world economy. Supporters \nhave been steadfast in claiming the report is conclusive, in claiming \nthe scientific data is solid, and in claiming the integrity of the \nfindings are above reproach. Any mistakes identified and pointed out \nare minimized and ignored.\n  They have been singing this song for years. The U.N.'s top climate \nofficial is Dr. R.K. Pachauri, and the chorus of defenders of the U.N. \nreports have grown louder in recent months as the house of cards they \nhave built is falling apart.\n  There have been disclosures of e-mails that show scientists \nmanipulated the sciences; there have been nonscientific materials \nutilized to reach scientific conclusions; there has been scientific \nconclusions that are not properly peer reviewed. Each week, the list of \nerrors grows. The excuses from Dr. Pachauri, the man in charge of the \nU.N. climate change reports, well, they have been wearing thin.\n  I come to the floor as a Senator who serves on both the Energy \nCommittee and the Environment and Public Works Committee. I come to the \nfloor to tell you and our Nation the United Nations' scientists are \nmanipulating data to further political goals--political goals of \npassing a climate change accord that will cost the world billions.\n  This is not my accusation. The person making the charge is the person \nwho verified the false conclusion.\n  It is better to hear it in the person's own words:\n  His name is Dr. Murari Lal. Dr. Lal is a retired Indian academic, now \na consultant. He was one of the four lead authors of the Asia chapter \nof the U.N. report.\n  He is also behind the bogus claim in United Nations climate change \nreports that Himalayan glaciers will have melted by 2035.\n  He admitted that this scientific ``fact'' as climate change \nsupporters like to state, was included in the report ``purely to put \npolitical pressure on world leaders.''\n  Let me repeat--he said this so called ``fact'' was included in the \nUnited Nations report ``purely to put political pressure on world \nleaders.''\n  According to Dr. Lal, ``It related to several countries in this \nregion and their water sources.''\n  ``We thought that if we can highlight it, it will impact policy \nmakers and politicians and encourage them to take some concrete \naction.''\n  The so called ``fact'' in the report is just not true.\n  On January 21, the Economist stated that when informed about the \nerror the United Nations ``did nothing'' and the claims were ``airily \ndismissed by Rajendra Pachauri.''\n  The Times of the U.K. reports a second factually inaccurate \nconclusion. It reports that the United Nations wrongly linked global \nwarming to natural disasters.\n  In an article written by Jonathan Leake, he stated that: The United \nNations climate panel faces new controversy for wrongly linking global \nwarming to an increase in the number and severity of natural disasters \nsuch as hurricanes and floods.\n  The original link between climate change and natural disasters was \nbased on an unpublished report. According to the Times the report ``had \nnot been subjected to routine scientific scrutiny''--and ignored \nwarnings from scientific advisers that the evidence supporting the link \nwas ``too weak.''\n  Despite the warnings once again, the United Nations Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change included the fiction in its report.\n  Today the claim by the U.N. that global warming is already affecting \nthe severity and frequency of natural disasters is a large part of the \npolitical debate across this country.\n  How many politicians made the claim that Hurricane Katrina was the \nresult of climate change? Well now they know the inconvenient truth.\n  According to the Times of the U.K., the actual authors of the claim \non natural disasters withdrew the claim--but the United Nations did \nnot.\n  Every day new scandals emerge about the so called ``facts'' in the \nU.N. reports.\n  Claims that ice is disappearing from the world's mountain tops were \napparently based on a student dissertation and an article in a \nmountaineering magazine.\n  It was revealed that green activists with little scientific \nexperience were the source for unsubstantiated claims that global \nwarming might wipe out 40 percent of the Amazon rainforest.\n  These revelations are in addition to the released e-mails by the \nClimatic Research Unit at East Anglia University. These are the e-mails \nthat first raised serious questions about the conduct of U.N. and even \nU.S. scientists.\n  These e-mails demonstrate a coordinated effort by trusted climate \nscientists to suppress dissenting views and manipulate data and methods \nto skew the U.N. reports to reach a politically correct view of the \nimpact of climate change.\n  Scientists at the Climatic Research Unit said that they ``admitted \nthrowing away much of the raw temperature data on which their \npredictions of global warming are based.''\n  The lack of any raw data prevents other scientists from checking \ntheir work and raises additional questions about the accuracy of the \ndata used in the U.N. reports.\n  The actions by scientists and others to suppress data that \ncontradicts their conclusions is misleading, unethical and \nunacceptable.\n  Their conduct needs to be investigated.\n  Senator Inhofe and I have written U.N. Secretary Moon to have the \nU.N. conduct an independent investigation into the original climate \ngate revelations.\n  That request has not been acted upon.\n  Revelations of ongoing scientific fraud at the United Nations Inter-\ngovernmental Panel on Climate Change is disturbing.\n  Concrete action by world leaders is needed.\n  The integrity of the data and the integrity of the science has been \ncompromised.\n  Today, I call for government delegations of the U.N.'s general \nassembly and U.N. Secretary Moon to pressure Dr. Rajendra Pachauri to \nstep down as head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change.\n  It is time to conduct an independent investigation into the conduct \nof the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n  Dr. Pachauri should be removed from any involvement with the \ninvestigation.\n  Recent reports over the weekend raise questions about whether or not \nDr. Pachauri knew of the false information in the U.N. report months \nprior to the disclosure.\n  These claims, first reported in the Times of the U.K., stated that:\n\n       Pachauri was told that the Intergovernmental Panel on \n     Climate Change assessment that glaciers would disappear by \n     2035 was wrong, but he waited two months to correct it.\n\n  If proved true, this would mean that Pachauri failed to alert the \nworld to this mistake before the December Copenhagen conference.\n  Investor's Business Daily in an editorial stated:\n\n       If we're serious about restoring science to its rightful \n     place, the head of the UN's panel on climate change should \n     step down. Evidence shows he quarterbacked a deliberate and \n     premeditated fraud.\n\n  Walter Russell Read, project director for Religion and Foreign Policy \nat the Pew Forum was quoted in Investor's Business Daily Tuesday \nFebruary 2 as saying:\n\n       After years in which global warming activists had lectured \n     everyone about the overwhelming nature of the scientific \n     evidence, it turned out that the most prestigious agencies in \n     the global warming movement were breaking laws, hiding data \n     and making inflated, bogus claims resting on, in some cases, \n     no scientific basis at all.\n\n  President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton, and U.N. Ambassador Rice \nneed to apply all the necessary pressure to ensure that Dr. Pachauri is \nremoved.\n  I also call on President Obama to direct his cabinet to stop \nsupporting any policies that relied in whole and in part on the \nfraudulent United Nations reports.\n  It is time to have the scientific data behind such policies \nindependently verified.\n  Administration policies relating to climate change will cost millions \nof Americans their jobs.\n\n[[Page S465]]\n\n  We need to get this right.\n  To continue to rely on these corrupted U.N. reports is an endorsement \nof fraudulent behavior.\n  It is a signal to the American people that ideology is more important \nthan their jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Haiti\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on January 22 I spoke in this Chamber about \nthe earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12 and the unprecedented \ndevastation it caused. We now know that an estimated 3 million people \nhave been affected, including some 700,000 people displaced from Port-\nau-Prince and living under plastic or other makeshift shelter. As many \nas 200,000 more may have died; tens of thousands have suffered \ninjuries, including many whose limbs had to be amputated, some as the \nonly way to save their lives and to extricate them from the rubble. \nHundreds of thousands of children have lost one or both of their \nparents. It is hard to quantify the scale of human suffering.\n  Think of it. Thousands of commercial buildings, 200,000 homes, the \npresidential palace, the national cathedral as well as the parliament \nbuilding, the government ministries, U.N. headquarters were either \nheavily damaged or destroyed. Roads, ports, and communication \ninfrastructure were extensively damaged.\n  Ninety percent of the schools in Port-au-Prince have been destroyed. \nThis rebuilding is going to take years, even with the help of the \ninternational community, the United States, working side-by-side with \nthe people of Haiti.\n  The generosity of the American people as well as people from so many \nother countries has been extraordinary. Hundreds of millions of dollars \nhave been raised from private organizations, foundations, corporations, \nand individuals, including schoolchildren. There have been countless \ntons of donations of food, clothing, medicines, and other supplies. It \nis especially heartening to see the commitment and dedication of \nvolunteers, many of whom after they received word of the earthquake \nimmediately began to pack their bags to travel to Haiti to help any way \nthey could--not sure of where they would stay but knowing they had \nskills that were needed.\n  One such group is the Vermont Haiti Relief Team. It includes members \nof the Vermont Haiti Project and the Vermont Federation of Nurses and \nHealth Professionals. They traveled to Haiti. I talked with some of \nthem who helped with the recovery, I heard and read their stories, I \nhave seen the photographs they sent back. Here is one photograph--the \nnurses are carrying, obviously, a patient on a stretcher.\n  As a Vermonter, as an American, I could not be more proud of the \nlifesaving work they are doing. Our little State of Vermont, as far \nnorth from Haiti as it could be--right up there on the Canadian \nborder--answered the call to help a neighbor in the hemisphere.\n  On January 20, 11 volunteer doctors, nurses, and other health \nprofessionals from Vermont arrived in Jimani, Dominican Republic. That \nis a remote border town where some of the injured from Haiti were taken \nimmediately after the earthquake and where many more have arrived.\n  The Vermont health workers joined other doctors and nurses to care \nfor hundreds of patients in the hospital. They coordinated helicopter \nand ambulance transports, they established clinics to evaluate and \ntreat injuries. They cared for over 250 amputees. They worked \ntirelessly to meet the needs of the victims and their families.\n  What they did helped immeasurably. I look at this one photograph--at \none of the nurses helping this child. Some couldn't speak the language. \nNone of them knew the people before they went there. All they knew was \nthat the Haitians are fellow human beings, suffering, and they felt, as \nwe do in Vermont and in so many other places: If your neighbor is \nhurting, you are hurting, and so you help your neighbor. They went and \nhelped.\n  It is life-saving work. But it is also life-changing work. These \nVermonters will return home having endured, improvised, and made a \ndifference through the experience of a lifetime. How many of us can say \nwe have done something that made such a difference in someone's life? \nThey have, but their own lives have also been changed.\n  They were confronted with hundreds of injured people. They had just a \nhandful of medical personnel, no supplies, and they worked around the \nclock with volunteers from Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and many \nother countries. Sometimes the electricity worked, sometimes it did \nnot. Death surrounded them. But many of those who would have died \nsurvived because of the care of these Vermonters.\n  The team also traveled to Fond Parisien, Haiti, where a clinic was \nestablished. They worked with Haitians and other relief organizations \nto create a wound clinic, and a hospital for hundreds of displaced \npersons.\n\n  After 2 weeks working in difficult conditions, the first team of \nVermonters is coming home. They are exhausted physically and \nemotionally, but they are proud of the help they provided to their \nHaitian patients and of being able to represent Vermont in the relief \neffort. This Vermonter is proud of them and proud of a second team that \nhas now arrived in Haiti and has begun working.\n  The Vermont Haiti Relief Team hopes to continue to send volunteers \nfor 2-week rotations to support the hospital in Jimani and the clinic \nin Fond Parisien for the next 3 to 6 months.\n  I have been to Haiti. I know what a poor country it is. My wife \nMarcelle is a registered nurse, now retired. She has gone to those \nhospitals. She has seen how little there is to work with. She knows \nthat somebody coming with the equipment that's needed, the supplies \nthat were lacking, what a difference that makes.\n  Marcelle and I are very impressed with the commitment of those \nVermont volunteers. It is emotionally and physically exhausting, but no \nless rewarding. I thank them for their hard work and dedication, for \ntheir selfless example.\n  What happened in Haiti was as great a natural disaster as any one of \nus will ever hear of. But what it has done is spark the generosity of \npeople everywhere. The help has to continue. I will make sure of that \nas chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee.\n  Thanks to this small group of Vermonters who went down there, lives \nwere saved, lives were changed, children were rescued. We Vermonters \nare proud.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Black History Month\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, we remember the giants of American \nhistory, those who led troops into battle, or rose to high office, or \ngave their lives for something greater than themselves; the warriors, \nthe statesmen, the heroes who fought to defend our values and our \nfreedoms.\n  We quote their words and etch their names into stone. We rightfully \nhonor their place in the annals of history.\n  But the quiet moments of our history are often overlooked.\n  There are many unsung heroes whose actions give shape to our national \nidentity. Too frequently, these brave men and women are pushed to the \nmargins or relegated to obscurity.\n  That is why I am here today to honor one woman who did not fight in \nwars, give great speeches, or perish on the battlefield.\n  Make no mistake: those pursuits are noble, and it is right that we \nhonor them.\n  But our quiet heroes have just as much claim to our national \nattention, and also deserve our respect and praise.\n  So today I would ask my colleagues to pause and to think of just such \na quiet American hero:\n  She never wore a uniform, though in a sense she led a great and \ndiverse army. She never rose to high office, although she paved the way \nfor others, including myself to do so.\n  Rosa Parks began her life in a world that largely considered her to \nbe undeserving of equal rights. She knew the injustice of segregation, \nand was no stranger to racism and hatred.\n  She grew up poor in Tuskegee, AL, where she wasn't even allowed to \nride the bus to school.\n  But, thanks to a life of principled activism, and a moment of quiet \ncourage on a city bus in Montgomery, this poor country girl would grow \ninto a strong woman whose name became synonymous with ``freedom'' and \n``equality.''\n  And when she passed away, not on a foreign battlefield, but quietly \nin her home, at the age of 92, she was mourned by her friends and \nneighbors from back home in Alabama, but also by an entire nation, in a \nfuneral held at the National Cathedral and lasting a full 7 hours.\n  Such was the impact that Rosa Parks had on our social and political \nlandscape.\n  Such was the indelible mark left by her decision, on that first day \nof December in 1955, to say ``no.''\n  To refuse to accept that she was a second-class citizen.\n  To claim what was rightfully hers as an American, not by force, and \nnot by attacking or degrading her fellow man, but by insisting, with \nquiet conviction: I am your equal. I am any man or woman's equal.\n  On that day, she knew that her cause was just. She had unshakable \nfaith not only in the righteousness of her beliefs but in the heart and \nsoul of this great nation that its people would turn away from bigotry \nand hate, that unjust laws could be changed, and that the great promise \nof America lives not in the imperfect here and now, but in our ability \nto define who we wish to become, to chart our own course, and remake \nour destiny.\n  Rosa Parks was not alone in this belief. There were many others, from \nall backgrounds and walks of life, who shared a similar faith in \nAmerican ideals.\n  But, by refusing to give up her seat on that bus in Montgomery, Rosa \nParks brought those ideals to life.\n  She helped give wings to a movement that grew, and gathered steam, \nand inspired millions to work tirelessly on the side of justice and \nequality.\n  Today, Rosa Parks would have celebrated her ninety-seventh birthday. \nJust this morning, I joined Leader Reid and our Congressional \ncolleagues to commemorate this milestone.\n  And as we observe Black History Month, I can think of no finer way to \nbegin this time of remembrance and celebration than by honoring the \nlegacy of a great American like Rosa Parks.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering this quiet pioneer \nand millions of others like her, ordinary people who are not afraid to \nreach for extraordinary things.\n  Regular folks who see this country and this world as they are, but \nare not afraid to imagine what they can be.\n  Few of these unsung heroes will ever see their names in print, or \netched into our collective history, but all remind us of the enduring \ngreatness of the United States of America and the fundamental goodness \nof our fellow human beings.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 82, the nays are \n16. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, with the storm fast approaching, I think \nit is to everyone's advantage we complete our work today. So I am \nconvinced this will be the last vote of the day. Now, I would say this. \nI have been working\n\n[[Page S467]]\n\nwith Senators Grassley and Baucus, and, of course, the Republican \nleader, trying to get something keyed up for Monday, and I think we are \nmaking a lot of progress in that regard.\n  It appears we are going to have a cloture vote on a nominee on \nMonday. I already talked to the Republican leader about this several \ndays ago. We are also going to move forward on a jobs package Monday. \nWe are either going to do one on a bipartisan basis--I sure hope we can \ndo that; it really would be good for the country and good for us--if \nnot, we will have to do one that will be my amendment rather than an \namendment of a bipartisan group of Senators. So I hope we can do that. \nBut we will have that worked out later today more than likely. But this \nwill be the last vote for the day.\n  Madam President, we also are working on someone to replace Judge \nAlito in the New Jersey Circuit, and his name is Joseph Greenaway. We \nhope that can also be done on Monday.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, in order to vote on the nomination of \nMartha Johnson to head the General Services Administration, the Senate \nwas required to overcome the 15th filibuster of President Obama's \nnominations to fill important posts in the executive branch and the \njudiciary. That number does not include the many others who have been \ndenied up-or-down votes in the Senate by the anonymous obstruction of \nRepublicans refusing to agree to time agreements to consider even \nnoncontroversial nominees. There have been as many filibusters of \nnominations as there have been confirmations of Federal judges in \nPresident Obama's first 2 years in office.\n  This 15th filibuster is three times as many as there were in the \nentire first 2 years of the Bush administration. Was it not just a few \nyears ago that Republicans were demanding up-or-down votes for \nnominees, and contending that filibusters of nominations were \nunconstitutional? Again, the 15 filibusters of nominations matches the \ntotal number of Federal judges confirmed in President Obama's first 2 \nyears in office.\n  In the second half of 2001, the Democratic majority in the Senate \nproceeded to confirm 28 judges. By this date during President Bush's \nfirst term, the Senate had confirmed 31 circuit and district court \nnominations, compared to only 14 during President Obama's first 2 \nyears. In the second year of President Bush's first term, the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate proceeded to confirm 72 judicial \nnominations, and helped reduce the vacancies left by Republican \nobstructionism from over 110 to 59 by the end of 2002. Overall, in the \n17 months that I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during \nPresident Bush's first term, the Senate confirmed 100 of his judicial \nnominees.\n  The obstruction and delay does not only affect judicial nominees and \nour Federal courts. Martha Johnson is the second executive branch \nnominee this week that has been filibustered by Republicans. Her \nnomination has been stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar since June \n8 due to the opposition of a single Republican Senator over a dispute \nwith GSA about plans for a Federal building in his home State. The will \nof the Senate and the needs of the American people are held hostage by \na single Senator.\n  Overall, as of this morning, there were more than 75 judicial and \nexecutive nominees pending on the Senate Executive calendar.\n  Yesterday, at the Democratic Policy Committee's issue retreat, I \nasked President Obama if he will continue to work hard to send names to \nthe Senate as quickly as possible and to commit to work with us, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, to get these nominees confirmed. So far \nsince taking office, the President has reached across the aisle working \nwith Republicans and Democrats to identify well-qualified nominations. \nYet even these nominations are delayed or obstructed. The President \nresponded by stating:\n\n       Well, this is going to be a priority. Look, it's not just \n     judges, unfortunately, Pat, it's also all our federal \n     appointees. We've got a huge backlog of folks who are \n     unanimously viewed as well qualified; nobody has a specific \n     objection to them, but end up having a hold on them because \n     of some completely unrelated piece of business.\n       On the judges front, we had a judge for the--coming out of \n     Indiana, Judge Hamilton, who everybody said was outstanding--\n     Evan Bayh, Democrat; Dick Lugar, Republican; all recommended. \n     How long did it take us? Six months, six, seven months for \n     somebody who was supported by the Democratic and Republican \n     senator from that state. And you can multiply that across the \n     board. So we have to start highlighting the fact that this is \n     not how we should be doing business.\n       Let's have a fight about real stuff. Don't hold this woman \n     hostage. If you have an objection about my health care \n     policies, then let's debate the health care policies. But \n     don't suddenly end up having a GSA administrator who is stuck \n     in limbo somewhere because you don't like something else that \n     we're doing, because that doesn't serve the American people.\n\n  I could not agree more with President Obama. This should not be the \nway the Senate acts. Unfortunately, we have seen the repeated use of \nfilibusters, and delay and obstruction have become the new norm for the \nRepublican in the Senate. We have seen unprecedented obstruction by \nSenate Republicans on issue after issue--over 100 filibusters last year \nalone, which has affected 70 percent of all Senate action. Instead of \ntime agreements and the will of the majority, the Senate is faced with \na requirement to find 60 Senators to overcome a filibuster on issue \nafter issue. Those who just a short time ago said that a majority vote \nis all that should be needed to confirm a nomination, and that \nfilibusters of nominations are unconstitutional, have reversed \nthemselves and now employ any delaying tactic they can.\n  The Republican minority must believe that this partisan playbook of \nobstruction will reap political benefit for them and damage to the \nPresident. But the people who pay the price for this political \ncalculation are the American people who depend on the government being \nable to do its job. I hope that Republican Senators will rethink their \npolitical strategy and return to the Senate's tradition of promptly \nconsidering noncontroversial nominations so that we can work together \nto regain the trust of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nis yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Martha N. Johnson, of Maryland, to be Administrator of General \nServices?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I will be brief. The vote that just \noccurred was a vote on the nomination of Martha Johnson, of Maryland, \nto head the General Services Administration. That vote was reported by \nthe committee unanimously to the U.S. Senate on June 8 of last year--\nJune 8 of last year. It has been blocked since that moment, and now we \nhave a vote. We didn't have a vote in July, August, September, October, \nNovember, December, or January; we had it now, 7 or 8 months later. \nAfter blocking it for 7 or 8 months, 92 Senators voted yes. Explain to \nthe American people how you block a nomination for 7 months that you \nsupport. Try to explain that. In my judgment, it is a shameful \ndisrespect for good government to block nominations for month after \nmonth after month.\n  The same is true with individual issues that are brought to the floor \nof the Senate. I will give you a couple of examples. An appropriations \nbill was blocked on the floor of the Senate, and then 80 people voted \nyes. A credit card holders' bill of rights was blocked in the Senate, \nand then 90 people voted yes. The Department of Defense appropriations \nwas filibustered in the Senate, and then 88 Senators voted yes on that.\n  If ever there were a demonstration for all to see how unbelievably \nbroken this process is, it is today, once again, that after 7 or 8 \nmonths, a very qualified candidate, reported out unanimously from the \ncommittee of jurisdiction to head the GSA now gets 92 people to vote \nyes, which means we have a lot of people who block things they intend \nto vote for later. It is an unbelievable example of why this place \ndoesn't work. A minimum amount of cooperation, in my judgment, would go \na long way to helping make this place work the way it should. This \nnomination should have taken 10 minutes on the floor of the Senate last \nJune after it was reported out unanimously by the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  If I sound irritated by what is going on, I think a good many Members \nof the Senate are irritated by what I believe is a show of disrespect \nfor good government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S468-4", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S468-S470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEDICAID READJUSTMENT RATE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I know that under the previous \narrangement, the Senator from Massachusetts will be giving his farewell \nremarks. I would like to speak for the next 4 minutes prior to him \ncoming to the floor.\n  I spoke on the floor earlier explaining to my colleagues and \nproviding some additional information about the fair resolution the \nSenate came to to help Louisiana and any other State that would have \nbeen similarly impacted through a very difficult Medicaid readjustment \nrate. I spoke at length this morning about that.\n  I want to show this chart that clearly outlines our particular and \nunique and disastrous situation. Since 1999, and before, the State of \nLouisiana--and the occupant of the chair was a Governor, so she knows--\npaid approximately 30 percent of our Medicaid dollars and the Federal \nGovernment picked up about 70. We are in the lower one-third of States \non a per capita basis and have been since the Civil War, and we remain \nthat way to this day.\n  What happened after Katrina and Rita was, because of the great \ngenerosity not only of this body and the Congress and the former \nPresident and the current President and private sector dollars--\nbillions and billions of dollars poured into our State, driving our per \ncapita income up an unprecedented 40 percent. That has never happened \nin the history of the Medicaid Program. The State that comes closest to \na per capita increase, I believe--or several States increased by only \n14 percent.\n  The bottom line is, if our delegation had not sought some fix, some \narrangement, some workout of this problem, the people of Louisiana, who \nhave been impacted by the largest disaster in recent memory, would have \nhad to pay $472 million more for basically the same program. The \nformula was flawed.\n  The point I want to make in my final minute is this: I am proud to \nlead this effort to fix this. The effort was not a secret effort; it \nwas a public effort--called for by the Republican Governor, Bobby \nJindal, in a press conference 2 weeks before Barack Obama was sworn in \nas President--to talk about this issue in a public forum, not a private \nforum. It was not a last-minute effort; it started a year ago. It was \nnot a special deal for me; it was a timely and fair resolution for the \npeople of Louisiana--one which they still deserve.\n  The consequences of failure, in my final 15 seconds, are that the \npeople of Louisiana, if this is not fixed--a health care issue on a \nhealth care bill--if it is not fixed, the people of Louisiana will have \nto either cut $472 million out of our budget this year--and that is a \nlot of money out of a budget, even by Washington standards--or raise \ntaxes.\n  I will continue to come to the floor to speak proudly, openly, and \nforcefully about this issue. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nallowing me to clarify a few points.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a group of documents printed in the \nRecord to substantiate what I have said today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         State of Louisiana, Department of Health and Hospitals, \n           Office of the Secretary,\n                                   Baton Rouge, LA, April 6, 2009.\n     Hon. Charles E. Johnson,\n     Interim Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human \n         Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Johnson: Since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \n     struck the gulf coast in 2005, several federal agencies, \n     including the Department of Health and Human Services, have \n     contributed significant financial resources in the recovery \n     effort. Many of the initiatives continue, and we are grateful \n     for the ongoing work being done by HHS to assist Louisiana.\n       I write today to share with you what seems to be an \n     unintended consequence of the bold financial initiatives \n     undertaken since 2005. Billions of dollars have been infused \n     into Louisiana's economy following the damage caused by the \n     failure of the federal levee system--dollars for which we are \n     grateful, but which we also know are temporary by their \n     nature. Unfortunately, as calculations are performed by the \n     federal government to determine federal participation for \n     Medicaid, it has become clear the federal formula for \n     estimation of federal match for Louisiana has become \n     significantly artificially skewed by the infusion of these \n     dollars into the calculation of per-capita income.\n       Louisiana's federal match for Medicaid typically has been \n     expected to range somewhere between 69.6 percent and 73 \n     percent with very small variations from year-to-year. \n     However, according to forecasts provided by Federal Funds \n     Information to States (FFIS), and our own calculations, it \n     appears our FMAP will decline for FFY 10 from its current \n     nearly 72 percent to 67.6 percent, and then again for FFY 11 \n     to 63.1 percent. Similarly, our enhanced match for CHIP will \n     decline from 80 percent to 74 percent. According to FFIS, \n     these calculations are based on what appears to be a 42 \n     percent increase in Louisiana's per-capita income from 2005-\n     2007--an increase otherwise not typical by any reasonable \n     definition of income without the inclusion of the multitude \n     of one-time recovery dollars included by the BEA in their \n     calculations.\n       The federal formula for FMAP is deliberately established by \n     Congress to utilize a three-year running average so as to \n     avoid such sudden spikes or decreases. Even with such \n     safeguards, however, Louisiana is facing the largest decrease \n     in FMAP in the nation, and at an alarming rate, based on \n     currently forecast expenditures, which assume\n\n[[Page S469]]\n\n     significant current-year and proposed reductions in spending \n     for the next fiscal year, the lost federal match will \n     annualize to an estimated $700 million. Importantly, this \n     lost federal revenue is net of the stimulus--meaning it is a \n     reduction from our Medicaid program in addition to the \n     reduction that will take place when the stimulus expires.\n       The projected major reduction in FMAP will converge by \n     January, 2011 to pose a cataclysmic challenge upon the \n     expiration of the stimulus. Many states are in a position to \n     plan for the loss of stimulus dollars, particularly if their \n     FMAP is remaining in a static state. In fact, FFIS estimates \n     21 states will see an increase in their FMAP in FFY 11, while \n     other states are protected by the floor. However, with \n     Louisiana literally going from an 80 percent stimulus FMAP \n     rate to a 63 percent FMAP beginning in January, 2011, the \n     sudden decrease is simply not manageable without a sudden and \n     dramatic blow to our program, its providers and, most \n     importantly, to the 26 percent of our population--mostly \n     children--who rely upon the financial solvency of the \n     program.\n       Louisiana has a very honored tradition of enrolling our \n     lowest income children in health coverage, with only 5 \n     percent of our children currently being estimated to be \n     without coverage. Thanks in large part to the approval of \n     HHS, we expanded access to children up to 250 percent of the \n     federal poverty level in January, 2008, and have enrolled \n     more than 25,000 additional children in our programs since \n     that time. We have been singled out as the state that has the \n     best track record of retaining these children in coverage. \n     Clearly, Governor Jindal is committed to making additional \n     progress in improving the health outcomes for our population, \n     but such significant reductions in federal funding--\n     particularly resulting as a consequence of our hurricane \n     recovery--can only disrupt this program. . . .\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2009.\n     Secretary Kathleen Sebelius,\n     Department of Health and Human Services,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Sebelius: We write to you today to follow up \n     on an April 9 letter to your office from Louisiana Department \n     of Health and Hospitals Secretary Alan Levine regarding \n     potential reductions to Louisiana's Medicaid Federal Medical \n     Assistance Percentage (FMAP).\n       While many states will face challenges to their Medicaid \n     programs in the coming years, we believe that Louisiana's \n     case is unique. As you may be aware, our state is still \n     rebuilding from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 as well \n     as Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, including the \n     rehabilitation of the healthcare system in the New Orleans \n     area. These extensive recovery efforts have inflated \n     Louisiana's per capita income, but were only temporary and do \n     not accurately reflect the increases to incomes in industries \n     not related to hurricane recovery.\n       Since the FMAP formula uses per capita income to calculate \n     how much each state will receive in Medicaid funding, we are \n     greatly concerned that the post-hurricane per capita income \n     increases could significantly impact our state's FMAP \n     allocation. We ask that you meet with Secretary Levine to \n     develop a solution to the unique problem that is facing our \n     state.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mary Landrieu, U.S. Senator; Rodney Alexander, Member of \n           Congress; Charlie Melancon, Member of Congress; Bill \n           Cassidy, Member of Congress; David Vitter, U.S. \n           Senator; Charles Boustany, Member of Congress; Steve \n           Scalise, Member of Congress; John Fleming, Member of \n           Congress; Anh ``Joseph'' Cao, Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 137\n\n       Whereas, in 2005 and 2008, Louisiana was struck by \n     hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike, collectively \n     requiring billions of dollars of federal and private \n     assistance to the state; and\n       Whereas, the people of Louisiana are grateful for the \n     support of the American people and of the United States \n     Congress as the state is recovering from these catastrophic \n     events; and\n       Whereas, coastal states, such as Florida, Mississippi and \n     Texas, and other states, such as Iowa, have recently \n     experienced significant disasters related to either \n     hurricanes or flooding, and coastal states can reasonably \n     expect to experience similar calamities in the future; and\n       Whereas, after a disaster resulting in massive and wide \n     spread damage to public and private property, economic \n     activity may temporarily significantly increase as the state \n     and local communities endeavor to rebuild; and\n       Whereas, due to the increased economic activity resulting \n     from hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Louisiana's per capita \n     personal income saw an unusual and extraordinary increase of \n     forty-two percent from 2005 through 2007; and\n       Whereas, the per capita personal income for Louisiana grew \n     by six point eight percent from 2000 through 2005; and\n       Whereas, the bureau of economic analysis of the U.S. \n     Department of Commerce stated in its 2007 report entitled \n     State Personal Income, that ``Louisiana grew ten point five \n     percent in 2007, down from twenty point six percent in \n     2006,'' and that ``these growth rates are substantially \n     higher than any other state''; and\n       Whereas, the bureau further reported that, ``the rental \n     income component of Louisiana personal income was boosted by \n     five point four billion dollars of Road Home subsidies from \n     the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,'' and \n     that much of the per capita personal income gain in Louisiana \n     ``is accounted for by the Road Home subsidies which average \n     nearly twelve hundred fifty dollars per Louisiana resident''; \n     and\n       Whereas, evidence shows that even though the per capita \n     personal income had grown by forty-two percent from 2005 \n     through 2007, median income has remained stable which \n     indicates that real personal income has not grown in a \n     sustained way; and\n       Whereas, the bureau of economic analysis captures not only \n     the economic activity generated by the receipt of government \n     disaster relief payments but receipt of insurance payments \n     that would not have occurred but for the hurricanes--activity \n     which, when included in the overall calculations of per \n     capita personal income are extremely difficult to \n     disaggregate for attribution to specific causes as the \n     spending percolates throughout the economy; and\n       Whereas, the increased economic activity in Louisiana in \n     2006 and 2007 is clearly a direct result of the rebuilding \n     that occurred in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita \n     and this economic activity led to a corresponding increase in \n     per capita personal income in Louisiana in 2006 and 2007; and\n       Whereas, accurate considerations of per capita personal \n     income are important because federal law establishes the \n     formula by which the FMAP for each state is determined based \n     on a comparison of each states per capita personal income \n     to the per capita income personal income of the United \n     States as calculated by the bureau of economic analysis; \n     and\n       Whereas, when a state's per capita personal income \n     increases relative to the average of the United States, the \n     state's FMAP decreases; and\n       Whereas, according to the federal formula, the increase in \n     per capita personal income in Louisiana in 2006 and 2007 will \n     have the unintended consequence of reducing Louisiana's FMAP \n     for federal fiscal years 2010 and 2011; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's FMAP will decrease to 67.61% in \n     federal fiscal year 2010 and to 63.16% in federal fiscal year \n     2011, a total decrease of 6.53% over two years, the largest \n     decline of any state; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's FMAP is temporarily enhanced to eighty \n     percent as a result of the enactment of the American Recovery \n     and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), but that enhanced FMAP \n     will terminate on December 31, 2010; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's FMAP will drop precipitously from \n     eighty percent to sixty-three point sixteen percent on \n     January 1, 2011, and this loss in federal match will \n     annualize to approximately one billion dollars; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana has demonstrated a significant \n     commitment to its programs for providing health care access \n     to the poor by investing in substantial sums of state general \n     fund dollars through Medicaid, SCHIP and a statewide system \n     of public hospitals, all of which to combine to provide a \n     safety net for a state with low income and significant \n     provider access problems, and such a drastic reduction in \n     Louisiana's FMAP will have devastating impact on the state's \n     infrastructure for caring for the poor; and\n       Whereas, the presumed purpose for using the per capita \n     personal income as a basis for the calculation of FMAP is to \n     ensure resources are directed to states which are more likely \n     to have low-income populations, and thus, a more significant \n     burden on the Medicaid program; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's Medicaid program has not seen a \n     decrease in enrollment after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but \n     rather an increase, and thus, from an economic perspective, \n     it is clear the purpose for utilizing per capita personal \n     income as the primary driver of the state's FMAP cannot be \n     accurately and fairly applied to Louisiana during the period \n     following the temporary increase in economic activity; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana Legislature does not accept that it \n     is the intention of the United States Department of Health \n     and Human Services or the United States Congress, through an \n     artifact of the FMAP formula, to financially penalize \n     Louisiana and other states working to rebuild their \n     communities after major disasters. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to enact legislation to \n     adjust the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage rules to \n     ameliorate the unintended negative impact caused by the \n     infusion of disaster relief funding, both public and private, \n     into Louisiana's and other state's economies following major \n     disasters. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Madam President, I rise for the honor of speaking on the \nfloor of this Senate Chamber for the last time. With the swearing-in of \nSenator-elect Scott Brown of Massachusetts scheduled for later this \nafternoon, my time as a Senator is nearing its close.\n  I repeat for the record, my most sincere congratulations to Scott \nBrown on his impressive victory. We have worked together to assure that \nhe and the people of Massachusetts were well served during the \ntransition, and I wish him all the very best in his service to the \nSenate.\n  Under the saddest of circumstances--the loss of our colleague and our \nclose friend Senator Ted Kennedy--my appointment to this office has \nallowed me to serve my Commonwealth and country in ways I could not \nhave imagined a few months ago. It has enabled me to work closely with \nmany old and new Senate friends--women and men who have been sent by \ntheir constituents to work together to make our Nation a better place.\n  These months have helped me to understand even more personally why \nSenator Ted Kennedy devoted his public life to the work of the Senate, \nwhy he took such pride in its history and its accomplishments, why he \nreached across the aisle to find common cause with allies who shared \nhis hopes, and why, from time to time, he called upon this body to \nreach beyond the politics of the moment to achieve a greater good for \nthe country's future. The lessons of his legacy will live on in this \nChamber and in the institute devoted to the study of the Senate that \nwill bear Ted Kennedy's name.\n  I discovered when just a boy how emotionally difficult it was to say \ngoodbye. So I learned to use two other words that come much easier at \ntimes such as this. Those two words are ``thank you.''\n  I was not elected to this post, but I am deeply grateful to the \npeople of Massachusetts who, through their elected representatives, \ngave me the opportunity to serve them. Particular thanks are owed to \nsenate president Therese Murray and house speaker Bob DeLeo for their \nleadership in enabling Gov. Deval Patrick to appoint an interim \nSenator. I will always be grateful to Governor Patrick for his \nconfidence in me.\n  It was my special gift to have had Senator Kennedy's trust and \nfriendship since signing on as a member of his Senate staff some 40 \nyears ago. But following his death, to be encouraged by his family--his \ndevoted wife Vicki, his daughter Kara, his son Ted, Jr., and his son \nPatrick--to consider an appointment to succeed the man whom they so \nloved and who achieved so much in this body is an honor for which no \nwords of thanks are adequate.\n  I will forever be grateful to my friends and colleagues John Kerry, \nChris Dodd, and so many others, for their warm and generous welcome to \nthe Senate. We shared a bond of sorrow with every other Senator at the \nrealization that, after 47 years of legendary service, Ted Kennedy \nwould no longer be occupying this desk. It was a time of emotional \nstirring, to be sure. But I found resolve in the certainty that Senator \nKennedy himself would be the first to urge us to persevere, and that \nattention to Senate duties was the most obvious way I could honor his \nmemory.\n  In undertaking those duties, I thank the majority leader Harry Reid \nand his entire leadership team for their encouragement, support, and \nwise counsel. I thank the assistant majority leader, Dick Durbin of \nIllinois, for his very generous remarks about me on the floor earlier \ntoday.\n  I thank my Senate freshman colleagues who have been a source of \nstrength to me and I predict will be a source of strength and \nleadership in this great body in the years to come; to all my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle; to the officials of the Senate, \nthe Secretary, the Parliamentarians, the clerks and reporters; to the \nSergeant at Arms, the doorkeepers; to the secretaries for the majority \nand minority and their able staffs; to the Chaplain; and, of course, to \nthe pages. Each and all of you have been extraordinarily thoughtful to \nme, patient with your tutelage and generous with your kindness and \ncourtesies, and I will remember each of you with affection and \nappreciation.\n  Finally, I wish to thank the Kennedy-Kirk staff. The Kennedy staff \nhas enjoyed a reputation of professional excellence through the years. \nWhy? Because they strove to match their boss's unmatchable work ethic \nand his tireless quest for excellence in the Senate. They shared \nSenator Kennedy's commitment to do all within one's ability to make \nAmerica a better and more just society and to make a positive \ndifference in the lives of its people.\n  I am grateful that many Kennedy staffers were willing to stay on as \nKirk staffers. It has been my pleasure to share a special bond with \nthem and with the capable young recruits who joined our ranks to begin \ntheir public service with this short-term freshman Senator.\n  My special thanks go to Senator Kennedy's and my chief of staff, Eric \nMogilnicki, who managed our collective efforts with calm and competence \nduring months of distraction and heartache; to Barbara Souliotis, \ndirector of our Massachusetts office who served Senator Kennedy and the \nconstituents of Massachusetts with devotion and distinction from his \nvery first campaign in 1962 until this very day; and to Carey Parker, \nwith whom I began my own Senate service over 40 years ago. Carey was \nthe loyal and wise legislative assistant constantly at Senator \nKennedy's side helping to craft and guide a legislative legacy that \nshall remain a standard of excellence for the ages.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nCongressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks a list of my \nstaff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, these are outstanding public servants who \nhave my heartfelt appreciation and every best wish for the future.\n  Over 3 months ago, in my maiden speech from this desk, I chose to \nspeak about Senator Kennedy's top legislative priority--to make quality \nhealth care affordable and accessible to all Americans. Since then, \nmuch has been accomplished in both Houses of Congress to bring us \ncloser to that long awaited goal.\n  Following the election results in Massachusetts over 2 weeks ago, it \nwas suggested that we let the dust settle before deciding what our next \nsteps should be on health care reform. But we must not let so much dust \nsettle that it buries all the sensible and necessary ideas that have \nbeen suggested. Comprehensive health care reform must remain an urgent \npriority of the 111th Congress.\n  But before we move forward on the path to health care reform and the \nmany other critical issues that demand our attention, I respectfully \nsubmit that the Senate--and by that I mean each individual Senator--\nmust pause to answer this question: Will the majority and minority walk \nthat path together and work together on the business of the people we \nrepresent or will the people we represent watch the Senate that belongs \nto them revert to the calculated, politically polarizing standoff that \nhas alienated the country during these past few months?\n  With the results from Massachusetts, much has been made of the fact \nthat the numbers have changed in the Senate, and that is true. The \nnumbers have changed. But the American people are asking a more \nimportant question: Will anything else change? Will the Democratic \nmajority, despite its still solid numerical advantage, be forced to \ncling to a 60-vote strategy as the only path to forward progress on \nmatters small and large, procedural as well as substantive? Will the \nRepublican minority misread the Massachusetts results as vindication of \na strategy to just say no to any measure proposed by a Democratic \nPresident of the United States or by their colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle?\n  In my first speech from this desk as the 100th Member and the most \njunior Member and the 60th Democratic vote, I said I was hopeful that a \nnewcomer's perspective would be received as a constructive contribution \nto the debate and that the debate should not be about one party \nreaching 60 votes; it should be about 100 Senators reaching out to each \nother to reform a system that better reflects the true values and \ncharacter of our Nation.\n  Now some 4 months later, I feel obliged to repeat this observation to\n\n[[Page S471]]\n\nmy colleagues, Democrats as well as Republicans.\n  Bipartisan comity and collaboration must replace the polarization \nthat threatens to poison the atmosphere and impede the work of this \nbody. The Senate is in need of its own form of climate change, and only \nSenators of good will and of good faith and of both parties can bring \nthat about.\n  The American people are filled with anxiety, anger, and impatience. \nThey are facing issues of job security, health security, retirement \nsecurity, home security, tuition security, and the list goes on. Their \ncrises should not be dividing their Senate; it should be uniting it.\n  When the American families we are honored to represent are imperiled \nby economic hardship and uncertainty, they expect Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents to work together in their common \ninterest. And they deserve no less.\n  Lest anyone be misled by the message of the Massachusetts election, \nthey should examine the exit polls. Voters were asked if the Senator-\nelect should join his Republican colleagues and try to block the \nPresident and congressional Democrats or should he work with them in a \nbipartisan manner. Among all voters, cooperation won by more than 3 to \n1, 76 percent to 21 percent. And among those voters who supported the \nSenator-elect, bipartisan cooperation was preferred to obstruction by \nalmost 2 to 1--61 percent to 36 percent.\n  I spent a part of my career as national chairman of one of our two \nmajor political parties. It was my job to be partisan. It was my job to \nweigh each decision, asking whether or how it might give us a political \nadvantage in the short run or in the next election. That is what party \nchairmen are expected to do. That is not what Senators are expected to \ndo.\n  There is always the possibility that my closing remarks will be \ndismissed by some as idealistic or unrealistic or partisan or as just a \nperspective of a short termer who doesn't understand how the process \nworks.\n  To them, I respectfully suggest that they listen as well to the words \nof the last Republican Senator elected from Massachusetts. This is what \nSenator Edward W. Brooke, an elder statesman of the Republican Party, \nsaid when he received Congress's highest civilian honor, the \nCongressional Gold Medal, less than 3 months ago:\n\n       I'm here to tell you that politics is not an evil thing. \n     It's a good thing. And when used properly, it does good \n     things. I think of the awesome responsibilities of the House \n     of Representatives and the United States Senate in these \n     years of crisis. . . . Not only this country, but this world \n     looks to you.\n\n  Then, turning away from his audience to directly address the majority \nand minority leadership of both Houses of Congress, Senator Brooke said \nthis:\n\n       When Republicans and Democrats get together, they can do \n     anything. And the country is waiting for you to do anything. \n     They just want relief. You have the responsibility, you have \n     the authority, you are the people on Earth that are going to \n     save this country and save the world. Think about that. We've \n     got to get together. We have no alternative. There's nothing \n     left. It's time for politics to be put aside on the back \n     burner.\n\n  Madam President, I submit Senator Brooke is correct. We have no \nalternative. The Republican and Democratic Members of the Senate have \nno alternative but to work together in a bipartisan spirit with a level \nof civility and cooperation that is equal to the dignity of this \ninstitution and to the magnitude of what is at stake for American \nfamilies.\n  The Senate is at its best and is rewarded fairly by the electorate \nwhen it reflects a spirit of teamwork and collaboration that brings \nresults for the people it is meant to serve. We have seen it throughout \nhistory. We have seen it in statesmen such as Ted Kennedy and Ed \nBrooke. We have seen it in so many others who have served in this \nChamber with distinction. I know--I know--there are Senators of good \nwill of both parties who long for that spirit today.\n  We are among the very few who are privileged to serve in this \nhistoric body. As I complete my own duties here, I could not leave with \na clear conscience without urging all my colleagues to seize this \nopportunity and this mutual obligation to take the long view, to put \npartisan politics aside, to come together in good faith and good will \nto better serve the institution we revere, the people we represent, and \nthe Nation we love.\n  Madam President, with gratitude for the privilege of serving the \npeople of Massachusetts in the Senate, for the last time, I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                Staff of U.S. Senator Paul G.

Walsh, Collenne \n     Wider, Emily A. Winterson.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague, Paul Kirk, \nfor his eloquent and important comments to the Senate. He said a moment \nago he hoped a newcomer's perspective would be a constructive \ncontribution to the debate. I think all my colleagues would agree that \nwhether in the caucus or in his maiden speech before the Senate or in \nhis comments just now, Paul Kirk has made an important contribution to \nthe Senate.\n  Shortly after his oath of office last September, I said Paul was \nsmart, modest, polite, civil, and willing to share credit, and despite \nall that, I still thought he would be a terrific Senator. I think all \nof us would agree he has been a terrific Senator in a short span of \ntime.\n  At a time of enormous upheaval in Massachusetts, a time of mourning, \nthere was no one who was more suited for the moment than Paul Kirk, and \nthere was no one who understood the meaning of the moment better than \nPaul Kirk--Ted Kennedy's friend of 40 years.\n  Everyone would agree Paul hit the ground running. He was familiar \nwith Teddy's staff and was able to bring highly qualified people \nhimself. He had a command of all the issues that were facing the \nSenate. He had a special understanding of the politics that are played \nin Washington. Paul was always aware, as he said with his dry wit, that \nhe was a short-timer, but in his months here he didn't decide to come \nand be satisfied to simply serve out the term. He led, just as he \nexpressed to us he knew people expected him to.\n  He cast an all-important vote, obviously, in the Senate's historic \npassage of comprehensive health care reform. But, frankly, much more \nimportant than a decisive vote, he provided a clear and compelling \nvoice in the Democratic caucus for important features of the health \ncare reform bill, especially the Community Living Assistance Services \nand Supports Act--or the CLASS Act, as it is known. That is an act Paul \nfought hard for, based on his commitment to providing much needed \ninsurance support to Americans with disabilities, allowing them to live \nindependently in their communities. It was a cause, I might add, that \nmarked Ted Kennedy's life but also Paul's.\n  Paul didn't just work on health care reform. As a Member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, he asked tough and prescient questions \nof the Secretary of State, of the Defense Secretary, of the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, about the military mission \nin Afghanistan--the kind of questions of which I know his mentor, Ted \nKennedy, would have been proud.\n  He also cosponsored legislation to achieve greater parity in domestic \npartner benefits between the Federal workforce and the private sector \nemployees. He worked with me to extend unemployment insurance benefits \nthat will benefit as many as 40,000 Massachusetts residents, as well as \nget $80 million in Federal grants for community health care centers in \nMassachusetts.\n  In all this--and Paul spoke about it a few minutes ago--he was served \nby this amazing array of staff who are assembled behind him. He was \nserved superbly by Senate staffers he inherited from Ted Kennedy and \nthose he brought to the Senate. These outstanding men and women deserve \nour\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\nthanks, as he has given them all our thanks in the Senate and well \nwishes for the next chapter in public service.\n  In one of his early speeches in the Senate, Paul Kirk spoke at length \nabout his friend, Ted. He said Senator Kennedy was not one to sit idly \nby--he acted; he acted to help as many people as possible. Well, the \nsame can now be said also of Senator Paul Kirk, though obviously for a \nmuch shorter period of time. He was not one to sit idly by. In the \nshort time he has been here, he did act, and he has helped as many \npeople as possible.\n  When he was selected to replace his friend in the Senate, I was \nreminded then--and I think I mentioned this on the floor--of Ted \nKennedy's fondness for the poet Robert Frost and a line from one of his \npoems. Frost wrote:\n\n       Men work together, I told him from the heart, whether they \n     work together or apart.\n\n  Teddy and Paul worked together for much of their lives. Even though \nthey have been apart these past months, they have never stopped working \ntogether in the spirit and in the causes that Paul has embraced in his \ntime here.\n  As I think about the comments he just made, in talking about what we \nneed in the Senate, I couldn't help but look across the aisle and not \nsee a Senator there. I regret that. Senator Inouye, seated to my right, \nhas served here much longer than most of us--and Senator Leahy, who was \njust here, and Senator Dodd--but I think we were all part of the Senate \na number of years ago when that never would have been the case.\n  So it is what it is. I hope they hear his comments. I hope all our \ncolleagues will reach for this moment Senator Kirk has asked us to and, \nin doing so, will keep faith not just with his service but with the \nservice of our dearly beloved friend, Ted Kennedy.\n  I wish to thank Paul Kirk for his service to the people of the \ncountry and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the way in which he \nkept faith with the spirit of the law which sent him here. I think he \nhas served us all well, and we will miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Tuesday night the Senate spoke with \none voice expressing serious concern about ongoing attempts by China \nand other countries to restrict press and Internet freedom and \ncondemning the recent cyber-attacks against Google in China.\n  In a bipartisan effort, a truly bipartisan effort, we unanimously \npassed S. Res. 405, introduced by myself and Senators Brownback, Casey, \nKyl, Feingold, Lieberman, McCain, Specter, and Webb--a broad spectrum \nof the Senate who all agree on this issue. This resolution reaffirms \nthe centrality of freedom of expression and the press as cornerstones \nof U.S. foreign policy. It frames such freedoms as part of U.S. efforts \nto promote individual rights and voices concern over the ongoing \nefforts by many countries, and I mean many countries, to restrict free \nexpression, highlighting the attempts to censor, restrict, and monitor \naccess to the Internet.\n  The impetus for this resolution was a recent cyber-attack on Google's \ncorporate infrastructure and at least 34 companies, reportedly \noriginating in China. Google has evidence to suggest that a primary \ngoal of this attack was to access Gmail accounts of Chinese human \nrights activists, journalists, and dissidents.\n  Even worse, this attack was only one of many recent attempts to \nexploit security flaws and illegally access computer networks of \nnumerous individuals and institutions. These cyber-attacks are \nunconscionable violations of national security interests in addition to \nviolations of intellectual property rights. With the passage of this \nresolution, countries from which such attacks originate or countries \nwhich take steps to restrict or monitor the Internet should consider \nthemselves on notice.\n  The resolution calls on the Chinese Government to conduct a thorough \nreview of the recent attacks and to make this investigation and its \nresults transparent.\n  This is not just about cyber-warfare, and it is not just about China. \nThis resolution highlights a much broader and far-reaching problem of \nstate-sponsored efforts to restrict free and unfettered access to the \nInternet.\n  As technology continues to develop, an increasing number of \ngovernments have employed repressive tactics to monitor and control the \nInternet. In countries such as Iran and China, a growing effort has \nbeen made to silence the voices of their citizens and restrict the free \nflow of information. According to the 2009 ``Freedom on the Net'' \nreport conducted by Freedom House, the Government of China employs a \nsophisticated, multilayered, and wide-ranging apparatus to curtail \nInternet freedom. It also employs legal and economic means to coerce \nInternet service providers, Web hosting firms, and mobile phone \ncompanies to delete and censor online content.\n  Finally, it requires domestic Chinese and foreign companies with \nsubsidiaries in China--such as Google but many others--to adjust their \nbusiness practices to allow for increased filtering and supervision by \nthe Government of China, which limits the data available on search \nengines.\n  This resolution urges companies to engage in responsible business \npractices in the face of such pressure from foreign governments by \nrefusing to aid in the curtailment of free expression and welcomes the \ndiplomatic initiative announced by Secretary Clinton in her January 21 \nspeech on Internet freedom to support the development of technology \naimed at censorship circumvention.\n  Finally, the resolution highlights violations of a free press in \nChina, such as the ongoing jamming of Radio Free Asia, Voice of \nAmerica, and other international broadcasters, despite the unimpeded \nbroadcast in the United States of Chinese state-run medial outlets. We \nallow China to broadcast to the CCTV and the Radio China outlets into \nthe United States completely unfettered. Yet they jam all of our \nbroadcasts by Voice of America and Radio Free Asia into their country. \nThis is not fair, this is not reciprocity, and it is not becoming of a \nnation that hopes to become one of the great nations of the world.\n  It pays tribute to the professional and citizen journalists who \npersevere in their dedication to report in China despite the extremely \nhigh rate of imprisonment among journalists.\n  The freedoms highlighted in this resolution are not just an inherent \ngood, they are also a practical benefit. As Secretary Clinton recently \nsaid:\n\n       . . . countries that restrict free access to information or \n     violate the basic rights of Internet users risk walling \n     themselves off from progress.\n\n  I am grateful for the widespread support and passage of S. Res. 405, \nand I thank the other cosponsors for their leadership. The United \nStates must not sit back as voices in China, Iran, and around the world \nare silenced. It is my hope this resolution will help to promote an \nenvironment of expanded freedoms, especially when it comes to the \nInternet and the press.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S473]]\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, since the financial meltdown in 2008, \nAmerica and Congress have remained stuck at a crossroads. Not since the \nGreat Depression of the 1930s have we experienced a financial and \neconomic crisis of such magnitude that it forces us as a society and \nlawmaking body to reconsider the legal and institutional underpinnings \nof our financial system.\n  The history of our Nation shows we have been at this crossroads \nbefore. At times, we have made the right decision, but, sadly, at other \ntimes we have made the wrong one.\n  Throughout the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, \nthe complacency of government and the contrivances of powerful, moneyed \ninterests prevented us from achieving fundamental reform of our \nfinancial and monetary structures. The result was, our history was \nreplete with all-too-frequent banking panics.\n  Regrettably, it took well over a century before we heeded the clarion \ncall for reform.\n  The shared experience of the Great Depression thrust us into the \nharsh reality that the status quo was bankrupt. Out of the ashes of \nthat crisis, we built a legal and regulatory edifice that has endured \nfor decades.\n  One of the cornerstones of that edifice was a federally guaranteed \ninsurance fund to back up bank deposits. Another was the Glass-Steagall \nAct which established a firewall between commercial and investment \nbanking activities. Other rules were imposed on investors to tamp down \nrampant speculation, such as margin requirements and the uptick rule on \nshort selling.\n  For the next 50 years, the United States experienced relative \nfinancial calm and economic growth, with the normal business cycle \nproviding the usual ups and downs, of course.\n  The edifices built in the 1930s served us well until the 1980s and \nthe savings and loan crisis, which itself was brought on by the \nrollback of rules that applied to thrifts.\n  Unfortunately, the passage of time, and even after the shock of the \nS failures, the ideology of market fundamentalism began to sweep \nacross our regulatory environment, erasing the clear lessons of \nhistory.\n  Those market fundamentalists argued that our financial actors could \npolice themselves, that their own self-interest in remaining \nfinancially viable would create sufficient incentive to do thorough due \ndiligence, far exceeding the ability of regulators to limit excessive \nrisk by rulemaking.\n  Systematically, these fundamentalists worked to dismantle many of the \nprudential New Deal-era banking reforms. Their crowning achievement: \nthe repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999.\n  Wall Street and Washington were possessed by this laissez faire ethos \nover the past 20 years. But it was this philosophy and the fountainhead \nof decisions that sprang from it that led us blithely, and perhaps \nblindly, down the path to our current crisis.\n  Even Alan Greenspan, the avatar of the deregulatory mindset, has now \nadmitted this dominant concept of self-regulation was ill-conceived.\n  In a speech just 1 year ago this month before the Economic Club in \nNew York, the former Fed Chairman of 19 years conceded that the \n``enlightened self-interest'' he had once assumed would ensure that \nWall Street firms maintain a ``buffer against insolvency'' had failed.\n  The sheer complexity of today's trading instruments and the supposed \nrisk management tools used to ensure them against collapse was, he \nsaid, ``too much for even the most sophisticated market players to \nhandle properly and prudently.''\n  Mr. Greenspan, perhaps more than anyone else, should have known \nbetter. But instead of playing the role of the markets' fire chief, he \nplayed that of head cheerleader. For example, Mr. Greenspan applauded \nthe trend of financial disintermediation, proclaiming that new \ninnovations would allow risks to be dispersed throughout the system.\n  Unfortunately, he failed to realize that products such as credit \ndefault swaps sometimes perversely encouraged banks to become empty \ncreditors, since banks holding these default instruments could end up \nmaking more money if people and companies defaulted on their debts than \nif they actually paid them.\n  Of course, this was just the tip of the iceberg. Despite having the \npower to write and enforce consumer protection standards, the Federal \nReserve did nothing to combat deteriorating origination standards in \nmortgage and consumer loans.\n  Mr. Greenspan signed off on regulations that gave banks the ability \nto set their own capital standards. He allowed banking institutions to \nleverage excessively by gorging on short-term liabilities and, in some \ncases, creating off-balance-sheet entities to warehouse their risky \nassets.\n  In the wake of Wall Street excess and dereliction of duty by its \nregulators, financial ruin descended upon our country. Ultimately, it \ntook extraordinary actions--including a multibillion-dollar taxpayer \nbailout--to prevent us from falling into the abyss of a second Great \nDepression. We narrowly avoided that fate.\n  But now, when Congress should be hardest at work rebuilding the \nedifice that served us so well for decades, we are not. Instead, we are \nbeing lulled into a false sense of security.\n  Many of Wall Street's biggest financial institutions, just a few \nmonths ago saved from oblivion by U.S. taxpayers, have already \nrecovered. In some cases, they are even making record profits. Once \nagain, they are back to their old tricks, in particular remaining \nobsessively fixated on short-term trading profits, with the help of \nzero percent loans from the Fed window, to drive their recovery.\n  In fact, much of the competition was killed off in the crisis so that \nonce stronger banks are now stronger still, allowing them to charge \ncustomers higher transaction fees, from equities to bonds to \nderivatives.\n  Many on Wall Street are engaged in high-frequency trading strategies\n\n[[Page S474]]\n\nwhich, as the Chicago Federal Reserve branch wrote just this week, pose \na systemic risk.\n  Fair and transparent markets are a cornerstone of American democracy. \nBut institutions on Wall Street are riven by obvious conflicts of \ninterest, as banks and nonbanks continue to profit, even by taking \npositions directly adverse to those of their clients, and too big to \nfail remains a critical problem.\n  Many on Wall Street are telling us it is too late to unscramble the \negg, that we cannot separate banking and trading entities that over the \npast 10 years have become inextricably intertwined. But the Nation is \ncounting on the Congress to do what is right. We must restore and \npreserve the credibility of our financial markets. We simply cannot \nfail to undertake what should be a dramatic reformation of our \nfinancial regulatory system.\n  Especially as a depression--which is how today's economy feels to \nmillions of Americans who lost their jobs, their homes, their \nretirement savings--continues across this country, we simply cannot \nsquander the time for fundamental reform. We can never let a financial \ndisaster happen again.\n  So what must we do? Mr. Greenspan has called for heightened Federal \nregulation of banks and other financial institutions. But that is not \nat all sufficient.\n  That is why I was deeply gratified last month when the Obama \nadministration took an important step in pushing Congress in a stronger \ndirection. The President put forward a plan that has been suggested by \nMr. Greenspan's predecessor at the Fed, Paul Volcker. It went well \nbeyond Mr. Greenspan's call for mere heightened regulation.\n  Chairman Volcker's plan would ban commercial banks from engaging in \nproprietary trading that does not benefit their clients. In other \nwords, as Mr. Volcker explained, banks should stick to banking, \nproviding both credit to those who need it and an efficient global \npayment system, without which, of course, our worldwide economy cannot \nwork.\n  It is axiomatic to say banks should exist to serve their customers, \nnot as platforms on which an elite class of traders make their careers \nand their mind-boggling bonuses.\n  Sound advice, Mr. Chairman.\n  Remarkably, some on Wall Street and in Washington have been arguing \nthat proprietary trading did not cause the crisis, even though the \ncrisis began on Wall Street with the collapse of a Bear Stearns hedge \nfund, even though all of the major firms involved in the crisis built \nup major proprietary positions in collateralized debt obligations and \nother securities.\n  As Professor Roy Smith of New York University, a former Goldman Sachs \npartner, said:\n\n       Those weren't client-driven trades. They decided to take \n     them themselves. The idea that proprietary trades were a \n     trivial part of the losses at the banks is just not \n     realistic.\n\n  This is from a New York University professor and former Goldman Sachs \npartner.\n  These same critics are now looking to poke holes in the Volcker \nproposal--to put it to death by a thousand cuts. They state that \nproprietary trading can't be distinguished from normal market-making \nactivities. They add that customer money is oftentimes invested \nalongside some of the firm's capital in proprietary ventures. Before it \nis even considered in Congress, they found facile arguments to \nundermine the very spirit of the proposal. These critics would leave \nthe decisionmaking to the regulators, and I could not disagree more. We \nshould not leave the decisionmaking to the regulators.\n  So while I applaud Chairman Volcker's direction, I believe we need to \ngo even further. We cannot pass the buck to our regulatory agencies. We \nhave tried that before. They punted their responsibilities to the \ncredit rating agencies and to the banks themselves, and we were left \nwith disastrous consequences.\n  As a recent feature in the Economist stated, the big issue we face is \n``not how to make regulation cleverer, but how to protect taxpayers \nfrom a huge bill when all the precautions fail and a bank steps into \nthe void.''\n  Congress needs to draw hard lines that get directly at the structural \nproblems that afflict Wall Street and our largest banks. We must draw \nlines that divide financial institutions which are ``too big to fail.'' \nAnd we must draw lines that end the conflicts of interest that \nliterally and inevitably serve to corrupt some of our most important \nfinancial institutions.\n  I have been around the Senate for 37 years, and I know laws are \nusually not written with hard-and-fast lines. Laws are a product of \nlegislative compromise, which often means they are vague and ambiguous, \nand we often justify our vagueness by saying that the regulators to \nwhom we grant statutory authority are in a better position to write the \nrules and then to apply those regulatory rules on a case-by-case basis. \nMany times, they are right, but this is not one of those times.\n  If Congress fails to draw hard lines that deliver on real systemic \nreforms, regulators cannot be counted upon to do what is needed. We \nneed brick and mortar, not human judgment, to cleave the banks from \ninvestment banking again. We need stone walls, not regulatory \noversight, to prevent institutional conflict of interests that \ninevitably bring financial disaster to millions of Americans. We must \ncreate a system, as the saying goes, of laws and not of men. While \nCongress is by nature a compromiser, we must do better than our usual \nlegislative ambiguity. We must provide those agencies--the Fed, the \nSEC, the FDIC, the OCC, the CFTC, and others--the statutory clarity and \nthe bright lines they need to enforce the law.\n  That is why Congress needs a bold and clear plan that ends taxpayer \nbailouts for Wall Street and eliminates the problem of too big to fail. \nIn my view, the core part of that plan must include three critical \nfeatures:\n  First, we must reimpose the kinds of protections we had under Glass-\nSteagall, completely separating traditional commercial banking \nactivities from the activities of investment banks.\n  Second, we must impose size and leverage constraints on the nonbank \nplayers to ensure they never again--never again--become too big to \nfail.\n  Third, we must address the fundamental conflict of interest in modern \ninvestment banking that permits proprietary trading to come before \nserving customers.\n  I was proud to join Senators Cantwell and McCain in sponsoring a bill \nthat would reimpose Glass-Steagall. By statutorily splitting apart \nmassive financial institutions that house both banking and securities \noperations, we will go a long way toward fixing too big to fail.\n  As important as reimposing the protections of Glass-Steagall, we must \nalso understand that the financial world has changed enormously since \nit was last in place. An investment bank is no longer an advisory \nbusiness where small partnerships jealously guard their capital. \nInstead, it is dominated by highly leveraged behemoths that trade for \ntheir own account. So while Glass-Steagall firewalls protect federally \ninsured deposits and eliminate the conflicts in combining commercial \nand investment banking, it wouldn't eliminate the possibility of a \nlarge, leveraged, and interconnected firm such as Lehman Brothers from \ncreating havoc in the financial system.\n  For that reason, Congress must take other prudential steps. We can \nbegin with the other concept put forward by the Obama-Volcker \nproposal--placing limits on debt. Wall Street banks were able to fly \ntoo high on borrowed wings by leveraging their threadbare capital base \nwell over 30 times--30 times--allowing a firm such as Lehman Brothers \nto finance a trillion-dollar balance sheet of illiquid trading assets \nthrough short-term debt. I repeat, we cannot depend upon regulators and \ntheir discretionary judgments to ensure this does not happen again. \nInstead, we need a strict limit on the size of investment banks' \nliabilities. There is already such a limit in place for bank deposits. \nNo individual bank can hold more than 10 percent of the size of the \ntotal national deposits. That deposit limit can be applied to nonbank \nliabilities such that no investment bank can have liabilities equal to \nmore than 10 percent of total deposits. With this limit, we can ensure \nthat never again will the so-called shadow banking system eclipse the \nreal banking system.\n  Two other problems in the current crisis were the questionable \nquality of bank capital and the arbitrary nature\n\n[[Page S475]]\n\nof regulators' risk-based capital assessments. Lehman Brothers, in \nfact, had more than double its required capital only days before it \nfailed, in part due to a loosening of the definition of capital and in \npart due to unrealistic valuations of how risky Lehman's assets \nactually were.\n  We can eliminate those problems with a simple statutory leverage \nrequirement that is based upon banks' core capital; that is to say, \ntheir common stock plus retained earnings. Such a requirement would \nsupplement regulators' more highly calibrated risk-based assessments. \nIn short, it would provide a sorely needed gut check that ensures \nregulators don't miss the forest for the trees when assessing the \ncapital adequacy of a financial institution.\n  Finally, as many of my colleagues know, I have focused a lot on the \nproblems associated with conflicts of interest, including those at \nbanking institutions. One of the key problems is that proprietary \ntrading poses an inherent conflict of interest. Instead of seeking the \nbest prices for their clients' orders, brokers can trade against or \neven in front of them--a potential profit motive that could \ndisadvantage their customer and put them at a conflict of interest with \ntheir customer.\n  Given that, we need to think critically about how we can address the \nconflicts inherent in the modern investment banking model that place \nthe traditional businesses of merger advice and securities underwriting \nunder the same roof with proprietary trading, hedge funds, and private \nequity investments. For example, under this business model, it has \nbecome commonplace for a firm to underwrite securities and then short \nthem--or sell them--within a week to protect themselves. This and other \nproblematic practices need to be restricted. Chairman Volcker is \nabsolutely right that proprietary businesses are not appropriate for \ncommercial banks.\n\n  More to the point, it is becoming clear that we need stronger \nprotections against conflicts of interest at investment banks, which \nplay a critical role in providing clients with advice on mergers, \nequity offerings, and debt offerings, as well as in providing liquidity \nand making markets in securities.\n  Of course, there are some who will claim that all these remedies are \ntoo prescriptive; that they constitute too much regulation. It is too \nlate to unscramble the eggs, they say, so let's move on, or let's leave \nit to the regulators to develop appropriate rules and remain flexible. \nThat is the road to another financial disaster.\n  If Congress fails to impose the needed structural and institutional \nchange, the same systemic risks to our financial system remain; indeed, \nthey will get worse with each financial crisis because the Federal \nsafety net gets bigger and bigger. And when the next crisis occurs--and \nit will--the legislative pendulum will suddenly shift direction and it \nwill fall hard on Wall Street, very hard, if we and Wall Street do not \nact together in a realistic and constructive spirit first.\n  Frankly, I am always astounded that I continue to hear those \narguments about overregulation when, in fact, we have had precious \nlittle regulation, particularly since Glass-Steagall was eliminated a \ndecade ago.\n  Risk taking is a fundamental part of finance. Without risks, markets \njust do not work. But the balancing act between safety on one side and \ngrowth and innovation on the other cannot tilt too far in the wrong \ndirection. If we don't act, as sure as I am standing here, the short-\nterm trading profits on Wall Street today threaten to become the losses \nborne by the rest of America down the road.\n  As Chairman Volcker said at the Banking Committee hearing this week, \nif we do not heed his warning, the next disaster may not take place in \nhis lifetime, but it will come, and his soul will come back to haunt us \nall. The American people already know this basic truth, even if Wall \nStreet does not. They may not understand the complexities of the \nbanking system, and, indeed, only a handful of math Ph.Ds can follow \nthe complex algorithms that help create much of today's exorbitant \ntrading profits. But people do know banks are not designed to be \ntrading machines. They know banks should make their money taking \ndeposits and lending money, which in turn provides capital for growth, \ncreates jobs, and provides opportunities for more jobs and more growth. \nYou can call it populism, but you can also call it good-old common \nsense, borne once again in the lessons of hard economic times brought \nabout by Wall Street excesses. That common sense needs to be returned \nto our national financial system. We must shrink bankers' outside sense \nof entitlement and return to a more realistic vision of their role in \nsociety. Bankers are not traders, nor should they be. Bankers should be \ntoo safe to fail, not so large that we cannot permit their failure.\n  We must structurally reform the conflicts of interest that threaten \nto erupt again in crisis and great financial loss. We must build again \nthe edifices that will keep the American economy safe from financial \ncrisis for decades to come. We must do it now. Americans deserve no \nless.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S475-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S475-S476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EARNED-INCOME TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, a week or so ago we marked Earned-\nIncome Tax Credit Awareness Day, a day to highlight a vital tool for \nAmericans working their way out of poverty. These are challenging \neconomic times. The costs of food, housing, transportation and, basic \nnecessities increase while wages stagnate. We know for the last 10 \nyears, even before this recession, even in times of relative prosperity \nwhere profits were up and there was growth in the economy, most \npeople's wages were flat even though costs went up. Tuition especially, \nenergy costs, health care costs have meant difficult times for a \ndecade; obviously more acutely difficult now. That is one of the \nreasons the earned-income tax credit, one of the most important tax \ncuts for our Nation, is so important.\n  The EITC is designed to fill that gap that so many working families \nsuffer from. It provides millions of Americans, including hundreds of \nthousands of Ohioans, from Bellaire to Van Wert, from Ashtabula to \nMiddletown--provides hundreds of thousands of Ohioans earning low to \nmoderate wages, a potentially lifesaving tax credit. If you work and \nyou play by the rules but you earn low wages, the earned-income tax \ncredit can provide for your children, help you build economic security, \nhelp you extend your reach for the American dream.\n  According to a recent study, the earned-income tax credit has lifted \nmore children above the poverty line than any government program. The \nearned-income tax credit, again, is available for people who have jobs \nand get a tax credit as a result of that job. In 2005, more than 22 \nmillion U.S. households applied for the earned-income tax credit. They \nreceived on average $1,800 a household. An estimated 2.6 million \nchildren were lifted above the poverty line because of the earned-\nincome tax credit.\n  This is no handout. This is earned. It is the earned-income tax \ncredit because people in lower wage jobs are working hard and playing \nby the rules and doing the right thing. The American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act has increased the earned-income tax credit refund, \nexpanding it to help thousands more Ohioans. Approximately 875,000 Ohio \nfamilies qualify for the earned-income tax credit, but as much as 20 \npercent do not take advantage of it. They do not know about it or they \ndo not know how to apply for it. That is 175,000 working families from \nChillicothe to Dayton, from Maumee to Bryan; 175,000 working families \nin my State have earned the earned-income tax credit but they are not \nreceiving it.\n  There are millions of dollars on the table, if you will, millions of \ndollars in tax credits for Ohio's working families. These are the \ncriteria: If you earned less than $48,000 last year, depending on the \nsize of your family, you could be eligible to receive an earned-income \ntax credit of up to about $5,000. Even if your income is lower than the \nthreshold for filing taxes, file them anyway to obtain the earned-\nincome tax credit.\n\n[[Page S476]]\n\nThat is all you have to do. You earned it, you absolutely earned it, \njust ask for it.\n  I encourage people who are not sure to call my office or call the \noffices of your Senators or your Congress men and women around the \ncountry.\n  The Presiding Officer from Illinois has been very active in this, and \nhis office is available also to make sure in his State that these \nfamilies who work hard, play by the rules--maybe they are making \n$20,000 $30,000, $40,000 a year; they are struggling--can get several \nthousand dollars tax credit, money in their pocket as they work to \npursue the American dream.\n  We have seen what the earned-income tax credit can do for working \nfamilies. In Hamilton County, southwest Ohio, the Cincinnati area, a \nwoman and her three children became homeless after she lost her job. \nBut because of her work, the wages she earned, she qualified for the \nearned-income tax credit. Every dime of her $2,000 earned-income tax \ncredit went back into her pocket to help her overcome the daunting \neconomic challenges she faced--$2,000 which went, for somebody at that \nincome level, so very far.\n  An elderly couple was grateful they qualified for the earned-income \ntax credit. They used the $3,700 to cover a tragic occurrence, a \ngrandchild's funeral expenses, expenses otherwise beyond their reach.\n  There are hundreds of thousands of stories like this across Ohio and \nacross our Nation. I encourage Ohioans in Ashtabula and Bellaire and \nZainsville and Springfield and Xenia who may by eligible for the \nearned-income tax credit to visit the IRS tax site at www.irs.gov or \ncall 1-800-906-9887 and find a local Volunteer Income Tax Assistance \nCenter. Remember, if you think you might be eligible for the earned-\nincome tax credit, it is a tax credit that, if you are working and you \nare working hard and playing by the rules and you are not making a lot \nof money--not just minimum wage, but if you are not making more than \n$30,000 or $40,000 a year, even up to $48,000 year--you should call \nthat number or visit the Web site, irs.gov. The Volunteer Income Tax \nAssistance Center, or VITA, is a vital and free resource for working \nfamilies where accountants and tax experts volunteer their time to help \nyou file your taxes so you can receive the EITC.\n  In Lorain, OH, in my home county, where President Obama visited just \n10 days ago, in a program which we began when I was a Member of \nCongress, a couple visited a free tax preparation center after trying \nto do their taxes on their own. They found help; they qualified for the \nEITC. They received a refund of $5,000, which helped replace the roof \nof their house which required replacement.\n  To receive EITC, all you have to do is file your taxes. That is it. \nYou earned it, just ask for it. Spread the word, Mr. President, and all \nof my colleagues and anyone listening--spread the word about the \nearned-income tax credit. It is a bridge out of poverty that serves \nmillions of families across Ohio and across the Nation. Remember, you \nearned it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S476-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HEROIC ACTIONS OF NEVADA'S FEDERAL AGENTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay \ntribute to the heroic actions of eight Federal agents at the Lloyd D. \nGeorge Federal District Courthouse in Las Vegas, NV.\n  On January 4, 2010, an armed man entered the Lloyd D. George Federal \nDistrict Courthouse and opened fire at the Federal agents securing \nentrance to the building. The Federal agents fought to ensure the \nsafety of the employees, occupants, and visitors of the courthouse. On \nthat day, Stanley Cooper gave the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Stanley Cooper, 72, was a Court Security Officer at the courthouse. \nStanley was born in Tulsa, OK, where he began his career in public \nservice in 1960. After four years, Stanley moved to Las Vegas, NV, to \nserve in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Stanley retired \nas a sergeant after 26 years with the LVMPD. Soon after, he began work \nas a court security officer with the U.S. Marshals Service. He was a \nquiet man whose passion and dedication for serving the people of his \ncommunity was only surmounted by his love for his family. Stanley \nCooper died valiantly in the line of duty to protect the lives of those \naround him. I offer my most heartfelt condolences to the families, \nfriends, and loved ones of Stanley Cooper.\n  Alongside Stanley Cooper were Deputy U.S. Marshal Richard Gardner, \nU.S. Marshal Dave Del Berti, Court Security Officer Jack Eklund, Court \nSecurity Officer Arthur Gennaro, Court Security Officer Michael Gerrity \nIII, Court Security Officer William Sherman, and Detention Officer \nJustin Cord. Richard Gardner, 48, was treated and released for injuries \nhe sustained during the shooting. Richard serves as Deputy U.S. Marshal \nat the Lloyd D. George Federal District Courthouse. These eight brave \nmen pursued the gunman as he fled across the street to the Historic \nFifth Street School, where he was later subdued.\n  Law enforcement personnel put their lives at risk every day to \nprotect our communities, and we should all be grateful for their \nsacrifices. On the morning of January 4, these eight men showed the \nbravery, sense of duty, and valor of true heroes. Selflessly, they put \nthemselves in harm's way to subdue the gunman, preventing harm to \ninnocent bystanders.\n  I am humbled today to honor these eight men for their extraordinary \nbravery, dedicated service to the citizens of the great State of \nNevada, and the heroic measures they took to save the lives of others. \nMy thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this tragedy. As we \ngrieve, may all of us find strength in the courage and compassion shown \nby the federal agents during this tremendously difficult time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today to pay tribute \nto the brave men who literally fought off evil on January 4, 2010, at \nthe Lloyd D. George Federal Building in Las Vegas, NV. On that tragic \nday, an armed assailant entered the lobby of the courthouse with clear \nobjectives, to kill as many innocent people as he possibly could. Court \nSecurity Officer Stanley Cooper went to work that day with the same \nvision and determination he had every day; that was to keep the \nemployees and visitors to the Federal building safe as they went about \ntheir lives. Tragically, Stan was fatally wounded by the gunman as he \nfaithfully stood his watch at the security check point that morning.\n  Stanley Cooper was a quiet and gentle man who dedicated his life to \nthe service and protection of others. He retired after 26 years as an \nofficer with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and then \nchose a life of service again as a court security officer. Stan will \nalways be remembered as a hero, not only because he gave his life in \nthat one terrible moment on January 4 but also because he gave his life \nevery day in the selfless act of serving others.\n  The other court security officers on duty that day, along with \nmembers of the U.S. Marshals Service and a detention officer, acted \nswiftly and bravely to subdue the gunman and protect the countless \ninnocent lives that were in harm's way. Deputy U.S. Marshal Richard J. \n``Joe'' Gardner was wounded in the ensuing battle as he and the other \nofficers valiantly fought off the deadly attack.\n  It is with utmost gratitude that I take a moment to remember and \ncommend the life of a true hero, Officer Stanley Cooper, and to thank \nDeputy U.S. Marshal Joe Gardner, the court security officers, the U.S. \ndeputy marshals, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers, \nand all law enforcement officers who responded to the heinous assault \nat the Lloyd D. George Federal Building on January 4, 2010, for their \nbrave and courageous actions. Stan and the other officers answered the \ncall of duty that day without concern for themselves or their own \nsafety. Their sacrifice and courage will not be forgotten.\n  May God grant Stan's beloved family and friends peace and comfort in \nthis time of loss, and may He continue to protect all the men and women \nin law enforcement who selflessly serve and protect others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S476-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S476-S477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ROGELIO DARIAS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the passing of one of \nNevada's finest entertainers, Rogelio Darias. Known in Las Vegas and\n\n[[Page S477]]\n\nthroughout the world as simply the ``The Bongo King,'' Rogelio brought \nsmiles to all those within earshot with his rhythmic talents. Mr. \nDarias passed away on January 20, 2010, at the age of 93.\n  Born in Santa Clara, Cuba, Rogelio first began his storied career as \na percussionist in a band with his siblings, Pedro and Diego, at the \ntender age of eight. Their musical group, known as the ``Hermanos \nDarias'' quickly garnered the attention of music producers throughout \nCuba, and it was not long before young Rogelio was swept away to the \nbig city of Havana, where he pursued further his musical career. He \nsoon began working with Havana's most well-known musicians, such as \nMaestro Ernesto Lecuona and Chiquito Orefiche, and performing both on \nthe radio station Cadena Azul Chain and at the National Theater.\n  Rogelio's mastery of the his craft became world famous, and before \nlong he was traveling to Europe, Asia, and Africa, spreading his \n``bongo gospel'' to people of all races, nationalities, and creeds. \nNotwithstanding his world-wide fame, Mr. Darias continually sought to \nbetter himself as a musician. He spent several months living in the \nAfrica's Belgian Congo, where he studied the authentic African rhythms \ncreated by the local indigenous population. Years later he also worked \nalongside Polynesian musicians in Hawaii, as well as Japanese musicians \nin Tokyo. His love of any and all music, and instatiable appetite for \nknowledge undoubtedly contributed to Mr. Darias' seemingly endless \nmusical talents and knowledge.\n  By the 1960s, the Bongo King had arrived in Las Vegas, one of the \nworld's foremost performing arts centers. During his time in Las Vegas, \nRogelio established himself as one of the most sought-after musical \ncollaborators in the industry. His incredible beats were in high demand \nby stars such as Liberace and Charo, with both of whom he toured. \nHollywood also came calling, and as a result Rogelio performed for both \nJohnny Carson and Merv Griffin and their respective hit shows.\n  In spite of his worldwide fame and incredible accomplishments, \nRogelio Darias remained a loyal friend and family member to those who \nknew him best. His passing has come as a great tragedy to all those \npeople who depended on him for a laugh and a smile. Las Vegas lost a \nmonumental entertainer in the passing of Rogelio Darias.

Mr. President, I recommend to my colleagues a Robert Robb \ncolumn, published in the Arizona Republic, February 3, 2010.\n  In it, Robb points to the massive deficits in President Obama's \nbudget and argues that the administration has no grounds on which to \npass the blame.\n  He explains that the deficits President Obama recommends from 2011 on \nare entirely his own, driven by vast new spending, and that they are \nfar higher than historical deficits.\n  Robb writes that, even though President Obama's budget projects that \nthe recession will be over by 2011, he proposes that Federal spending \ncontinue at nearly 24 percent of gross domestic product through 2020, \nfar beyond the historical average of around 20.5 percent.\n  He also points out an enormous increase in the debt as a share of \nGDP:\n\n       After the World War II debt was reduced, accumulated \n     federal debt never exceeded 50 percent of GDP until 2009, \n     when it reached 53 percent. Under Obama's recommendations it \n     would grow to 77 percent by 2020.\n\n  Robb recommends returning spending to its historical average as a \nmeans of getting the deficit under control.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article be printed in the Record \nand urge my colleagues to consider the facts and arguments contained in \nit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Feb. 3, 2010]\n\n                    Obama Deficits Not Bush's Fault\n\n                      (By Robert Robb, Columnist)\n\n       The Obama administration undoubtedly wants the budget \n     message to be all the good things it wants to do for the \n     American people, except those who make the mistake of earning \n     too much money.\n       There's a second stimulus, rechristened a jobs program. \n     Health care reform, repositioned as an attack on the \n     insurance industry's dirty deeds. New middle-class tax \n     breaks. More spending on education. Lots more spending on \n     infrastructure and clean energy.\n       The budget is intended to position the Democratic Party as \n     the friend of the middle-class. But the message is blotted \n     out by all the red ink.\n       Obama likes to depict himself as a deficit victim. He \n     inherited a huge deficit and a deep recession. Not his fault.\n       Certainly the Republicans during the Bush years were \n     fiscally irresponsible. But within historical bounds. The \n     deficits in Obama's budget are beyond historical bounds and \n     are his alone.\n       Even with Bush's tax cuts, federal revenues in 2007 were at \n     the average as a percentage of GDP, 18.5 percent, going back \n     to 1960. The deficit was just 1.2 percent of GDP, \n     historically on the low side. Accumulated federal debt was 36 \n     percent of GDP.\n       Then the recession hit. From 2008 to 2009, federal spending \n     increased 18 percent. This was a budget year that straddled \n     the Bush and Obama presidencies. But the spending increase \n     was driven by anti-recession measures, predominately the Bush \n     stimulus and bailouts.\n       Obama supported these measures. In fact, his complaint \n     about the Bush stimulus was that it was too small.\n       This raises a question of political ontology: If Obama \n     agreed with Bush, is it still just Bush's fault?\n       The Bush tax cuts expire this year. Except for the legacy \n     costs of the Iraq war, Obama is free to recommend changing \n     anything Bush did. The deficits he recommends from 2011 on \n     are purely his own.\n       And they are massive, and driven by spending.\n       Obama purposes that the federal government spend over 25 \n     percent of GDP in 2011, compared to a historical average of \n     around 20.5 percent. He justifies this as necessary to \n     continue to fight the recession.\n       Obama, however, projects that the recession will be fully \n     over in 2011 and robust growth under way. Yet he proposes \n     that federal spending continue to be nearly 24 percent of GDP \n     through 2020.\n       In other words, rather than wind down the additional \n     recession spending after recovery, Obama is proposing that it \n     simply become a new, higher base.\n       After the World War II debt was reduced, accumulated \n     federal debt never exceeded 50 percent of GDP until 2009, \n     when it reached 53 percent. Under Obama's recommendations it \n     would grow to 77 percent by 2020.\n       If Obama were to recommend a path to return spending to its \n     historical share of economic output, in 2020 the deficit \n     would be just $255 billion, about what the federal government \n     spends each year on large capital projects, and just 1 \n     percent of GDP. In other words, not a problem. And federal \n     spending would have still increased by more than 4 percent a \n     year since 2008.\n       Instead, Obama recommends a 2020 deficit of over $1 \n     trillion and a troubling 4.2 percent of GDP.\n       Rather than recommend deficit reducing measures himself, \n     Obama wants to turn the job over to a bipartisan commission. \n     Republicans suspect a rat, an attempt to get them to support \n     even larger tax increases than Obama is already proposing.\n       They are right. Under Obama's budget, revenues are already \n     projected to be 19.6 percent of GDP, much higher than the \n     historical average. Yet he still proposes trillion dollar \n     deficits.\n       The problem is spending. Obama wants to do too much of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S477-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S477-S478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FREE GUN LOCKS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend the Wayne County Sheriff's Office on its newly announced \ninitiative to provide gun trigger locks free of charge to firearm \nowners in the Metro Detroit area. Partnering with local religious \nleaders and Project Child Safe, an organization that provides gun locks \nto law enforcement agencies, the Sheriff's Office seeks to reduce the \nnumber of firearm-related accidents that occur in the home.\n  Every year, far too many children get access to guns in homes across \nthe United States, often with fatal consequences. According to the \nCenters for Disease Control, in 2006, 154 children and teens died as a \nresult of unintentional shootings, and in 2008, 3,997 children and \nteens were injured by a firearm unintentionally. It is imperative that \ngun owners across the country safely store their weapons out of the \nreach of children to prevent these tragic accidents. Safe storage \nincludes keeping guns unloaded, using trigger locks, storing guns in a \nlocked, safe place away from children, and storing ammunition in a \nseparate, locked place.\n  Providing gun owners with trigger locks and educating them on gun \nsafety and storage has become even more important with the recent \nincrease in\n\n[[Page S478]]\n\nthe number of gun owners, specifically the number of concealed weapon \npermit holders. According to Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon, there \nare currently 41,687 concealed weapon permit holders in Wayne County. \nThere were 13,843 permit applications in 2009, up from 9,300 in 2008, \nand so far in 2010, the Sheriff's Office has seen an average of 61 \nrequests per day. In light of this dramatic increase, we must do \neverything we can to reduce the risk guns pose to children.\n  Commonsense gun safety legislation, such as mandatory child safety \nlocks, could help reduce the number of tragic accidents that kill and \ninjure young Americans. Again, I applaud the efforts of the Wayne \nCounty Sheriff's Office on their distribution of free gun trigger locks \nto gun owners in the Metro Detroit community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S478-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S478-S479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING FREYA VON MOLTKE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in memory of Freya von \nMoltke, an extraordinary woman and long-time resident of Norwich, VT, \nwho passed away this January 1 at the age of 98.\n  In 1929, at the age of 18, Freya met the young lawyer Helmuth von \nMoltke, and 2 years later she married him. Freya earned her own law \ndegree in 1935 but never practiced; law had already begun to lose its \nmeaning as Hitler and the Nazi party tightened their grip on power. It \nwas for the same reason that Helmuth gave up his dreams of becoming a \njudge and of working closer to the family estate in Kreisau, in \nSilesia, now a part of Poland. Instead, he opened a small law office in \nBerlin, where he could remain independent of the regime without drawing \nattention to himself. He and Freya divided their time between the \nfamily estate and his apartment in Berlin.\n  In the last years before the war, they traveled to South Africa to \nvisit Helmuth's mother's parents in South Africa. On those trips they \nspoke openly of what the Nazi regime was capable of, and were \nconstantly urged not to return to Germany. But they felt responsible, \nfor their broader family, the estate, and Germany's fate; they felt \nthey had no choice but to return. Helmuth's work as an attorney came to \nan end at the outbreak of the war in 1939, when he was drafted into the \nGerman army's intelligence service. Freya settled into overseeing the \nfarm in Kreisau in his absence, and the flood of letters between them \nbegan. Helmuth came home whenever he could. They welcomed their first \nson Helmuth Caspar, in 1937 and their second, Konrad, in 1941.\n  It was clear to the von Moltkes from the beginning that the Nazi \nregime was criminal, but moving from opposition to active resistance \nwas a giant step. When Helmuth told Freya that he knew he had to do \nwhat he could to resist, she gave him her complete support. Slowly \nHelmuth gathered a loose group of friends and friends of friends, \npeople who could be trusted, people who represented almost every class \nand interest group outside the Nazi party. He spent his evenings in \nBerlin meeting with them in small groups, discussing what would \neventually have to be done to undo the damage to Germany by the Nazis. \nOnly on a few memorable occasions did they all dare to meet together; \nFreya and Helmuth invited the whole group to gather for seemingly \ninnocent weekends in Kreisau. There they were able to hammer out \ntogether their plans for the longed-for day when the Nazi regime would \nfinally fall--their plans for a new Germany, a democratic Germany \nembedded in a renewed and democratic Europe. Freya not only \nparticipated in the discussions; she also took care of everyone's room \nand board.\n  Early in 1944, Helmuth was imprisoned for warning an acquaintance of \nhis imminent arrest. In July of that year, many of his friends \nparticipated in an attempt to assassinate Hitler. It failed, and many \nof them lost their lives immediately. In the aftermath, the Gestapo \nbegan to uncover the connections leading from one resistance group to \nanother, including the one they called the ``Kreisau Circle.'' Most of \nthe surviving members of the group soon joined Helmuth in prison. Most \nwere tried before the infamous People's Court, convicted, and sentenced \nto death. Helmuth himself was executed in January of 1945.\n  Between her trips to Berlin to make appeals for Helmuth's life, Freya \ntook in a growing group of their friends' widows and children at \nKreisau. In the face of the Soviet advance, she moved them all into \nnearby Czechoslovakia, only to find that it was safer to move them home \nagain. Through the intervention of British friends, she and her \nchildren at last managed to leave Kreisau for Berlin, but they soon \nleft Germany for South Africa, where Freya made her living as a social \nworker.\n  In 1956, unable to tolerate apartheid any longer, Freya returned to \nGermany. In Berlin she began her work to keep the memory of the German \nresistance to Hitler alive; she also began to transcribe Helmuth's \nletters, which, along with the minutes of the Kreisau Circle's \nmeetings, she had hidden from the Gestapo in the beehives on the \nestate. She published Helmuth's final letters from prison very soon \nafter the end of the war. In 1988, many of the thousands of letters he \nhad written her between the summer of 1939 and his death appeared in \nEnglishas ``Letters to Freya.''\n  It was in September of 1960 that Freya moved to Norwich, VT. She \nmoved to Norwich to join her close friend--and her husband's--Eugen \nRosenstock-Huessy, whose wife had died the year before. Freya lived \nwith him until his death in 1973, and after his death she founded a \nnonprofit to keep his books in print; she was president of that group \nuntil the 1990s, by which time they had over 60 titles in print. Freya \nserved for years on the board of the Co-op supermarket in Hanover, NH, \nand with friends from the Co-op board she went on to found the Twin \nPines Cooperative Housing Foundation, the first group to try to develop \naffordable housing in that part of Vermont and the first in the State \nto establish a tenant-owned housing cooperative.\n  At 75, after many years in Norwich, Freya became an American citizen \nand an active member of the League of Women Voters. At 93 she agreed to \nspeak in Berlin on the 60th anniversary of the failed assassination \nattempt, but for many years she had spoken in Vermont high schools \nabout what she and her husband and their friends had done and the need \nfor courage in the face of injustice in any society. Students from one \nschool she visited for years sent flowers to her funeral.\n  It is no simple feat for a foreigner to become accepted as a \n``natural'' part of a small town in northern New England, but Freya did \nit. In 1985, the owner of Dan & Whit's general store in Norwich ran \ninto her in the post office. He reacted to the flood of unfamiliar \nfaces by telling her, ``Let them come. We were here first.'' His \ngallant inclusion of her as a ``native'' after only 25 years in town \nmoved Freya deeply. Her own hospitality is reflected in the sign she \ntacked to her unlocked kitchen door at the age of 90: ``To Everybody! \nPlease, walk in! Push hard. Find me upstairs if I don't respond.''\n  Freya was firm in her belief that the territory Germany had lost, the \nland her family had lost, was the price Germany had to pay for the \ncrimes of the Nazi regime. But she had hopes for what had been the \nfamily estate. In 1988, a group of young people in East Germany had the \nidea of making the former von Moltke estate a place where people from \ndivided Europe could meet and get to know each other; they found \nfriends in Poland, but also in West Germany, in Holland and the United \nStates. Only a year later, a friend of their Polish friends became the \nprime minister of Poland and invited the chancellor of Germany to meet \nhim for a mass of reconciliation in Kreisau. The two men agreed to fund \nthe restoration of Kreisau, now called Kryzowa. The German chancellor \nhad invited Freya to accompany him, but she said she would wait until \nthe Poles invited her, which they soon did. In her final years, she \nlent her name and her blessing to a foundation to support the new \nKreisau, which with support from the German and Polish governments has \ngrown in 20 years from the dream of a few young people to an \ninternational meeting place that hosts about 100 events a year, \nattended by some 10,000 young people from all over Europe.\n  Freya von Moltke was an inspiration to all who knew her. She was a \nwonderful friend and neighbor, and she enriched the lives of countless \ncitizens of\n\n[[Page S479]]\n\nour State. She lived a long and fruitful life; she will be missed by \nadmirers around the world, but most of all by the Vermonters who knew \nand loved her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S479-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MIKLOS HARASZTI\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

An accomplished writer and journalist \nas well as a courageous human rights activist in his native Hungary for \ndecades prior to the end of the Cold War, he was elected to parliament \nin the early 1990s. Since his appointment to his current position in \n2004, Mr. Haraszti has been an outspoken champion for beleaguered \njournalists throughout the OSCE region.\n  Mr. Haraszti's periodic reports have proven invaluable in tracking \ntrends regarding laws, policies and practices governing freedom of \nexpression and media in the participating states. He has been vigilant \nin monitoring and reporting on issues arising from the adoption of \n``extremism'' laws in a growing number of OSCE countries. The \nRepresentative on Freedom of the Media has likewise been a strong voice \nin calling for decriminalization of defamation and a critic of attempts \nby some regimes to restrict the Internet and new media technologies. \nMost importantly, he has responded to specific urgent situations and \ncases, including instances involving the harassment, physical attacks, \nand even murder of journalists. He has never shied away from naming \nnames, he has never played favorites, and he has been a voice for those \nwhom governments would like to silence.\n  Next month Mr. Haraszti will conclude his service as the OSCE \nRepresentative on Freedom of the Media. You can write a great mandate \nfor a high-level official, but if you don't appoint the right person to \nthe job, you won't get results. Mr. Haraszti has been the right person \nfor the right job and we have been very fortunate that he has given 6 \nyears to serve the greater good in the OSCE region.\n  The OSCE participating States will be hard pressed to find an \nindividual to match his professionalism, passion, and integrity.

Hot Springs was recently \nvoted the ``Best Attraction in Arkansas'' by the readers of Southern \nLiving magazine, one of the largest lifestyle magazines in the country.\n  I have always felt a close connection to the community of Hot \nSprings. I have many fond memories of the trips to Hot Springs that my \nparents took me and my siblings on when we were young. Exploring the \ndowntown shops, restaurants, and National Park bathhouses was always \nexciting. We also spent untold hours on the area lakes boating, \nswimming, and fishing. I am pleased that I am able to continue \nexperiencing those wonderful memories with my own children, who I know \nwill someday look back on their childhood days spent in Hot Springs, as \nI have, as some of the most happy times of their lives.\n  In 1832, Congress set aside the natural hot springs site as a Federal \nreservation, making Hot Springs National Park America's ``first \nresort.'' Hot Springs provides opportunities for camping, fishing, \nhiking, and boating on its lakes and in its forests. Hot Springs is \nalso known for its vibrant arts community, with a variety of art \ngalleries and antique shops, along with the nationally recognized Hot \nSprings Documentary Film Festival and Hot\n\n[[Page S480]]\n\nSprings Music Festival. Hot Springs is also home to Oaklawn Park, which \noffers thoroughbred racing each, spring and simulcast racing throughout \nthe year.\n  I salute the residents of Hot Springs for their efforts to maintain \nthe heritage, beauty, and history of their community.

Mr. President, manufacturers across the country \nhave been hit hard in this current downturn. In fact, the manufacturing \nsector has lost 2.1 million jobs since the beginning of the recession \nin December 2007--roughly 15 percent of its total employment. That is \nwhy it is heartening to see that a small manufacturing company in my \nhome State of Maine is hiring new employees and seeking to grow its \nproduct line. Today I recognize this firm, Maine Manufacturing LLC in \nSanford, for the tremendous work it is doing to hasten an economic \nrecovery in the region by putting people back to work.\n  Maine Manufacturing, which specializes in the production of several \ndisposable laboratory supplies like filters and centrifuge tubes \nfrequently used in research and university labs as well as \npharmaceutical and biotech companies, was founded in 2008 by Craig \nCunningham, who formerly served as the director of engineering for \nWhatman Inc.'s Sanford plant. Whatman, a British laboratory equipment \nmaker that is now part of GE Healthcare, announced in September 2008 \nthat it would be shutting its Sanford plant over the course of the next \nyear, leaving over 200 employees without work. Seeking to mitigate the \nnegative effects in the local community, Mr. Cunningham and his \ncolleague, William Emhiser, requested that GE Healthcare operate the \nplant until early 2010 and keep roughly 70 employees until that time, \nallowing Maine Manufacturing to fully take over the facility. GE \nHealthcare agreed, and on January 4, 2010 Maine Manufacturing took over \nsix product lines from the company.\n  Mr. Cunningham's company started very small, with three full-time \nemployees and four part-time workers just a year ago. To grow his \nbusiness, Mr. Cunningham applied for and received a $100,000 community \ndevelopment block grant, which provided working capital to the company \nand afforded his business the opportunity to purchase critical new \nequipment. The grant also allowed Maine Manufacturing to create 12 new \njobs. To further increase its workforce, the company recently offered \njobs to 66 employees who previously worked at GE Healthcare. While \ncreating quality jobs for Mainers, Maine Manufacturing is \nsimultaneously becoming a major supplier to GE Healthcare, producing \nfilters and other parts the company uses to manufacture larger \nproducts. Additionally, the company hopes to expand even more in the \ncoming years to become a recognized leader in its industry.\n  Because the recession has hit small businesses the hardest, it is all \nthe more impressive that Maine Manufacturing has made such tremendous \nstrides in growing, expanding, and hiring over the past year. These \nfirms employ just over half of all employees in the private sector, and \nMaine Manufacturing has provided them with a model for successful job \ngrowth in coming years, which will be essential to the revitalization \nof the American economy. I am grateful for the actions of Craig \nCunningham and William Emhiser to create necessary jobs for Maine \nworkers, and I look forward to hearing future good news about their \nimpressive company.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S480-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE UNDERWATER OPERATIONS INDUSTRY\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the \nunderwater operations industry, especially the Marine Technology \nSociety and the Association of Diving Contractors International.\n  The Marine Technology Society was founded in 1963. Throughout its 40-\nplus years of existence, it has stayed true to its guiding purpose: \n``to promote awareness, understanding, advancement and application of \nmarine technology.'' Founded in 1968 the Association of Diving \nContractors played an essential role in creating the first safety \nstandards for commercial divers. The association today has member \ncompanies hailing from 41 different nations all pledging to abide by \nthe ADCI Consensus Standards for Commercial Diving Operations.\n  The commercial underwater industry encompasses the support of deep \nsea divers, ROV operators, technical support, retail dealers, the \nshipping industry, the energy industry, universities, research \nfacilities, equipment manufacturers, families, and a support system \nthat extends to all avenues of the labor market. This diverse community \nand unique segment of industry work tirelessly toward maintaining and \nsupporting safe underwater operations throughout the world. The \ncommercial underwater industry affects the development of dams, \nbridges, oil platforms, pipelines, underwater, geological research, \nouter space, and even the entertainment industry.\n  The industry is especially vital to Louisiana. From our seafood \nindustry to one of the Nation's largest provider of offshore energy, \nour waterways and shorelines are of great importance to our economy. \nUnderwater operations allow these industries to run smoothly.\n  Underwater operations conducted from the deepest seas to inland \nwaterways throughout the world are a vital component in ongoing \nindustrial development globally. It is important that Federal and State \ngovernment and citizens worldwide recognize the value of the underwater \noperations industry to the continued progress of humanity.\n  Thus, today, I am proud to applaud such an important industry, and \nthank them for their contributions to the State of Louisiana, our \nNation, and the rest of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S480-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S480-4", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S480-5", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S480-S481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests a concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2843.

A bill to combat international violence against women and \ngirls; to the Common on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nInternational Violence Against Women Act, introduced today by Senators \nKerry, Boxer, Snowe, and Collins. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor on this legislation simply because it has the power to save \nthe lives of women and girls around the world while increasing our \nsafety here at home.\n  This bill is particularly significant because it would be a very \nsignificant effort by the U.S. to tackle this egregious and widespread \nproblem. One out of every three women worldwide will be physically, \nsexually or otherwise abused during her lifetime, with rates reaching \n70 percent in some countries.\n  Ranging from rape to domestic violence and acid burnings to dowry \ndeaths and so-called honor killings, violence against women and girls \nis an extreme human rights violation, a public health epidemic and a \nbarrier to solving global challenges such as extreme poverty, HIV/AIDS \nand conflict. It devastates the lives of millions of women and girls--\nin peacetime and in conflict--and knows no national or cultural \nbarriers.\n  Women who are abused are not only more likely to face serious injury \nor death because of abuse, but are at much greater risk of dying in \npregnancy, having children who die in childhood, and contracting HIV/\nAIDS.\n  What many people don't realize though is that violence against women \nand girls is a major cause of poverty. Women are much more likely to be \namong the world's poorest, living on a $1 a day or less, and the \nviolence they face keeps them poor. It prevents them from getting an \neducation, going to work, and earning the income they need to lift \ntheir families out of poverty. In turn, women's poverty means they are \nnot free to escape abuse, perpetuating a vicious cycle that keeps women \nfrom making better lives for themselves and their families.\n  In Nicaragua, for example, a study found that children of victims of \nviolence left school an average of 4 years earlier than other children. \nIn India, it has been found that women who experienced even a single \nincident of violence lost an average of 7 working days. Sometimes, the \nworkplace itself can be a source of abuse: in Kenya, 95 percent of the \nwomen who had experienced sexual abuse in their workplace were afraid \nto report the problem for fear of losing their jobs.\n  Greater economic opportunity and earning capacity not only allows \nwomen an option of escaping violent situations, but more importantly, \nit increases equality and mutual respect within households, reducing \nwomen's vulnerability to abuse in the first place.\n  Women around the world are working desperately to change the laws and \ncustoms in their countries that routinely allow women and girls to be \nraped, beaten or deprived of any legal rights, even the ability to see \na doctor or leave the house alone. But they need our help.\n  IVAWA is a good step in that direction.\n  The bill was developed in consultation with more than 150 expert \norganizations, including the input of 40 women's groups from all around \nthe world.\n  Highlighting the cross-cutting nature of the issue of violence, the \nbill is supported by a diverse coalition of almost 200 NGOs, including \nAmnesty International USA, Women Thrive Worldwide, Jewish Women \nInternational, Family Violence Prevention Fund, CARE, United Methodist \nChurch, and Refugees International.\n  This bill would direct the State Department to create a comprehensive \n5-year strategy to reduce violence against women and girls in up to 20 \ncountries and provide vital funds to foster programs in these countries \nthat address violence in a coordinated, comprehensive way. It would do \nthis by reforming legal and health sectors, helping to change social \nnorms and attitudes that condone rape and abuse, and improving \neducation and economic opportunities for women and girls.\n  Because violence against women is often rampant in countries \nembroiled in conflict or crisis, this bill also requires that the U.S. \nact in cases of extreme outbreaks of violence against women and girls, \nlike the horrific levels of rape experienced by women in the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo.\n  This legislation is necessary because this is not an academic issue--\nwe must remember that the scourge of gender-based violence effects real \nwomen around the world.\n  But there are solutions.\n  When Dulce Marlen Contreras started her organization with seven of \nher friends, the first thing on her mind was how to help the women of \nHonduras protect themselves from domestic violence. A daughter of \nfarmers in the rural region of La Paz, Honduras, Marlen was tired of \nwatching the women of her community endure widespread alcoholism and \nhousehold abuse.\n  In 1993, Marlen founded the Coordinadora de Mujeres Campesinas de La \nPaz, or COMUCAP, to raise awareness about women's rights. The \norganization started by educating women in the community about their \nrights and training them to stand up for themselves.\n  As time went on, Marlen noticed something was missing. While \nawareness-building was critical, in order to reduce violence for the \nlong-term COMUCAP had to attack the problem at its root: poverty. ``We \nrealized that until women are economically empowered, they will not be \nempowered to escape abuse for good,'' says Marlen. Seeing this link \nchanged the way COMUCAP approached its work. It started training women \nto grow and sell organic coffee and aloe vera, helping them to earn an \nincome for their families.\n  Initially the reaction from the community was hostile--women's \nempowerment was seen as a threat to families. As COMUCAP's programs \ngrew, however, they started seeing results--the more money women made, \nthe more power they were able to assert in the household.\n  As the community started to view the women of COMUCAP as economic \ncontributors to its families, more and more women made decisions \njointly with their husbands and stood up for themselves and their \nchildren in the face of abuse. Today COMUCAP provides employment and \nincome to over 256 women in its community. Household violence has \nreduced drastically within the families of COMUCAP.\n  This example clearly illustrates that violence against women is \npreventable and that there are proven solutions that work. Even more \ninspiring, there are many thousands of local organizations like COMUCAP \nworldwide, which work within their own communities to support women in \nviolent situations, help them find ways to support themselves and \nchange cultural attitudes within their communities.\n  By supporting funding to overseas women's organizations to enable \nthem\n\n[[Page S485]]\n\nto work independently, IVAWA encourages this type of grassroots \nsustainability that will be crucial to any permanent solution to \nviolence.\n  Violence has a profound effect on the lives of women and girls, and \ntherefore, all communities around the world. As a member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, I am committed to continue to work with my \ncolleagues to fight to end it and to provide any assistance and \nresources necessary to achieve this goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2986. A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to waive interest for certain loans relating to damage \ncaused by Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, Hurricane Gustav, or \nHurricane Ike; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on an \nissue that is of great importance to my home State of Louisiana: \ndisaster recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of 2005 and \nHurricanes Gustav and Ike of 2008. Almost 5 years after these first two \ndevastating storms, our eyes are still fixed on our shores during \nhurricane season as our communities and businesses in the hardest-hit \nareas continue to rebuild. As chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I remain focused on their ongoing \nrecovery efforts and am here today to introduce a bill that I believe \nwill help these struggling small businesses become successful once \nagain and hire new workers.\n  Charles R. ``Ray'' Bergeron and his wife's Fleur de Lis Car Care \nCenter in New Orleans, Louisiana, is one of the businesses that need \nthis type of assistance. Small Business Administrator Karen Mills and I \ntoured the Bergerons' business back in June. Pre-Katrina, Fleur de Lis, \nwhich opened in 1988, had nine employees. After Hurricane Katrina hit, \nMr. and Mrs. Bergeron found themselves having to take out two loans, \none for their house and another for their small business. As of our \nvisit in June, the Bergerons were down to two employees, not including \nthemselves, and their business was back at about 40 percent of pre-\nKatrina sales, due in large measure to the population not returning. \nTheir neighborhood is mostly empty homes, which Mr. Bergeron attributes \nin part to high flood insurance premiums, high property taxes and high \nhomeowner's insurance.\n  As of June when I met with them, the Bergerons had a $225,000 SBA \ndisaster loan with a standard 30-year term, which Mr. Bergeron says he \nwill not pay off until he is 101 years old. But just yesterday, Mrs. \nBergeron contacted my office requesting SBA assistance with their loan \nrepayment after work to repair the flood-damaged roads surrounding \ntheir gas station had cut access to their business for even their most \nloyal customers. Since the project began, Fleur de Lis' sales have been \ncut almost in half. This latest challenge comes on the heels of the \neconomic downturn, which caused the station to lay off two employees \nearlier last year.\n  The Bergeron's story is one I have heard from countless businesses. \nCoupled with their recovery from the 2005 and 2008 hurricanes, and more \nrecently, the economic downturn, these businesses--the ones that took \nthe initiative to quickly reopen after the storms--are today struggling \nwith one challenge after another. Yet these ``pioneer'' businesses are \nthe ones rebuilding communities need the most because they serve as \nanchors. If residents see the Bergeron's gas station, or their favorite \nrestaurant, open, they are more likely to come back to rebuild their \nhomes.\n  To help ongoing recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast, and to give these \nstruggling businesses immediate assistance, I am introducing today the \nSoutheast Hurricanes Small Business Disaster Relief Act of 2010. I \nthank my colleague Representative Charlie Melancon for introducing the \nHouse companion bill. Our legislation would provide targeted assistance \nto as many as 22,000 businesses in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. \nWhat these particular businesses have in common is that they received \nSBA disaster loans following the 2005 or 2008 hurricanes. While they \nhave made payments on these loans, I have heard from countless \nbusinesses in my State that they could expand operations if they had \nadditional cash flow. This legislation would inject immediate capital \ninto these hardest-hit businesses by giving SBA the authority to waive \nup to $15,000 of interest payments over 3 years, helping to create or \nsave up to 81,000 jobs.\n  Under this program, SBA is required to give priority to applications \nfrom businesses with 50 employees or less and businesses that re-opened \nbetween September 2005 and October 2006 for the 2005 storms or \nSeptember and December 2008 for the 2008 hurricanes. This ensures that \nSBA first helps true small businesses and those ``pioneer'' businesses \nthat were the first to re-open after the disaster. The program would \nend on December 31, 2010.\n  This program makes a difference because for some businesses, \ndepending on the loan term and loan amount, their total principal/\ninterest payments could run as high as $1,000 per month. For example, \nfor a $114,000 disaster loan with a 4 percent interest rate and a 25-\nyear term, a business could be paying as much as $400 in monthly \ninterest. In one year, this adds up to $4,800 and almost $14,500 in 3 \nyears. While this is not a lot of money for Wall Street banks or \nFortune 500 companies, $15,000 makes a major impact for a gas station \nwith two employees, like Fleur de Lis, or a neighborhood restaurant \nwith 10 employees. These businesses have seen their bottom lines shrink \nas others on Wall Street received extravagant bonuses. I, for one, \nbelieve it is time to help these Main Street businesses, as they are \nthe backbone of our communities.\n  My legislation also follows legislation approved by a previous \nCongress. The prior bill came after Hurricane Betsy devastated Florida, \nLouisiana and Mississippi in September 1965. According to Red Cross \nreports at the time, between 800,000 and 1 million people were \nadversely impacted by the hurricane. Before this storm, the only \nprevious disaster of that magnitude was the 1937 Ohio-Mississippi River \nfloods, which forced more than a million people from their homes. In \ntotal, Betsy destroyed more than 1,500 homes, damaged more than \n150,000, and damaged more than 2,000 trailers. Hurricane Betsy also \ndestroyed 1,400 farm buildings and 2,600 small businesses. At the time, \nthe Senate Committee on Public Works noted in Committee Report 89-917 \nthat, ``The overwhelming magnitude of the vicious storm, surprising \neven to experienced disaster workers, was more apparent every day as \nstorm victims continued to register for long-term recovery help in \nrebuilding their lives and homes.''\n  As part of the review to provide Hurricane Betsy victims appropriate \nassistance, including a field hearing in Louisiana, Congress determined \nthat the massive scale of this disaster required targeted, disaster-\nspecific programs. In particular, Congress approved the Southeast \nHurricane Disaster Relief Act of 1965, Public Law 89-339. This bill \nauthorized various business, homeowner, and agricultural disaster \nassistance, including loans and temporary rental assistance. In its \ncommittee report on the legislation, which is referenced above, the \nSenate Committee on Public Works wrote, ``This bill contains what the \ncommittee believes is needed and necessary to give further aid to the \ndisaster-stricken areas . . .  including special measures to help these \nStates in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of devastated areas.'' \nAmong other provisions, Section 3 of the bill authorized SBA to waive \ninterest--for loans above $500--due on the loan over a period of 3 \nyears, but not to exceed $1,800 in interest. The bill was signed into \nlaw in November 1965 and Congress later approved $35 million to \nimplement provisions in the Act.\n  Just as with Hurricane Betsy in 1965, in 2005, Mississippi and \nLouisiana again saw a catastrophic disaster hit their businesses, \nfarms, and homes. Everyone now knows the impact Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita had on the New Orleans area and the southeast part of our State. \nImages from the devastation following these storms, and the \nsubsequent Federal levee breaks, were transmitted across the country \nand around the world. Katrina ended up being the deadliest natural \ndisaster in United States history, with 1,800 people killed--1,500 in \nLouisiana alone. Katrina was also the costliest natural\n\n[[Page S486]]\n\ndisaster in U.S. history, with more than $81.2 billion reported in \ndamage.\n\n  In Louisiana, we had 18,000 businesses catastrophically destroyed and \n81,000 businesses economically impacted. I believe that, across the \nentire Gulf Coast, some estimates ran as high as 125,000 businesses \nimpacted by Katrina and Rita. Many of these businesses, for various \nreasons, have not returned or re-opened. By mid-2007, Orleans Parish \nwas still down 2,000 employers, or 23 percent of its pre-Katrina \nbusiness level. Nearby St. Bernard Parish--which had up to 80 percent \nof its homes damaged--had the largest percentage decline of 48 percent \nfewer businesses open, according to Louisiana State University and the \nLouisiana Recovery Authority. These disasters were followed by the 2008 \nhurricanes that hit the same areas in Texas and Louisiana. With this in \nmind, on September 25, 2009, I chaired a committee field hearing in \nGalveston, Texas. At this hearing, we received a progress report from \nFederal, State and local officials on the recovery from Hurricane Ike \nin 2008. We also heard from individual business owners in Galveston who \nwere still struggling a year on from the hurricane.\n  These Galveston business owners, the Bergeron's Fleur de Lis gas \nstation, and many other ``pioneer'' businesses did choose to re-open \nand are now struggling to stay alive. As is clear from the Bergerons' \nstory, these businesses have suffered from not one disaster, but three: \nHurricane Katrina/Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav/Ike in 2008, and the \neconomic downturn. My home State of Louisiana was slow to feel the \nbrunt of the credit crunch and economic meltdown, but last year we \nbegan to see the drying up of investments and the shrinking of \nconsumers' pocketbooks. I believe the special program implemented \nfollowing Hurricane Betsy in 1965 would today greatly benefit \nbusinesses in these three states hardest hit by Katrina, Rita, Gustav \nand Ike. Given the urgent needs of many of these impacted businesses, I \nwill be reaching out to my colleagues in Texas, Louisiana, and \nMississippi to hopefully gain their support for quick passage of this \nassistance. While I recognize that these are the hardest hit states, I \nam also interested to hear from my other Gulf Coast colleagues on \nwhether this program would benefit their impacted businesses as well.\n  In closing, I would like to note that Congress has been generous in \nproviding essential recovery funds following the 2005 and 2008 storms. \nHowever, as we approach the fifth anniversary of the 2005 disasters, we \nmust now ensure that impacted businesses can make it past this \nanniversary--preventing thousands more workers from being unemployed or \nadditional defaults on SBA disaster loans. One important way that this \nCongress can ensure that these workers remain employed and that these \nbusinesses survive, and even grow, would be to relieve some of the \ninterest on these SBA disaster loans. For this reason, I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to support this commonsense legislation which would make a \ndifference for up to 22,000 Main Street business owners and their \nestimated 81,000 employees in the Gulf Coast.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the Small Business Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing the \nSmall Business Contracting Improvements Act of 2010, legislation \ndesigned to protect the interests of small businesses and boost their \nopportunities in the Federal marketplace.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have focused a considerable amount of energy \npromoting the interests of small businesses in the federal contracting \narena. The legislation I am introducing today marks a critical step \nforward in this process.\n  As the largest purchaser in the world, the Federal Government is \nuniquely positioned to offer new and reliable business opportunities \nfor our Main Street businesses. Government contracts are perhaps one of \nthe easiest and most inexpensive ways the government can help \nimmediately increase sales for America's entrepreneurs, giving them the \ntools they need to keep our economy strong and create jobs. By \nincreasing contracts to small businesses by just 1 percent, we can \ncreate more than 100,000 new jobs--and today, we need those jobs more \nthan ever.\n  But the reality is, small businesses need all the help they can get \naccessing Federal contracts. In fiscal year 2007, according to the \nFederal Procurement Data System, the Federal Government missed its 23 \npercent contracting goal by .992 percent. That .992 percent represents \nmore than $3.74 billion and 93,500 jobs lost for small businesses. The \nnumbers are even worse the next fiscal, in fiscal year 2008 the Federal \nProcurement Data System reported that the government missed its goal by \n1.51 percent--meaning more than $6.51 billion and 162,700 jobs lost. \nWhile these numbers tell the stark story of why this legislation is \nvital for our small businesses and our overall economy, they are still \nonly a part of the story of why this legislation is needed.\n  Our small businesses have been taking the brunt of this economic \ndownturn. In this past year, small businesses accounted for more than \n85 percent of job losses. This fact was vividly illustrated to me this \nweekend when I met with Louisiana business owners and officials. A \nsmall business owner who spoke at our meeting told of how he was down \nfrom 20 plus employees to three. He was clear that if he had access to \nfederal work he would begin staffing up tomorrow. That is the reason I \nam introducing this legislation today. These contracting opportunities \nrepresent job creation for small businesses in a way that is unique. \nWhen large businesses get new work they\n\n[[Page S487]]\n\ntypically spread that work among existing employees. When small \nbusinesses get these contracts they must staff up to meet the increased \ndemand.\n  Furthermore, last night President Obama made the case that small \nbusinesses need to be the focus of our recovery. I have heard over and \nover again that small business is the engine that drives our economy. \nWell, if that is true, then it is time to give that engine some gas. \nPresident Obama set the right tone last night and today our bill looks \nto act on his words and fill that tank as we consider improvements in \nfour key areas.\n  The first area I attempt to make improvements in is the area of \ncontract bundling. Although contract bundling may have started out as a \ngood idea, it has now become the prime example of the old saying that \ntoo much of a good thing can be very, very bad. The proliferation of \nbundled contracts coupled with the decimation of contracting \nprofessionals within the government threatens to kill small businesses' \nability to compete for federal contracts.\n  Our bill looks to address those issues by ensuring: accountability of \nsenior agency management for all incidents of bundling; timely and \naccurate reporting of contract bundling information by all federal \nagencies; and improved oversight of bundling regulation compliance by \nthe Small Business Administration, SBA.\n  The bill also ensures that contract consolidation decisions made by a \ndepartment or agency, other than the Defense Department and its \nagencies, provide small businesses with appropriate opportunities to \nparticipate as prime contractors and subcontractors.\n  Another way that this bill attempts to tackle the issue of bundling \nis by creating a joint venture and teaming center at the SBA. This \ncenter will provide technical support to associations and businesses \nwho are interested in bidding on larger contracts as part of small \nbusiness teams or joint ventures. The bill will also ease regulations \nthat serve as a disincentive for small businesses who want to enter \ninto teaming relationships with one another.\n  The second area that this bill attempts to address is subcontracting. \nThe Committee has heard from many businesses about the challenges that \nsome small business subcontractors face when dealing with prime \ncontractors. Business owners have related that the way subcontracting \ncompliance is calculated creates opportunity for abuse. They also \nrelated that many small businesses will spend time, money and effort \npreparing bid proposals to be a part of a bid team and that once the \ncontract is won they never heard from the prime contractor again. Many \nalso complain about a lack of timely payments after they have completed \nwork.\n  This bill attempts to deal with some of these issues by including \nprovisions designed to prevent misrepresentations in subcontracting by \nprime contractors. To accomplish this, the bill: provides guidelines \nand procedures for reviewing and evaluating subcontractor participation \nin prime contracts and provides for speedier payments to small business \nsubcontractors who have successfully completed work on behalf of the \nprime contractor.\n  The third area I intend to update is the acquisition process. This \nbill aims to increase the number of small business contracting \nopportunities by including additional provisions to reduce bundled \ncontracts by reserving more contracts for small business concerns. The \nbill accomplishes this by: authorizing small business set-asides in \nmultiple-award, multi-agency contracting vehicles; directing the Office \nof Federal Procurement Policy to issue guidelines to analyze the use of \ngovernment credit cards for the purpose of meeting small business \ngoals; and requiring that agencies include meeting small business \ncontracting goals in the performance evaluation of contracting and \nprogram personnel.\n  The last area that I tackle in this legislation is small business \nsize and status integrity. The Committee has heard from a number of \nsmall businesses about large businesses parading as small businesses. \nIt is imperative that small business contracts go to small businesses. \nSmall businesses may be losing billions of dollars in opportunities \nbecause of size standard loopholes.\n  This bill attempts to address these issues by making additions to the \nSmall Business Act that are designed to strengthen the government's \nability to enforce the size and status standards for small business \ncertification. To achieve this, the new section: establishes a \npresumption of loss to the federal government whenever a large business \nperforms a small business contract; requires that small businesses \nannually certify their size status; requires the development of \ntraining programs for small business size standards; requires a \ndetailed review of the size standards for small businesses by the SBA \nwithin one year; and directs GAO to study the effectiveness of the \nmentor-protege program.\n  It is well past time to provide greater opportunities for the \nthousands of small business owners who wish to do business with the \nFederal Government. I believe that this legislation is a good step \ntoward opening those doors of opportunity. I hope all of my colleagues \nwill join me in supporting this bill and I look forward to working with \nthem as we work to move this legislation forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2989\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as ranking Member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today, along with \nSenator Landrieu, to introduce the Small Business Contracting \nRevitalization Act of 2010. This critical piece of legislation is the \ndirect result of consensus-building and compromise, and continues the \nbipartisan tradition of the Small Business Committee. I also wish to \nthank Chair Landrieu for her partnership with me in forging this truly \ncrucial measure as we work toward contracting parity for small \nbusiness, and for her tireless leadership on all concerns confronting \nsmall businesses today.\n  The Small Business Contracting Revitalization Act of 2010 retains \ncritical procurement provisions that originate in the comprehensive \ncontracting bills I introduced or cosponsored in the 109th and 110th \nCongresses which were unanimously voted out of the Small Business \nCommittee. This particular legislation will serve to minimize the use \nof contract bundling and consolidation of contracts by the Federal \nGovernment, and increase the ability of small businesses to fairly \ncompete for such contracts through a host of key improvements, \nincluding allowing small businesses to join together in teams to bid on \ncertain procurement opportunities. Additional requirements will help to \nensure prompt payment from prime contractors to subcontractors, and \nmake it easier for the Federal Government to prosecute businesses who \nfraudulently identify themselves as small companies.\n  Since the mid-1990s, with the enactment of acquisition streamlining \nreforms and the downsizing of the Federal procurement workforce, small \nbusinesses have faced a litany of hurdles that have deprived them of \nFederal contracting dollars. One such impediment is contract bundling \nwhich takes contracting opportunities out of the hands of deserving \nsmall businesses by grouping numerous small contracts and bundling them \ninto one large award. Ill-equipped to manage the demands of these \nconsolidated awards due to a lack of resources, small business owners \nagain find themselves crowded out of the Federal contracting process. \nConsequently, the bipartisan measure we are introducing today reflects \nthe recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nto impose stricter reviews and more comprehensive reporting of bundled \ncontracts, encourages small business teaming to bid on larger \ncontracts, and promotes Federal agency publishing and use of best \npractices. Additional obstacles to successful small business \ncontracting include ``bait and switch'' tactics used by prime \ncontractors who use small firms in developing bids but do not \nsubcontract with them once a contract has been awarded. Our bill will \naddress this concern as well as other ongoing problems such as large \nbusinesses posing as small businesses, flawed reporting data, and \nagencies who fail to meet their small business contracting goals.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am further dismayed by the myriad ways that \ngovernment agencies have time and again egregiously failed to meet the \nvast majority of their small business statutory ``goaling'' \nrequirements. It is unconscionable that the statutory goal for only one \ncategory of small business--small disadvantaged businesses--has been \nmet, and that goals for the three other programs--HUBZones, women-owned \nsmall businesses, and service-disabled veterans-owned businesses--have \nnever been achieved.\n  Consider that, in 2007, small businesses were eligible for $378 \nbillion in Federal contracting awards, yet received only $83 billion. \nThis blatant failure to utilize small businesses, thus preventing them \nto secure their fair share of Federal contracting dollars, has resulted \nin firms losing billions of dollars in contracting opportunities. But \n23 percent is only a base goal--we must strive to exceed it, not just \nmeet it.\n  In the last two years alone, the Small Business Committee has held \nnumerous hearings and roundtables to identify and explain small \nbusiness' contracting concerns. In addition, the GAO and the Small \nBusiness Administration's Inspector General have issued multiple \nreports addressing small business Federal contracting deficiencies. Our \nlegislation builds on the contracting provisions of previous Small \nBusiness Committee contracting bills by endowing the SBA with \nadditional tools to meet the demands of an ever-changing 21st century \ncontracting environment.\n  That said, I am greatly encouraged by the latest statistics relating \nto Federal contracting dollars awarded to small businesses from the \nfunds appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, \nARRA. Preliminary reports show that, as of February 1, 2010, small \nbusinesses have received over 29 percent of the ARRA Federal \ncontracting dollars, well-exceeding the imposed 23 percent statutory \ngoal. This begs the question, if the Federal government can not only \nmeet but exceed these requirements for the Recovery Act, why can't \nthese goals be met year in and year out? The simple answer is they can. \nI am hopeful that this administration will make a conscious effort to \nreverse the government-wide failure to meet small business goals on a \nconsistent basis.\n  I am confident that this legislation will result in the changes \nnecessary to reduce fraud and waste while paving the way for the \nFederal government to\n\n[[Page S491]]\n\nmaximize the use of America's innovative small businesses in the \ncontracting arena. Again, I want to recognize Senator Landrieu for her \nleadership in this matter, and for her continuing commitment to the \nsmall business community.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. \n        Collins, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Gregg, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Graham, \n        Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lieberman, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2995. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish a national \nuniform multiple air pollutant regulatory program for the electric \ngenerating sector; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today Senator Carper and I have joined \nwith Senators Klobuchar, Collins, Gregg, Kaufman, Graham, Feinstein, \nShaheen, Schumer, Lieberman, and Snowe to introduce the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 2010.\n  This bill is about clean air and the effect of sulfur dioxide, \nnitrogen oxides, and mercury emissions of coal-fired power plants on \nhealth, jobs, and tourism. This bill does not address carbon emissions.\n  To me the most important aspect of this bill is that for the very \nfirst time it puts into federal law requirements that we cut mercury \nemissions by 90 percent from coal plants, which produce 50 percent of \nour electricity today.\n  This bill will reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury \nemissions from power plants by directing EPA to cut mercury emissions \nat least 90 percent through the best available technology and \nstrengthening national limits on emissions of sulfur dioxide and \nnitrogen oxides from power plants with new trading systems that will \nenable cost-effective reductions of these two pollutants.\n  For Tennesseans this is a bill about our health, it is about tourism \nin our State and it is about our jobs.\n  400,000 Tennesseans have asthma that is affected by the dirty air in \nour state. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can trigger asthma \nattacks and cause chronic lung problems. 400,000 Tennesseans with \nasthma are at a daily risk due to poor air quality.\n  The more we learn about mercury the more we understand that it gets \nin our food supply, it gets in our water supply, some of it comes from \nour coal plants and it especially affects women and children. \nNationwide, EPA estimates this bill will save more than 215,000 lives \nand more than $2 trillion in health care costs by 2025.\n  In our State, we are privileged to have the most visited national \npark in America, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park--we are \nintensely proud of it. But we want the 10 million tourists who come \nthere every year to see the blue haze that the Cherokee Indians used to \nsing about, not the smog that is produced by dirty air blowing into our \nState and some of the dirty air that we produce.\n  Finally we have become an automobile State. When auto parts suppliers \nmove to Tennessee and want to locate near the Nissan plant or near the \nVolkswagen plant, one of the first things they have to do is to get a \nclean air permit. Our State simply cannot clean up our air all by \nourselves without strong national standards to require the rest of the \ncountry to stop producing dirty air that blows into our State. So for \nTennesseans this is about our health, about our tourism and our \nmountains, and this is about our jobs.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency says the bill will only cost \nelectricity consumers about 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent increases in \ntheir utility bills by 2020. This may only be about $2 a month per \ncustomer. I think $2 a month is worth it for savings of $2 trillion in \nhealth care costs.\n  In summary, this bill helps save hundreds of thousands of lives, \nsaves trillions of health care dollars, enables communities to meet new \nEPA air quality requirements and create new jobs, and protects the \nscenic beauty of some of our greatest natural treasures.\n  Cleaner air is something we can all support and I ask my colleagues \nto join Senator Carper and me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a description of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Clean Air Act Amendments of 2010\n\n\n To reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury emissions from \n                              power plants\n\n       Sponsors and Cosponsors: Carper, Alexander, Klobuchar, \n     Collins, Gregg, Kaufman, Graham, Feinstein, Shaheen, Schumer, \n     Lieberman, Snowe.\n       Background on the Pollutants:\n       1. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a gas that can \n     quickly trigger asthma attacks, but is most dangerous as one \n     of the primary raw ingredients in particle pollution. \n     SO2 converts in the atmosphere into microscopic \n     fine particles that can lodge deep in the lungs--and increase \n     the risk of dying early, trigger heart attacks, strokes, and \n     may cause lung cancer.\n       2. Nitrogen oxides (NOX) are the key contributor \n     to ozone smog, which causes respiratory illness and harms \n     crops and ecosystems.\n       3. Mercury is a neurotoxin. High exposure to mercury can \n     harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs and immune systems, \n     especially in children and pregnant women. Also harms crops, \n     wildlife, and streams.\n       What this bill does:\n       Codifies the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) for 2010 and \n     2011--setting SO2 and NOX standards for \n     eastern states.\n       Strengthens national limits on emissions of SO2 \n     and NOX from power plants and creates new trading \n     systems that will enable cost-effective reductions of these \n     two pollutants.\n       Directs EPA to cut mercury emissions at least 90% through \n     the best available technology.\n       Why it is needed--\n       Jobs: Clean air targets promote job creation in \n     engineering, construction, and manufacturing of advanced \n     clean air technologies. Targets help communities meet air \n     quality standards, so new manufacturers can get clean air \n     permits, build new facilities, and hire new workers.\n       In Chattanooga, Tennessee, for example, it will allow more \n     auto part suppliers to build facilities near the new \n     Volkswagen plant and employ thousands of Tennesseans.\n       Health: Cleaner air means residents are less likely to have \n     chronic lung disease, asthma, or lung cancer.\n       Nationwide, EPA estimates this bill will save more than \n     215,000 lives and more than $2 trillion in health care costs \n     by 2025.\n       In Tennessee, 400,000 Tennesseans with asthma are at a \n     daily risk due to poor air quality.\n       In Delaware, over 18,000 children with asthma are living in \n     areas of poor air quality.\n       Tourism: Millions of people a year visit the Great Smoky \n     Mountains National Park to see the ``Blue Haze'' not the smog \n     from dirty air. Tennessee has over 85 million tourists visit \n     the state each year, generating over $14 billion for the \n     State of Tennessee.\n       Certainty: Clear targets provide certainty for pubic health \n     protection and for power sector investment. Predictability \n     allows companies to find the most cost-effective ways to \n     employ clean air technologies.\n       How it works: Through the use of emissions control \n     equipment, such as ``scrubbers'' on smokestacks, and other \n     technologies, the bill would require utilities to:\n       Cut SO2 emissions by 80 percent (from 7.6 \n     million tons in 2008 to 1.5 million tons in 2018).\n       Cut NOX, emissions by 53 percent (from 3 million \n     tons in 2008 to 1.6 million tons in 2015).\n       Cut mercury emissions by at least 90 percent no later than \n     2015.\n\n                                        CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2010\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Clean Air Act Amendments of 2010\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSulfur Dioxide...................

Not included in this legislation.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Voinovich, and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 2996. A bill to extend the chemical facility security program of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the law granting the Federal Government, \nfor the first time, the authority to regulate the security of the \nnation's highest risk chemical facilities is due to expire at the end \nof this fiscal year. Given the success of this law and its vital \nimportance to all Americans, I am introducing legislation today with \nSenators Pryor, Voinovich, and Landrieu to reauthorize it.\n  The U.S. is home to an astonishing number of facilities that \nmanufacture, use, or store chemicals for legitimate purposes. From \npharmaceuticals to cosmetics, soaps to plastics and all manner of \nindustrial, construction, and agricultural products, chemicals enable \nthe manufacture of more than 70,000 products that improve the well-\nbeing of the American people.\n  The chemical industry is enormous, diverse, and vital to the American \neconomy. It approaches half a trillion dollars annually in sales. It is \none of our largest exporters, with exports totaling $174 billion \nannually. It directly employs more than 850,000 people nationwide and \nsupports millions more indirectly.\n  These facilities are vital parts of our economy and society. But, to \nour enemies, they can be potential chemical weapons. Like the airliners \nof September 11th, it would only take an attack on a few, or even one, \nto cause a horrifying loss of life.\n  In 2005, as Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I held a series of hearings to examine the terrorist \nthreat to the nation's chemical facilities and the devastating \nconsequences that could arise from a successful attack. As a result of \nthose hearings, I introduced comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to \nprovide the Department of Homeland Security with the authority \nnecessary to set and enforce security standards at high-risk chemical \nfacilities in the U.S. That bill formed the basis for chemical security \nlegislation signed into law in 2006 as part of the Department of \nHomeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007.\n  Specifically, section 550 requires the Department to issue rules \nrequiring all high-risk chemical facilities to conduct vulnerability \nassessments, develop site security plans to address identified \nvulnerabilities, and implement protective measures necessary to satisfy \nrisk-based performance standards. Section 550 also directs the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to review and approve those \nvulnerability assessments and site security plans and to audit and \ninspect covered chemical facilities for compliance with the performance \nstandards. It also permits the Secretary to shut down covered \nfacilities that are non-compliant.\n  In April 2007, the Department published interim final rules, known as \nthe Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards, CFATS, setting forth \nthe requirements that high-risk chemical facilities must meet to comply \nwith the law. Among other things, CFATS establishes 18 risk-based \nperformance standards which facilities must meet to be in compliance \nwith the law. These standards cover items such as securing the \nperimeter and critical targets, controlling access, deterring the theft \nof potentially dangerous chemicals, and preventing internal sabotage.\n  CFATS, however, does not dictate specific security measures. Instead, \nthe law allows chemical facilities the flexibility to choose the \nsecurity measures or programs that the owner or operator of the \nfacility decides would best address the particular facility and its \nsecurity risks, so long as these security measures satisfy the \nDepartment's 18 performance standards.\n  Since publishing CFATS in 2007, the Department has worked \naggressively and diligently on implementation. The Department has hired \nand trained more than 100 chemical facility field inspectors and \nheadquarters staff. Indeed, by the end of Fiscal Year 2010, the \nDepartment hopes to employ more than 260 CFATS staff. And, to date, the \nDepartment has received over $200 million in funding to support CFATS.\n  Given the daunting challenges of establishing such a comprehensive \nregulatory program from scratch, the Department wisely decided to \nimplement CFATS in phases, beginning with those facilities presenting \nthe very highest security risks.\n  To determine which facilities presented the highest risks, the \nDepartment first required chemical plants that possessed certain \nthreshold quantities of specified chemicals to complete an online \nsecurity assessment--called ``Top-Screen.'' Based on the Top-Screen and \nany other available information, the Department then ascertained \nwhether a facility ``presented a high level of security risk'' and \npreliminarily divided such facilities into four tiers of escalating \nrisk. While all covered facilities must satisfy the Department's \nperformance standards, the security measures sufficient to meet them \nare more robust for those facilities in the higher tiers, such as Tiers \n1 and 2.\n  For chemical facilities that qualified as ``preliminarily high \nrisk,'' the Department required the preparation and submission of \nsecurity vulnerability assessments. These assessments enabled the \nDepartment to identify more accurately each facility's risk and, thus, \nto assign final risk tier rankings. Based on these final tier rankings, \nthese facilities must develop site security plans and submit to \ninspections or audits to ensure their compliance.\n  The men and women of the Department have processed a tremendous \namount of information in a relatively short period of time. According \nto the  Department, since establishing CFATS, it has reviewed almost \n38,000 Top-Screen submissions and notified more than 7,000 facilities \nof their high-risk designations and preliminary tiers.\n\n  As of December 2009, CFATS covered only 6,000 facilities. Some \nfacilities closed; others made material modifications that altered \ntheir risk profile. Of those remaining, the Department has assigned \nfinal tiers to almost 3,000--including all of the facilities in Tiers 1 \nand 2--and is now reviewing their site security plans.\n  Although the Department remains in the midst of implementing CFATS, \nit has generally received positive reviews for its work. The private \nsector has become a partner in the program's success. The collaborative \nnature of the program has been praised by many experts as a model for \nsecurity-related regulation.\n  Notwithstanding the Department's success in administering the CFATS \nprogram and the considerable costs that facilities have incurred in \ncomplying with it, some now want to ``swap horses in midstream'' by \nradically overhauling the law.\n  Indeed, in November 2009, the House of Representatives passed \nlegislation that would dramatically alter the nature of CFATS, \nrequiring the Department to completely rework the program and stop its \nconsiderable progress--dead in its tracks. Among other things, the \nHouse bill would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish \nnew risk-based performance standards, require covered chemical \nfacilities in Tiers 1 and 2 to implement so-called ``inherently safer \ntechnology'', IST, and allow third-party lawsuits against the \nDepartment over CFATS implementation.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the changes proposed by the House will \nin no way enhance the nation's security. They will, however, impose \nunnecessary and costly burdens on the economy and destroy the \ncollaborative public-private partnership critical to CFATS' success.\n  The House provision that would allow the Department to mandate that \ncertain chemical facilities implement IST is an example. IST is an \napproach\n\n[[Page S493]]\n\nto process engineering involving the use of less dangerous chemicals, \nless energetic reaction conditions, or reduced chemical inventories. It \nis not, however, a security measure. And because there is no precise \nmethodology by which to measure whether one technology or process is \nsafer than another, an IST mandate may actually increase or \nunacceptably transfer the risk to other points in the chemical process \nor elsewhere on the supply chain.\n  For example, it is my understanding that after careful evaluations of \nthe available alternatives, many drinking water utilities have \ndetermined that gaseous chlorine remains their best and most effective \ndrinking water treatment option. Their decisions were not based solely \non financial cost considerations, but also on many other factors, such \nas the characteristics of the region's climate, geography, and source \nwater supplies, the size and location of the utility's facilities, and \nthe risks and benefits of gaseous chlorine use compared to those \ninherent with the use of alternative treatment processes.\n\n  According to one water utility located in an isolated area of the \nNorthwest, if Congress were to force it to replace its use of gaseous \nchlorine with sodium hypochlorite, then the utility would have to use \nas much as seven times the current quantity of treatment chemicals to \nachieve comparable water quality results. In turn, the utility would \nhave to arrange for many more bulk chemical deliveries, by trucks, into \nthe watershed. The greater quantities of chemicals and increased \nfrequency of truck deliveries would heighten the risk of an accident \nresulting in a chemical spill into the watershed. In fact, the \naccidental release of sodium hypochlorite into the watershed would \nlikely cause greater harm to soils, vegetation and streams than a \ngaseous chlorine release in this remote area. Because the facility is \nso isolated from population centers, the gas released in the event of \nan accident would almost certainly dissipate before reaching populated \nareas.\n  Forcing chemical facilities to implement IST could wreak economic \nhavoc on some facilities and affect the availability of products that \nall Americans take for granted. For instance, according to October 2009 \ntestimony by the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates \nbefore the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, mandatory IST would \nnegatively restrict the production of pharmaceuticals and \nmicroelectronics, unnecessarily crippling those industries.\n  Moreover, the increased cost of a mandatory IST program could \nencourage chemical companies to transfer their operations overseas, \ncosting thousands of American jobs.\n  To be clear, some owners and operators of chemical facilities will \nwant to use IST. But the decision to implement IST should be that of \nthe owner or operator, not a Washington bureaucrat.\n  In fact, the evidence is quite compelling that many chemical \nfacilities, based on an assessment of many complex factors, have \nalready taken steps to avoid the use, storage, and handling of \nextremely dangerous chemicals in favor of safer alternative processes. \nThe Department's own data indicate that nearly 1,000 facilities \nvoluntarily adopted safer alternative processes.\n\n  Notwithstanding all of the other changes to CFATS passed by the \nHouse, the mandatory IST requirement itself will bring CFATS to a \nscreeching halt. This is neither necessary nor wise. Congress should \nnot dictate specific industrial processes under the guise of security \nwhen a facility may choose other alternatives that meet the Nation's \nsecurity needs.\n  That is precisely why Senators Pryor, Voinovich, Landrieu, and I are \nintroducing the Continuing Chemical Facilities Antiterrorism Security \nAct of 2010. Instead of directing the Department to start again from \nscratch, our legislation would reauthorize section 550 for five more \nyears. Such an extension would provide the Department with sufficient \ntime to fully implement the CFATS program in its current form. It would \nalso provide a stable regulatory environment to encourage chemical \ninnovation and industry confidence.\n  Our legislation also contains two improvements, both of which are \nbased on similar provisions from the Security and Accountability For \nEvery, SAFE, Port Act of 2006. The first would direct the Secretary to \nestablish a voluntary Chemical Security Training Program to enhance the \ncapabilities of Federal, State, and local governments, chemical \nindustry personnel, and governmental and nongovernmental emergency \nresponse providers to prevent, prepare for, respond to, mitigate \nagainst, and recover from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and \nother emergencies that could affect chemical facilities. The second \nwould create a voluntary program to test and evaluate these \ncapabilities.\n  Not only is the chemical industry vital to our country's economy, but \nalso it is the linchpin to the important advancements and innovations \nin critical fields such as science, technology, agriculture, medicine, \nand manufacturing.\n  As one of the co-authors of the first chemical security law, no one \nis more conscious than I am of the risks that attacks on chemical \nfacilities pose to the nation. The Department has done a remarkable job \ndeveloping a comprehensive chemical security program.\n  If our true intent is to secure high-risk facilities, then it is \nincumbent upon Congress to allow the Department to continue doing its \njob implementing CFATS.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL, of Colorado:\n  S. 2999. A bill to provide consistent enforcement authority to the \nBureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the United States \nFish and Wildlife Service, and the Forest Service to respond to \nviolations of regulations regarding the management, use, and protection \nof public lands under the jurisdiction of these agencies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nto improve the management our public lands by increasing the fines and \npenalties associated with violations of law--and regulation--governing \nthe use of these lands.\n  Throughout the west, and especially in Colorado, increased growth and \ndevelopment has resulted in an expanded use and enjoyment of our public \nlands. These uses have, in some cases, stressed the capacity of the \npublic land agencies to adequately control and manage such uses. As a \nresult, many of our public lands are being damaged.\n  While most users are responsible and law-abiding, some either \nknowingly or inadvertently violate these rules and damage these \nprecious natural resources, which harms wildlife, increases run-off and \nsediment loading in rivers and streams, diminishes the enjoyment of \nother users, and impacts sensitive high-alpine tundra, desert soils, \nand wetlands. In addition, as we have seen over the past decade, the \ncareless use of fire can catastrophically damage homes and habitat, and \ncan result in the tragic loss of life.\n  Often times, when these violations occur, the federal public land \nagencies do not have the authority to charge fines commensurate with \nthe damage that results. For example, under the Federal Land Policy and \nManagement Act of 1976, the Bureau of Land Management is limited to a \nfine of $1,000 no matter how great the damage. That figure has remained \nunchanged for a quarter of a century, and does not reflect the fact \nthat in many cases the damage from violations will cost thousands more \nto repair.\n  The bill I am introducing today would provide for increased fines for \nsuch knowing violations to $100,000, and possible imprisonment, and for \nother non-willful violations to $5,000. The bill is similar to one that \nI cosponsored in previous Congresses. The need for this legislation was \ndemonstrated by incidents in several states, including some in \nColorado.\n  For example, in the summer of 2000, two recreational off-road \nvehicles ignored closure signs while four-wheel driving on Bureau of \nLand Management land high above Silverton, CO. As a result, they got \nstuck for five days on a 70 percent slope at 12,500 feet along the \nflanks of Houghton Mountain.\n  At first, they abandoned their vehicles. Then, they returned with \nothers to pull them out of the mud and off the mountain. The result was \nsignificant damage to the high alpine tundra, a delicate ecosystem that \nmay take thousands of years to recover. As noted\n\n[[Page S494]]\n\nin a Denver Post story about this incident, ``alpine plant life has \nevolved to withstand freezing temperatures, nearly year-round frost, \ndrought, high winds and intense solar radiation, but it's helpless \nagainst big tires.''\n  Despite the extent of the damage, the violators were only fined $600 \napiece--hardly adequate to restore the area, or to deter others.\n  Another example was an event in the mountains near Boulder, CO, that \nbecame popularly known as the ``mudfest.''\n  Two Denver radio personalities announced that they were going to take \ntheir off-road four-wheel drive vehicles for a weekend's outing on an \narea of private property along an existing access road used by \nrecreational off-road vehicles. Their on-air announcement resulted in \nhundreds of people showing up and driving their vehicles in a sensitive \nwetland area, an area that is prime habitat of the endangered boreal \ntoad. As a result, seven acres of wetland were destroyed and another 18 \nacres were seriously damaged. Estimates of the costs to repair the \ndamage ranged from $66,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  Most of the ``mudfest'' damage occurred on private property. However, \nto get to those lands the off-road vehicle users had to cross a portion \nof the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest--but the Forest Service only \nassessed a $50 fine to the two radio disc jockeys for not securing a \nspecial use permit to cross the lands.\n  Again, this fine is not commensurate to the seriousness of the \nviolation or the damage that ensued, and is an ineffective deterrent \nfor future similar behavior.\n  These are but two examples. And these violations are not just limited \nto off-road vehicle use. Regrettably, there have been many more such \nexamples not only in Colorado but also throughout the west from a range \nof public land uses. These examples underscore the nature of the \nproblem that this bill would address. If we are to deter such activity \nand recover the damaged lands, we need to increase the authorities of \nthe federal public land agencies.\n  My bill would do just that. Specifically, it would amend the Federal \nLands Policy and Management Act and other relevant laws governing the \nForest Service, the National Park Service, and the Fish and Wildlife \nService to authorize these agencies to assess greater fines on those \nwho violate laws and regulations governing the use of these special \nlands. The bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to assess up to $100,000 in fines, or up to 12 \nmonths in jail, or both, for violations of these laws and regulations. \nIn addition, the bill establishes that any reckless use of fire on \nthese public lands shall be punishable by fines of no less than $500.\n  This bill augments another bill, S. 720, the Federal Land \nRestoration, Enhancement, Public Education, and Information Resources \nAct or the Federal Land REPAIR Act, which I have introduced this \nsession with my colleague Senator Bennet. S. 720 would authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to apply any \nfunds acquired from violations to the area that was damaged or affected \nby such violations, and to increase public awareness of the need for \nproper recreational use of our federal lands.\n  With the increase in fines established by this bill, along with the \nauthorization to apply these funds to restoring damaged lands under the \nREPAIR Act, these public land agencies could restore address impacts on \nthese public lands. Specifically, these bills would allow the public \nland agencies to repair damaged wildlife habitat, replant wetland \nvegetation, re-vegetate scarred lands, repair trails, roadways, and \nembankments to stem erosion and restore riparian ecosystems, and \ninstall barriers and other security measures to help deter violations \nin the first place.\n  Together, these bills can go a long way to giving the federal public \nland agencies the tools they need to better protect and restore these \nsensitive and critical lands for the use and enjoyment for generations \nto come. I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 3002. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nmore effectively regulate dietary supplements that may pose safety \nrisks unknown to consumers; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nDietary Supplement Safety Act of 2010 with my colleague Senator Dorgan. \nThis bill would strengthen the Food and Drug Administration's, FDA, \nregulation of dietary supplements to ensure the safety of the millions \nof Americans who use them daily. The proposed legislation would require \nmanufacturers of dietary supplements to register with the FDA and \ndisclose a full list of ingredients contained in each supplement. \nCurrently, these companies do not have to submit such information \nbefore their products are offered for sale to consumers.\n  A little over a year ago the NFL suspended six players, including two \nplayers from one of the teams competing this Sunday, for violating the \nleague's anti-doping policy. Several of the players were surprised that \nthey tested positive for a banned substance because they used a dietary \nsupplement they believed to be safe and legal. Additionally, a recent \nGAO study, GAO-09-250, found that a record number of young Americans \nare using dietary supplements naively believing these supplements are \nsafe and approved by the FDA for sale. However, FDA does not have a \npre-market approval process. In a recent article published in The New \nYork Times, it was reported that Americans spent almost $24 billion on \ndietary supplements last year. Close to $3 billion of that total is \nestimated to have come from manufactures that frequently advertise \ntheir products as alternatives to anabolic steroids, which are used for \nincreasing muscle mass and strength.\n  The current regulatory process does not adequately address the \nproblem. Manufactures of dietary supplements are not required to \ndemonstrate that their product is safe and effective before it is \noffered for sale to the public. The dietary supplement industry is one \nthat is mostly self-regulated. However, manufacturers have failed to \ndisclose to their customers key ingredients that may harm a consumer's \nhealth.\n  For this reason, the proposed bill would require manufacturers to \nregister the locations they manufacture these supplements, the products \nthey are making, and disclose the ingredients found in their products \nwith the FDA. Furthermore, dietary supplement companies would be \nrequired to provide a 75 day pre-market notice to the FDA not only for \nNew Dietary Ingredients, but for all products containing steroids, \nincluding hormones, pro-hormones, and hormone analogues, and must \nestablish that the product is safe for its intended use.\n  Lastly, the proposed legislation provides the FDA with mandatory \nrecall authority if a product is found to be unsafe or harmful. Had \nthis provision been in place earlier, the FD might not have taken 10 \nyears to ban ephedra, a dietary ingredient that accounted for 64 \npercent of all adverse reactions in 2001, despite accounting for 1 \npercent of all total dietary supplement sales. It has been reported \nthat use of ephedra contributed to the deaths of Baltimore Orioles \npitcher Steve Bechler and Minnesota Vikings player Korey Stringer. \nSadly and unfortunately, there are numerous stories of amateur athletes \nwho took this supplement and experienced serious health problems.\n  Legitimate dietary supplement companies should have nothing to fear \nfrom this legislation. These additional requirements are critical to \nthe FDA's ability to evaluate the safety of particular dietary \ningredients and to quickly identify and notify all dietary supplement \nmanufacturers and consumers of ingredients with known safety risks. \nPeople's lives and dreams have been significantly impacted by \nillegitimate supplements. The purpose of the bill is not to create a \nsweeping regulatory structure, but instead a targeted structure that \nprovides for openness, transparency and safety. All Americans should \nknow the ingredients of any dietary supplement they use and the FDA \nmust have the tools necessary to ensure the safety of all Americans.\n  I am proud that this legislation is supported by all the major sports \nleagues, including Major League Baseball, the National Basketball \nAssociation, the National Football League,\n\n[[Page S495]]\n\nand the National Hockey League. Additionally, the legislation is \nsupported by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, the United States \nOlympic Committee, the American College of Sports Medicine, National \nCollege Athletic Association, NCAA, and the PGA Tour. I hope my \ncolleagues will join these organizations in supporting this needed \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 3003. A bill to enhance Federal efforts focused on public \nawareness and education about the risks and dangers associated with \nShaken Baby Syndrome; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Shaken Baby \nSyndrome Prevention Act of 2010, important legislation that promotes \nawareness and prevention of Shaken Baby Syndrome/Abusive Head Trauma, a \ndevastating form of child abuse that results in the severe injury, \ndisability or death of hundreds of children each year.\n  Child abuse and neglect is a well-documented tragedy for some of our \nyoungest and most vulnerable citizens. According to the National Child \nAbuse and Neglect Data System, NCANDS, 794,000 children were victims of \nabuse and neglect in 2007. Babies are particularly vulnerable; in 2007, \nchildren aged 12 months or younger accounted for nearly 40 percent of \nall child abuse and neglect fatalities and children aged 4 years and \nyounger accounted for almost 77 percent. Yet even these disturbing \nstatistics may not paint an accurate picture; most experts agree that \nchild abuse is widely under reported.\n  Abusive head trauma, including Shaken Baby Syndrome, is the leading \ncause of death of physically abused children, in particular for infants \nyounger than one. When a frustrated caregiver loses control and \nviolently shakes a baby or impacts the baby's head, the trauma can kill \nthe child or cause severe injuries, including loss of vision, loss of \nhearing, brain damage, paralysis, and/or seizures, resulting in \nlifelong disabilities and creating profound grief for many families.\n  Far too many children have experienced the horrible devastation of \nShaken Baby Syndrome. A 2003 report in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association estimates that as a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome, \nan average of 300 U.S. children will die each year, and 600 to 1,200 \nmore will be injured, of whom 2/3 will be infants younger than one. \nMedical professionals believe that thousands of Shaken Baby Syndrome \ncases are misdiagnosed or undetected, as many children do not \nimmediately exhibit obvious symptoms after the abuse.\n  Prevention programs can significantly reduce the number of cases of \nShaken Baby Syndrome. For example, the upstate New York SBS Prevention \nProject at Children's Hospital of Buffalo has used a simple video to \neducate new parents before they leave the hospital, reducing the number \nof shaken baby incidents in the area by nearly 50 percent.\n  In Connecticut, a multifaceted prevention approach involving \nhospitals, schools, childcare providers, and community-based \norganizations in awareness and training activities, including home \nvisits and targeted outreach, has raised awareness and encouraged \nprevention across the state. Hospitals in many states educate new \nparents about the dangers of shaking a baby, yet it is estimated that \nless than 60 percent of parents of newborns receive information about \nthe dangers of shaking a baby. Without more outreach, education, and \ntraining, the risk of Shaken Baby Syndrome will persist.\n  With the introduction of the Shaken Baby Syndrome Prevention Act of \n2010, I hope to reduce the number of children injured or killed by \nabusive head trauma, and ultimately to eliminate Shaken Baby Syndrome. \nOur initiative provides for the creation of a public health campaign, \nincluding development of a National Action Plan to identify effective, \nevidence-based strategies for prevention and awareness of SBS, and \nestablishment of a cross-disciplinary advisory council to help \ncoordinate national efforts.\n  The campaign will educate the general public, parents, child care \nproviders, health care professionals and others about the dangers of \nshaking, as well as healthy preventative approaches for frustrated \nparents and caregivers coping with a crying or fussy infant. The \nlegislation ensures support for families who have been affected by SBS, \nand for families and caregivers struggling with infant crying, through \na 24-hour hotline and an informational website. All of these activities \nare to be implemented through the coordination of existing programs \nand/or the establishment of new efforts, to bring together the best in \ncurrent prevention, awareness and education practices to be expanded \ninto areas in need. Awareness is absolutely critical to prevention. \nFamilies, professionals and caregivers responsible for infants and \nyoung children and must learn about the dangers of violent shaking and \nabusive impacts to the head.\n  Additionally, this bill will include a study to identify the current \ndata collected on Shaken Baby Syndrome and examine the feasibility of \ncollecting uniform, accurate data from all states regarding the \nincidence rates of Shaken Baby Syndrome, the characteristics of \nperpetrators, and the characteristics of victims. It is my hope that \nhaving this information will enable us to better reach those who may be \nat risk for Shaken Baby Syndrome and, thus, prevent Shaken Baby \nSyndrome.\n  On behalf of the victims of Shaken Baby Syndrome, including Cynthia \nGibbs from New York, Hannah Juceum from California, Sarah Donohue from \nNew York, Kierra Harrison from Nevada, Miranda Raymond from \nPennsylvania, Taylor Rogers from Illinois, Cassandra Castens from \nArizona, Gabriela Poole from Florida, Amber Stone from New York, \nBennett Sandwell from Missouri, Jamison Carmichael from Florida, \nMargaret Dittman from Texas, Dalton Fish from Indiana, Stephen \nSiegfried from Texas, Kaden Isings from Washington, Joseph Wells from \nTexas, Dawson Rath from Pennsylvania, Macie McCarty from Minnesota, \nJake Belisle from Maine, Benjamin Zentz from Michigan, Chloe Salazar \nfrom New Mexico, Madison Musser of Oklahoma, Daniel Carbajal from \nTexas, Nykkole Becker from Minnesota, Gianna D'Alessio from Rhode \nIsland, Brynn Ackley from Washington, Rachael Kang from Texas, John \nSprague from Maryland, Ryan Sanders from Virginia, David Sedlet from \nCalifornia, Reagan Johnson from Virginia, Skipper Lithco from New York, \nBrittney Sheets from New York, Madilyne Wentz from Missouri, Nicolette \nKlinker from Colorado, Brianna Moore from West Virginia, Shania Maria \nfrom Massachusetts, Dayton Jones from Pennsylvania, Breanna Sherer from \nCalifornia, Evelyn Biondo from New York, Kenneth Hardy from \nPennsylvania, Alexis Vazquez from Florida, Joshua True from Washington, \nStephen David from California, Michael Blair from Arkansas, Olivia \nThomas from Ohio, Kaleb Schwade from Florida, Aiden Jenkins from \nPennsylvania, Isabella Clark from Pennsylvania, Aaron Cherry from \nTexas, Dominic Morelock from Ohio, Emmy Cole from Maine, Chelsea Forant \nfrom Massachusetts, Joshua Cross from Ohio, Gavin Calloway from \nMaryland, Christopher Daughtrey from North Carolina, McKynzee Goin from \nOregon, Bryce McCormick from Florida, and many other innocent lives \nlost or damaged, I look forward to working with my colleagues to see \nthat this legislation becomes law so that we can expand efforts to \neradicate Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN:\n  S. 3004. A bill to require notification to and prior approval by \nshareholders of certain political expenditures by publicly traded \ncompanies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, last month, the Supreme Court ruled \nthat corporations, U.S. or multinational, are equivalent to people and \nshould be able to spend an unlimited amount of company money on \npolitical campaigns.\n  I bet the framers of our constitution could not only tell the \ndifference between businesses and people, but could predict the result \nif businesses are permitted to spend without limit to elect their \nfavorite politicians.\n  The top three Fortune 500 companies brought in an average profit of \nmore than $27 billion last year. The average Ohio household brought \nhome an income of about $48,000.\n\n[[Page S496]]\n\n  If you believe our government should be by the people and for the \npeople--flesh and blood people--then corporations already have far more \ninfluence on our political process than they should.\n  In 2009, corporations spent $3.3 billion lobbying Congress to \ninfluence insurance legislation and prescription drug legislation and \nfinancial reform legislation and the list goes on. Now they will be \nable to spend unlimited funds to elect their favorite candidates to \nCongress, getting in on the ground floor in the hopes that legislation \nthey don't like will never see the light of day.\n  Grassroots organizations like, conservative organization and Families \nUSA, whose members are real people with real concerns, will be left in \nthe dust by the drug industry and other deep pocketed special \ninterests.\n  The bottom-line is that our democratic form of government will sit on \na cushion of corporate cash. If Corporate America wants to decide who \nruns our country, they will have a billion ways to do it.\n  Congress has--and must exercise--its constitutionally granted \nauthority to minimize the negative impact of this decision. Today, I \nintroduced The Citizens Right to Know Act, legislation that is intended \nto reduce the incentive for corporations to buy out the political \nprocess. It would also put a stop to foreign influence on U.S. \nelections.\n  To protect shareholder investments, this legislation would require \nall the shareholders of a corporation to vote for election spending \nbefore it happens, with approval by a majority of shareholders. Each \nshareholder would get one vote per share of common stock held. If \nshareholders know that millions or billions in potential dividends are \nabout to be spent on campaign ads, they may help instill some reason \ninto the, elected, leadership of the corporations they own.\n  It would also require corporate CEOs to do what political candidates \ndo when they pay for political advertising: political candidates face \nthe camera and tell the public that they sponsored the commercial. \nCorporate CEOs would have to do the same for their political \nadvertisements. Issue organizations or trade groups would have to \ndisclose their three top corporate contributors, and to disclose \nfunding information for certain radio and print ads on their website. \nShedding sunlight on the political shenanigans of billion dollar \ncorporations may do a world of good in dampening the effects of their \nspending.\n  Finally, the bill would close a loophole that permits foreign \ninvestors, including foreign governments, to influence U.S. elections \nby channeling money through a U.S. affiliate. Any company that has a 51 \npercent or greater ownership stake from a foreign entity, be it a \nforeign individual, business association, or government, would be \nprohibited from spending money to influence. I think we can all agree \nthat foreign governments should not have the same right to contribute \nto campaigns as the American people, and it would be outrageous if they \ncould spend money to influence the outcome of the Presidential or any \nother race.\n  Americans--true, red blooded Americans--should decide who represents \nthem in our democratic system. Billion dollar corporations make \nimportant contributions to our nation, but tilting our democratic \nsystem their way is not one of them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 3005. A bill to create an independent research institute, to be \nknown as the ``National Institute of Finance'', that will oversee the \ncollection and standardization of data on financial entities and \nactivities, and conduct monitoring and other research and analytical \nactivities to support the work of the Federal financial regulatory \nagencies and the Congress; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the National Institute of \nFinance Act of 2010, which would create an Institute to provide our \nfinancial regulators with the data and analytic tools needed to prevent \nand contain future financial crises.\n  By establishing this new Institute, my bill offers the foundation for \na new approach to financial regulation that would better protect \nAmericans from the financial storm they are currently struggling \nthrough.\n  Over the past 18 months, we have learned that our regulators did not \nhave the appropriate tools or knowledge to address risks that cut \nacross different markets and sectors of the financial system. The \nrecently passed House financial regulatory reform bill and other \nproposals take an important step in filling this huge regulatory gap by \nestablishing centralized systemic risk oversight. However, any new \nregulatory structure will be ineffective unless we also equip it with a \nstrong, independent, and well-funded data, research, and analytic \ncapacity to fulfill its mission.\n  The idea for the National Institute of Finance has been endorsed by a \ndedicated group of the Nation's top academic researchers, economists, \nand statisticians--including Nobel Laureate Harry Markowitz--who \nrecognize that any financial regulatory reform is incomplete without a \nmuch stronger data, research, and analytic capability.\n  To further explore these issues, I asked the National Academy of \nSciences in August to study the data and tools needed for systemic risk \nregulation. Among the Academy's findings: that the U.S. currently lacks \nthe technical tools to monitor and manage systemic financial risk with \nsufficient comprehensiveness and precision. That market efficiency, in \naddition to regulatory capacity, would be enhanced by improved \nintelligence about what is going on in the system as a whole. And that \nexisting capabilities are not a sufficient foundation for systemic risk \nmanagement.\n\n  The bill I introduce today addresses these significant weaknesses by \ncreating the National Institute of Finance, whose mission will be to \nsupport the community of financial regulatory agencies by collecting \nand standardizing the reporting of financial market data; performing \napplied and essential long-term research; and developing tools for \nmeasuring and monitoring systemic risk.\n  The Institute would house a data center that would collect, validate \nand maintain key data to perform its mission, including a central \ndatabase to map the interconnections between financial institutions, \nalong with details on their transactions and positions, and their \nvaluation of their assets and liabilities. By working with banks and \nother firms to standardize the format of such data and by providing \nstandard reference data, such as databases of legal entities and \nfinancial products, the Institute would reduce the costs to regulators \nand financial institutions from the currently fragmented and \ndisorganized systems used to collect and store such information.\n  Second, the Institute would contain a research and analysis center to \ndevelop the needed metrics and then measure and monitor systemic risk \nposed by individual firms and markets. This new Institute would house \nsome of the country's most-well-respected researchers to collect and \nanalyze the data needed to understand what is happening in our \nfinancial markets, to conduct investigations of market disruptions, and \nto work with regulators to identify new and dangerous trends.\n  It would conduct and help coordinate applied research on financial \nmarkets and systemic risk, a field that is not well-represented right \nnow at the Federal Reserve or within our other regulatory agencies. It \nwould also develop the metrics and tools our regulators need to measure \nand monitor systemic risk and help policymakers by conducting studies \nand providing advice on the impact of government policies on systemic \nrisk.\n  Finally, the Institute would provide independent periodic reports to \nCongress on the state of the financial system, ensuring that we are \nkept apprised of the overall picture of our markets more effectively \nthan we have been in the past. The domino effect caused by the \nrecession will continue to cripple Rhode Island families and Americans \nacross the country unless we put in place a strong new infrastructure \nand shore up our financial markets.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in strengthening our financial \nsystem by cosponsoring this legislation and supporting its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S497]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3005\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``National \n     Institute of Finance Act of 2010''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States is experiencing the worst economic \n     and financial crisis since the Great Depression. The nature \n     of the current crisis is systemic. It was set in motion not \n     by the actions of any single entity, but by a loss of \n     confidence throughout the financial system as a whole.\n       (2) Such catastrophic events revealed significant \n     shortcomings in the legal tools available to financial \n     policymakers. The scale and systemic nature of the crisis \n     calls for a thorough review of the United States' system of \n     financial regulation, to assess its capacity to understand, \n     monitor, and respond to systemic threats. It is critical that \n     financial regulators have the legal tools they need to act \n     quickly, decisively, effectively, and when appropriate, \n     preemptively, to prevent systemic financial crises in the \n     future and to mitigate their negative impact, should they \n     recur.\n       (3) The recent catastrophic events in financial markets \n     also revealed significant gaps in the information and \n     analytic tools available to regulators and policymakers \n     charged with ensuring the health of the financial system.\n       (4) Systemic risk involves interactions among financial \n     entities in addition to features of individual firms. \n     Therefore, to understand and monitor the buildup of systemic \n     risk in the financial system requires information about such \n     interactions among institutions.\n       (5) Operational methods do not exist by which to measure \n     systemic risks in the United States financial system. Nor do \n     proven operational techniques exist by which regulators can \n     identify the buildup of systemic risks in the United States \n     financial system.\n       (6) Regulators do not have effective methodologies for \n     assessing the effects of particular regulatory actions or \n     approaches on the overall health of the financial system.\n       (7) Financial regulators do not have the data needed to map \n     the networks of counterparty relationships through which \n     systemic contagion could spread. Nor do they have the \n     analytic tools required to translate such data into useful, \n     actionable information.\n       (8) Notwithstanding noteworthy efforts from the research \n     community, sustained, large-scale programs of applied \n     research and development necessary to create operational \n     systems for understanding, measuring, and monitoring systemic \n     risk in financial systems have not emerged.\n       (9) There is a substantial amount of high-quality research \n     in academia in relevant disciplines, including financial \n     economics, statistics, and operations research, but such \n     research tends to focus on theoretical or conceptual \n     innovations that are not immediately reducible to operational \n     practice.\n       (10) The incentives confronting academic researchers work \n     against the production of research that does not yield novel \n     theoretical insights or computational techniques.\n       (11) The challenges of gaining access to data and obtaining \n     funding from government and industry for academic research \n     severely restrict the number of academics working on \n     understanding and monitoring systemic risk in the financial \n     markets.\n       (12) Some of the largest commercial firms make substantial \n     investments in research and development in the area of \n     quantitative finance, but such commercial research programs \n     are targeted almost exclusively at applications that create \n     commercial value for the firms undertaking the substantial \n     investments necessary to support the programs, and focus \n     primarily on techniques for pricing particular financial \n     instruments and managing firm-specific risks.\n       (13) Financial institutions that sponsor research programs \n     usually protect the results of investigations as commercial \n     trade secrets. Even those results that might be useful in \n     application to the analysis of systemic risk are generally \n     not available to the public.\n       (14) No organization anywhere has access to the \n     comprehensive transaction-level data that are necessary to \n     map the network of counterparty relationships in the \n     financial system. Absent such data, it is not possible to \n     evaluate the primary counterparty risks, the extent to which \n     any given firm is vulnerable to the failure of one of its \n     counterparties, or broader counterparty network risks.\n       (15) It is not possible to understand, assess, or predict \n     how the collapse of one or more institutions might set off a \n     cascade of failure that destabilizes the entire financial \n     system.\n       (16) Without intelligence about the network of counterparty \n     relationships and the liquidity provided by the members of \n     the counterparty network, it is difficult even to identify \n     reliably the set of institutions that regulators should deem \n     to be systemically important.\n       (17) Notwithstanding statutory mandates that call for \n     sharing of information among regulatory agencies, United \n     States financial regulators do not require that firms report \n     data in a uniform standard format. The lack of compatibility \n     in the data formats used by different agencies implies in \n     practice that agencies find it difficult and expensive to \n     integrate data from multiple sources.\n       (18) In periods of financial crisis such as that \n     experienced in the 2 years preceding the date of enactment of \n     this Act, absence of data comparability becomes a critical \n     handicap, in that dispersed information cannot quickly be \n     integrated into a comprehensive framework that could help \n     reveal the condition of the financial system as a whole. \n     Without a capacity quickly to compare and integrate financial \n     data of diverse types from multiple sources, regulators are \n     unable to analyze the state of the financial system \n     accurately and comprehensively. Nor are they able to foresee, \n     and potentially head off, the onset of a financial crisis.\n       (19) The events of September 2008 offer a sobering example \n     of the consequences that can flow from an inability quickly \n     to integrate financial data from diverse sources. During \n     several critical days in that month, senior Government \n     officials contemplated the possible consequences of allowing \n     the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. Insofar as the \n     content of their deliberations is accessible in the public \n     record, there is little evidence that such officials had at \n     their disposal an intelligence system that could illuminate \n     the potential consequences of alternative choices. \n     Notwithstanding that the United States Government, through \n     its several agencies, collects a broad range of information \n     from financial firms, the events of September 2008 revealed \n     that, at this most critical juncture, these data and \n     accompanying analytics could not provide financial officials \n     with the information they needed.\n       (20) The creation of a system for collecting and organizing \n     a comprehensive financial transaction database that employs \n     standardized formats is feasible.\n       (21) The Enterprise Data Management Council, an industry \n     consortium, is on record as advocating both the feasibility \n     and desirability of bringing uniform standards to the \n     collection, reporting, and management of financial \n     transaction data.\n       (22) A leading financial firm has developed for its \n     internal use a system that incorporates comprehensive \n     reference databases of all legal entities in its counterparty \n     network and of all of the many types of financial instruments \n     in which it transacts. Using the system, the firm can compute \n     its exposure to many of their counterparties within an hour.\n       (23) A leading information technology firm has developed a \n     prototype of an operational system that would support a \n     comprehensive database of financial instruments and \n     transactions across the entire economy, and in collaboration \n     with other private sector firms and public sector entities, \n     is in the process of developing a prototype system for \n     maintaining the needed system-wide reference databases.\n       (24) The community of financial regulators can realize \n     substantial benefits by consolidating into one entity the \n     highly technical tasks of establishing and maintaining \n     uniform standards for reporting financial data, organizing \n     and managing high-volume flows of financial data, providing \n     analytic and high performance computational services, \n     performing applied research and development activities, and \n     conducting, coordinating, and sponsoring essential long term, \n     fundamental research in the field of financial analysis and \n     regulatory intelligence.\n       (25) Such technical tasks benefit from increasing economies \n     of scale, the total cost of providing such services to the \n     regulatory community promises to be lower if one agency is \n     tasked to provide all of such data, instead of creating \n     redundant and less effective units in each of the several \n     financial regulatory agencies.\n       (26) An entity that provides access to data and analytic \n     tools to all regulatory agencies on a common basis would help \n     to ensure that all agencies are receiving accurate, \n     consistent, comparable data and analytic tools that can be \n     modified for agency-specific needs.\n       (27) The creation of an entity that creates shared data and \n     analytic services will provide a natural and regular vehicle \n     for the exchange of research and collaboration between \n     regulatory agencies.\n       (28) The emergence of uniform standards for referencing and \n     reporting financial transactions would generate substantial \n     benefits for the financial services industry. There is, at \n     present, no consistent, comprehensive, and universal system \n     for coding, transmitting, and storing financial transaction \n     data. Data reside typically in unconnected databases and \n     spreadsheets, using multiple formats and inconsistent \n     definitions. The routine conduct of business obliges firms to \n     incur substantial costs to translate and transfer data among \n     otherwise incompatible systems. In addition, this data \n     incomparability impedes the ability of companies to assess \n     their risks accurately. The adoption of a common language for \n     data coding and handling would dramatically reduce costs for \n     processing transactions and carrying out other administrative \n     tasks. Standardized reporting would also enable firms to map \n     their counterparty relationships more clearly and more easily \n     understand their\n\n[[Page S498]]\n\n     credit exposures to other firms, a development that promises \n     improvements in risk management practices across the \n     industry.\n       (29) In August 2008, the Counterparty Risk Management \n     Policy Group called for the financial industry to move \n     rapidly toward real-time reconciliation and confirmation of \n     financial transactions. Industry experts believe that this \n     change would yield substantial benefits to firms \n     individually, to the financial services industry, and to the \n     economy as a whole. Achieving this goal would not be \n     possible, however, without industry-wide adoption of common \n     standards for coding and handling financial transaction data. \n     Despite the clear benefits of data standardization and \n     despite years of effort by the industry, through consortia \n     such as the Enterprise Data Management Council, the financial \n     services industry has not been able to make meaningful \n     progress towards the goal of universal adoption of uniform, \n     consistent standards for data handling.\n       (30) Efforts to see a common set of standards for financial \n     data adopted universally are impeded by so-called ``network \n     effects''. The benefits of adoption for any one firm depend \n     on the extent to which other firms adopt the same common \n     language. For any one institution, the full benefits are \n     distinctly limited until a critical number of participants in \n     the industry adopt the same standards. In light of these \n     network effects, the adoption of a single data handling \n     standard by all industry participants presents a daunting \n     coordination challenge. Each individual firm is discouraged \n     from making the substantial investments required to upgrade \n     its own systems, unless and until they receive assurance that \n     others in the industry will follow suit. Many firms are \n     deferring significant upgrades to their systems until well-\n     defined industry-wide standards are accepted.\n       (31) The financial services industry's historical \n     experience strongly suggests that the industry is unlikely to \n     achieve universal adoption of a single data-handling standard \n     on its own initiative, through either the decentralized \n     actions of industry participants or through voluntary \n     coordination at the urging of industry consortia or trade \n     associations. Standardization of financial data will require \n     an external mandate.\n       (32) The new data standards promulgated for reporting by \n     firms will emerge as the de facto standard for data \n     management in the finance industry, a standard on which firms \n     could converge. Firms could then be confident of realizing a \n     significant return on the investment needed to update their \n     internal systems, knowing that other industry participants \n     were doing likewise.\n       (33) The establishment of Federal requirements for the \n     maintenance and provision of reference databases and \n     reporting of transactions and position data to a central \n     repository would assure individual institutions of a \n     significant return on the investment needed to update their \n     internal systems. Firms would benefit from not having to \n     maintain their own unique reference databases, standardized \n     reporting would greatly reduce the cost of reconciling trades \n     and other back office activities, and it would give firms a \n     clear map of their counterparty relationships, which would \n     facilitate better risk management across the industry.\n       (34) Once achieved, the universal adoption of standard \n     protocols for handling financial transaction data promises to \n     generate significant and sustained improvements in the \n     efficiency and productivity of the financial services \n     industry in the United States. Such improvements will help to \n     secure and maintain the international leadership position of \n     United States capital markets.\n       (35) United States regulators must never again find \n     themselves confronting a financial crisis without the full \n     set of legal, data, and analytic tools they need to \n     understand, measure, monitor, and respond intelligently to \n     systemic risks that threaten the stability (of the United \n     States financial system.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that the financial regulatory community is \n     equipped fully with the data and analytic tools it needs to \n     fulfill its responsibility to safeguard the United States \n     financial system;\n       (2) to reduce the likelihood of another systemic financial \n     crisis occurring;\n       (3) to restore integrity and confidence to the financial \n     markets of the United States;\n       (4) to provide for the security of the United States \n     economy from potential external threats to the United States \n     financial system;\n       (5) to improve the efficiency of the financial markets in \n     the United States;\n       (6) to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of \n     coordinated financial regulation in the United States;\n       (7) to help maintain the leadership position of the United \n     States as home to the most efficient, competitive, and \n     productive capital markets in the world; and\n       (8) to help restore and maintain conditions in the United \n     States financial system that will support the creation of \n     wealth and prosperity in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FINANCE; \n                   ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is established the National \n     Institute of Finance, which shall be an independent \n     establishment, as that term is defined in section 104 of \n     title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) Mission.--The mission of the Institute is to support \n     the Federal financial regulatory agencies, including any \n     systemic risk council or agency established by Congress, by--\n       (A) collecting and providing data;\n       (B) standardizing the types and formats of data reported \n     and collected;\n       (C) performing applied research and essential long-term \n     research;\n       (D) developing tools for risk measurement and monitoring;\n       (E) performing other related services; and\n       (F) making the results of its activities available to \n     financial regulatory agencies.\n       (b) Director.--\n       (1) Appointment.--The Institute shall be headed by a \n     Director, who shall be appointed by the President, by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (2) Term of service.--The Director shall serve for a term \n     of 15 years.\n       (3) Executive level and pension.--The position of the \n     Director shall be at level II of the Executive Schedule, and \n     a Director who serves a full term, or becomes disabled and \n     unable to fulfill the responsibilities of the Director after \n     serving at least 10 years, shall receive a pension at \n     retirement equal to the salary of that person in the last \n     year of the term, and that pension shall increase in \n     subsequent years with the increase in the cost of living.\n       (4) Vacancy.--In the event that a successor is not \n     nominated and confirmed by the end of the term of service of \n     a Director, the Director may continue to serve until such \n     time as the new Director is appointed and confirmed.\n       (5) Prohibition on dual service.--The individual serving in \n     the position of Director may not, during such service, also \n     serve as the head of any financial regulatory agency.\n       (6) Responsibilities, duties and authority.--The Director \n     shall have sole discretion to fulfill the responsibilities \n     and duties and exercise the authorities described in this \n     Act, except in cases where specific authorities have been \n     given to the Board of Directors.\n       (c) Board of Directors.--The Board of Directors of the \n     Institute shall be comprised of the Director, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury, and the head of each financial regulatory \n     agency.\n       (d) Membership of the Director on the Board of Directors.--\n     The Director shall serve as a voting member of the Board of \n     Directors and as a member of any financial systemic risk \n     regulatory council or agency established by Congress.\n       (e) Funding.--\n       (1) Annual budget.--The Director, in consultation with the \n     Board of Directors shall establish the initial annual budget. \n     For all other annual budgets, the Director shall submit an \n     annual budget for the Institute to the Board of Directors not \n     later than April 30 of each year. The Board of Directors may, \n     without amendment, reject the budget with a two-thirds \n     majority vote. Each time a budget is rejected, the Director \n     shall submit a revised budget to the Board of Directors \n     within 60 days, and the Board of Directors may, without \n     amendment, reject the budget with a two-thirds majority vote. \n     If the Board of Directors fails to reject the budget within \n     60 days of submission by the Director, the budget shall be \n     automatically approved. If a new budget is not approved \n     before the existing budget expires, the most recent approved \n     budget shall continue on a pro rata basis. Each submitted \n     budget and all votes by the Board of Directors on each budget \n     shall be part of the public record of the Board of Directors.\n       (2) Assessments.--The Institute shall be funded through \n     assessments on the financial entities required to report data \n     to the Institute.

Res. 408\n\n       Whereas women's athletics are one of the most effective \n     avenues available for the women of the United States to \n     develop self-discipline, initiative, confidence, and \n     leadership skills;\n       Whereas sports and fitness activities contribute to \n     emotional and physical well-being;\n       Whereas women need strong bodies as well as strong minds;\n       Whereas the history of women in sports is rich and long, \n     but there has been little national recognition of the \n     significance of the athletic achievements of women;\n       Whereas the number of women in leadership positions as \n     coaches, officials, and administrators has declined \n     drastically since the passage of title IX of the Education \n     Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-318; 86 Stat. 373);\n       Whereas there is a need to restore women to leadership \n     positions in athletics to ensure a fair representation of the \n     abilities of women and to provide role models for young \n     female athletes;\n       Whereas the bonds built between women through athletics \n     help to break down the social barriers of racism and \n     prejudice;\n       Whereas the communication and cooperation skills learned \n     through athletic experience play a key role in the \n     contributions of an athlete to her home, workplace, and \n     society;\n       Whereas women's athletics has produced such winners as Flo \n     Hyman, whose spirit, talent, and accomplishments \n     distinguished her above others and who exhibited the true\n\n[[Page S501]]\n\n     meaning of fairness, determination, and team play;\n       Whereas parents feel that sports are equally important for \n     boys and girls and that sports and fitness activities provide \n     important benefits to girls who participate;\n       Whereas early motor-skill training and enjoyable \n     experiences of physical activity strongly influence life-long \n     habits of physical fitness;\n       Whereas the performances of female athletes in the Olympic \n     Games are a source of inspiration and pride to the people of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the athletic opportunities for male students at the \n     collegiate and high school levels remain significantly \n     greater than those for female students; and\n       Whereas the number of funded research projects focusing on \n     the specific needs of women athletes is limited and the \n     information provided by these projects is imperative to the \n     health and performance of future women athletes: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates February 3, 2010, as ``National Women and \n     Girls in Sports Day''; and\n       (2) encourages State and local jurisdictions, appropriate \n     Federal agencies, and the people of the United States to \n     observe ``National Women and Girls in Sports Day'' with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to submit the National Women and \nGirls in Sports Day resolution. As we celebrate the 24th anniversary of \nNational Girls and Women in Sports Day, I am pleased to be joined by \ncolleagues, Senator Murray, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Bingaman.\n  The celebration of National Girls and Women in Sports Day began in \nremembrance of Olympic volleyball player Flo Hyman for her athletic \nachievements and her commitment to ensuring equality for women's \nsports. Tragically, Hyman died of Marfan's Syndrome in 1986 while \ncompeting in a volleyball tournament. In that same year, I introduced a \njoint resolution commemorating the first National Women in Sports Day \nin 1987. With today marking the 24th anniversary of this celebration, \nwe continue to honor all girls and women, recognizing past and current \nachievements in athletics, as well as the positive influence of sports \nparticipation and the continuing struggle for equality and access for \nwomen in sports.\n  We undoubtedly have a plethora of women athletes who deserve our \nadmiration and appreciation with the upcoming 2010 Winter Olympics in \nVancouver. Just a few weeks ago, the most decorated female skier in \nU.S. history Lindsey Vonn was named the 2009 Sports Woman of the Year \nby the United States Olympic Committee. That remarkable achievement \noccurred on the heels of earning the distinction of Female Athlete of \nthe Decade by NBC's Universal Sports. While her athletic talent alone \nmake both these awards certainly well-deserved, Ms. Vonn is also widely \nrespected for her indomitable tenacity and resilience: In the 2006 \nOlympic Winter Games she continued her race despite a horrific crash \nand earned the Olympic Spirit Award. No doubt she will carry her \n``Olympic Spirit'' in this year's competition as well.\n  It is clear that while we celebrate the tremendous progress women's \nsports have made since the commencement of National Girls and Women in \nSports Day, we cannot sit on the sidelines. As reflected in this year's \ntheme, ``Stay Strong, Play On'', we must continue to build on the \noutstanding successes in sports participation by girls and women over \nthe past several decades. Again, I applaud the girls and women across \nthe state of Maine and our country for their participation and \nleadership in athletics as we celebrate National Girls and Women in \nSports Day--today and every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S501-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 409--CALLING ON MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT IN UGANDA \n   TO REJECT THE PROPOSED ``ANTI-HOMOSEXUALITY BILL'', AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cardin, and Ms. Collins) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, first I wanted to say a few words to welcome \nour new colleague, Scott Brown, who has joined our ranks as a Member of \nthe Senate from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I wasn't able to be \nhere at 5 p.m. when he was sworn into office, but I wish him the very \nbest. I had a good conversation with him a couple weeks ago after his \nelection and look forward to serving with him.\n  I rise this evening to honor a good friend and a legendary public \nservant. Although he only served here a short time, Paul Kirk has been \na public servant for decades. I wish to tell him and his wife Gail and \ntheir family what a remarkable contribution in a few short weeks Paul \nKirk has made as a Member of the Senate.\n  Paul is an American who will never get the kind of attention he \ndeserves for the rich life of public service he has led throughout his \ncareer. That won't bother him one bit because that is who Paul Kirk is. \nFor over half a century, he has been motivated not by a desire to seek \nrecognition or to receive it but by a passion for progress and a deep \nlove of his own country.\n  Paul came to Washington last fall with the impossible task of \nsucceeding our dear friend Ted Kennedy as Senator from Massachusetts. \nPaul did so not in the hopes of filling Teddy's shoes but in continuing \nto blaze the path forward that Ted Kennedy forged more than four \ndecades ago when he arrived as a new Member of this body. As a U.S. \nSenator, Paul Kirk has served the Commonwealth with great dignity and \nhumility. Although he was only among our ranks for a few short months, \nall of us will miss him in this Chamber. He left such a good and \nlasting impression of his service.\n  Paul's time here is just one of many roles he has played in service \nto our Nation and our democracy. In 1965, many years ago, Paul Kirk \nentered public service as an assistant district attorney in \nMassachusetts. But it wasn't long before Paul's story became \nintertwined with the Kennedy family in Massachusetts.\n  In 1968, Paul worked on Robert Kennedy's Presidential campaign, and \nthe very next year he joined the Senate staff of Bob's brother Ted. \nThus began the kind of a partnership that has moved mountains \nthroughout our history. As a Senate staffer, the political director of \nTeddy's Presidential campaign, and the chairman of our own Democratic \nParty, Paul served alongside Ted Kennedy as Teddy and his remarkable \nstaff over those four decades fought battle after battle on behalf of \nthe American people.\n  Paul has always understood the importance and power of the American \nstory. That is why he has served for a decade as chairman of the \nNational Democratic Institute of International Affairs, working to \nspread and support democracy around the world so that every nation \ncould know what it is to be truly free. And he has worked to strengthen \nour own democracy as well, as the longtime cochairman of the Commission \non Presidential Debates.\n  As we all know, Paul Kirk is a very proud Democrat, but he is even \nprouder as an American. In an age when it seems as if partisanship can \noverwhelm even our most fundamental Democratic values, Paul Kirk has \nstood for fair play and open debate for decades.\n  Many Americans first met Paul Kirk after Teddy passed away, when Paul \nso elegantly conducted that remarkable memorial service at the Kennedy \nLibrary in Boston. They saw in him the passion that led him to join Ted \nKennedy in the cause of progress and also the quiet dignity of a man \nfor whom the work would go on, even after the passing of his very dear \nfriend.\n  As a U.S. Senator, they have seen him take up the torch of issues \nthat mattered to Teddy and to the people of Massachusetts and to the \nAmerican people, none more important, of course, or dear to Paul's \nheart than the fight to reform our health care system, a fight that \nwill have to continue in his absence.\n  Paul has been assisted in this difficult job by a core of public \nservants, the names of whom are unfamiliar to most and the likes of \nwhich we might not see again, the staff he inherited from Ted Kennedy. \nWhether you are a Democrat or Republican--I say this to new Members--\nthe older Members of this Chamber, Democrats and Republicans, will tell \nyou that to know the Kennedy staff was to respect how talented and \nprofessional that staff was, how fairly they treated every Member of \nthis body and every staff member. It was the core reason for their \nsuccess legislatively, because they had such respect for individual \nMembers, the staff who works here, and for the ideas people brought to \nthe debate. They too, of course, deserve our appreciation and \nrecognition as well.\n  I congratulate Senator Scott Brown and welcome him to this Chamber. \nIt is a remarkable opportunity he will have to represent the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts. I look forward to working with him in \nthe coming days and weeks. Senator Brown comes to fill a seat from \nwhich great things have been done for the people of Massachusetts and \nour country. I think there might be no greater compliment I can pay to \nthe man whom we welcomed last year than to say to Senator Brown: We \nwish you the very best in filling Ted Kennedy's shoes and Paul Kirk's \nshoes as well.\n  To my friend Paul, I thank you for your service, not just the service \nyou performed in this Chamber but a lifetime of service you have given \nto our country and the many more years of service I know you will be \nable to provide. To his wife Gail, I thank you for sharing your husband \nwith the country over these past months. I wish you all the best as you \nlook forward as well to the future.\n  To our colleagues who have come to know Paul's decency and \nprofessionalism, I urge we follow his example, not just in dogged \npursuit of good legislation that moves our country forward but in the \neffort to make this Chamber a place where good ideas and good \nconscience can once again trump pettiness and partisanship. Let us be \nguided in our work not just by Teddy's passion but by the selfless \nspirit of service that has made Paul Kirk such a fine U.S. Senator and \na very good American.\n  I thank Paul for his service. I said to him the other day that my \nonly regret is that he hasn't been able to serve here a longer time \nbecause I think he would have made a remarkable contribution to our \ncountry. He did in a short time, but I have a feeling that had he been \nhere for a number of years, the country would be a better place today. \nIt already is because of his service. It could have been even better. I \nwish him the very best.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/04/senate-section/article/S503-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2010, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
