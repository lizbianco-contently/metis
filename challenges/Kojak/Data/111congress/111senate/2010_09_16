Mr. President, we have worked for this entire Congress on \nfood safety. I have had a number of people from Nevada--about a dozen \npeople--who have talked about their foodborne illnesses, children whose \ngrowth is stunted their entire life. One young woman spent 11 months in \nthe hospital as a result of eating tainted spinach. All over America \nthis is happening.\n  We have food safety laws that are inadequate and causing people to \nget sick because the food is not checked closely enough. Senators \nDurbin, Harkin, chairman of the committee, and Enzi have worked hard to \nget something done. I have talked with Senator McConnell. He thinks \nsomething should be done. We thought we finally had it worked out. We \ncould take care of this, but Senator Coburn has said no. He wants it \npaid for a different way. We spent a whole Congress on this \nlegislation. Of course, at the last minute, he comes in, and likely we \nare\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\nnot going to be able to get this done before we go home for the \nelections.\n  What a sad thing for our country. People are dying as a result of \nthese problems with food. It is a shame we cannot get this done. We \nhave almost 400 matters that have passed the House of Representatives, \nand we cannot deal with them here because the Republicans say no. That \nis not the way to do business. In years past, these things would have \ngone through very easily.\n  We should be concerned about something as important as this issue, \nand the focus should be--and deserves to be--on the person who is \nholding up this legislation. It is too bad. There are all kinds of \nexcuses, but excuses do not do the trick. People have come to see me \nwho have been deathly ill. All that could have been avoided. The \nlegislation would do that. It is bipartisan in nature. It should be \ncompleted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/16/senate-section/article/S7144-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 5297, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5297) to create the Small Business Lending \n     Fund Program to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to make \n     capital investments in eligible institutions in order to \n     increase the availability of credit for small businesses, to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax \n     incentives for small business job creation, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Baucus/Landrieu) amendment No. 4594, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Reid (for Nelson (FL)) modified amendment No. 4595 (to \n     amendment No. 4594), to exempt certain amounts subject to \n     other information reporting from the information reporting \n     provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n       Reid (for Johanns) modified amendment No. 4596 (to \n     amendment No. 4595), to repeal the expansion of information \n     reporting requirements for payments of $600 or more to \n     corporations.\n       Reid amendment No. 4597 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 4594), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 4598 (to amendment No. 4597), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Theodore Roosevelt once said:\n\n       Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance \n     to work hard at work worth doing.\n\n  Americans prize hard work. We value a day's pay earned at honest \nlabor, and that is one reason the great recession that started in 2008 \nhas been particularly hard on Americans. The great recession robbed 8 \nmillion Americans of one of the best prizes that life offers--their \nwork.\n  That is why for 2 years now we have been working hard to create jobs. \nWe worked to create jobs by passing the Recovery Act at the beginning \nof last year. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that the \nRecovery Act ``increased the number of full-time equivalent jobs by 2 \nmillion to 4.8 million compared with what would have occurred.''\n  We worked to create jobs by passing the HIRE Act in March of this \nyear. The Treasury Department found ``an estimated 4.5 million workers \nwho have been unemployed for 8 weeks or longer were hired by employers \nwho are eligible for the HIRE Act payroll tax exemption.''\n  We have been working to create jobs with this small business bill \nbefore us. We have been working to pass this bill since June. That is \nright, since June. Here it is September. Finally we are going to get \nthis bill passed--I hope.\n  The economists tell us that this small business jobs bill could help \nsmall businesses create as many as half a million new jobs.\n  This small business jobs bill would provide small businesses with \naccess to capital. It would create incentives for investment. It would \nsupport innovation and entrepreneurship. This small business jobs bill \nwould give small businesses $12 billion in tax cuts. It would increase \nsmall business lending. It would help small business owners get private \ncapital to finance expansion and hire new workers. It would reward \nentrepreneurs for investing in new small businesses. It would help Main \nStreet businesses compete with big companies. All these things would \nhelp small businesses to create as many as half a million more jobs.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has prepared a technical explanation \nof the bill which expresses the Finance Committee's legislative intent \nbehind the tax provisions. It is available on the Joint Committee's Web \nsite.\n  This small business jobs bill has been hard work. For something this \ncommon sense, it has been harder work than we thought it would be. Some \nfolks on the other side of the aisle have thrown obstacles in the way. \nSome have thrown in our way pretty much everything but the kitchen \nsink. Today they are throwing the kitchen sink in our way as well.\n  Today, before we can vote on this targeted small business jobs bill, \nsome on the other side have resorted to the last refuge of delay. They \nare proposing motions to suspend the rules of the Senate. They are \nthrowing two more votes in the way.\n  But in case anyone is taking these last-minute antics at face value, \nlet me set the record straight. These motions to suspend the rules are \nnot serious legislating. These motions are not the way the Senate \nenacts law. We do not enact law by suspending the rules.\n  Rather, these motions are the way that folks score points. These \nmotions are the way folks try to embarrass other people. These motions, \nquite frankly, are stunts.\n  If you take them at face value, these motions address two tax \nprovisions that expired at the end of last year. They are two examples \nof what folks around here call tax extenders.\n  Here is the irony: We have been trying to extend these and other \nexpiring tax provisions for months. Yes, literally for months. We took \nup the extenders bill in March, and we have been trying again and again \nto pass a package of all the expiring provisions pretty much all year \nsince then.\n  To make it entirely clear, I will try again today. Before the vote on \nthe motions to suspend the rules, I will ask unanimous consent to take \nup and pass the full set of expiring provisions. In a few minutes, I \nwill ask unanimous consent to take up and pass a paid-for, responsible \nset of expiring provisions. One way or another, Congress will address \nthese expiring provisions. We always do. We will do so again this year.\n  But no one should be misled. These motions to suspend the rules today \nare not serious legislating. They are merely two more in a series of \ndelays thrown up in front of this bill. We should reject these delaying \ntactics. We should get on with passing this bill to create small \nbusiness jobs.\n  Creating jobs is what people sent us here to do, and now is the time \nto do it.\n  Thanks to Tuesday's vote, we are finally bringing this debate to a \nclose. It is certainly time. It is time to get this work done. It is \ntime to help small businesses. It is time to help create up to half a \nmillion new jobs. This bill has been hard work, but this bill is work \nworth doing. So let's bring this debate to a close. Let's reject the \ntransparent efforts to delay some have thrown in the way, and let's \ntarget this targeted tax relief to small businesses today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, sometime today the majority leader will \nfile cloture on the motion to proceed to the Defense authorization \nbill, setting up a vote for next week on this important legislation. \nUnder ordinary circumstances, this would be a straightforward, \nnoncontroversial vote that could unite the two parties on a matter \nrelated to our common defense. But not this year.\n  This year, Democrats would rather use this bill to manufacture \ncontroversy. Worse still, in their determination to meet their own \ncampaign promises ahead of the upcoming election, Democrats have \ndecided to put their own political interests ahead of\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\nthe collective judgment of our military service chiefs who are still in \nthe midst of a study about whether don't ask, don't tell can be \nrepealed without hurting combat readiness. But this should not surprise \nanyone. For nearly 2 years now, Democrats have done their own thing. \nAmericans have been asking Democrats for nearly 2 years to focus on the \neconomy and jobs, and what they have gotten instead is one costly \ngovernment-driven job after another that kills jobs and hurts the \neconomy.\n  When it comes to matters of national defense, Democrats in Washington \nhave established a clear pattern of making political decisions first \nand then analyzing the problem later. Whether it was the decision to \nclose Gitmo before figuring out what to do with the terrorists who were \nhoused there, to deny our intelligence community the ability to \ninterrogate terrorists, an artificial timeline for withdrawal in \nAfghanistan or this latest decision to use a Defense authorization bill \nto move ahead with repeal of don't ask, don't tell before hearing back \nfrom the service chiefs, Democrats have shot first and asked questions \nlater. In other words, they put their own ideological goals ahead of \neverything else.\n  I remind my colleagues we are fighting two wars and that our \nvolunteer force doesn't ask for much. They ask that they be well \ntrained, well equipped, that their families be cared for, and that we \nmeet their selfless sacrifice with dignity and respect. This bill \nshould be an easy one. We should be united and give our troops a \nresponsible defense policy they need and then the Defense \nappropriations bill they need--without strings, without games, and save \nthe politics for the campaign trail.\n  Another bill the Democrats have made needlessly political is the \nsmall business bill which we will also be voting on later today. \nSenator Hatch has offered an amendment that would fully extend the R \ntax credit, an amendment the Democrats blocked just before the August \nrecess but which the President now appears to support. We will also \nhave a chance to extend the biodiesel tax credit through the Grassley \namendment. This amendment is essential to keeping producers \ncompetitive, but because of the majority's partisan tactics this credit \nhas expired.\n  It is my hope our friends on the other side will now join the \nPresident and the Republicans in supporting these two important pieces \nof job-creating legislation. Unfortunately, the Democrats whole game \nplan over the last year and a half and through today is to tick as many \nitems as possible off the liberal wish list while they still have a \nchance.\n  The American people think our friends on the other side should have \nspent a little more time worrying about 10 percent unemployment rather \nthan legislative sideshows. If Senate Democrats truly want to do \nsomething for the private sector jobs in this country, they should \nsupport the bipartisan R tax credit of Senator Hatch and the \nbiodiesel tax credit of Senator Grassley and then work with Republicans \nafter that on preventing the looming $1 trillion tax hike Democratic \nleaders have so far ignored.\n  It is time our friends on the other side got serious about jobs and \nthe economy. It is time they put the liberal wish list on the shelf and \nfocused on the priorities of the American people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have a tax bill before us that is \nsupposed to help small business because small business creates 70 \npercent of the new jobs. The President says that. I think we have to \nlook at the background of the high unemployment rate, particularly why \nit is staying up there--maybe not why it got up there but why is it \nstill there.\n  I spoke last night about a lot of uncertainty that comes because of \nthe cap-and-trade bill, the bank regulatory reform bill, the health \ncare reform bill, the biggest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry coming up this fall if we do not intervene and prevent the \nbiggest tax increase, and a lot of other issues out there that tell us \nhow uncertain it is, what Congress is going to do. That uncertainty \nkeeps the entrepreneurs of America from opening up and creating jobs.\n  If you want to quantify how they are tight-fisted about the situation \nright now, the last figure I saw was about $2.1 trillion in cash in the \ntreasuries of major corporations of America. They are not making any \nmoney by storing that cash, but they do not know what sort of a future \nthis Congress is going to give them, so they are very guarded on any \nmoves they make. Then we have things such as shutting down all the oil \ndrilling--unemploying tens of thousands of people. Then what I am going \nto visit with you about is the fact we did not pass the biodiesel tax \ncredit December 31 last year when it sunset and that industry is shut \ndown and 20,000 jobs have been lost. It is ironic to me that we spent \nweeks on a bill that is before the Senate, as legitimate as it is, to \ncreate jobs in small business, when, frankly, there are a lot of \nnegative things going on in the Congress of the United States that \ncause people to be laid off or, because of uncertainty, not to be hired \nback. I wish to speak about the biodiesel industry.\n\n  As we are faced today with a 9.6-percent unemployment rate, I have a \nsolution that will create 20,000 jobs almost overnight. That solution \nis to extend the biodiesel tax credit today. This tax credit expired \nDecember 31, 2009. This democratically controlled Congress has failed \nto extend it, even though, on several occasions, I and other Members on \nthis side of the aisle have taken action in that direction.\n  The Democratic leadership claims, as the President does, that they \nwant more green jobs--and I am in favor of that. I am the author of the \nWind Energy Tax Credit, as an example. I have been a backer of ethanol. \nI have been a backer of biomass and this biodiesel tax credit. So there \nare plenty of opportunities to show that we, on this side of the aisle, \nsupport the President wanting to create green jobs. If the President \nand the Democratic leadership want to do that, they have not acted to \nprevent the loss of green jobs in the biodiesel industry.\n  The biodiesel industry has lost tens of thousands of jobs as a result \nof this neglect. It would be nice if the Democratic leadership's \nrhetoric met with reality.\n  I have twice sought to have the biodiesel tax credit simply passed \nthrough the Senate by unanimous consent. However, both times my request \nwas objected to by those on the other side of the aisle. Meanwhile, \nthese biodiesel plants in Iowa and throughout the country continue to \nlay off workers. In fact, most of them are just plain shut down because \nthe democratically controlled Congress has not extended the biodiesel \ntax credit.\n  I made a speech similar to this in December, when we were on the \nhealth care reform bill. I said: Can't we find some time to pass these \ntax extenders so we do not let them lapse--and all these question \nmarks. That was 8 months ago, 9 months ago. But somehow we thought last \nDecember, since Congress had not been in session on Christmas Eve since \n1895, we ought to be in session once in 115 years--or because we just \nhad to pass this health care reform bill before the end of the year \nbecause it takes effect by 2014, we couldn't find a little bit of time \nto keep 22,000 people employed in the biodiesel industry. So we asked \nfor those consents and we did not get them. These workers are laid off \nbecause the democratically controlled Congress has not extended this \ntax credit.\n  This is a simple and noncontroversial tax extension that will likely \nreinstate 20,000 more jobs nationwide and at least 2,000 within my \nState of Iowa. By the way, this is not controversial, and there are 71 \nother tax provisions that expired December 31, 2009, and I don't know \nthat any of those are controversial. So the biodiesel industry has lost \nits jobs. These jobs have fallen victim to a tactic used by the \nDemocratic leadership to hold this popular and noncontroversial tax \nprovision hostage in an attempt to advance political objectives.\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\n  Just last February I worked out a bipartisan compromise on tax \nextenders--all of them--with Chairman Baucus to extend the expired tax \nprovisions, including biodiesel.\n  However, the Senate Democratic leadership decided to put partisanship \nahead of the job security for tens of thousands of biodiesel workers by \ndestroying the compromise to which Chairman Baucus and I agreed. So I \nam here again to try to put tens of thousands of people back to work \nproducing clean and renewable fuel that everybody in this Congress says \nthey support, and the green jobs from these productions.\n  There is a difference between a biodiesel tax credit and the other \ntax provisions in the tax extender bill that has stalled in the Senate. \nThe failure to extend the biodiesel tax credit before it expired has \nground the industry to a halt because biodiesel is now more expensive \nthan gasoline. Gasoline stations, knowing they cannot sell biodiesel, \ndo not buy it, and biodiesel producers have, therefore, stopped \nproducing biodiesel because they have nobody to sell it to. \nConsequently, the layoffs.\n  While the other tax provisions are important, most are not as time \nsensitive as biodiesel because they are not transactional tax \nincentives like the biodiesel tax credit but, instead, are based on a \ntaxable year. Unfortunately, now it is clear the larger extenders bill \nhas stalled for the time being. We need to pass the biodiesel tax \ncredit separately.\n  The last time I sought unanimous consent, which was the second time I \ndid it, one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle objected. \nThe objection said something like, the biodiesel tax credit was part of \na larger extenders bill they were working on.\n  Now that the tax extenders bill is stalled, the Senate needs to pass \nthe biodiesel tax credit by itself. I ask my colleagues to vote yes to \nwaive the rules and put 20,000 biodiesel workers back to work.\n  I move to suspend rule XXII, paragraph 2, for the purposes of \nproposing and considering amendment No. 4433, which is at the desk. \nHaving said my part, I think before Senator Hatch speaks--he will speak \nabout a very popular tax extender that needs to be extended and on \nwhich I do not know that there is one single disagreement. It is a \nnoncontroversial provision but has still been languishing here for the \nlast 9 months, and losing jobs as a result of it, at the very same time \nwe are trying to create jobs through a bill that is before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague from Iowa. I appreciate his \nleadership on the Finance Committee and the good work he has done over \nall of these years.\n  Mr. President, in accordance with rule V of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate, I move to suspend rule XXII, paragraph 2, for the purpose of \nproposing and considering the following motion to commit, which is at \nthe desk with instructions to H.R. 5297. I move to commit H.R. 5297 to \nthe Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same back to \nthe Senate with changes to include a permanent extension of the \nresearch tax credit.\n  This motion is a simple one. It is a motion to suspend the rules to \nallow for the consideration of the motion to commit the bill before us \nto the Finance Committee, from which both Senator Grassley and I sit, \nwith the specific instruction to add to the bill a permanent research \ntax credit.\n  It is a simple motion, but I believe it is a significant moment. The \nAmerican people understand that there is a desperate need for jobs and \ngrowth, and they have heard that Washington is partisan, broken, and \nunable to respond to their genuine needs. Just last week they heard \nthat President Obama proposed a permanent research credit as an \nadditional step ``to grow the economy and help businesses spur \nhiring.''\n  Well, we can address all three with my simple motion: Make the \nresearch credit permanent, do it in a bipartisan spirit, and give job \ncreation the jump start it badly needs. It seems like a pretty good \nidea to me, but the track record so far is very disappointing. Making \nthe credit permanent is exactly what Senator Baucus, the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, and I proposed to do in the bill we \nintroduced last year.\n  We have been introducing this same idea for many years now. Yet the \nSenate does not seem to be able to do anything more than extend the \ncredit on a very temporary basis. In recent weeks, I have been trying \nto add a research credit extension to the small business lending bill \nthat is before us today. Unfortunately, my efforts have been in vain \nbecause the leader has filled the amendment tree, and I have not had \nthe opportunity to offer such an amendment to this bill.\n  Frankly, the way this Senate has been run, there has been very much \nto criticize. This is supposed to be the most important deliberative \nbody in the world. Yet almost every bill that has any controversy to it \nat all, they bring it to the floor, fill up the tree, forbid the \nminority to have any chance to have any amendments, and in the process \nstultify the legislation.\n  It is easy to see why adding a research tax credit incentive to this \nbill is a high priority. Obviously, President Obama thinks it should \nhave a high priority. He was very specific last week in making it clear \nthat this is a step we should take to grow the economy and to help \nbusinesses spur hiring, bringing people onboard to work. Here we have a \nsmall business tax bill that has been proposed by the majority party. \nYet it does not include a very important provision that has long \nenjoyed bipartisan support by most Members of the Senate. Now we have \nthe President of the United States specifically calling for this \nprovision to be enacted to grow the economy and help businesses spur \nhiring, for which I give him great credit.\n  This, too, I believe is the underlying purpose of this small business \nbill. What is strange is my pleadings for this provision to be added to \nthis bill have so far fallen on deaf ears. Therefore, I have had to \nresort to this procedural motion to suspend the rules in order for this \nprovision to be added to the bill.\n  Since the parliamentary tree is tied up and we do not even have a \nchance for amendments, I could not bring it up as an amendment other \nthan this way. I would have thought this would have been unnecessary. \nAfter last week's proposal by the President, I would have expected that \nMembers of his own party might have acted to include the research \ncredit extension on the first possible legislative vehicle. This bill \nis that vehicle.\n  But, no, this bill is moving forward toward passage in the Senate \nwith nary a word from the majority about the provision the President \nproposed last week. He said it was important. He wants it. It is \nsomething we ought to do. Above all, it would be bipartisan, one of the \nfew things we have been able to do in a bipartisan way since this \nadministration took over.\n  Perhaps most of my colleagues on the other side were on the beach and \naway from the television and the newspapers and did not see or know \nabout the President's call for a permanent research credit. For those \nof my colleagues who might not have heard about the President's call \nfor a permanent research credit, let me share a couple of facts that \nhe, our President, put forward.\n  He said a permanent extension of the research credit is ``a win-win--\nencouraging job growth and investment now that will pay off with \nstronger economic growth in the future.'' Again, I could not agree more \nwith the President.\n  President Obama also said economic growth is the single best way to \nbring down the deficit. There are some things our President says that \nmake a terrific amount of sense. This is one of them because this bill \nbefore us today is supposed to be all about job creation and growing \nthe economy. Because the President has renewed his call for a permanent \nextension of the very important research credit, it seems to me this \nmotion would be unnecessary. I would have thought, as I said before, \nthat the leadership would have taken care of adding this item to this \nbill.\n  I think most everyone will agree that this might very well be the \nonly tax bill that even has a remote chance of passage and enactment \nbefore the election next month. Surely the majority leader does not \nplan to simply ignore\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\nthe President's call for passing a permanent extension of the research \ncredit.\n  Well, since he either forgot to add this priority or decided to \nignore the President, I am offering this motion as a way to remind him \nand a way to allow it to happen before this bill comes up for a final \nvote. I urge all of my colleagues to consider the implications of this \ncountry dropping to a second tier industrial power.\n  Our economy has been, both short term and long term, filled with \nproblems. In the short run, we are not producing the number of new jobs \nwe need. Our economy is not growing nearly as rapidly as we would all \nlike. It is not generating nearly enough moneys or enough revenue to \nthe Treasury. In the longer run, we are facing some severe \ncompetitiveness issues with our U.S. firms in competition with foreign \nfirms. The Federal Government has, unfortunately, saddled them with the \nhigh taxation, more onerous regulations, and an unfriendly business \nclimate. We have the second highest corporate taxes in the world.\n\n  In the high-technology area, along with other sectors of our economy \nthat are even more global in nature, we have even more difficult \nchallenges. Our international tax rules are very inhospitable to U.S.-\nbased firms. This is one of the reasons the United States no longer \ndominates the list of having the largest companies in the world. In \nfact, in 1980, of the 50 largest companies in the world, we had 39 of \nthem headquartered in the United States. Today we have just 16. It is \nbecause of these stupid rules that have been put in place, these stupid \ntax approaches that we must change if we want to do something about \njobs in our society today.\n  One particular danger is that many of our trading partners have \nenacted very generous tax incentives in an attempt to lure away \nresearch and development from our country to theirs. There was a time \nnot very long ago when the United States was considered the only real \nplace in the world where companies wanted to conduct their research and \ndevelopment.\n  We had the best research scientists and the best facilities in the \nworld. That time is no more. We can no longer make this boast. Many \nother places offer world-class facilities and scientists just as well \ntrained and experienced as ours, many of whom have been trained right \nhere, and we push them out of our country because we will not expand \nour H1B immigration rules. Talk about stupidity.\n  Now they also offer tax incentives to companies that are far superior \nto our country's tax incentives for our companies and for companies \noverseas. In fact, at this time we can offer no tax incentives for U.S. \nresearch and development because the credit expired last December. The \nresearch tax credit is a provision that has been in the tax law since \n1981. It has been extended by Congress more than a dozen times.\n  This credit has wide and deep bipartisan support in this body as has \nbeen demonstrated numerous times. More importantly, however, is the \nfact that the research tax credit is a vital incentive to business \nenterprises of all sizes in this Nation.\n  In my home State of Utah, there are hundreds of small high-technology \ncompanies, companies and firms, that spend a high percentage of their \nrevenue on research and development. In fact, Utah has more than 5,000 \ntechnology companies. Every State wants to attract companies such as \nthese because their jobs are generally better paying private sector \njobs than most private sector jobs.\n  On average, high-tech jobs pay 69 percent more. This R is vital to \nthe future survival of these firms. No high-tech company can afford to \nignore research that wants to be around next year or maybe even in the \nnext quarter. The research credit is, in my thinking, the most urgent \nand important to our economy, our competitiveness, and to those \nhundreds of smaller high-technology companies in Utah.\n  We have before us on the Senate floor a small business bill. This \nbill is designed to strengthen our small businesses, which most of us \nacknowledge comprise the strongest component of our job creation engine \nin this economy to help them to do what they obviously are not doing \nvery well at this time, and that is to grow and bring on more new \nworkers. The tax portion of this small business lending bill is a good \npackage that I support.\n\n  I think we do need to pass the tax provisions in the bill before us. \nHowever, it would be a grave mistake for us to think this is all we \nneed to do to solve job-creation problems in our economy--far from it. \nWe should be adding many provisions to this small business tax bill. \nThese include the extension of the tax relief provisions passed in 2001 \nand 2003. That tax relief is important. However, since that is the \nsubject of an intense partisan debate in the Senate right now, it does \nnot seem possible. It seems reasonable, however, that we could all \nagree to add the most prominent tax provision the President is calling \nfor--a bipartisan provision, the research and development tax credit--\nand make it permanent. It has wide and deep support on both sides of \nthe aisle, here and in the House. Republicans are saying yes to the \nPresident on this. It is the members of his own party who seem to be \nsaying no, even though I think most of them will vote for this if it \nhas a chance to be heard and voted upon.\n  As Congress tries to address the job situation, we need to keep in \nmind that one of the best things we can do to retain and create good \njobs in the United States is to incentivize research activities. One of \nthe best ways of doing this is to ensure we have an effective tax \npolicy to keep research here in our own country. Unfortunately, many of \nour trading partners now have strong tax inducements for companies to \nperform research overseas. Research and development jobs are high-\npaying, and they are very desirable jobs.\n  Moreover, R very often leads to other kinds of economic development \nand the creation of even more jobs. We simply cannot afford to lose our \nlead in research by not keeping the United States as the premier \nlocation in the world for research and development. Having a robust \nresearch credit is key to this. The President understands it is the \nkey. I surely hope my colleagues will wake up and help make this happen \nbefore it is too late and we have to work to get back what once was \nours.\n  My understanding is that some might go along with this, but they want \nto increase taxes on oil and gas. They also want to do some other very \nobnoxious things that would be difficult for which to get bipartisan \nsupport.\n  We know that business in this country is having a very difficult time \nright now. My understanding is that they may want to add a carried \ninterest provision, which would probably put a lot of venture capital \nfunds out of business and would drive a lot of people out of business \nand maybe into bankruptcy. We simply cannot support that. We can \nsupport--and I think we would have almost 100 percent of the votes here \nin the Senate--the research tax credit. I believe it would show great \nbipartisanship at a time when it is needed. I think it would even \nbenefit our Democratic colleagues to work with us on this.\n  But there are things in this underlying bill that really are very \ndifficult to vote for--one part of it is, in the eyes of many, a new \nmini-TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. We have seen how bad the \nlast one worked. I hate to see us go further down that path when we \ncould, in a bipartisan way, resolve these problems.\n  Last spring, four of us on the Finance Committee worked out an \nextenders package. We worked diligently together. We agreed on how it \nshould be done. It was bipartisan in nature. I believe my friends on \nthe other side initially agreed to it because it would have gotten at \nleast 95 votes in the Senate. It could have been done early enough to \ncreate a lot of jobs this year. Then all of a sudden it became a \npartisan exercise again.\n  Time after time, if the Democrats can get one Republican to go with \nthem, they call it bipartisan. I guess one could say that, but that is \nreally stretching the term bipartisanship, especially when I think we \ncould have had virtually 100 percent, or at least 95 votes for the \nextenders package we had worked out.\n  It is amazing to me how difficult it is to work together around here, \nespecially when we want to and especially when we can come up with \nprograms and legislation to which virtually everybody in this body \nwould agree. It is almost like an arrogance of power: We are just going \nto teach those Republicans that we are not going to do what\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\nthey think is good. I hesitate to say it, but I think that had we had \nmore bipartisanship around here over the last year and a half, we would \nbe a lot further along. This economy would be back in a much stronger \nway, and there would have been a lot of jobs created.\n  If we are just going to keep playing partisan games on these very \nimportant bills on which we should all agree, then it stultifies jobs \nand the economy. I think it makes this administration look bad. In the \nprocess, it creates a lot of angst and anger throughout the whole \ncountry.\n  We would have had this done; it would have been done early this year \nhad it not been for partisanship, in my opinion. There are things to be \npartisan about. There are things on which both sides disagree \nvociferously. That is the way this body works. We should go after each \nother on these matters. But there are some things on which we can all \nagree.\n  When the President comes out and says we need a permanent research \ntax credit, after all of the difficulties we have had, one would think \nour colleagues on the other side would grab Republicans and run with \nit. We could get it done, as we have always done in the past. There is \nno certainty with the current research tax credit, or the one that \nexpired last year. Companies cannot plan for the future because we have \nto reinstate this all the time. Sometimes it is late, and even if we \nmake it retroactive, it is not as helpful as it would be. Making it \npermanent would be a tremendous boost to scientific companies in this \ncountry and all other companies where innovation can occur. We have \nseen great results from the research and development tax credit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, this is a motion to suspend rule XXII, \nparagraph 2, for the purpose of proposing and considering a motion to \ncommit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I know we will be voting soon on these \nissues and moving forward on the small business legislation. That is \nwhat we are really here to do today, to pass legislation that is going \nto help Main Street. This is a bill that is long overdue. I know once a \ntrain is leaving the station, once legislation has cleared the hurdles \nand is going to pass, a lot of people want to then add other things \nonto that legislation. Those are some of the issues being discussed \nhere this morning. But the important thing is not to hold up \nlegislation for small businesses one more day. Let's not delay the need \nthat Main Street has to get access to capital to help small businesses \ngrow our economy.\n  In Washington State, we have lost thousands of jobs. Yet if every \nsmall business in Washington State had the ability to hire one person \nas a result of getting access to capital, we would nearly wipe out our \nunemployment since this recession. It is critical for us not to delay \nthis legislation any further, to move it ahead, and to make sure we are \ngetting capital into those small businesses.\n  I know some of my colleagues have critiqued this legislation, saying \nthey will not support it. I know we have had at least two Members on \nthe other side who support this legislation moving forward. So, yes, I \ndo call that bipartisan. I appreciate the fact that those two \nlegislators had enough courage to say this was important to their \nconstituents. In the August recess, they listened to small businesses, \nand they knew this was important to get done.\n  There is a lot of misinformation out there in the eleventh hour about \nhow perhaps certain people weren't supportive of the legislation. My \ncolleague from Oregon has a list that keeps growing every single day. \nIt is now four or five pages of different organizations that support \nmoving forward on this legislation. I haven't heard any of them \nadvocating that we hold it up one more day or send it back to the \ncommittee to add more things to it. No doubt the discussion we are \nhaving about the extenders package of other policies should happen. If \nwe get more bipartisan support, we will get those things done and we \nwon't have them held up.\n  But if we go back to this basic issue we are trying to address, it is \nreally about the implosion that happened on Wall Street that took Main \nStreet down with it and about correcting that and moving forward today \nin a way that will help small business help our economy recover.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will look at this \nbill overall, look at the tax credits given to small businesses, the \nfact that the depreciation rates in investment in new manufacturing and \nequipment can help small businesses be competitive, and that they will \nlook at the expansion of the SBA programs that were enthusiastically \nendorsed by lots of different organizations--by banks, by lenders, by \nindividual businesses--because they know that program that was enhanced \nin January to help give more flexibility was a huge success. When it \nexpired in June, we saw a falloff in the type of investment and job \ncreation we need to have.\n  This is about a philosophy. If my colleagues think our economy is \nabout helping those huge businesses at the top or from Wall Street and \nthat is somehow going to trickle down, then let's just keep doing \nbusiness as usual. But if Members believe this is about helping small \nbusinesses grow, which is 75 percent of job growth in America, then \nlet's get this bill off the floor today and get this legislation \npassed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, today, passage of essential legislation \nto support job-creating business investment was relegated to callous \npolitical brinkmanship. For months, funding for the biodiesel and the \nresearch and development, R & D, tax credits have been stalled due to \nRepublican opposition. Just in June, I voted three times to fund the \ncredits--on the 17th, again on the 24th, and finally on the 30th. Each \ntime, every Republican voted against the bill that contained these and \nother essential extensions. Then today, as we neared completion of \nanother essential piece of legislation, the small business jobs bill, \nmotions regarding biodiesel and R & D were presented by Senators \nGrassley and Hatch as a way to slow down progress on the legislation at \nhand.\n  Let me be clear--we must extend these credits. R & D credits have \nlong been viewed as lifeblood for American innovation and job creation. \nWhile less known, the biodiesel credits also provide essential economic \nassistance to clean energy small businesses. Without a doubt businesses \nsuffer due to our inability to work together. A business in Erie, PA, \nillustrates this point. Hero BX has struggled this year to keep its \nproduction facility open without the biodiesel credit, putting 40 jobs \non the line.\n  I want to provide Hero BX and other businesses across the \nCommonwealth and beyond with the tools needed to compete and survive. \nSenator Baucus has reintroduced the tax extender package, including the \nR & D and biodiesel credits. I encourage all of my colleagues to \nsupport the bill. This is not about allowing a victory in an election \nyear. Passage is about providing companies the incentives to keep and \ncreate jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think allocated time is about to \nexpire.\n  My good friend, the Senator from Iowa, talked about how good it would \nbe if we removed uncertainty from the law. The unanimous consent I am \nabout to propound would give Senators the opportunity to remove much \nuncertainty. This unanimous consent request, if agreed to, would extend \nthe biodiesel tax credit the Senator from Iowa spoke about. It would \nalso extend the R tax credit the Senator from Utah talked about. This \nconsent request would do so completely paid for. The Senator from Iowa \nspoke about his wanting to move the tax extenders for 8 months. The \nunanimous consent request I am about to propound will provide for \nextending all of the tax extenders.\n  The consent request will allow Members on the other side of the aisle \nto get what they say they want; that is, to remove uncertainty in the \nlaw and get these provisions passed.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Request--H.R. 4849\n\n  As I mentioned a few moments ago, I now intend to ask unanimous \nconsent to take up and pass the full set of expiring provisions. So I \nask unanimous\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\nconsent that H.R. 4849, the Small Business and Infrastructure Jobs Tax \nAct of 2010, be discharged from the Finance Committee; that the Senate \nproceed to the bill; that the Baucus substitute amendment extending \nexpiring provisions that is at the desk be considered and agreed to; \nthat the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record, as if read; and that this all occur \nwith no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I reserve the right to object, and I will \nobject, because this side wants an open amendment process. We are tired \nof every time a bill comes to the floor in the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world, they tie up the parliamentary tree so we can't have \nhonest amendments.\n  Secondly, the approach of my dear friend and colleague, whom I have \nworked with all of these years on the research tax credit, is not \npermanent and would not make it permanent, which is what the President \nhas asked for.\n  I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The debate time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, amendments Nos. 4595, 4596, 4597, and 4598 \nare withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote on the motion to suspend rule XXII \noffered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  Who yields time? If no time is yielded, the time will be charged \nequally.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I don't see the Senator from Iowa here. \nIt is his amendment to suspend the rules.\n  Let me say once again this motion to suspend the rules of the Senate \nis not serious legislating. It is simply an attempt to delay the \npassage of the small business bill.\n  The biodiesel tax credit is another tax extender. We will address \nthese expiring provisions. We will also do so in a fiscally responsible \nmanner. This motion today is another delay to passage of the underlying \nsmall business bill which is before us at this moment. So we reject \nthis delay and we reject this motion so we can get on with passing this \nbill to create small business jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I have 1 minute to speak to my motion \nto suspend the rules to bring up this bill.\n  We are on a bill now on the Senate floor that is supposed to create \njobs. Hopefully, this bill will create jobs. But it is kind of small \ncompared to what this Congress could do by passing the biodiesel tax \ncredit. It should have been passed before December 31 last year. \nSenator Baucus and I put together a bipartisan bill to do it in \nFebruary. That bill was delayed by the majority leader, so we are back \nhere again for a third time, trying to get attention to jobs. This \nbiodiesel tax credit will immediately put 20,000 more people back to \nwork, and 2,000 in my State of Iowa.\n  I hope we will suspend the rules and create jobs for sure because \nthose jobs were there before December 31 and they will be there on \nSeptember 17 if we pass this amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last week President Obama called for a \npermanent research tax credit. We have always extended this tax credit. \nWe failed last December to do it on time. Therefore, we are without it. \nWe are without the jobs that would be created by it. I think it was a \nterrific move by the President to come out for a permanent research tax \ncredit, and we ought to swiftly move to add it to this particular bill.\n  The only way I can do that, because of the tying up of the tree--\nwhich is happening all too often around here--is by a motion to suspend \nthe rules.\n  This bill is a bill to create jobs. At least that is what it is \nsupposed to be. But the research tax credit would do the most to \ninstantaneously create jobs, and these are high-paying jobs. The only \nway we can get it is to vote for this motion to suspend. If we do, I \nthink we would have 95 votes--a bipartisan vote--for this particular \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I deeply appreciate the remarks of my \ngood friend from Utah. The fact is, any motion to suspend the rules in \nthis context is not fair and, without being disparaging, it is not \nserious legislating. This is an attempt to throw another roadblock to \ndelay passage of the small business bill.\n  In addition, the extenders bill, which I tried to get up by UC, would \nextend the R tax credit. We will find our way there later this year. \nWe cannot suspend the rules at this point to delay passage of the small \nbusiness bill. Rather, let's not accept this motion so we can get on to \npassing the small business bill and take up the R tax credit later on \nthis year. We will definitely take it up. It will be passed later this \nyear.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I know we are getting ready to vote on \na very important piece of legislation--the Small Business Job Creation \nAct--that we have actually been working on now for a year and a half. \nIt is hard to believe that a year and a half has gone by, but it has, \ndespite the extraordinary work that has been done on this bill from the \nDemocratic leadership, from a handful of Republican Senators who \nstepped up to make this a possibility, and from the administration and \nTreasury and literally hundreds of organizations that have brought this \nvote to the floor today. I wish it could have been 6 months ago. I wish \nit could have been 8 months ago. Every day, every week we have waited \nto pass this bill has been another tough week for small businesses \nthroughout our country. But this week is a good week for them. They \nhave a bill that they can be proud of, that I believe we can be proud \nof, and it is overdue that we pass this bill today.\n  I know Members understand the significance of the three major parts \nof the bill: $12 billion in directed tax cuts; an infusion of resources \nand strength to the core small business programs in the SBA that we \nknow are effective in stimulating loans to Main Street, that create the \njobs that will put this recession in the rearview mirror; and we know \nthe third part of this bill is a very significant and new strategic \nlending partnership we are establishing with healthy community banks, \nthe 7,000 community banks in every neighborhood--in rural areas, in \nsuburban areas, in all of our States, and in almost every single one of \nthose communities in those States.\n  I thank Chairman Baucus particularly for his help and Senator Reid \nparticularly for his help. I thank Senator Boxer and Senator Cantwell \nand Senator Merkley. But I also thank Senator Levin, Senator Warner, \nSenator Stabenow, many members of my Small Business Committee, Senator \nShaheen, Senator Murray, Senator Schumer, Senator Lincoln, Senator \nHagan, Senator Cardin, Senator Burris, and many others--Senator Sherrod \nBrown has been down to the floor time and time again.\n  I also thank two colleagues particularly from the other side of the \naisle, Senator Voinovich and Senator LeMieux, who listened to their \nFlorida bankers, who listened to their Ohio bankers, who listened to \ntheir small businesses in Florida and Ohio and said that this is the \nkind of bill we need--tax cuts, strengthening of SBA programs, and a \nsmart strategic lending program.\n  I thank Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Gene Sperling and Don \nGraves, and of course I thank the staff of the Small Business Committee \nand my staff in particular who did so much work.\n  In addition, I thank the National Small Business Association, \nIndependent Community Bankers, the American Bankers Association, the \nNational Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders, and the hundreds \nof organizations that helped push and pull this Senate to this vote \ntoday.\n  In the last minute I have, I wish to submit two things for the Record \nthat I think need clearing up and amplification. One is a letter from \nthe Chief Economist of the SBA that answers directly a criticism that \nwas published in the Washington Post yesterday about the ``myth'' that \nsmall business is not the business that grows jobs in America. The \neconomist was misquoted. This is a letter for the Record specifically \noutlining that. I think it is worth review today.\n  Second, and more important, a banker from California--and I thank \nSenator Boxer. I met with a banker from California and from Florida. I \nam from Louisiana, but they wanted to see me, I wanted to see them, and \nI met with them. Got a standing ovation. I am very proud, of course, \nbecause they said to me: Senator, this may be one of the most \nsignificant bills to help get\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\nour banks where we need to be to start lending.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Small Business Administration,\n\n\n                                           Office of Advocacy,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2010.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chair Landrieu: I am writing to clarify and apologize \n     for my statements about small business to Ruth Marcus in her \n     September 15, 2010, Washington Post article.\n       When I stated, ``It's not true'' . . . ``It's half the \n     story'' in relation to small businesses being the major \n     source of net job creation, I misspoke. I meant to state, \n     ``While true, it's only half the story.'' Meaning that while \n     we know that small businesses are the major job creator, \n     there are different types of small businesses, and that is \n     where the story is.\n       Oddly enough, the fact that small businesses are the major \n     job creator has been corroborated by all three papers \n     mentioned in the article; even though all used different time \n     periods, different methodology and different data.\n       The article discusses an academic debate that is playing \n     out with John Haltiwanger, a University of Maryland \n     Professor, in one camp and myself in the other. The topic is, \n     ``What group within the small business sector is driving new \n     job creations.'' John believes it is start-ups and young \n     small businesses; while I believe it is the relatively few \n     small firms with fast growth. In many senses we are both \n     correct.\n       So the debate is not, who creates more jobs, small or large \n     firms. We know the answer; small firms create the majority of \n     net new jobs, as shown from Bureau of Labor Statistics, \n     Business Employment Dynamics data. They show firms with fewer \n     than 500 employees accounted for 65 percent of the net new \n     jobs in the private-sector over the last seventeen years.\n       My study on high growth firms finds a similar figure when \n     looking at all three time periods and firms with volatile \n     employment changes (meaning using a net concept of fast \n     growers and fast decliners).\n       Unfortunately, I was quoted as stating, ``it would appear \n     that both small and large firms contribute about equally to \n     employment growth.'' While a further examination of my study \n     would show that this comment only refers to high-growth \n     firms, not the entirety of all firms. When one includes all \n     firms, the results show that small firms create two-thirds of \n     the net new jobs.\n       I have spent my career developing the field of small \n     business economics. I take pride in what I have been able to \n     accomplish, but regret the damage I may have caused by the \n     way in which I conveyed the information to Ms. Marcus. \n     Attached is a copy of my study High Impact Firms: Gazelles \n     Revisited. I am happy to supply any further assistance you \n     may need.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Zoltan Acs, Ph.D.,\n     Chief Economist.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Richard M. Sanborn [mailto:rsanborn--sccombank.com]\n     Sent: Wednesday, September 15, 2010 11:40 PM\n     To: Gillers, David (SBC)\n     Cc: David H. Bartram\n     Subject: Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010--HR 5297\n       Mr. Gillers, I want to thank you for taking the time this \n     evening to call in reference to my comments to Senator \n     Landrieu at the California Bankers/Florida Bankers meeting. \n     My whole team and I are extremely grateful to the Senator for \n     championing the Act through the Senate as it will have a \n     profound impact on our institution.\n       Once passed and signed into law, the Act will allow us to \n     apply for (and hopefully receive) an approximate $1.8 million \n     investment by the US Treasury through the Small Business \n     Lending Fund component of the Act. We can leverage that \n     Capital investment approximately 10 X, resulting in our \n     ability to lend to small businesses and grow our loan \n     portfolio an additional $18 million. While $18 million in new \n     loans to small businesses does not seem like much, as we are \n     primarily focused on lending to small businesses through the \n     SBA's 7(a) lending program, to achieve $18 million in loan \n     grow, we could originate approximately $180 million in new \n     SBA loans to small businesses . . . which is a lot for a \n     small bank like ours (we're only a $130 million asset bank). \n     Of course that assumes we originate all $180 million with a \n     90% SBA guarantee and sell 100% of that guaranteed portion.\n       Originating $180 million in new SBA small business means \n     that we can provide needed capital to approximately 275 \n     businesses, based on our current average SBA loan size of \n     $650 thousand. If we apply the SBA's overall average loan \n     size of $220 thousand, we could help over 800 small \n     businesses get much needed capital.\n       This will be a great program, if passed, and will help the \n     small businesses in the markets we serve. Again, please thank \n     the Senator for her help with this important measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Sanborn.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Seacoast is a small bank. It only has $130 million in \nassets. According to this banker's testimony to me yesterday, he is \ngoing to take this bill and all of its provisions, and he believes he \ncan leverage $180 million in SBA loans to small businesses. Based on \ntheir record and based on the average SBA loan size of $650,000, this \none bank in southern California believes it can make 275 business \nloans.\n  If this one small bank in South Carolina can take this bill and its \nprovisions and leverage it to 275 good-quality loans in South Carolina, \nthere is hope on the way. This is a real step to putting this recession \nbehind us. I thank the Democratic leadership for making it a \npossibility. I hope next time a bill like this is brought to the floor \nof the Senate, it will not take so long; we will not have to jump over \nthe barriers and barricades that were put in front of this bill. So I \nhope Members on the other side of the aisle will lower those barriers \nnext time because our small businesses cannot wait.\n\n\n                             Tier 1 Capital\n\n  Madam President, as one of the two lead sponsors of the Small \nBusiness Lending Fund, I am deeply convinced of the ability of this \nprogram to provide small businesses with the credit they need to grow \nand create jobs. As you know, the purpose of this fund is to provide \ncommunity banks with Tier 1 capital to increase their lending to small \nbusinesses, along with incentives for doing so. With up to $30 billion \nin capital, community banks that participate in the Small Business \nLending Fund will be able to support many multiples of that amount in \nnew lending. To allow that to occur, it has always been our intent and \nour understanding that the bank regulators should treat these \ninvestments as Tier 1 capital, in a manner consistent with that \naccorded to other capital securities issued to Treasury by eligible \ninstitutions and in consideration of the strong public interest in \npromoting lending to small businesses.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I thank Senator Landrieu for her \nleadership on this issue. I agree that the intention of this \nlegislation from the very start has always been that investments made \nthrough the Small Business Lending Fund should be treated as Tier 1 \ncapital in a manner consistent with that accorded to other capital \nsecurities issued to Treasury by eligible institutions. This treatment \nwill allow these institutions to use Treasury funds to expand small \nbusiness lending as intended.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. With access to Tier 1 capital, I \nbelieve that the community banks that participate in this program will \nbe able to provide small businesses with the credit they need to grow \nand hire.\n\n\n                Deduction for Health Insurance Coverage\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I would like to ask the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee a question on the application of a provision in \nthe Small Business Jobs Act of 2010.\n  Section 2042 of the bill will allow self-employed persons to deduct \nthe cost of health coverage for themselves, their spouses, and their \nchildren who have not reached age 27 by the end of the year for \npurposes of determining their liability for self-employment taxes. Is \nit correct that the provision is not intended to affect the \ndetermination of earned income for other purposes? For example, earned \nincome for purposes of determining the maximum amount of health \ninsurance premiums a self-employed person may deduct for income tax \npurposes is not affected by this provision.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. Since the 108th \nCongress, he has introduced legislation to correct this inequity in the \nTax Code. I would like to congratulate and thank the Senator from New \nMexico for his leadership in championing this provision.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, the Senate is on the verge of passing the \nSmall Business Jobs Act which has been many months in the making and \nhas been debated on the Senate floor for numerous weeks. I commend \nSenators Reid, Baucus, and Landrieu for their tenaciousness in pursuing \nthis legislation. It is essential we help small businesses attain the \ninvestment and capital necessary to create jobs and grow our economy.\n  Small business growth is critical to restoring our economy. Over the \npast 15 years, small businesses have created two-thirds of all new \njobs. Unfortunately, small businesses have been hit\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\nhard by the recession--losing more than 6 million jobs since December \n2007. The Small Business Jobs Act provides the long overdue assistance \nto small businesses that will help create as many as 500,000 new jobs.\n  To assist small business owners and their employees, the Small \nBusiness Jobs Act will create jobs through a combination of much-needed \ntax credits, enhancements to Small Business Administration, SBA, \nlending programs, and the development of new community bank lending \nfacilities.\n  I am very pleased this legislation will extend the successful loan \nenhancement provisions that Senator Schumer and I successfully included \nin the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The bill extends the \nprovisions in the economic stimulus to increase the SBA guarantee rate \nto 90 percent and reduces fees on small business 7(a) and 504 loans \nobtained through the SBA. These provisions have supported more than $30 \nbillion in lending to small businesses across the country and helped \ncreate or retain more than 710,000 jobs. SBA lending in Massachusetts \nhas nearly doubled in the past year as a result of this program.\n  As the former chairman of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have been a long time advocate of small businesses \nand appreciate the role they play in our economy. The Small Business \nJobs Act includes provisions that I have worked on for several years.\n  The loan increases included in the bill build upon my legislation \nfrom last Congress. With 7(a) loan limits increased from $2 million to \n$5 million and 504 loans from $1.5 million to $5.5 million, small \nbusinesses will be better able to expand and meet their financial needs \nfor sustainability and growth.\n  The Small Business Jobs Acts expands upon the small business capital \ngains provision included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nof 2009. The bill temporarily increases the small business capital \ngains exclusion from 75 percent to 100 percent and eliminates the AMT \npreference.\n  Back in 1993, I worked with Senator Bumpers to enact legislation to \nexclude half of capital gains from the sale of small business stock \nthat is held for 5 years. The bill before us expands on this provision.\n  I have also worked with Senator Ensign on a provision included in \nthis legislation that would remove cell phones and other similar \ndevises from the definition of listed property so their cost can be \ndeducted or depreciated like other business property, without onerous \nrecordkeeping requirements.\n  In 1989, Congress passed a law which added cell phones to the \ndefinition of listed property under the Internal Revenue Code. Back in \n1989, cell phone technology was an expensive technology worthy of \ndetailed log sheets. Only a few top executives had cell phones. At that \ntime, it was difficult to envision cell phones that could be placed in \na pocket or handbag. Congress was skeptical about the daily business \nuse of cell phones.\n  With technology changing rapidly and many people owning a cell phone \nand a blackberry, a strict substantiation requirement to determine \npersonal use is burdensome, inefficient, and administratively \nimpracticable given their frequent use in a fast-paced global \nenvironment. The Tax Code should keep pace with technological advances. \nThere is no longer a reason that cell phones and mobile communication \ndevices should be treated differently than office phones or computers.\n  Investing in small businesses is essential to turning around the \neconomy. Not only will investment in small business spur job creation, \nit will lead to new technological breakthroughs. This bill is long \noverdue and I am pleased that it is close to becoming a reality. I urge \nall my colleagues to support this critical legislation for our economy.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to express my support \nfor the passage of H.R. 5297, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. I am \npleased that we got cloture on this legislation earlier this week, so \nwe can get a final vote on the bill before the Senate completes its \nwork for the week.\n  Things are more challenging now for our Nation than at any time \nduring my life. Americans are worried about our Nation's future and \ntheir own personal well-being, and this uncertainty reveals itself in \nthe answers to two questions I often ask when I speak to people. The \ntwo questions I ask are, one, do you have a better standard of living \nthan your parents had? To which I always hear yes. And two, do you \nbelieve your children will have a better standard of living than the \none you have? To which I almost always hear no.\n  To recover from this recession, we need to restore the faith of the \nAmerican people in their future. We need to convince them that the \nglass is half full, and not half empty. And until we stabilize and \nrepair our broken economy, and restore the flow of credit to businesses \nand individuals, the uncertainty and pessimism will remain.\n  This small business bill gives us one opportunity to address our \neconomic challenges. The small business bill will improve the \nenvironment for small businesses by, among other things, including a \nnumber of small business tax breaks, expanding Small Business \nAdministration loan programs, providing tax incentives for new small \nbusiness investment, and expanding small business access to credit.\n  The bill will increase the guarantee of SBA's most popular loan \nprogram, which provides credit for small businesses that cannot \notherwise obtain favorable loan terms, and it would provide higher \nmaximum loan amounts for investments in major fixed assets, such as \nland, buildings, equipment, and machinery. It would also provide a \nvariety of export assistance tools to help our small businesses expand \ntheir reach into world markets and compete better in the global \neconomy. These include a new grant program, counseling and education, \nredirecting SBA personnel, and improving export financing programs. \nFinally, this bill will extend tax incentives, such as section 179 \nexpensing and bonus depreciation, which will generate new investment.\n  I have heard from many Ohio businesses regarding this small business \nbill, especially manufacturing businesses, which are the backbone of \nOhio's economy. These small business owners have asked me to work with \nmy colleagues and finish work on this legislation. A number of \nmanufacturing organizations, which represent small businesses in Ohio \nand around the country, have written to me in support of the bill, \nincluding the Ohio Manufacturers Association, the Precision Machined \nProducts Association, PMPA, the Precision Metalforming Association, \nPMA, the National Tooling and Machining Association, NTMA, and the \nMotor and Equipment Manufacturers Association. They share many of the \nsame concerns; they are worried about their member companies' ability \nto obtain credit and keep afloat long enough to get out of this \nrecession.\n  Many small businesses have been unable to obtain credit from their \ntraditional lenders, which has led to less spending and more layoffs. \nFor example, I was told that a Cleveland-based PMPA manufacturer that \nhas been in business for over 50 years, and whose owner has served on \nthe board of directors of several major banks, could not find \nsufficient credit in the United States. As a result, the company had to \nseek offshore lending, which it eventually found in Germany. I have \nheard similar stories from a number of small business owners. They \ncomplain that they cannot get loans or their lines of credit are being \nreduced or withdrawn despite their company's creditworthiness.\n  These groups, which represent thousands of small businesses and their \nemployees, have sent me letters in support of this legislation, and I \nwill ask that these letters be printed in the Record. I wanted to share \none comment from a longtime friend of mine, James B. McGregor, Sr., \nvice chairman of McGregor Metalworking Companies in Springfield, OH, \nwho said that this bill would ``help to jumpstart manufacturing in \nAmerica by improving the credit market for small businesses.'' Jim is \nthe owner of a family-owned manufacturing company, and he knows as well \nas anyone how tough things are out there for manufacturers.\n  In addition to small manufacturers, others organizations also support \nthis small business bill. Many community banks say it would allow them \nmore latitude to lend to small businesses. The Independent Community \nBankers Association, which represents 5,000 of the Nation's 8,000 \ncommunity banks,\n\n[[Page S7153]]\n\nsaid in a letter to the two Senate leaders that of all the provisions \nin this bill, the Small Business Lending Fund, SBLF, ``holds the most \npromise for small business creation in the near term. Failure to even \nconsider the SBLF in the Senate would be a missed opportunity that our \nstruggling economy cannot afford . . . [i]t would provide another \noption for community banks to leverage capital and expand credit to \nsmall business.''\n  The American Bankers Association, ABA, has expressed support for the \nbill because it would allow ``community banks to find new sources of \ncapital . . . [and] provides an option for banks to . . . continue \nmeeting the needs of their communities.'' The ABA also supports the \nbill because it would enhance SBA loan programs, which it says is \n``critically important and will help lenders provide loans so that \nsmall businesses can create jobs in their communities.''\n  Other business organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and \nFinancial Services Roundtable support the bill because they know it \ncontains important tax provisions, strengthens existing SBA programs, \nand helps our economy.\n  So, my support for the small business legislation is based upon the \nmany calls of support I heard from Ohio's small and medium \nmanufacturers, most of whom are still struggling to recover from this \nrecession. At the same time, these manufacturers are experiencing the \nfiercest competition I have seen in my lifetime.\n\n  My support of Ohio's manufacturers is not new, and my support of this \nbill is a part of my longstanding concern for and support of Ohio's \nmanufacturing companies. As Governor of Ohio, I am proud that we gave \nhigh priority to manufacturing and that it grew for the first time in \nmany years during my administration. We instituted several incentives \nfor manufacturing, including a job-creation tax credit, a manufacturing \nand equipment investment tax credit, and the technology investment tax \ncredit. As Governor, I went on nine business, trade, and investment \nmissions, with the intention of helping open new markets for Ohio \nproducts, and I am hopeful that the export promotion efforts in this \nlegislation will help Ohio's manufacturers take advantage of selling in \nthe global market.\n  When I came to the Senate, I continued to support manufacturing, \nmaking it a key priority of my legislative efforts. For example, during \nPresident Bush's first term, I worked with the administration, when it \nfiled the section 201 action, to support the U.S. steel industry at a \ntime when imports were coming in at an increasing rate and threatening \nthe industry's existence. And after a painful period of adjustment, the \nsteel industry came back. I am afraid of what might have been the fate \nof this important industry had President Bush not taken action. I am \nalso proud that I was the chief advocate to the President and Secretary \nof Commerce Don Evans of the need for an Assistant Secretary of \nManufacturing as well as a plan to support manufacturing. From 2006 to \n2008, I worked closely with Senator Bayh, who is also from a \nmanufacturing State, to pass legislation to improve our Nation's \nintellectual property theft enforcement efforts. These efforts were \nrewarded when the PRO-IP Act became law in October 2008. Our efforts to \npass this legislation may have surprised some who view IP theft as \nsomething related to knockoff purses and software, but IP theft has \nsuch a damaging effect on our manufacturers, we both viewed this as an \nimportant way to help our manufacturers compete on a level playing \nfield in the global economy.\n  Most recently, I have worked to protect manufacturing from onerous \ncap-and-trade legislation that would have a devastating effect on \nmanufacturing, while doing little to improve emissions from countries \nsuch as China and India. I have also worked on a bipartisan basis to \nreauthorize the surface transportation act. This is another must-pass \nbill that would provide certainty to a number of industries and would \nhelp our manufacturers recover from this recession. I have spoken to \nthe President about the need to pass a highway bill, and I was \nencouraged that he has promised to take a leading role in getting it \ndone.\n  I know that my Republican colleagues have concerns with the lending \nfacility and what it means for the role of government in the private \nsector. I have heard their concerns, but based on the feedback I have \nheard, mostly from Ohio's small businesses, I reached the conclusion \nthat this $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund will help banks that \nserve local communities to expand their lending at a time when credit \nto small businesses has tightened for a variety of reasons. These are \nthe community banks that make the small but necessary loans to \nrestaurants, small manufacturers, home improvement contractors and the \nlike to keep their businesses afloat and hopefully begin to expand as \nthe economy recovers. In addition, the program is voluntary for these \nbanks, and the lending fund is estimated by the Congressional Budget \nOffice to save money. In other words, the lending fund will not add to \nthe budget deficit or the national debt, and it will not increase \ntaxes. So this fund amounts to a relatively modest, voluntary, revenue-\nneutral financial tool for small community banks helping to restore the \nflow of credit small businesses desperately need.\n  Finally, for those who are trying to make this a partisan bill, I \nwill say there is enough blame to go around. The Democrats in Congress \ndelayed passing this bill for many weeks. They denied Republicans the \nopportunity to amend the bill for many weeks, while we held political \nvotes on a number of issues. The President then went on to politicize \nthe bill, ignoring legitimate complaints about the lack of amendments \nfrom my side of the aisle. It is worth remembering the Senate moved to \nthe bill on June 29, then abandoned it repeatedly to vote on \nunemployment benefits multiple times, financial regulation, \nsupplemental appropriations, executive nominations, the DISCLOSE Act, \nand the teacher bailout, which took us into the August recess. Then \nwhen discussions about Republican amendments were finally starting to \nreceive serious consideration, these amendments were countered by \nDemocratic amendments, leading to an amendment tit for tat, which is \ntoo often the case.\n  But while I am disappointed that my colleagues were unable to offer \namendments to this bill, which is one of the traditions of the Senate, \nI felt we could no longer wait to pass this legislation. We needed to \ndo something now to help the economy get going, and hopefully we will \nget back to the Senate tradition of offering amendments and having \nvotes. Finally, I am pleased that there was a vote on at least one \nRepublican amendment, the amendment offered by Senator Johanns, which \nwould repeal an extremely burdensome reporting requirement for small \nbusinesses included in the health care reform bill. While I am \ndisappointed that it failed and small businesses continued to be \nthreatened by this burden, I am hopeful that this amendment process has \nbrought enough attention to the problem and it can be fixed before the \nend of this year.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I will continue to work to pass a robust \nhighway reauthorization bill this year, which I strongly believe would \nhelp improve our economy, and once again, I ask President Obama and \nMajority Leader Reid, to work with the relevant committees to complete \nwork on a multiyear, paid for, reauthorization of the highway bill \nbefore the 111th Congress adjourns.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the letters to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Precision Metalforming Association and National Tooling & \n           Machining Association,\n                                                    July 23, 2010.\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: On behalf of One Voice, the joint \n     effort between the National Tooling and Machining Association \n     (NTMA) and the Precision Metalforming Association (PMA), and \n     our nearly 3,000 metalworking member companies, thank you for \n     your continued efforts to support small businesses \n     manufacturing in America. Your vote on the Small Business \n     Loan Fund Amendment was critical to helping support small \n     businesses access timely and sufficient credit and to \n     domestic manufacturing growth.\n       Many small and medium-sized manufacturers continue to face \n     challenges accessing timely and sufficient credit for day-to-\n     day\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\n     operations, investing in capital equipment and raw materials, \n     increasing worker hours, and hiring more employees. The lack \n     of availability of credit has led to decreased spending, \n     increased layoffs, and depleted collateral in many \n     industries, including metalworking. In the current \n     environment, many lenders are steering clear of perceived \n     ``at risk'' industries such as manufacturers who are \n     temporarily impaired. This legislation will improve the \n     lending environment and will help America's small \n     manufacturers strengthen their businesses and continue to \n     lead our nation's economic recovery.\n       Thank you again for your long history of supporting \n     America's manufacturers. We look forward to continuing to \n     work with you and your staff on issues critical to \n     strengthening manufacturing in America.\n           Sincerely,\n     William E.

Lack of capital is stunting \n     economic growth and the Loan Fund program is an important \n     component of improving the situation and spurring the \n     economy.\n       As we work to recover and strengthen manufacturing in \n     America, access to sufficient and timely credit is a critical \n     component.

Our members are small and medium-sized, \n     mostly family-owned businesses who rely on timely and \n     adequate lines of credit to purchase raw materials and make \n     significant investment in their operations.\n       As you know, the vast majority of small businesses turn to \n     their local community banks for lines of credit. However, due \n     to numerous market conditions and regulatory restrictions, \n     lenders have reduced or revoked credit lines even for \n     profitable companies in Ohio seeking to purchase equipment \n     and hire workers to meet increased demand and new job orders. \n     Tool and die makers in particular are expected by their \n     customers to invest significant capital up front when \n     manufacturing a product and are often not paid for several \n     months and at times for over a year. The nature of this \n     industry requires an adequate and stable credit market and \n     this legislation is an important step to jumpstarting \n     American manufacturers.\n       Thank you for your support of this legislation and your \n     continued leadership in Washington on behalf of small and \n     medium-sized manufacturers. We especially appreciate the \n     dedication and time your staff has committed over the years \n     supporting the needs of over 16,000 manufacturing companies \n     in Ohio.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Robert L.

Your efforts \n     to help pass the Small Business Jobs Act is critical to \n     jumpstarting the economy. Our members continue to report \n     challenges accessing timely and sufficient credit to help run \n     day-to-day operations, invest in their facilities and hire \n     new employees. Your support of this bill will improve the \n     credit environment for small manufacturers and expand growth.\n       Ohio manufacturers are the backbone of our economy, \n     employing more than 600,000 people in our state. Many of \n     these companies report they are ready to expand and take on \n     new business but the tight capital markets restrict their \n     ability to increase production and purchase raw materials. \n     One year ago, 72 percent of respondents to our industry \n     survey expected to encounter challenges with credit when the \n     economy improves--their predictions have come true.\n       Senator, as you recently said, ``We don't have time \n     anymore. This country is really hurting.'' Nowhere is this \n     more true than in Ohio. You and your staff have tirelessly \n     worked to strengthen manufacturing in America and your \n     support of this legislation to improve the lending \n     environment for our businesses is critical.\n       Thank you again and we look forward to continuing to work \n     with you on this and other important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William E.

The Senate is \n     expected to vote on the bill next week.\n       ``Senator Voinovich's support of this bill continues his \n     long history of standing with small and medium sized \n     manufacturers in this country,'' said PMA member James B. \n     McGregor, Sr. vice chairman of McGregor Metalworking \n     Companies in Springfield, OH. ``We greatly appreciate his \n     support in helping to jumpstart manufacturing in America by \n     improving the credit market for small businesses.''\n       McGregor, who also serves on the Manufacturing Council, a \n     forum established by the U.S. Department of Commerce to \n     ensure regular communication between the federal government \n     and the manufacturing sector, added: ``While a slew of \n     proposals to boost manufacturing have been announced in the \n     past couple of weeks by both political parties, most of these \n     proposals are months, if not years, away from Congressional \n     action. By improving access to credit, the Small Business \n     Jobs Act can help small and medium sized manufacturers now. \n     We urge the Senate to pass this bill as soon as possible.''\n       For additional information or to arrange an interview with \n     a PMA or NTMA manufacturer, please contact Caitlin Andrews at \n     202-828-7637 or caitlin.andrews@bgllp.com\n       About NTMA: NTMA is the national association representing \n     the precision custom manufacturing industry, which employs \n     more than 440,000 skilled workers in the United States.

George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: The Motor & Equipment Manufacturers \n     Association (MEMA), along with its affiliated associations, \n     Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA), Heavy \n     Duty Manufacturers Association (HDMA), and Original Equipment \n     Suppliers Association (OESA), applaud and thank you for your \n     leadership in ending the stalemate in the Senate on the Small \n     Business Jobs and Credit Act (H.R. 5297).\n       A vibrant parts manufacturing industry is critical not only \n     to the state of Ohio, but to the entire nation. This bill is \n     critical to help smaller manufacturers, including parts \n     suppliers, access the credit they need to reinvest in and \n     grow their businesses. MEMA strongly supports H.R. 5297 and \n     believes that both the creation of a Small Business Lending \n     Fund to assist banks in increasing small business capital \n     investment lending as well as the establishment of a State \n     Small Business Credit Initiative that allocates federal funds \n     for states to partner with financial institutions will \n     directly and immediately help small manufacturers.\n       Again, thank you for your willingness to step in and help \n     move this important bill forward for Senate passage. We are \n     very grateful for your leadership and political courage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert E. McKenna,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, it has been nearly 2\\1/2\\ months since \nthe majority leader first brought small business jobs legislation to \nthe floor, and now this bill will pass the Senate through a constrained \nprocess under which the majority has continually stunted our ability to \noffer amendments, dictating to our side which amendments they \nconsidered worthy--something I find abhorrent and antithetical to this \ninstitution. And I might add, before the votes we held Tuesday on the \nJohanns and Nelson amendments on the 1099 issue, we had voted on just \none amendment during consideration of this bill--an amendment to \nreinstate an ill-conceived and divisive lending fund into the bill. And \nwith the failed votes on the 1099 issue, we inexplicably and \nregrettably punted on a chance to help millions of small businesses \nsave the time, cost, and effort of sending billions of new information \nreporting forms to the IRS and to other businesses.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I have come \nto the floor several times during recent months to express my regret \nover the procedural twists and turns that have gotten us to this point. \nClearly, we have had ample opportunity to consider and pass meaningful \nsmall business jobs legislation. Yet time after time other priorities \nhave taken precedence. Most recently, it was the August recess that \ntook us away from Washington for 5 weeks while small businesses \ncontinued to call for help. They didn't get an August recess. They \ndidn't have the luxury of putting things on hold while the economic \nsituation failed to improve. As I said in July on the Senate floor, it \nseems as if we have forgotten how to talk to one another here, how to \nwork together and forge a bipartisan and sensible solution to a problem \nthat plagues our economy.\n  A prime example of this is the recent votes we took to repeal the \nonerous and imprudent mandate in the health care legislation regarding \nthe filing of 1099 forms by millions of businesses. It will require \nthat, starting in 2012, every business in America must report to the \nIRS on business purchases that exceed a threshold of only $600 per \nvendor or supplier. This mandate would include purchases of supplies \nand equipment, as well as purchases of services ranging from cell phone \ncoverage to window washing to utilities.\n  This new mandate was imposed in the health reform law, yet it has \nnothing to do with health insurance reform. It makes the Federal \nGovernment a more intrusive and burdensome presence in every aspect of \nAmerican business--which is the very last thing American business needs \nduring these tumultuous economic times. What small firms are clamoring \nfor is certainty. They look to the Federal Government to help foster an \nentrepreneurial environment under which they can do what they do best--\ncreate new jobs--and not saddle them with an incessant and unnecessary \npaperwork burden like this new 1099 filing requirement. This new system \nof 1099s has absolutely nothing to do with a direct tax liability in a \ngiven year. Instead, this reporting regime will allow the IRS to track \nbusiness purchases that exceed $600. Businesses typically have an \nintense focus on carefully tracking their sales to customers with \nmarketing professionals. Rather than tracking sales to customers, this \nnew government mandate will force a change in business focus to a \ndetailed accounting of purchases from suppliers.\n  While controlling costs is clearly a vital component of business \nprofitability, this new government mandate on cost accounting and \nreporting to the IRS is an inordinate shift of priorities that will \nharm competitiveness and profitability because it will shift focus and \nresources away from customers. We had bipartisan support to eliminate \nthis provision, and yet we couldn't agree to repeal this provision \nbecause 52 Democrats opposed Senator Johanns amendment. How out of \ntouch and disconnected can the majority be? American business owners \nare desperate for relief from taxes and regulation, and we can't even \nagree to help them. Instead, we are going to impede their ability to \nthrive and grow.\n  Indeed, for the small businesses that attempt to comply with this tax \nreporting mandate, this paperwork burden will be imposed with a \ncrushing effect. New tracking systems will have to be implemented for \npurchases in order to ensure that aggregated purchases exceeding $600 \nare reported to the IRS. In fact, according to a National Federation of \nIndependent Business, or NFIB, small business survey, at $74 an hour, \ntax paperwork is the most expensive paperwork burden placed on small \nbusinesses by the Federal Government. The Small Business Administration \nhas found that the cost of tax compliance is already 67 percent higher \nin small firms than in large firms. And because this new 1099 reporting \nburden would be so ubiquitous for firms attempting to be compliant--by \nrequiring new processes of making business purchases and tracking of \nbusiness purchases--this compliance cost statistic is likely to become \nwoefully outdated as costs soar ever higher. Mr. President, we ought to \nbe reducing the small business regulatory compliance burden, not \naugmenting it.\n\n  So, once again, here we are, and the only amendment that the majority \nhas seen prudent to approve reinstates an ill-conceived Treasury \nlending fund that has been widely recognized as ``TARP Jr.,'' while we \nfail to vote in favor of an amendment introduced by Senator Johanns \nthat could have helped small businesses.\n  Simply put, we will rely on small businesses to lead us out of the \npresent economic morass. According to the Small Business \nAdministration, or SBA, small firms have created 64 percent of net new \njobs over the past 15 years. And since they represent 99.7 percent of \nall employer firms and employ slightly more than half of all private \nsector employees, it is more than evident that our overall economy's \nhealth is based on the well-being of our Nation's almost 30 million \nsmall businesses. With our Nation's unemployment rate hovering near 10 \npercent since last August--over a whole year ago--and standing at a \nregrettable 9.6 percent today, it will require nearly unprecedented \neconomic growth to reverse this trend.\n  We have 14.9 million Americans on the unemployment rolls, searching \nfor opportunities in what often seems to them a hopeless situation. \nAccording to the most recent ADP Employment Report, we learned that \nprivate-sector companies actually shed 10,000 jobs in August--news \nwhich the firm noted ``. . . confirms a pause in the recovery,\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\nalready evident in other economic data.'' From February through July, \n``. . . the average monthly gain in employment was 37,000 with no \nevidence of acceleration.'' By any measure, these job creation figures \nare lackluster and insufficient.\n  Yet if we are to spur a full-fledged recovery that recoups the jobs \nwe have lost since the start of the recession in December 2007, the \nNFIB's latest Economic Trends survey notes that ``. . . to restore 2007 \nemployment levels and unemployment rates by 2013, we need a net 400,000 \nnew jobs every month for 3 years''--which, given the numbers coming \nfrom both the Department of Labor and ADP, would be next to impossible. \nWe have hit the mark of 400,000 jobs in 1 month only once this year--in \nMay--and that was due to the hiring of 411,000 census workers. Indeed, \nthe private sector only grew by 41,000 jobs that month.\n  Furthermore, with respect to our economic growth, the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis late last month revised its estimate of GDP growth \ndownward to an astonishingly low 1.6 percent for the second quarter of \n2010, from an earlier prediction of 2.4 percent.\n  Let's be clear. This kind of growth is insufficient to reduce \nunemployment and bolster our economic future, and it certainly will not \ninstill the level of confidence that small business owners require in \ndecisions to take risks and invest in their businesses. In fact, just \nbefore the July 4th recess, I met with the president of the Boston \nFederal Reserve, Eric Rosengren. And as he noted, the ``growth'' the \neconomy has shown thus far is for the most part in inventory--and this \nis not actually ``real growth.'' Right now, our government is the only \nreal growth industry in this country, and that is not a recipe for \nfuture prosperity and the kind of innovation that has always placed \nAmerica on the vanguard in an exceptionally competitive global \nmarketplace.\n  So what will be required? In the Federal Reserve's analysis, roughly \na 6-percent growth in GDP will be necessary just to equalize the job \nlosses we have suffered by the end of 2012. That rate would be almost \nthe same level of growth we experienced during the recovery from the \n1982 recession and approximately double the growth following the 1991 \nand 2001 recessions. Indeed, even to attain a 5-percent unemployment \nrate by the end of 2015, it would require annual growth of 4.2 percent. \nThe last time we witnessed sustained annual GDP growth near that level \nwas the late 1990s, peaking at 4.8 percent growth in 1999. So we have \nour work cut out for us.\n  Yet, while small businesses are looking to Washington for some \ncertainty in the tax and regulatory policies they deal with on a daily \nbasis, there has been a stark disconnect between Washington and the \nentire rest of the country. This vast chasm is vividly discernible in \nthe NFIB's July Small Business Economic Trends report, which describes \nsmall businesses' optimism as being at an ``unprecedented'' low. The \nreport went on to state that ``the U.S. economy faces hurricane force \nheadwinds and the government is at the center of the storm, making an \neconomic recovery very difficult.''\n\n  The NFIB's June survey noted that the optimism index remained in \n``recession'' territory, and even with some signs of life in our \neconomy, ``Washington, D.C. . . . seem[s] determined to undermine any \neconomic forward momentum for small business owners.'' That report \nfurther stated that ``Congress continues to pass and propose \nlegislation that increases the cost of running a business and create \nhuge uncertainty about future costs.'' And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nadded its own dire analysis of Washington's actions in an open letter \nin mid-July, asserting that, ``By straying from the proven principles \nof American free enterprise, policymakers are needlessly prolonging the \neconomic agony of the recession for millions of Americans and their \nfamilies.'' These candid assessments of how small business owners view \nthe actions of this Congress and this administration must \nunquestionably be heeded if we are to ever regain the trust of the \nAmerican people. As I said earlier, the majority is detached from \nreality.\n  So clearly there is a demonstrable necessity for a broad jobs package \nthat will get our Nation's small businesses back on track and spark the \nidling engines of our economy. The substitute amendment that has been \nlaid down contains a solid foundation for investing in jobs that \nincludes many of the provisions I have championed over the last year \nand a half and that formed the core of my Small Business Job Creation \nAct, S. 3103. This includes crucial measures to bolster Small Business \nAdministration, or SBA, lending, increase the number of small companies \nthat export to foreign markets, and provide immediate tax relief to our \nNation's true job creators. In fact, the Small Business Committee has \napproved many of these provisions unanimously, and the President of the \nUnited States has called for them to be included a jobs package.\n  One of the critical starting points of this legislation is taking \nsteps to stem the endemic credit crisis our Nation's business community \nis still facing. This bill will address this stifling credit crunch \nthat is placing a perilous chokehold on our economy across the country \nso that we can do something viable and bold to confront such a \nuniversally-acknowledged problem.\n  We can begin to turn around this deplorable trend by boosting the \nSBA's capacity for facilitating access to credit. This bill includes \nkey lending provisions from a measure I introduced with Small Business \nCommittee Chair Landrieu, which was reported out of our committee by a \nvote of 17 to 1, to increase the maximum limits for SBA 7(a) and 504 \nloans from $2 million to $5 million; raise the maximum microloan limit \nfrom $35,000 to $50,000; and allow for the refinancing of conventional \nsmall business loans through the SBA 504 program. These loans are \ncritical to small businesses that utilize this capital in starting \ntheir firms and investing in equipment and expansion. It should be \nevident to everyone in this Chamber why 81 business organizations have \nendorsed these provisions.\n  I would note that enhancing SBA loans has already paid tremendous \ndividends. In the stimulus, we included initiatives to increase SBA \nmaximum 7(a) loan guarantees from 80 percent to 90 percent and to \nreduce certain 7(a) and 504 lender and borrower fees. But, regrettably, \nthese provisions have lapsed, and these initiatives, which are credited \nwith increasing loan volumes by a remarkable 90 percent nationwide and \n236 percent in Maine, have, to my dismay, come to a close. At a time \nwhen unemployment hovers at unsustainable levels and consumer \nconfidence hangs in abeyance, nothing could be more counterintuitive \nthan to allow these provisions to remain moribund. In fact, we have \nseen the dramatic results to SBA lending since the expiration of these \ncritical enhancements. In August alone, the SBA approved only $1.097 \nbillion in SBA 7(a) guaranteed loans, a 43-percent decrease from the \n$1.9 billion in 7(a) loans it approved in May, the last month of the \nfee relief and higher guarantees.\n  That is why I introduced an amendment to this bill along with \nSenators Grassley, Enzi, Isakson, and Collins, to resuscitate these \nhighly effective programs--and I am pleased that the majority leader \nhas included a modification of our amendment in the most recent \nsubstitute. This language would provide $505 million to reinstate SBA \nfee reductions and the elevated guarantee on SBA 7(a) loans through the \nend of 2010.\n  Additionally, we must provide tax incentives to the small business \ncommunity in order to foster job creation. We know from survey after \nsurvey that small business owners consider taxes to be one of the \nbiggest impediments to the growth of their firms. Indeed, in the \nNational Small Business Association's 2009 Year-End Economic Report, 38 \npercent of respondents to their survey noted Federal taxes as one of \nthe three most significant challenges to the future growth and survival \nof their businesses--a category trumped only by the ongoing economic \nuncertainty pervading our Nation. To help mitigate this uncertainty, \nthe tax portion of this bill that Chairman Baucus and ranking member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, helped negotiate \nincludes three critical components: cash flow, investment incentives, \nand fairness.\n  The lifeblood of a small business is its cash flow, and so this bill \ncontains several provisions that will improve the cash flow status of a \ncompany. The provision that is most remarkable will\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\nalso address a fundamental injustice of the TAX CODE: permitting the \nself-employed, like realtors, a full deduction for the first time ever \nfor health insurance premiums against not only income taxes but also \nagainst payroll taxes. At a rate of 15.3 percent, for many small \nbusiness owners the self-employment tax, or SECA tax, imposed on the \nhealth benefits of the business owner is an expensive injustice that \nonly adds to the already exorbitant cost of health insurance. \nRegrettably, the health reform bill that was jammed through Congress \nearlier this year fell far short for small businesses. So allowing the \nfull deduction for health insurance for the self-employed is critical \nfor affordability.\n  This substitute will also allow for general business credits to be \ncarried back 5 years and taken against the alternative minimum tax, or \nAMT. When Congress implements policies through the TAX CODE, we expect \nbusinesses to utilize these incentives. Unfortunately, during a \ndownward business cycle as we have been in for 2 full years, businesses \ndo not have income tax liability that can be offset with a credit. The \n5-year carryback of credits will allow business owners to reach back to \nprior years when they had taxable income and offset prior tax liability \nwith these credits to get an immediate cash infusion. They can use this \ncash as they choose, but, as we have seen with net operating loss \nrelief, they use these funds for anything from meeting payroll to \ninvesting in new equipment. This same principle applies with respect to \nthe provision that allows credits to be used against the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  And with regard to investing in new equipment, more businesses will \nbe incentivized to make equipment purchases or upgrade their physical \nspaces. Real property has never been included in ``expensing,'' and \nthis would allow ``Main Street'' businesses such as retail, \nrestaurants, and dentist offices, to renovate and make other \nimprovements to their buildings in 2010 and 2011 and immediately deduct \nthose costs. In this legislation, we also increase the expensing \nlimitation to $500,000 for equipment. This is double the amount \npreviously permitted. However the bill would also bifurcate that amount \nso that up to $250,000 of expenses for real property can be expensed \nand the business can still purchase up to $250,000 of equipment.\n  One final tax provision I would like to discuss concerns investment \nin small business. Senator Kerry and I have long championed allowing \nfor the complete exclusion on capital gains attributable to small \nbusiness stock held for 5 years. The President touted this effort in \nhis State of the Union Address. I hope this will help jumpstart \ncritical investment in our Nation's small businesses.\n  Furthermore, this bill would take critical steps to inject some \nfairness into the Federal contracting process for small businesses. And \nit also includes $50 million in funding for small business development \ncenters, which provide critical technical assistance and counseling to \nsmall businesses at over 1,000 locations nationwide. The SBDC program \nhas a proven track record of job creation. According to an annual \nreport by Dr. James Chrisman at Mississippi State University, between \n2007 and 2008, employment levels of SBDC clients increased 10 percent \nmore than for U.S. businesses in general. As a result of the additional \nfunding included in this package, Dr. Chrisman estimates that over \n20,000 new jobs would be created, while tens of thousands more will be \nsaved.\n  Just as there is much we can do right away domestically, our \nlegislation will also take action to help our small businesses compete \nglobally. Given that fewer than 1 percent of U.S. small businesses \nexport, it is all the more vital that we take advantage of this \nuntapped market and help those enterprises sell their goods and \nservices to the 95 percent of the world's customers who live outside \nour borders. In his State of the Union Address, President Obama made \nclear that we must double our exports over the next 5 years, and small \nbusinesses are a critical component of the administration's strategy \nand our national competitiveness.\n\n  For this reason, this bill includes small business exporting \nprovisions from legislation I introduced with Chair Landrieu. The \nprovisions in this bill--larger SBA export loan limits, expanded export \ntechnical assistance, and enhanced assistance for trade promotion--have \nbipartisan support, they were reported unanimously by our committee \nlast December, and they have administration support and have also been \nendorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These provisions could create \nroughly 46,000 new American jobs in the year after enactment and \n200,000 jobs over the next 5 years.\n  Another theme that I frequently hear from small businesses is that \nthe regulatory environment promoted by Washington is too complex and \noften detrimental to their ability to expand operations and create \njobs. As such, this legislation strengthens the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct by requiring agencies to respond to the SBA Chief Counsel of \nAdvocacy's comments in the final rules that they promulgate. This will \nhelp to ensure that the potentially devastating impacts to small \nbusiness job creation are fully considered during the Federal \nrulemaking process. It also seeks more independence for the Office of \nAdvocacy by mandating a separate line item in the administration's \nannual budget. These provisions are strongly supported by a variety of \ngroups, including the National Federation of Independent Business, the \nU.S. Chamber, and the National Small Business Association.\n  Yet, despite all of these provisions--many of which I helped craft \nand many of which have broad, bipartisan support--regrettably, I cannot \nsupport this bill as it stands because of the reckless and wrongheaded \n$30 billion lending fund contained in the legislation. I have spoken at \nlength about this on the Senate floor before, but let me remind my \ncolleagues--once again--what we are voting on with this lending fund.\n  First, regardless of what proponents of the lending fund will say, it \nis essentially an extension of the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or \nTARP, which just terminated with the enactment of financial regulatory \nreform legislation. This is not simply my analysis. In a May 17, 2010, \nletter that Mr. Barofsky, the special inspector general of TARP, wrote \nto the Members of the House of Representatives, he states that ``. . . \nin terms of its basic design, its participants, its application \nprocess, and, perhaps its funding source from an oversight perspective, \nthe SBLF [Lending Fund] would essentially be an extension of TARP's CPP \n[Capital Purchase Program] program. . . .'' So if the experts tell us \nthat it looks like TARP--well, let's not kid ourselves--regardless of \nhow the proponents want to spin this, it is still TARP.\n  Additionally, there are unintended consequences that may result from \nTreasury's Small Business Lending Fund which certainly raise a red flag \nfor me. It is possible that instead of promoting quality loans, the \nproposal could encourage unnecessarily risky behavior by banks. The \nTreasury Department proposes to lend funds to banks, at a 5-percent \ninterest rate, which can then be reduced to as low as 1 percent if the \ninstitutions in turn increase their small business lending. However, if \nthe banks fail to increase their small business lending, the interest \nrate they pay could rise to a more punitive 7 percent. This could lead \nto the ``moral hazard'' of banks making risky loans to avoid paying \nhigher interest rates.\n  Finally, I have serious concerns about the cost of the program. The \nlending fund provision that is in the Reid substitute remains virtually \nidentical, for scoring purposes, to how it was in the House-passed \nsmall business bill, H.R. 5297. That score is based on a cash--based \nestimate. Under a cash-based estimate, the Congressional Budget Office, \nor CBO, listed the official score for the lending fund as raising $1.1 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  Although CBO was bound to score the provision under a cash-based \nestimate, the office also highlights in that same score--and I quote--\n``Estimates prepared on a `fair-value' basis include the cost of the \nrisk that the government has assumed; as a result, they provide a more \ncomprehensive measure of the cost of the financial commitments than \nestimates done on a FCRA basis or on a cash basis. CBO estimates that \nthe cost of the SBLF [Lending Fund] on such a fair-value basis (that \nis, reflecting market risk) would be $6.2 billion.'' That is right, CBO \nis warning that although it is bound to score the\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\nprovision using a cash-based estimate, a more comprehensive scoring \nmethod reveals a potential $6.2 billion loss to taxpayers. I raised \nthis issue on the floor during the debate on the lending fund, but my \nopponents have simply ignored this concern. Certainly, this should have \nbeen taken into full consideration when evaluating the potential costs \nand benefits of the program and its effect on our increasing budget \ndeficit.\n  Finally, I note that this past Tuesday, the Washington Post ran an \narticle demonstrating that, while larger banks are generally associated \nwith TARP, ``. . . it's a collection of smaller banks that continued to \nplague the Treasury Department's bank bailout program.'' In fact, the \narticle cited that ``the latest report from the agency shows that more \nthan 120 institutions--nearly all of them small banks--have missed \ntheir scheduled quarterly dividend payments.'' So I do not understand \nwhy the majority wants to create a new program for small banks that has \nthe same characteristics of TARP, when many of those banks are already \nparticipating in TARP and have been delinquent on their payments.\n  So I am truly disappointed that we have arrived at this point.

Mr. President, I am shortly going to move to the Defense \nauthorization bill. I hope we can avoid a cloture vote on it. But from \nwhat I have been able to determine, that will not be possible. I have \nhad a number of conversations with Democratic Senators and Republican \nSenators. I have explained to them that if we are permitted to move to \nthe bill, either by consent or cloture on the motion to proceed, there \nare a number of amendments that I think need to be considered on it \ninitially. I have stated what those would be more than likely.\n  In my conversations with my Republican friends, they have indicated \nthat they want, likely, more than just a motion to strike the don't \nask, don't tell that is in the base of the bill. I said that is fine. \nThe main thing I want--and I think it is fair in the waning\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\nhours of this session before the election--is that we would have the \ntext of whatever the amendment might be and also a time agreement \nbecause everybody is aware that someone could get on an amendment and \ntalk forever. I am trying to be as reasonable as possible.\n  These decisions don't have to be made today, but I would like to do \nit before Tuesday because I am going to have to make decisions Tuesday \non what we are going to do on this bill. The main thing I have \nexplained to Democrats--and they know this--and I say to my Republican \ncolleagues, the work we do on this bill prior to the election is not \nthe end of this bill. This bill normally takes some time. We can't \nfinish it in a week. I understand more work needs to be done. Senator \nLevin has things in the bill he would like to correct with an amendment \nor agreement. It is my understanding there is more that the minority \ndoesn't like in this bill than just the don't ask, don't tell \nprovision.\n  I understand, in addition to issues I have talked about in the last \ncouple days, there are many other important matters that both sides of \nthe aisle wish to address. I am willing to work with Republicans on a \nprocess that will permit the Senate to consider these matters and \ncomplete the bill as soon as possible, which likely will be after the \nrecess.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. President, I move now to proceed to Calendar No. 414, S. 3454, \nthe Defense authorization bill, and I have a cloture motion at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the motion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object, and I will \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no objection in order at this time. \nThe cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the clerk \nwill state the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 414, S. 3454, the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011.\n         Harry Reid, Carl Levin, Tom Udall, Jack Reed, Barbara A. \n           Mikulski, Jon Tester, Al Franken, Richard J.

Akaka, Bill Nelson.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before I proceed with more procedural \nmatters related to the motion I just made, I am anxious to hear from my \nfriend, the ranking member of the committee. We are not trying to cut \nhim off in expressing his views.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the vote \non the motion to invoke cloture occur at 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, September \n21; that on that date, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to \nproceed following a period of morning business, with the time until \n12:30 p.m. equally divided and controlled between Senators Levin and \nMcCain or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if I understood the majority leader's \nwords, in a rather unusual departure from anything I have ever seen in \nthe Senate, if he receives sufficient votes to proceed to the bill, he \nwould take up certain amendments that are on his agenda, and then, in \nlameduck session, we might consider other amendments.\n  Coincidentally, the amendments the majority leader would agree to \nwould be two of them that are totally unrelated to national defense. \nOne is the DREAM Act and the other is secret holds, as I understand it. \nThen other amendments of importance, which are relevant, which those of \nus on this side of the aisle have, which are important, maybe we would \ntake them up, under certain circumstances, in a lameduck session.\n  Mr. REID. May I respond to my friend.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Arizona, I haven't decided for \nsure. We talked about some of the things I would do with our \namendments. I have been very clear with every Republican Senator I have \nspoken to that, of course, the motion to strike, we would get to that \nas soon as we can. If Senators had other amendments related to the \ndon't ask, don't tell provision, which has been somewhat controversial, \nand some people on the other side don't like that--if there are other \namendments related to that, we would be happy to do that before we \nleave for the elections. Then we would have to see what else we can \nwork out on this prior to going home for the elections. But recognize--\nand I think it is clear--that we are not going to be able to complete \nthis bill before we go home.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So, again, I say to the majority leader, you are going to \nask Members on this side to proceed to the bill without us knowing what \namendments you are going to allow and those amendments that may be \nconsidered in a lameduck session. It is well known that the DREAM Act \nis also one of the amendments the Senator from Nevada, the majority \nleader, has said will be part of the prelameduck session, which happens \nto be preelection, which happens not to have a thing to do with our \nNation's defense. Other amendments that may be directly related to \nnational defense will not be allowed by the majority leader, which is \nhis right, to fill up the tree, as he did last year after we spent a \nweek on the hate crimes bill, which had nothing to do with our Nation's \ndefense. I ask the majority leader to draw a conclusion or surmise that \nperhaps this has everything to do with elections and nothing to do with \nnational defense.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has been in \nCongress the exact same period of time I have been here. We were in the \nHouse together, and we came to the Senate together. I am confident he \nknows the rules of the Senate. It has been very unusual in this \nCongress that we have had to file so many times a motion to proceed to \nget on a bill. This is a bill that relates to the defense of our \ncountry. On any piece of legislation, it seems like a strange Senate \nprocess when you have to know what amendments are going to be offered \nby both sides before you move to the bill. That is why we are here and \nwhy we are Senators, to deal with legislation. I thought I was going \nover and above what I needed to do by telling the Republican leader \nsome of the amendments I thought we would deal with prior to the \nelection.\n  With my friend continually saying that the DREAM Act has nothing to \ndo with the defense of this country, we have hundreds of thousands of \npeople of Hispanic origin who are serving in the U.S. military as we \nspeak. The DREAM Act is very simple. It says if you have been in this \ncountry for 5 years and you came before age 16, you should be able to \ngo to a State school. You get no Pell grant benefits whatsoever. If you \nhave been in school for a couple years, you can get a green card, no \ncitizenship, or if a young man or woman of Hispanic origin decides they \nwant to join the U.S. military, they would have the right to do that, \nand after having served 2 years in the uniform of our country, they \nwould be able to get a green card. That is all the DREAM Act does. I \nthink it has a lot to do with the defense of this Nation. We need these \nyoung men and women to join our military. We want them to.\n  I also say that the reason I thought there was a concern about this \nlegislation from the minority side was they didn't like the don't ask, \ndon't tell provision. So I was trying to be as cooperative as possible \nand say amendments relating to that--let's do them. I talked to one \nRepublican Senator, and even though I didn't agree with her amendment, \nI thought it was appropriate that she had the ability to offer that.\n  I am not trying to end all discussion on this bill. I hope we can \nfinish it. As the Senator from Arizona knows, we are very limited in \nthe time we have before the election, and because we came here \ntogether, we are both going to have an election on November 2.\n  I am going to have to excuse myself. I will be happy to respond to \nquestions but I have a caucus that starts at 1 o'clock. If my colleague \nhas some questions, I will be glad to respond; otherwise, I will have \nto excuse myself.\n\n[[Page S7160]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will not take up the time of the \nmajority leader--I have a statement I will present at this time--except \nto say again that this is a transparent attempt to win an election. \nThat is what this is all about. Why would we want to put the DREAM Act \nfirst before the election? Why not after we come back? Why not take up \nthe secret holds after we come back? And, of course, the don't ask, \ndon't tell issue is one of significant importance to the American \npeople.\n  Last year, after spending a week on hate crimes--which, again, had \nnothing to do with this Nation's defense--the majority leader, with the \nagreement of the committee chairman, filed cloture and cut off debate \nand discussion of amendments that many of us felt were important.\n  I have been around this body for a number of years. I have never seen \nsuch politicization of our Nation's security as we are seeing in this \nprocess we are following. This politicization that has taken place over \nthe last 2 years is very unfortunate. For as long as I have been \nprivileged to be a Member of this body, the Senate has done a good job \nof keeping the National Defense Authorization Act out of partisan \npolitical fights that have little or nothing to do with the U.S. \nmilitary, the brave men and women serving in it, and our national \ndefense programs more broadly. There has even been a healthy degree of \nbipartisan cooperation to prevent items that are unrelated to our \nnational defense from crowding out time for debate and amendments \ngermane to our national security priorities. Sure, we have had fights \nover this legislation in the past, and at times they have been pretty \nheated. But they were debates overwhelmingly focused on national \ndefense. And whatever our differences we had through that process, we \ncame together at the end of the day to keep this legislation focused on \nour national defense and all who ensure it.\n  What troubles me is how far off course we have gotten over the past 2 \nyears. Under this majority leader and this chairman, we have witnessed \nthe unfortunate and growing politicization of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. Time to offer and debate important defense-related \namendments to this bill on the floor is being limited or cut off so \nthat the majority leader can push through highly political legislation \nthat has little or nothing to do with national defense--legislation \nthat would never be referred to the Armed Services Committee if it were \nintroduced independently.\n  The Hate Crimes Act would never have been referred to the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. The DREAM Act would never have been referred \nto the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  This is turning legislation related to our national defense and \nmilitary preparedness into a vehicle to force a partisan agenda through \nthe Senate, often on a party-line vote. And their desperation, because \nthey see the November 2 elections coming up, is palpable. What is \nworse, the majority leader is pushing this controversial agenda under \nthe cover of supporting our troops, knowing that the National Defense \nAuthorization Act is a must-pass bill and whatever else is in it will \ninevitably become law as a result.\n  Last year it was legislation on hate crimes. I am not saying this is \nnot an important issue or an issue that the Senate should not have \ntaken up and debated in due time. But hate crimes legislation has \nnothing to do with our national defense. Of course, the majority and \nthe committee chairman will always get creative on how to interpret \n``national defense.'' But the plain fact is, if hate crimes legislation \nwere introduced independently, it would be referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee, not the Armed Services Committee. Yet the majority leader \nand the committee chairman put that legislation onto the Defense \nAuthorization Act last year, promptly eliminating the ability to offer \namendments. Then the Senate spent a week locked in debate over \nlegislation that had nothing to do with national defense--precious time \nthat should have been spent discussing legislation that actually \npertained to our military priorities.\n  Things are only getting worse this year. We learned on Monday that \nbefore we go home for this election cycle, there will be no debate at \nall on the Defense authorization bill, except for what we are told--the \nmajority leader just said he has not decided--but we are told there \nwill be no debate at all on the Defense authorization bill except for \nthree amendments handpicked by the majority leader for narrow political \nreasons 2 months before an election.\n  One of those amendments will be on banning the use of so-called \nsecret holds. Another will be, we are told, on the DREAM Act which \nallows the children of immigrants who entered the country illegally to \nbecome U.S. citizens.\n  Again, I am not saying the Senate should not consider these pieces of \nlegislation, but neither of them would be taken up independently in the \nArmed Services Committee because they have nothing to do with national \ndefense. The majority leader has no business putting these two \namendments on the National Defense Authorization Act--and certainly not \ntwo of only three amendments that will even get voted on--at a time \nwhen our military is engaged in two wars overseas and when numerous \ndefense issues demand the Senate's time.\n  That leads us to an amendment to strike the provision in the bill \nthat would repeal the don't ask, don't tell law as the only other issue \nthe Senate will be able to debate and vote on. Unlike the other issues \nI have mentioned, a repeal of don't ask, don't tell, while \ncontroversial, is related to the National Defense Authorization Act. It \nis an issue that belongs in the Armed Services Committee. The problem \nis the truncated process and partisan manner in which the majority is \nforcing through a de facto repeal of a longstanding law that may have \nsignificant ramifications for our military force during a time of two \nwars, all to fulfill a campaign promise made by President Obama in \n2008, barely 2 months before the election.\n  I want to make one thing very clear: I do not oppose or support the \nrepeal of don't ask, don't tell at this time. I do oppose taking \nlegislative action prior to the completion of a real and thorough \nreview of the law. A complete survey to evaluate the impact of repeal \non the men and women serving in our military should be concluded before \nmoving forward. When the Senate does consider taking legislative \naction, that action should be based on the survey of our men and women \nin uniform, and their leaders.\n  Unfortunately and inexplicably, the majority is following an opposite \napproach. It is pushing for a vote on the don't ask, don't tell law \nbefore the Defense Department has concluded its survey of the opinions \nof our force on an important matter that will directly affect them and \ntheir families. The majority is doing this in complete disregard of the \nviews of our men and women in uniform, as well as our four service \nchiefs--the heads of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines--who are \nresponsible for the battlefield effectiveness of their services. All \nfour of the military leaders wrote letters encouraging Congress to wait \nuntil the completion of the survey of the force before taking any \nlegislative action on don't ask, don't tell. Their opinions have been \ndisregarded thus far, and it seems that the chairman and the majority \nleader do not care about their views either.\n  The majority will say this amendment does not actually repeal don't \nask, don't tell; it merely authorizes its repeal pending a \ncertification from the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that a repeal would not harm \nmilitary effectiveness. Just those three officials--not the four \nservice chiefs or Congress, for that matter. This is a legislative \ngimmick and a distinction without a difference.\n  In reality, the majority is sending a signal to our men and women in \nuniform that we will not wait to hear their views or give them any due \nconsideration once the Pentagon survey is finished. Instead, the Senate \nwill turn its responsibility to legislate on this important matter over \nto three officials who have already publicly stated their support for \nrepealing don't ask, don't tell. It is a blatant message of disrespect \nto our men and women in uniform that Congress is unwilling to even wait \nto hear what the force has to\n\n[[Page S7161]]\n\nsay on this important matter before pushing ahead with a controversial \npolitical vote less than 2 months before an election.\n  That is why I am opposed to debating and amending the National \nDefense Authorization Act at this time. I feel very strongly that we \nshould wait--actually wait--and not take any action on this \ncontroversial issue until we hear from our troops on what they think \nthe impact of repeal would be. Then the Senate should take time to \nconsider their views before deciding what we think is the best course \nof action. The only rationale for doing this now is a transparently \npartisan and political one.\n  After limited debate on only three amendments, two of which are not \nrelated to our national defense, the majority leader will then \napparently push for a final vote on this legislation--or delay until \nthe lameduck session--that also contains a controversial provision \npermitting abortions in military facilities, an irresponsible cut to \nthe Iraqi security forces, and $2.8 billion in porkbarrel earmarks that \nthe President did not request and the military says it does not need. \nThere will be no chance to debate these or other defense-related \nissues.\n  The effect of all of this is that the majority leader is turning \nlegislation on our national defense into a political football. Debate \nis limited and unrelated. Politically controversial amendments are \ncrowding out our limited time to debate actual military and defense-\nrelated legislation. This is a corruption of the principles and \nprocedures of the Senate if there ever was one, and it disrespects the \nlongstanding traditions of the Senate. It is only making it more likely \nthat the National Defense Authorization Act will one day go the way of \nso many other authorizations bills, which is to say nowhere.\n  This kind of transparent politicization of our national defense \nshould anger every Member of this body--Democrats and Republicans. The \nmen and women of our Armed Forces deserve better, and we should demand \nbetter.\n  I regret to see that the long-respected and revered Senate Armed \nServices Committee has evolved into a forum for a social agenda of the \nliberal left of the Senate. I will do everything in my power, if we \nregain the majority, to see that the Senate Armed Services Committee \nreturns to the tradition of addressing only those issues that are \ntotally related to the defense of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief and save most of the \ndebate for next week, but I do want to respond to a few of the \nstatements my friend from Arizona made.\n  First of all, in terms of hate crimes amendments, last year when we \nadopted this, it was not the first time we adopted it on the Defense \nauthorization bill. We at least considered and adopted, in some cases, \nhate crimes amendments in the fiscal year 2001 authorization bill, the \nfiscal year 2005 authorization bill, and the fiscal year 2008 \nauthorization bill. I did not hear my friend at that time make \nsuggestions that somehow the committee had lost its way in terms of \nbipartisanship.\n  We have not lost our way. The Senate is a body which has a right to \noffer amendments which are not germane or relevant to the bill in front \nof us. This is not the first time that someone wants to offer these \namendments. It will not be the last time. For it to produce the charge \nthat somehow or another the committee is no longer a bipartisan \ncommittee, it seems to me, is unfair, it is inappropriate, and I reject \nit.\n  The Senate has considered amendments on the Defense authorization \nbill in the last 20 years, not just on hate crimes, over and over \nagain--long before I became chairman, by the way--but we have debated \namendments on the Defense authorization bill on indecency standards, \nminimum wage, managed health plans, welfare reform, and the death \npenalty for drug-related killings. Those are just a few. I didn't hear \nanybody make the kind of charge at that time that somehow or other--\nbecause the Senate rules were being utilized to bring to the floor of \nthe Senate an amendment which wasn't directly related to the bill in \nfront of us--the committee itself had engaged in some kind of a \npartisan effort.\n\n  The rules of the Senate allow the majority leader to do what he did, \nand majority leaders have done that in the past. The rules of the \nSenate allow Senators other than majority leaders to offer amendments \nwhich are not relevant to the bill, and Republicans and Democrats have \ndone that before on bill after bill after bill and on Defense bill \nafter Defense bill after Defense bill. I think four times hate crimes \nhas been offered, and I believe adopted, in this body on the Defense \nbill, but it didn't unleash or produce the kind of charge we have just \nheard.\n  The majority leader, a few moments ago, said there is not going to be \nan effort to limit the consideration of just three amendments, if \ncloture is invoked. In fact, he is hopeful, and so am I, that numbers \nof amendments--many amendments--can be considered before the recess. I \nwould like to finish the bill before the recess, if we could. I would \nlike to get time agreements. As a matter of fact, before this last \nrecess, I asked unanimous consent that we move to this bill. I didn't \nput conditions on it, I just asked unanimous consent that we move to \nthe bill, and I couldn't even get consent to do that.\n  What is unheard of around here, as far as I know, is what is going on \nrepeatedly now in the Senate--objections, filibusters, and threats of \nfilibusters to move a bill to debate. This threat of a filibuster isn't \na filibuster on the bill; it is a threat to filibuster our debating a \nbill and offering amendments on the bill. That is what is happening. \nDenying the Senate the opportunity to legislate on a Defense \nauthorization bill is what is being proposed; that we not even be \nallowed to move to the bill until certain conditions of certain \nSenators are met.\n  There is going to be a lot of time to debate this cloture motion--and \nI will save most of that debate for Monday--but I do think it is \ninaccurate to suggest that suddenly there is an effort being made to \noffer a nonrelevant amendment to a bill in the Senate. Many of our \nbills have been subjected to nonrelevant amendments because the rules \nallow it. As the manager of this bill, I always try to figure out a way \nthrough that thicket. It is never easy. I have managed enough bills to \nknow it is never easy to get through that thicket the rules provide \nfor--that nonrelevant amendments are permitted. But it is not accurate \nto suggest, as my friend from Arizona has, that somehow or other last \nyear, for the first time, we adopted a nonrelevant amendment when we \nadopted hate crimes because we adopted that very amendment on this very \nbill two or three times before that.\n  That doesn't even get to the point of all these other amendments \nwhich have been adopted, not just on the Defense authorization bill but \non other bills which do not relate to the bill on the floor, and I just \ngave a few examples. Many of those amendments came from the Republican \nside. But to start suggesting that somehow or other what is happening \nis unique or novel, it seems to me, is not accurate and does not \ncontribute to handling in a bipartisan manner--and in this I think I \nshare the hope of the Senator from Arizona--the security of this \nNation; that it should continue to be, as it always has been, and God \nwilling always will be, a bipartisan matter handled in a bipartisan way \nby the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, just a short time ago, the Senator from \nArizona, my colleague, Senator John McCain, came to the floor and made \nan issue about the way we are proceeding on the Defense authorization \nbill. Senator McCain, who is the ranking Republican on the Armed \nServices Committee, with Chairman Carl Levin, objected to several \namendments which will be considered under this bill. One in particular \nis an amendment, a bill which I first introduced in its earliest form \nin the Senate almost 10 years ago. It is known as the DREAM Act.\n\n[[Page S7162]]\n\n  The DREAM Act is a legislative effort to solve a serious problem, and \nthe problem is this: There are many young people who were brought to \nAmerica by their undocumented parents. They came at the age of a few \nmonths old, 2 years, 3 years, 10 years of age, 12 years of age. There \nwas no family vote on whether they were coming to America; they were \npacked up and brought. Some came over legally and then became illegal \nbecause their visas were not extended. Some entered the country \nillegally. In every instance, these were children who were brought with \ntheir parents.\n  These children have grown up in America. They have gone to our \nschools. They have participated in community activities. They have now \nreached an age where they are finishing high school, many of them, and \nthey believe they are Americans. It may be the only language they \nspeak, the language of America, and they do not know of another country \nthat they were told by their parents they once lived in.\n  What is to happen with these children? Under the laws of America, \nthey are here illegally. The simple, direct answer is, they should be \ndeported. But we know that justice calls out for a different approach, \na better and fairer approach. To hold children responsible or culpable \nfor any wrongdoing by their parents is something we do not do in any \narea of the law.\n  If I am arrested speeding down the interstate and have my grandson in \nthe backseat, they are not going to arrest him for speeding. They will \ncharge me with a crime, but they will not charge him. In this instance, \nthe children in the backseat on this ride to America are being held as \ncriminals.\n  They have virtually no future, no status, no country, and it is a \ndesperate situation for many of them. Some of them are the best and \nbrightest kids in America. They are the valedictorians of the class, \nthe class presidents, they are the kids who get admitted to the good \ncolleges and universities and want a good life in this country.\n  But they are stopped everywhere they turn. They cannot qualify for \nany Federal aid for education because they are not citizens and not \nhere legally. They certainly cannot even enlist in the military, if \nthey chose to, because under our laws, undocumented cannot enlist.\n  So what is to become of them? I introduced the DREAM Act to say let's \nat least give them a chance. Here is what the DREAM Act says: If you \ncame to America under the age of 15, if you have been here 5 years, \ngraduate from high school, no criminal record of serious offenses, good \nmoral character, and you go on, in the next 6 years of your life after \nhigh school to enlist in our military or to complete 2 years of \ncollege, we will give you a chance. We will give you a chance.\n  Six years after high school, we will give you a chance to petition \nour government for legal status in America. That is it. What I have \nbeen told by many is that this is not only a good and just option for a \nlot of very young and talented people, but it also has other positive \nbenefits.\n  Yesterday in my office was a young man named Eric Balderas. I brought \nhis picture to the floor the other day. I met him for the first time \nyesterday. Eric Balderas is a sophomore at Harvard University. He was \nborn and raised in San Antonio, TX. His mother and father were illegal \nimmigrants to the United States.\n  He grew up in San Antonio and was accepted at Harvard University. \nThat says a lot. After he was there for a short period of time, he \ndecided he liked science. It turned out he was pretty good at it. As a \nsophomore, he has set his goal now. He wants to be a cancer researcher. \nHe wants to stay the course, finish his masters, and even go on to an \nadvanced degree so he can do research to find a cure for cancer.\n  Can we afford to let Eric go? Can we afford as a nation to send him \nback to Mexico, a place which he knows of but does not count as his \nhome? Can we afford to turn our back on him? I do not think so. I think \nthis is a valuable asset for the future of America. Eric's life should \nnot be wasted. It should be invested in our future.\n  But there is also an option under the DREAM Act beyond the completion \nof 2 years of college for those who would enlist in our armed services. \nSenator McCain came to the floor and he has traditionally supported the \nDREAM Act. But he raised a question as to whether it had a place in the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  I would urge my colleague from Arizona to consider the obvious. The \nDefense authorization bill is an appropriate vehicle for the DREAM Act \nbecause tens of thousands of highly qualified, well-educated young \npeople would enlist in the Armed Forces if the DREAM Act becomes law.\n  The Army says high school graduation is the best single predictor of \nsticktoitiveness, the kind that is required to succeed in the military. \nThat is required in the DREAM Act. You must graduate high school before \nyou can qualify.\n  In recent years, the Army has been forced to accept more applicants \nwho are high school dropouts, have low scores on military aptitude \ntests, and even some with criminal backgrounds to meet recruiting \nquotas. In contrast, now, the DREAM Act recruits would be well-\nqualified high school graduates of good moral character.\n  Many DREAM Act beneficiaries come from a community that is \npredisposed toward military service. The RAND Corporation found that \nHispanic youth are more likely than other groups to express a positive \nattitude toward the military, and Hispanics consistently have higher \nretention and faster promotion speeds than their White counterparts. \nThe Defense Department, in its fiscal year 2010-2012 strategic plan \nincluded the DREAM Act as a means of meeting the strategic goal of \nshaping and maintaining a mission-ready, all-volunteer force.\n  In 2007, Bill Carr, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, said the DREAM \nAct is ``very appealing,'' in his words, because it would apply to the \ncream of the crop of students and be good for readiness.\n  In 2006, then-Secretary of Defense David Chu, testifying before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, said: There are an estimated 50 to \n65,000 undocumented alien young adults who entered the United States at \nan early age and graduate from high school every year. Many of these \nyoung people may wish to join the military and have the attributes \nneeded: education, aptitude, fitness, and moral qualifications. The \nDREAM Act would provide these young people the opportunity of serving \nthe United States in uniform.\n  This was said by the Under Secretary of Defense under President Bush. \nIt is bipartisan and it should be. Military experts also support the \nDREAM Act. LTC Margaret Stock, professor at West Point, said: Passage \nof the DREAM Act would be highly beneficial to the U.S. military. The \nDREAM Act promises to enlarge dramatically the pool of highly qualified \nrecruits for the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  The DREAM Act includes many important restrictions to prevent abuse. \nDREAM Act students would not be eligible for Pell grants and would be \nsubject to tough criminal penalties for fraud and would have limited \nability to sponsor any family members for legal status. The DREAM Act \nhas broad bipartisan support, 40 cosponsors. In the 110th Congress it \nreceived 52 votes, a majority of the Senate, which under most \ncircumstances is a winning vote, but in the Senate we require 60 for \ncontroversial issues which many Republicans might oppose.\n\n  In this case, though, with 52 votes, 11 Republicans joined us in \nvoting yes. According to a recent poll by Opinion Research Corporation, \n70 percent of likely voters favor the DREAM Act, including 60 percent \nof the Republicans.\n  I say this to Senator McCain. I understand his point about amendments \nto the Defense authorization bill. I will not get into that particular \npoint. I mean, he can argue that out with Senator Levin and Senator \nReid and they can come to the best conclusion. They tend to work \ntogether pretty well under normal circumstances. But to argue the DREAM \nAct has nothing to do with the defense of this country is to overlook \nthe obvious, a point that has been made repeatedly by the leaders in \nthe Pentagon and Department of Defense; that to give these young people \na chance to volunteer to serve our Nation and to risk their lives for \nour safety and security is good for the military and gives them a \nchance for a life--a chance for a life.\n\n[[Page S7163]]\n\n  How can we do this to these kids who came to this country with their \nparents and who know no other nation? One of these young students said \nto me along the way: Senator, I dream in English. That is something we \nought to remember. For these children, America is the only home they \nhave ever known, the only home they ever want to know.\n  All they are asking for is a chance. There is a larger issue about \ncomprehensive immigration reform. We need it. I support it. I have \nworked with Senator McCain on it in years gone by, and we need to \nreturn to it. But for this particular group of young people in America, \nI beg my colleagues, give them a chance. Give these young people a \nchance.\n  They are counting on us, counting on us to come through. I do wish to \nsay that this DREAM Act is going to be considered, I hope, next week. \nIf we are successful on the motion to proceed, then we will move \nforward from there and probably debate it next week. We will need \nRepublican support to pass it, and there should be. It should be a \nbipartisan bill. In the past, many Republicans have stepped up, \nunderstanding this is the right thing to do.\n  When I speak to some of my Republican colleagues today, there are \nmyriad explanations of why they are not going to vote for it or may not \nvote for it: Oh, we need comprehensive reform. Maybe this is not the \nright bill to consider it on. After 10 years, I want to tell you, I do \nnot know how I can continue to face these young people. I do not know \nhow many any of my colleagues can without an effort, without trying.\n  I urge all my colleagues, over the weekend as they consider this \nimportant and historic vote, try to reach out and meet some of these \nyoung people. They will make converts of you in an instant. They are \nthe future of America. They are going to be our military leaders and \nour engineers and our doctors, our lawyers and our accountants, even \nour Senators and our Congressmen. Giving them a chance to give back to \nthis country is not too much to ask.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Federal Employees\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise again to honor our Nation's great \nFederal employees and, in particular, to celebrate this year's Service \nto America Medal winners. These are the employees we recognized in the \n111st Congress.\n  Last night, winners of eight awards were announced by the Partnership \nfor Public Service, a wonderful leading nonprofit, nonpartisan \norganization. One year ago, when I rose from this desk to pay tribute \nto the 2009 winners, I spoke about the values Federal employees embody: \ncitizenship, hard work, a willingness to take risks, perseverance, \nintellect, and humility. All nine of this year's awardees exemplify \nthese qualities.\n  One important value all of this year's winners share is concern for \nothers. Whether rescuing Haitian orphans from a deadly earthquake, \nfighting against trafficking of minors, or helping Native Americans get \naccess to Social Security benefits, this year's medalists have \ndedicated their careers and their talents to helping others. They do it \nfor less pay--yes, less pay--and often longer hours than at jobs they \ncould have taken in the private sector. If they receive a large \ncompensation, it is in the form of the satisfaction that their lives \nare serving a meaningful purpose in service to their Nation.\n  This year's Federal Employee of the Year Medal was awarded to a \nCitizenship and Immigration Services officer who helped expedite the \nadoption of more than 1,100--that is 1,100--orphans in the wake of \nHaiti's devastating earthquake in January. Pius Bannis was the only \nAmerican immigration official in the country working on adoption in the \nfirst weeks following the quake. He got right to work organizing \ntemporary daycare in our Embassy and ensuring the provision of \nemergency supplies to Haitian orphanages, including diapers, food, \nwater, and clean clothes.\n  Pius, in the midst of this Herculean effort, also had to cope with \nthe loss of Embassy staff and their family members.\n  A naturalized immigrant to the United States himself, he knows \nfirsthand the complexities of the immigration process, which makes him \nan outstanding CIS officer.\n  A resource conservation expert at the Environmental Protection \nAgency, Saskia van Gendt won this year's Call to Service Medal for her \nwork on fostering green building technologies. Millions of tons of \nmaterials used in construction are disposed of each year in landfills--\na third of our Nation's total solid waste. At the EPA, Saskia has \ncreated an innovative program to help spur a green revolution in \nconstruction materials. In 2007, she developed the Lifecycle Building \nChallenge. This annual competition engages architects, students, and \nbuilders to develop new designs that reduce the impact of buildings on \nthe environment. Since 2008, Saskia has been working with the StopWaste \ngrant program to encourage businesses to adopt environmentally friendly \nequipment. The Call to Service Medal that she won recognizes those who \nhave achieved early in their federal careers. Saskia is just 28 years \nold.\n  Honoring those who have spent many years in Federal Government, the \nCareer Achievement Medal was won this year by Susan Solomon, a senior \nscientist in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's \nEarth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. In her nearly 30 \nyears as a government employee, Susan has been at the forefront of \npioneering research into the hole in the Earth's ozone layer. Her \nresearch was critical in determining how certain consumer and \nindustrial gases were affecting the ozone, which helped spur the \nlandmark 1987 Montreal Protocol. Last year, Susan led a groundbreaking \nstudy that showed how the effects of carbon pollution, such as altered \ntemperatures and changes in sea level, can linger for over a thousand \nyears.\n  This year's Citizens Services Medal was awarded to a pair of \nofficials also from Colorado. Shane Kelley and Eva Ristow work in the \nDenver office of the Social Security Administration. They won for their \nwork to expand access to Social Security benefits for those living in \nimpoverished and rural areas using an online two-way video service. For \nyears, the SSA has had difficulties reaching those living in remote \nareas of the West, in particular Native Americans living on \nreservations. As a result, many do not know they are eligible to \nreceive Social Security benefits that could drastically improve their \nfamilies' standard of living. Shane and Eva developed an innovative \nInternet-based video teleconferencing system to help connect these \nrural communities to Social Security representatives in Denver. For \nthose whose annual incomes can be as low as $3,000, this new connection \nto the SSA--thanks to Shane and Eva--has had a gigantic impact.\n  As Deputy Director of Intelligence and Security and Chief of \nInnovative Technology for the Navy's Joint Interagency Task Force \nSouth, Sandra Brooks won this year's Homeland Security Medal. Drug \nsmugglers are constantly seeking new ways to evade our border security \nand customs checks. Sandy is one of the highly dedicated Federal \nemployees working to keep one step ahead of them. Her role is to \nanalyze information from a stream of sources and make sure it is shared \nquickly with the military, law enforcement, and homeland security \nagencies in the field. Sandy's efforts have directly led to the capture \nof over 20 submersible vehicles used to bring illegal drugs into our \ncountry. Her work is breaking down barriers that in the past have \nprevented security agencies from sharing information.\n  This year's Justice and Law Enforcement Medal was won by Jamie \nKonstas at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. An intelligence \nanalyst, Jamie helped\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\ncreate a national online database used in investigations into the \ntrafficking of minors for sex. Before this database was created, local \nlaw enforcement officials had few resources to track child victims or \ninformation on suspects after they had crossed state lines. Jamie's \nrole is to spot connections and cross-reference clues to break cases \nwide open. Her tireless efforts have led to the prosecution of over 500 \nchild predators.\n  The winner of this year's National Security and International Affairs \nMedal led a U.S. Army team at Fort Detrick, MD, that developed a new \nkind of medical kit to help troops wounded by roadside bombs. In Iraq \nand Afghanistan, improvised explosive devices--or ``IEDs''--have been \nused to target our soldiers and have caused many casualties. Teri Glass \nand her team created a unique medical evaluation kit that has allowed \nmedics in the field to transport wounded troops more safely and \nefficiently to hospitals. This has significantly raised the survival \nrate for soldiers wounded by IEDs. The kit Teri and her team developed \ncan convert a range of non-ambulance vehicles into medical evacuation \nvehicles in less than a minute, using a foldable litter, a rear-facing \nattendant seat, and a lift system. When not in use, all of it collapses \ninto a portable container the size of a suitcase and can fit in the \nback of a vehicle. Commanders in the field have credited this device as \nsaving the lives of countless servicemembers.\n  Last, but certainly not least, the Science and Environment Medal for \n2010 was awarded to the Department of Energy's Jeffrey Baker. As the \nDirector of the Office of Laboratory Operations at the Department's \nfield office in Golden, CO, Jeffrey has been the driving force behind \nthe design and construction of the largest net-zero energy office \nbuilding in the world. This means that the building generates as much \nor more energy than it consumes. Planning for the Research Support \nFacility began in the 1990s, when Jeffrey had a vision for a building \nthat would not only house the Department's laboratories but also serve \nas an example of energy-efficiency. He oversaw the design process and \nconstruction, and the building was completed on time and on budget. \nToday, the General Services Administration is planning to replicate \nJeffrey's approach for new federal buildings across the Nation.\n  All nine of these men and women are excellent examples of what \ngovernment does right. They deserve our thanks and recognition. So do \nthe 23 other finalists, as well as the thousands upon thousands of \nFederal employees who achieved great things this year as well.\n  I was proud to serve on this year's Service to America Medals \nSelection Committee--a blue ribbon panel that included my colleagues \nSenator Carper and Senator Voinovich as well as leaders from across the \nnonprofit and business sectors and members of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I hope all of my colleagues--and all Americans--will join me in \ncongratulating the 2010 Service to America medalists and thanking them \nfor their hard work on our behalf.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               IN CELEBRATION OF ``CHANGE THE EQUATION''\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate President Obama \nfor announcing today the launch of Change the Equation, a CEO-led \neffort to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \neducation or STEM. I rise to celebrate this incredible effort.\n  I have spoken many times on the floor, to outside organizations, and \nto a number of my colleagues individually about my passion for this \nissue. STEM education is a topic of personal importance to me, \nespecially because I am the Senate's only formerly working engineer.\n  I truly believe, now more than ever, whether it is energy \nindependence, global health, homeland security, or infrastructure \nchallenges, STEM professionals will be at the forefront of the most \nsignificant issues of our time. That is not hyperbole; I believe that. \nSTEM-educated graduates will hold the jobs of the future.\n  In fact, according to a study by Georgetown University's Center for \nEducation and the Workforce, by 2018, STEM occupations are projected to \nprovide 2.8 million new hires. This includes over 500,000 engineering-\nrelated jobs. When I hear people talk about how we are going to create \njobs and talk about the macroeconomic effects and microeconomic \neffects, eventually you have to have jobs. You have to have people who \nare ready to take those jobs. That is the only way we are going to make \nit through this economy. In the next 20 years, as the Georgetown study \nhas said, there will be 2.8 million more good jobs to keep us \ncompetitive in the United States with overseas.\n  That is why I am so pleased that the business community has responded \nto President Obama's educate and innovate campaign to improve the \nperformance and participation of American students in all the STEM \nfields. Launched last fall, the campaign aimed to create partnerships \nbetween Federal agencies, companies, foundations, professional \nsocieties, and other STEM-related organizations to help American \nstudents rise to the top of the pack in math and science achievements.\n  In response to the President's call to action, astronaut Sally Ride, \nformer Intel CEO Craig Barrett, Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt, \nXerox CEO Ursula Burns, Eastman Kodak CEO Antonio Perez, along with \nsupport from the Gates Foundation and Carnegie Corporation joined to \nform Change the Equation. With a membership of more than 100 companies, \nthis nonprofit, nonpartisan, CEO-led initiative will replicate \nsuccessful privately funded programs in 100 high needs schools and \ncommunities.\n  Change the Equation will be working toward three goals: One, improve \nSTEM teaching at all grade levels; two, to inspire student appreciation \nand excitement for STEM, particularly for women and underrepresented \nminorities; and three, to achieve a sustained commitment to improving \nSTEM education across the United States of America. I am so pleased \nbecause these are some of the same goals I have advocated for during my \ntime in the Senate.\n  Many Change the Equation members, nonprofits, and foundations have \nalready created new public-private partnerships and made commitments to \nmeet these goals. Public-private partnerships--that is what we need, \nand this is a great example.\n\n  For example, Lockheed Martin, the Military Child Education Coalition, \nand the National Math and Science Initiative will expand access to \nadvanced placement classes in STEM subjects to public schools serving \nmilitary families. What can be better than that? Talk about mixing \neverything together and coming out with something great.\n  HP is launching a U.S.-wide employee volunteering initiative with \nDonors Choose and National Lab Day. Other programs will improve \nprofessional development for STEM teachers, expand summer science camps \nfor girls, and allow more students to engage in robotics competitions, \nto name a few.\n  If you have not seen a robotics competition, see one. It is \nincredible to see what these young people can do to make robotics. They \ncan do something technologically difficult but have so much fun doing \nit.\n  All told, with the commitment made today by Change the Equation, the \nEducate to Innovate campaign has resulted in over $700 million in \nfinancial and in-kind support for STEM education. This is an incredible \naccomplishment and just the kind of public-private collaboration we \nneed to bolster STEM education.\n  Yesterday I submitted a resolution commending the efforts of the \nentertainment industry to encourage interest in STEM, something with \nwhich our Presiding Officer is very familiar. Many in that industry \nhave heeded President Obama's call to join the educate and innovate \ncampaign. The key to this is to make people feel it is cool to be an \nengineer, a mathematician, or\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\nscientist. What better way than to have leaders in entertainment \nencourage this kind of activity? It is a wonderful program.\n  Today, I could not be more pleased that so many of our Nation's CEOs \nhave also paid attention to this call to action and joined together to \nform Change the Equation. This is wonderful news. Support for STEM \neducation is essential--essential, essential, essential--for our \neconomic growth and recovery. It is the future of our workplace. The \nAmerican people deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Trade Imbalance\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, yesterday, I filed a report on a trip \nwhich I made to China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, but I did not have an \nopportunity to come to the Senate floor to discuss it. I do so today on \na number of the highlights of the trip.\n  In Beijing, we met with the head of the banking department, who is \nidentified in the filed report, to talk about a number of subjects, the \ncenterpiece of which was currency manipulation. We reviewed the \ntremendous trade imbalance between the United States and China, much of \nwhich is occasioned by manipulating their currency.\n  Legislation has been introduced and is pending in the Congress, which \nI have cosponsored, but it has not gone anyplace. There has been \ncomment made by the Secretary of the Treasury and the President himself \nabout currency manipulation, but it has not done very much to correct a \nvery bad situation. The Chinese have suggested officially that they \nwould be willing to make some modifications, but what they have done so \nfar has been very little.\n  In the conversation with the head Chinese banking official, he didn't \ngive any ground, really. I also discussed with him the issues of \nsubsidies and dumping, which have been rampant, taking away thousands \nof jobs in the United States. That was the subject of more extended \ndiscussion with the No. 2 Chinese official in their equivalent of our \nDepartment of Commerce, identified in the written report which I filed \nyesterday. We have seen some of our successful actions before the \nInternational Trade Commission. For example, last year we had a matter \ninvolving tires where the International Trade Commission found in favor \nof the petitioners and imposed duties. We were successful in a case \ninvolving tubular pipe. Earlier this week, I was the lead witness--as I \nhad been on the tubular case and on the tire case--on seamless steel \nbefore the International Trade Commission.\n\n  What we have seen with the Chinese practices on subsidies and dumping \nis a flagrant violation of international trade law. Before the \nInternational Trade Commission and I believe on the floor of the \nSenate, I have characterized it as international banditry. That is \nclearly tough talk, but I think it is accurate when there are repeated \nviolations of international law.\n  When I discussed these issues with the No. 2 Chinese official in the \nDepartment of Commerce, again there was very little give--talking \npoints, sticking with them. When I talked about subsidies, he brought \nup our practices on farm subsidies. I pointed out the total differences \nwhich were involved in those matters.\n  From China, we traveled to Hanoi and there met with a number of \nofficials. There was a very interesting meeting with a historian who \nwas identified in the report filed yesterday. It was fascinating to \ntalk to somebody on the perspective of what the history of Vietnam is. \nHe pointed out that in a few weeks, Hanoi will celebrate its 1,000th \nanniversary as a city. We pride ourselves on the settlement in \nPhiladelphia--especially Philadelphia but Boston and other American \ncities. In tenure, it pales into insignificance when you talk about a \ncity which has been in existence for 1,000 years.\n  When I talked to him about Chinese trade practices, he said: Well, \nthey are very difficult. I talked to him about what China is doing in \nthe China Sea, which has been a subject of international notoriety when \nour Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, made comments that those were \nmatters of importance to the United States. What China is doing there \nis going into the island areas where you have islands long held by \nTaiwan or by the Philippines or by Vietnam and others, rich in \nminerals, and asserting control and really acting like the bully they \nare in that issue, as well as on trade matters.\n  I was fascinated to hear the historian recount 13 invasions by China \nagainst Vietnam. Although it is not exactly the same, I wondered and \nspeculated about U.S. action in Vietnam, going into Vietnam to protect \nVietnam from the incursion of the Chinese Communists. Vietnam seems to \nhave done very well for itself for centuries. In a context where China \nhas tried to invade them, they have been able to protect themselves.\n  From Vietnam, we traveled to Taiwan and there met with the President \nof Taiwan and had a very extensive discussion about their economy and \ntheir trade practices. I was interested to note that the People's \nRepublic of China, the mainland, and the Republic of China, Taiwan, \nhave signed a trade agreement. They do it through corporations, but \nthey are obviously backed by the state. It appears to me that is almost \ntantamount to tacit recognition, when mainland China negotiates with \nTaiwan in that context. When I discussed it with the officials, they \nall said: No, no, it is not tacit recognition; the People's Republic of \nChina still maintains that there is one China. But some 20 countries \nhave recognized Taiwan as an independent government, and they are \nmoving ahead and have some 15 treaties between the 2 countries. They \nare working it through on what appears to be a fairly extensive \nnormalization of relations.\n  Although the President of Taiwan was very interested in having the \narms sold by the United States, I pressed him on whether it was \nrealistic, really a measure that they could defend themselves, or \nwhether it was symbolic. I did that in the discussions with other \nofficials in Taiwan.\n  It appears to me that we might consider revising our policy on the \nsale of arms to Taiwan where we have an irritant to mainland China that \ndoesn't really accomplish very much. We recently have sold Taiwan some \n$4.6 billion worth, which is very substantial, but if the People's \nRepublic of China, mainland China, decided to invade Taiwan, the \ndefenses they have and their request for additional fighter planes, \nwhich has not been granted--all of that would not be sufficient to stem \nthe tide.\n  While in Taipei, Taiwan, we visited the 101 building, 101 stories. It \nwas completed a few years ago, and at that time, it was the tallest \nbuilding in the world. It has since been supplanted. It was quite an \nexperience to be 101 stories above the ground, visiting the towers. As \nis known, when a building is that tall, it sways. But they have three \nenormous balls--I do not have the precise measurement but perhaps 50 \nfeet in diameter. One of the balls is at the apex of the building, \nright at the top, with huge springs, so that when the building sways, \nthe ball and the springs keep it in an upright position. I have been in \nsome tall buildings in the United States and felt the sway, but this is \nremarkable. We were told there are three enormous balls in the \nbuilding.\n  I wish to supplement the written statement filed yesterday with a \nsupplement, an addendum to the written statement. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Supplemental Statement on Foreign Travel\n\n\n                                 China\n\n   (Meeting with Wang Chao, Vice Minister of Commerce, Aug. 9, 2010)\n\n       In my meeting with Wang Chao, Vice Minister of Commerce, he \n     provided a history and snapshot of the Chinese economy. He \n     indicated that since 1979, China has tried to foster positive \n     commerce and economic growth. At the time of the revolution, \n     China's economy ranked 15th. Today it is 2nd. However, the \n     Minister pointed out that China's GDP per capita still ranks \n     in the 100s and therefore is still a developing economy. Many \n     regions in China, especially rural areas, lag behind the \n     industrialized cities.\n\n[[Page S7166]]\n\n       I pressed him on what is viewed as unfair economic \n     practices. The Minister replied that China will continue to \n     reform its economy and integrate with the international \n     economy. The balance of trade between the US and China was \n     2.5 billion in 1979. Last year it registered over 300 \n     billion. Today, 58,000 US companies have a presence in China \n     representing a total of $63 billion in investment. I \n     encouraged Mr. Wang to implement policies that would increase \n     China's investment in the US which stands at 3.3 billion.\n       I shared the history and plight of the steel industry in \n     the United States and how practices such as dumping have \n     caused significant unemployment. The Vice Minister countered \n     with complaints about US agriculture subsidies, the plight of \n     Chinese farmers, the United States' refusal to recognize \n     China as a market economy and its unwillingness to ease \n     export controls on non-defense high-tech products.\n\n\n                                Vietnam\n\n(Meeting with Duong Trung Quoc, Historian and Assembly Member, Aug. 12, \n                                 2010)\n\n       On Thursday, August 12, I had the opportunity to meet with \n     Mr. Duong Trung Quoc, a member of the National Assembly and a \n     noted historian. Mr. Duong is one of the few members of the \n     Assembly who is not a member of the communist party. He \n     provided me with a history of the region with a special focus \n     on Vietnamese-Chinese relations. Mr. Duong informed me that \n     China had invaded Vietnam on 13 occasions. He noted that \n     October 2010 will mark the 1,000 year celebration of Hanoi. I \n     told Mr. Duong that on the way to our meeting, I had the \n     opportunity to visit the Ly Thai To statue. Mr. Duong \n     provided some background on the founder of the Ly dynasty and \n     the two decades during which he ruled. Interestingly, Ly Thai \n     To launched a pre-emptive strike on China in an effort to \n     prevent and invasion.\n       The conversation turned to China's regional and global \n     ambitions and its hegemonic statements and actions in \n     Southeast Asia. I asked if China was attempting to dominate \n     the entire region. Mr. Duong said that China's policy is to \n     get more power and that they have difficulty acknowledging \n     other countries and rights in the region.\n       I asked about the claims of various countries over islands \n     in the South China Sea. Mr. Duong said that China's goal is \n     to have them all as their territory. He told me that all \n     Vietnam wants is to enjoy its sovereignty and rights and \n     territory consistent with international law.\n       I asked Mr. Duong about what could be done to resolve the \n     conflict on the Korean Peninsula. He responded that China \n     could do much more to resolve the matter, but that they use \n     the conflict as a tool in its bilateral relationship with the \n     United States.\n       I asked how Mr. Duong has survived as a politician while \n     remaining outside the communist party. He informed me that \n     the government does not pressure him and that he has been \n     able to operate freely. He further stated that of the 85 \n     million residents in Vietnam, only 5 million are members of \n     the communist party. However, 95 percent of the members in \n     parliament are members of the communist party. He stressed a \n     need to have more non-party members in the Assembly. I asked \n     if moving Vietnam towards a market economy could have a \n     positive impact in growing non-party participation. He \n     indicated it could be a step towards forming a two party or \n     multi-party system but that it could take a very long time.\n\n\n                                 Taiwan\n\n (Working Lunch, Dr. Lyushun Shen, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, \n                             Aug. 15, 2010)\n\n       The Deputy Foreign Minister provided a unique background in \n     that he had lived in Philadelphia and was stationed in the \n     Midwest while serving with Taiwan's foreign ministry. The \n     forum provided an opportunity to candidly discuss issues of \n     importance in our bilateral relationship as well as those \n     impacting the region.\n       We discussed the impact of Taiwan 101--the second tallest \n     building in the world--and what prestige that has brought to \n     Taipei. We discussed Taiwan's economy and the impact of the \n     economic downturn.\n       I asked the Minister what could be done about North Korea. \n     He indicated that the multilateral discussions should \n     continue to resolve the conflict. On the issues confronting \n     the cross-strait relations, the Minister was optimistic about \n     the future. He provided a background on what steps and \n     agreements have been made between Taipei and Beijing with an \n     emphasis on the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement \n     struck between both sides. This agreement will remove \n     barriers on trade and provide enhanced access for imports and \n     exports. I asked if this continued economic integration will \n     provide a framework for both sides to move peacefully in the \n     future. The Minister was optimistic it would be coupled with \n     the vibrant social integration between the people of Taiwan \n     and mainland China.\n\n\n                                 Taiwan\n\n (Meeting with Wang Jin-pyng, President of the Legislative Yuan, Aug. \n                               16, 2010)\n\n       At 9:30 am on August 16, I was hosted at the Legislative \n     Yuan by Wang Jin-pyng. I noticed a small protest outside the \n     building and the President commented that demonstrations \n     occur every day much like Washington, D.C.\n       I asked about the impact of the trade agreement between the \n     Republic of China and the People's Republic of China. Wan \n     Jin-pyng informed me that the Economic Cooperation Framework \n     Agreement (ECFA) was being discussed at the Yuan during my \n     visit and that legislators were reviewing the text which is \n     set to take effect in July 2011. He indicated that there were \n     already fourteen agreements between Taipei and Beijing.\n       I asked if this agreement signifies a certain recognition \n     of the island by Beijing and that perhaps China was moving \n     from non-recognition to non-denial. I was told that Beijing's \n     goal is still full reunification. The head of the Yuan stated \n     that the Republic of China, which is commonly referred to as \n     Taiwan, is recognized by more than twenty countries but that \n     mutual recognition is still far away.\n       I asked if Taiwan had steel interests, dumped and subsidies \n     like mainland China and what, if any, trade disputes were \n     outstanding. He indicated that napkin towels have been dumped \n     by China which forced Taiwan to levy a heavy duty. He also \n     indicated that Taiwan provided money in its budget for \n     industries to transition as the ECFA may force some \n     industries to go out of business.\n       The conversation shifted to China's hegemonic actions in \n     the region. Many entities in the region, including China and \n     Taiwan lay claim to islands in the South China Sea. A concern \n     I heard repeated during my travels is China's power grab on \n     territory and seas which could yield them rights to oil and \n     gas. The Taiwanese stated that any outstanding disputes \n     should be resolved peacefully between all interested parties.\n       When I asked about what could be done on the North Korean \n     issue, Wang Jin-pyng stated that Taiwan does not have the \n     capacity to deal with North Korea but that bilateral talks \n     should be resumed between the North and South. He indicated \n     that China could play an enhanced role and provide much \n     needed economic assistance to North Korea as an incentive. He \n     stated that the US-South Korean joint military exercises are \n     good because they put pressure on North Korea and demonstrate \n     resolve. He further stated that the issue of succession in \n     North Korea is a driving force which may impact posture and \n     actions but that the economic situation in the North is so \n     bad that we should continue to supply humanitarian aid. Wang \n     Jin-pyng believes that economic normalization in exchange for \n     security is the key to resolving the issue.\n       I asked about the importance of F-16 sales to Taiwan and \n     their real benefit in any cross-strait conflict. I was \n     informed that the sales are both substantive and symbolic in \n     showing backing for Taiwan and aiding in any future cross-\n     strait negotiations and talks. Further, Taiwan has a duty to \n     its people to provide defense of the island.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. In the absence of any other Senator on the floor, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts \nabout the surprising decisions that were noted in some of the media \nthat the majority leader, certainly with the support of the \nadministration, plans to introduce a very significant, very \ncontroversial, unacceptable amnesty amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill. The proposal is called the DREAM Act.\n  A lot of people think this is legislation that we need to deal with, \nand some have supported it over the years. It has been coming up for \nquite a number of years and never passed. So what do we have now? We \nhave a scheme to bring it up, not having had it go through the \ncommittee process. The bill was introduced March 2009. I assume that is \nwhat Majority Leader Reid plans to bring up, but we have not been given \nthe amendment language. So they have got this DREAM Act proposal. They \nwant to add it to the Defense bill, and put it on a bill that is so \nimportant they think the Congress will pass it anyway. Pass it as part \nof the Defense bill. We are weighing down the Defense bill--I am on the \nArmed Services and Judiciary Committees where both of these matters \nhave come up. They want to weigh down this armed services bill with \ncontroversial legislation that ought not to be on it, to jeopardize it \nand put us in a position where a lot of good people who otherwise want \nto support the bill will not be able to do so, No. 1.\n  No. 2, let's talk about the DREAM Act. The American people have every \nright to be unhappy with this Congress. They have every right to be \nunhappy with the President of the United States. This Congress and this \nPresident have not shown any inclination to end the massive lawlessness \nthat is occurring at our borders. We have learned\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\nthat. We went through this debate several years ago. I was engaged in \nit deeply, spent a lot of time and effort on it, and the message the \nAmerican people sent to us, when they shut down the switchboards in \nthis Senate by so many phone calls, was border security first. We have \ngot to end the lawlessness. So when you take a policy that says you are \ngoing to reward people who have entered our country illegally with a \nguaranteed pathway to citizenship, and with billions of dollars in \nfinancial aid or benefits they would not otherwise be entitled to, what \nmessage are we sending? We are sending a message, as we have too often \nsent year after year after year, that we are not committed to a lawful \nprocess of immigration in our country.\n  Let me say, a lot of people some years ago thought that we could \nnever get to a legal system of immigration. And we can. We have made \nsome progress. We have built a fence--not all that was supposed to be \nbuilt, but the fencing has helped. We have done some things that have \nhelped, but we are not there yet. I believe there is a national \nconsensus out there--polling data shows it. My conversation with my \npeople in my State and around the country in airports and so forth \nindicates that what we have to do is end the massive illegality and \nthen we can begin to talk about people who have been in our country a \nlong time. I am not saying that is something that should never be \ntalked about and dealt with. But in 1986, this country said, well, we \nhave got a lot of people here illegally. What we have got to do is to \nmake them all legalized and that will end the problem, see. Everybody \nwill be legal then. We do not have a real problem anymore. We promise \nwe will enforce the law in the future.\n  Well, the amnesty took place immediately and the ending of illegality \ndid not occur. In fact, illegality increased dramatically. Why? Because \nthe message that went out, not the words that were said by politicians \non the floor of the Senate, but the real message that went out around \nthe world was, Americans do not care if you get in the country \nillegally and if you can stay there for a while, you are going to get \namnesty too.\n  It is the same people today who are making the same argument. It \ncannot sustain scrutiny. It cannot sustain any critical analysis. It \nwill not work. It is a failed policy.\n  Look at the DREAM Act. It would eliminate the statute passed a little \nover 10 years ago in 1996 that said, if you are in the country \nillegally, you should not be given in-State tuition. A really big deal. \nOh, it is mean spirited. If you are in the country illegally, I am not \nsure what you should be entitled to, but certainly not discounted \ntuition or Pell grants, or student loans.\n  The first thing you do when you want to end illegality on immigration \npolicy is stop subsidizing it, for heaven's sake. Stop subsidizing it. \nWhat kind of mixed message is it when you have people in the country \nillegally and you give them special benefits, including Social Security \nand other benefits too?\n  They will be given a green card that has certain conditions. But, in \nfact, basically, I would say if you do not commit a felony, you are put \non a guaranteed path to citizenship. Well, oh, you have to go to school \nor get a GED or be enrolled in a community college. What happens when \nyou do these kind of things? I mean, there are people here who have \nnephews and nieces, children not in this country. They read that we \npassed such a bill as this. Why would they not think, well, I need to \nsee if I can get my relatives in, my grandchild or whoever, in this \ncountry illegally.\n  They are not allowed to come in. Everybody else has to wait in line, \nmaybe hire lawyers to make sure they can get their entry into the \ncountry legally. I will bring in my niece, my nephew, and they will \nqualify for this act in a few years. Why would that not increase the \namount of people who would come into the country illegally? It \ncertainly would do so. We have discussed these issues before.\n  This is a bogus policy. And after a few years, you are placed on a \npath to become a full citizen of the United States, ahead of millions \nof people who waited in line dutifully to get their citizenship. It is \na reward for illegality. You can spin it any way you want to. We \ndiscussed this for years in this body. It will not stand scrutiny. It \nis not good policy.\n  I understand some of my colleagues are saying this is somehow \nrelevant to the Defense bill, because there is an option to serve in \nthe military for two years that will put you on a path to citizenship. \nWell, there are programs already for people who join the military to \nenhance their ability to get citizenship.\n  But this bill is plainly legislation that has been kicked around here \nfor a decade, at least, and it has never been brought up as a Defense \nbill. It has always been brought up as an immigration bill, which it \nplainly is. So now to come in and try to say it is somehow connected \nbecause of this minute possibility, that 5 percent, probably at most, \nwould demonstrate their educational advantage through the military is a \nstretch. I want to repeat: What is happening here? This administration, \nit has been reported, is having internal analyses done to determine how \namnesty can be given without congressional action.\n  They have announced recently that people apprehended in our country \nillegally will not be deported unless they have committed a felony, \npresumably DUI or larceny, misdemeanor theft. So as long as you do not \nplead guilty to a drug felony, that will not lead to deportation.\n  That is the kind of action that eviscerates enforcement. We do not \nneed to be having that kind of policy in our country. We had the \nspectacle, shortly after President Obama was elected, when a hard-\nworking, honest ICE agent conducted a raid at a company in Bellingham, \nWashington and found a whole bunch of people there illegally working, \nand it caused an uproar.\n  Secretary Napolitano said, I am going to get to the bottom of it. Was \nshe getting to the bottom of this company that hired a bunch of illegal \naliens? No. She was going to get to the bottom of how it was that a law \nenforcement officer actually had the gumption or the initiative to go \nout and try to enforce the law in this country. They announced a policy \nbased on campaign promises they had made during the campaign that they \nwere not going to do that anymore. And, presumably, I am not aware of \nany that have been conducted since. They have people from immigration \nadvocacy groups running to the administration in high concern--you \npromised us you would not enforce this kind of law.\n  What do the American people think about this? They are not happy. \nPeople should not be happy about it. We are a nation of laws. We need \nto end the lawlessness. I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 years. I know \nsomething about how this has played out, and I have looked at it \nclosely over the last decade. It was not something I chose to be \ninvolved with. We almost had to raise a question and begin to examine \nit.\n  What I have discovered is, the potential is there, it is within our \ngrasp, to be able to end this massive lawlessness and create a lawful \nsystem.\n  At that point, we will be able to involve the American people and \nthen ask how should we treat people who might have come here young and \nhave been here quite a number of years? How should they be treated? But \nto do anything that creates a guaranteed path to citizenship for people \nwho are here illegally now will only undermine the progress we have \nmade in enforcement in recent years. People can wish things were \ndifferent. But in my analysis, we simply have to follow through on the \nlaw of the land, to end the lawlessness. We may need to pass \nlegislation to help, and we will. But we also have to have the will of \nthe Commander in Chief, the chief law enforcement officer, the \nPresident of the United States. We have to have the support of the \nmajority leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, and the \nmajority party in the Senate. They have to be committed to ending \nlawlessness. Are they or are they not? They will say they are. But I \nwould say this DREAM Act gimmick, this manipulation to stick it on the \nDefense bill is a clear statement that they are not committed to it.\n  In fact, what they are committed to is a political plan to assuage \nsome campaign promises made last time and to provide another method of \nlegalizing those who have entered the country illegally. That is not \nright.\n  What are we going to do? Let's get busy. Let's end the lawlessness \nnow.\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\nWe can do this in a few years. It is not going to break the bank. I \nhave been there and looked at it and studied it. If we followed up on \nthe gains we have made, we would make even more and be in a position to \nwrestle with these kinds of issues.\n  My concern is the following: First, it ought not to be on the Defense \nbill. It ought to come through in the regular order and in the light of \nday so people can have hearings and testimony, and citizens who are \nconcerned about it on either side can have their view and their say. \nSecondly, we don't have the money. Estimates I have seen have indicated \nthat this bill, amazingly, could cost the Treasury of the United States \n$19.2 billion just for the first 2 years. Where are we getting that \nmoney from? We are already in record deficits, having almost doubled \nthe debt, and will triple the debt in 8 more years. We are going to add \nanother $19 billion to subsidize illegal activity? In addition to that, \nSocial Security entitlement benefits, welfare, Pell grants, student \nloans, all those would be added to the cost also.\n  Are there any funds to investigate whether someone is qualified? It \nmay be that the average American hearing this debate says: These people \ncame here at age 3. They should qualify for in-state tuition, even if \nthey illegally came here. But those qualifications, coming here at that \nage, is not the requirement, first. No. 2, they only have to prove they \nhave been in the country for 5 years. How do they prove it? They \nproduce false documents. This is commonly done. How do they prove they \ncame here at age 14, age 12? They may or may not have documents.\n  Do you think the FBI is going to take a document submitted to the \nimmigration people to justify qualifications under the DREAM Act? Does \nanybody think the FBI is going to investigate to see if these are \nforged documents? Nobody is going to check this out; they don't have \ntime. There is no money in the legislation to do so, no requirement \nthat I can see to do so.\n  I know illegal immigration causes significant social and emotional \nproblems throughout society. Some would say the way to remedy it is to \nnot let anybody suffer any consequences as a result of violating the \nlaws of the United States. Just don't enforce the laws. Reward the \npeople who came in here illegally. Don't do anything about it.\n  Of course, on the surface that is untenable. But when you come up \nwith a plan that simply says if you are in our country illegally, you \ndon't qualify for in-state tuition, or you don't get subsidized student \nloans if you came into the country illegally, this is seen as harsh and \nmean spirited and should not occur. But great governments have to \ndecide how they are going to conduct their business, and they have to \ndecide whether we are going to end this lawlessness and have a lawful \nsystem of immigration.\n  This country, by the American people, has made up its mind. They have \ntold the Congress what they want. But the arrogance, the total \ndisrespect of the decent, honorable plea from the American people to \nend the lawlessness and create a system we can be proud of is \nsurprising to me. I would think the Congress, after all we have been \nthrough, would have understood that the plea of the American people is \nnot mean spirited. It is not unfair. It is quite legitimate and decent. \nWe believe in immigration. We want immigrants to come to the country. \nWe believe they should apply. We believe people who qualify should come \nhere before people who do not qualify. That is what America is all \nabout. That kind of legal system is one of the things that attracts \npeople all over the world to come here. It should not be undermined.\n  If we do the right thing, we will reject this amendment. Hopefully, \nit will not even be brought up. Please, I hope it is not brought up. It \nis just going to cause a lot of frustration and tension on the Defense \nbill that ought to be focused on the men and women in harm's way and \nhow to help them do their job better and more safely. I hope it does \nnot come up. But if it does, it needs to be voted down. We need to tell \nthe President, tell his Secretary of Homeland Security and his ICE \ndepartment, tell Members of Congress we are tired of fooling around. \nLet's get busy and complete the job and create a lawful system of \nimmigration of which we can be proud.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GOODWIN.

Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto mark the passing and honor the service of Army National Guard \nsoldier SGT Steven DeLuzio of South Glastonbury, CT.\n  Sergeant DeLuzio died August 22 during a fierce small arms attack \nwhile serving with the Vermont National Guard in Paktika, Afghanistan. \nHe had only 19 days left before he was due home to his family and loved \nones.\n  Sergeant DeLuzio graduated from Glastonbury High School, where he was \na born leader and active in school activities. He served as freshman \nclass secretary and is best known for leading the Glastonbury hockey \nteam to a State championship his senior year as cocaptain. Feeling a \ncall to serve after the events of 9/11 he signed up to serve with the \nVermont National Guard in 2004, just like his older brother, Scott. He \nserved one tour of duty in Iraq in 2006 and was deployed to Afghanistan \nin March of this year.\n  In his too short time, Sergeant DeLuzio proved himself as a selfless \nand heroic soldier. Many in the small town of South Glastonbury speak \nof Steven as always putting family and country first. His father, Mark \nDeLuzio, told the local paper that ``Steven is a hero and the greatest \nson.'' Due to his heroic actions on the day of his death, Steven was \nposthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.\n  As a tribute to such an extraordinary young man hundreds of mourners \nattended funeral services for Steven this past weekend at St. Patrick's \nchurch in South Glastonbury. His brother, Scott, who is currently \nserving in Afghanistan as well, said that Steven was ``a best friend. \nHe was more than just a brother. He was all you can ask for in a \nfriend.''\n  Steven DeLuzio was a man of dauntless courage and bravery. His \nservice and his sacrifice are a credit to his parents, Mark and Diane. \nI know how proud they, along with the rest of their community, are of \nhim, and I hope they know that we grieve alongside them. They, along \nwith Steven's fiancee, Leeza Gutt, are in our hearts.\n  Our freedom is won and our country endures because of the selfless \nsacrifice of heroic young men and women such as SGT Steven DeLuzio. All \nof us in Connecticut and across America mourn this tragic loss, and \nnone of us will ever forget the debt of gratitude we owe to him and his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/16/senate-section/article/S7168-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7168-S7170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LEGACY OF AGENT ORANGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, during the Vietnam war more than 20 \nmillion gallons of herbicide known as Agent Orange, much of it \ncontaining the highly toxic chemical dioxin, were stored, mixed, \nhandled, and sprayed by U.S. airplanes over millions of acres of forest \nand farmland in Vietnam. Since then, dioxin has been linked by the U.S. \nInstitutes of Medicine to various cancers and other debilitating \ndiseases, as well as birth defects. The International Agency for \nResearch on Cancer and the National Institute of Environmental Health \nSciences classify it as a human carcinogen.\n  Millions of Vietnamese citizens and U.S. military personnel were \nexposed,\n\n[[Page S7169]]\n\nin one way or another, to Agent Orange, and its effects have been a \nsubject of controversy for more than three decades. Today, the U.S. \nVeterans Administration recognizes 12 diseases and 1 birth defect \nrelated to herbicide exposure and recently added 3 more diseases as \neligible for compensation from the Federal Government.\n  Thanks to the efforts of U.S. veterans who suffered from the effects \nof dioxin, their needs have been recognized and are finally being \naddressed. But in Vietnam, where the government lacks the resources to \neither clean up the residual dioxin contamination or to adequately \nassist those who have suffered health problems, the legacy of Agent \nOrange remains a difficult and emotional subject for U.S.-Vietnamese \nrelations.\n  On the one hand, the Government of Vietnam for years blamed Agent \nOrange for seemingly any case of birth defect in the country, no matter \nhow farfetched. On the other hand, the U.S. Government consistently \ndenied causation between Agent Orange and birth defects in Vietnam and \nrefused to accept any responsibility for the alleged harm. For years, \nthe issue remained a contentious one for our countries.\n  Then about a decade ago, thanks to an initiative funded by the Ford \nFoundation and with the participation of the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, research was done that went a long way toward \ndispelling the myths about the extent of contamination, as well as \nidentifying where the most serious threats remain. Some 28 ``hot \nspots'' of varying degrees of dioxin contamination were located where \nAgent Orange had been stored or handled, often resulting in extensive \nspills and leakage into the soil or groundwater, from where it moved up \nthe food chain. The sites with the worst contamination are the Da Nang, \nBien Hoa, and Phu Cat airports. For example, in the area of the Da Nang \nAirport, dioxin levels in soil, sediment, and fish were documented as \n300 to 400 times higher than what is considered safe. And the \ncontamination is passed genetically from one generation to the next.\n  In 2006, the same year that a Joint Advisory Committee of U.S. and \nVietnamese Government agencies was established to discuss ways to \naddress this problem, the Department of State and Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, which I chair, provided $3 million for ``environmental \nremediation of dioxin-contaminated sites and related health activities \nin Vietnam'' for fiscal year 2007. An additional $3 million was \nprovided for fiscal year 2009 and the same amount again for fiscal year \n2010. The 2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act includes $12 million for \nthese purposes, and S. 3676, the Senate version of the fiscal year 2011 \nDepartment of State and Foreign Operations bill, which was reported by \nthe Appropriations Committee on July 29, 2010, includes another $15 \nmillion. Chairman Faleomavaega of the House Subcommittee on Asia, the \nPacific, and the Global Environment has held two hearings on the issue, \nand in July, Senators Harkin and Sanders traveled to Vietnam and \nvisited the Da Nang site.\n  The Government of Vietnam also provides tens of millions of dollars \nfor small monthly payments to persons with disabilities believed to \nhave been caused by Agent Orange, as well as some funds for dioxin \ncleanup. The Ford Foundation has provided $14 million for activities in \nVietnam related to Agent Orange. These include dioxin containment at \nthe Da Nang Airport, services and opportunities for people with \ndisabilities in eight particularly affected provinces, and to support \nthe work of the U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/Dioxin, a \nbinational committee of scientists, educators, and policy analysts. \nOther U.S. philanthropic organizations, including the Gates Foundation \nand Atlantic Philanthropies, as well as several governments and United \nNations agencies, have also contributed, while U.S. nongovernmental \norganizations have implemented programs to deliver services to affected \npeople. American companies have also been exploring greater business \npartnerships with Vietnam and contributing to education and other \nefforts. The Dialogue Group's Plan of Action calls for a 10-year effort \nthat would combine continuing U.S. and Vietnamese Government support \nwith support from nonprofits and corporations that have business \nrelationships in Vietnam. These would all be helpful steps.\n  My own interest in addressing the legacy of Agent Orange evolved from \nthe use of the Leahy War Victims Fund in Vietnam to assist persons with \ndisabilities, primarily victims of landmines and other unexploded \nordnance left over from the war, and my efforts to address the problem \nof civilian casualties and to assist innocent victims of the military \noperations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Since 1988, through the U.S. Agency for International Development and \nimplementing partners, including the Vietnam Veterans of America \nFoundation and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped, the U.S. \nGovernment has provided tens of millions of dollars through the Leahy \nfund for medical, rehabilitation and vocational assistance, training, \nand equipment. However, no one knows how many of the beneficiaries of \nthese programs may have been disabled as a result of exposure to Agent \nOrange, and large areas of the country still lack services for people \nwith disabilities.\n  In 2007, it was Bobby Muller, the former president of Vietnam \nVeterans of America Foundation, who had been instrumental, indeed \nindispensible, in promoting postwar reconciliation and the eventual \nnormalization of relations with Vietnam, who suggested to me that the \nU.S. Government needed to do something about Agent Orange. Vietnam and \nthe United States were making progress on so many fronts, from locating \nthe remains of MIAs to cooperation on HIV/AIDS and expanding tourism \nand trade, that it made no sense for the issue of dioxin contamination \nto remain a sore point. I agreed that we should try to turn this \ncontentious issue into one on which both countries could work together.\n  Since then, while it has taken far longer than I would have liked to \ndevelop a plan for utilizing the funds, the administration is now at \nthe point of identifying the most cost-effective remediation technique \nfor Da Nang, and, as I have noted, we are fortunate that in the \nmeantime other donors have joined this effort.\n  We also need to look forward. In Senate Report 111-237 accompanying \nS. 3676, the Appropriations Committee directs USAID, in consultation \nwith the Department of State, the Government of Vietnam, and other \ninterested parties, to develop a multiyear plan for Agent Orange \nactivities in Vietnam. This plan, which should reflect input from \ninterested parties with a history of working on this issue such as the \nFord Foundation and the U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/\nDioxin, should identify the key activities for the environmental \nremediation and health/disability components of this effort, indicate \nhow U.S. funding will be coordinated with and complimentary to the \ncontributions of other donors and how nongovernmental organizations, \nincluding nonprofits and businesses, can play constructive roles. It \nshould set clear goals, benchmarks for measuring progress, and \nestimated costs associated with these activities. In doing so, we will \nnot only chart our way forward, we will demonstrate to the Government \nof Vietnam and its people that we intend to continue to play a central \nrole in this effort.\n  To that end, I want to emphasize the importance of the health \ncomponent. While the soil and sediment remediation is critical and has \nreceived the most attention, it would be hard to overstate the \nimportance the Vietnamese give to addressing the needs of people who \nhave been harmed. While it may not be possible to definitively diagnose \nAgent Orange as the cause of a person's disability, the plan should \ninclude surveys or other steps to locate people who suffer from \ndisabilities that may have been caused by dioxin, so they can be \nhelped. An expanded involvement by nonprofit organizations, businesses, \nand philanthropies remains key to this humanitarian effort, and there \nis no longer any reason for hesitancy on the part of U.S. companies in \nVietnam in supporting such work.\n  After a tragic war that left deep scars in both Vietnam and the \nUnited States, we have become partners on a wide range of issues. We \nstill have our differences, particularly concerning human rights, but \nwe want to make progress in whatever ways we can. The legacy of Agent \nOrange, for years an issue that divided us, is now one that is bringing \nus together.\n\n[[Page S7170]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/16/senate-section/article/S7170-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7170-S7171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          RETIREMENT SECURITY\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today as chairman of the Special \nCommittee on Aging to talk about retirement security in America. In \nrecent years, workers have seen their savings take a hit, with many \nwondering whether they will ever be able to retire. The current \nretirement income deficit--in other words, the gap between what \nAmericans will need in retirement and what they will actually have--is \n$6.6 trillion, according to the nonpartisan Center for Retirement \nResearch at Boston College. Now more than ever, we need to strengthen \nour Nation's pension and 401(k) systems so that Americans can protect \nthe retirement savings they work a lifetime to earn.\n  In doing so, we must recognize that today's retirement savings \nvehicles look a lot different than they did a generation ago. Our \ncurrent system increasingly places the responsibility for saving on the \nindividual, meaning that people have to make retirement decisions on \ntheir own because many employers are not doing it for them. That is why \nthe Aging Committee is working to give people more guidance, more \ntools, and more protection.\n  Many Americans are increasingly relying on 401(k)-type defined \ncontribution savings plans to fund their retirement. Having a 401(k) \nrequires an individual to make several proactive decisions, including \nthe decision to save, how much to save, how to invest their savings, \nwhether to take loans out, and how to make their savings last through \nretirement. The committee's focus has been on helping participants make \nbetter decisions. After all, a person should not have to be a financial \nplanning expert in order to plan for a secure retirement.\n  We are discovering that the best system would have certain automatic \nfeatures, such as automatic enrollment with escalating contribution \nrates and target date funds that adjust automatically, combined with \noptions to opt out for those who want to create their own portfolio. We \nare pushing for more retirement coverage through ideas like better \ntarget date funds that are designed in the best interests of \nparticipants.\n  We are collaborating with the Department of Labor on many of these \nissues and also introducing our own bills in some cases. Senator Tom \nHarkin and I introduced a bill to require the disclosure of 401(k) fees \nto participants. A small difference in fees, compounded over a \nlifetime, can make a huge difference in overall savings. I commend the \nLabor Department for recently issuing regulations that will bring \ngreater transparency and disclosure of 401(k) fees and make it easier \nfor employers to ensure that their plans' fees are reasonable, and I \nlook forward to reviewing the Department's participant fee disclosure \nregulations when they are issued this fall. Senators Bingaman, Isakson, \nand I have introduced the Lifetime Income Disclosure Act, which would \nhave 401(k) statements translate the balance into a potential stream of \nretirement income. This will help participants save and plan for an \nadequate retirement. I am also working with my colleagues to ensure \nthat oversight of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the entity \nthat insures the pensions of more than 44 million workers and retirees, \nis strengthened.\n  Of course, we cannot talk about retirement security without talking \nabout Social Security. The Aging Committee recently released a report \nthat lays all the options on the table for making it secure over the \nlong term. We also must make sure that those who rely on it the most \nare protected. Finally, one of the most important ways to have a secure \nretirement is to work longer. We are focused on the removal of barriers \nto working past retirement age for those who choose to do so. Our \nefforts will keep people in the labor force and encourage employers to \noffer the benefits and flexibility many are looking for later in life.\n  In closing, I would like to applaud the many advocacy groups that are \nstriving to create a universal, secure, and adequate pension system. \nTheir efforts to bring necessary attention to the important issue of \nretirement security are appreciated. Together we will continue our work \nto improve retirement security for all Americans.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise today to speak out in support of \nRetirement USA's ``Wake Up, Washington!'' Month and to wake up my \ncolleagues to the looming retirement crisis in this country. The public \nhas already woken up. A recent survey found that 92 percent of adults \naged 44 to 75 believe there is a retirement crisis in America. Now it \nis time for Congress to address this crisis before it is too late.\n  We are already seeing the beginnings of the retirement crisis. Just \nlook at all of the older Americans forced to delay retirement or go \nback into the workforce because of the economic downturn. If we do not \nchange course, it is going to get much worse.\n  Next year, the first baby boomers will turn 65, and it is clear that \nmany are not prepared for retirement. According to the Employee Benefit \nResearch Institute, nearly one-half of them are at risk of not having \nsufficient retirement resources to pay for basic retirement \nexpenditures and uninsured healthcare costs.\n  The picture is not any better for the rest of American workers. \nThirty-one percent of workers do not have any retirement savings at \nall, and 43 percent of workers have less than $10,000. If those numbers \nare not sobering enough, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston \nCollege calculated America's retirement income deficit for Retirement \nUSA. They estimate that the gap between what people need for retirement \nand what they actually have is $6.6 trillion. That is a scary number.\n  There simply is no question that retirement is getting less and less \nsecure in this country. In the past, people relied on the ``three-\nlegged stool'' of retirement security--private pensions, personal \nsavings, and Social Security--but that stool has gotten awfully wobbly. \nOver 40 percent of workers lack access to any employer-sponsored \nretirement plan at all, the rising cost of living and stagnant wages \nare making it tougher for people to save, and our Social Security \nsystem is under attack.\n  It used to be that many workers could rely on defined benefit \npensions. Those plans are one of the best ways to ensure that workers \nhave a secure retirement because they provide a predictable, guaranteed \nsource of income that workers can count on for the duration of their \nlives. But, unfortunately, the traditional defined benefit pension is \nan endangered species. The number of employers offering these plans has \nfallen drastically over the past three decades. Now, less than 20 \npercent of workers in the private sector have the security of a defined \nbenefit pension.\n  The vast majority of employees with any retirement plan at all just \nhave a 401(k), but those plans do not provide real retirement security. \nThey leave workers exposed to the constant risk that the plans' \ninvestments will perform poorly. Look at what has happened to people's \n401(k)s over the past few years. Billions of dollars of retirement \nsavings have just evaporated, and lots of workers--especially people \ngetting close to retirement--saw any chance they had of retiring vanish \novernight. 401(k)s also do not provide workers with guaranteed lifetime \nincome like traditional pension plans. That means that workers and \ntheir families are forced to bear the risk that they will outlive their \nretirement savings.\n  Plus, in these troubled economic times, families are facing \nunprecedented challenges and saving for retirement just is not an \noption for many. Wages have been stagnant for years, yet the cost of \nliving keeps going up. People are working harder and longer than ever \nbefore, but they still cannot seem to meet the costs of basic everyday \nneeds, like education, transportation, and housing, let alone save \nenough to support them in their old age.\n  For many Americans, the only retirement security they have is Social \nSecurity, but that, too, is under siege. There are those that want to \nprivatize the system, cut back benefits, and raise the retirement age. \nThey say that everyone should just work longer and that retirement is a \n``luxury.'' Clearly, those people do not swing a hammer for a living. \nThey do not toil in our corn fields or work on our oil rigs. For \nAmericans who work in these physically demanding jobs, working longer \nsimply is not an option. A lifetime of hard work takes its toll, and at \nsome point, a person just cannot do it anymore.\n\n[[Page S7171]]\n\n  We are facing a future where no one other than the rich will have the \nopportunity for a safe and secure retirement. People that work hard for \ntheir entire lives will find themselves teetering on the brink of \npoverty, unable to pay the basic costs of living. That is going to have \ndrastic consequences for families and our country as a whole.\n  It is time for our Nation to face the retirement crisis head on, and \nfor our lawmakers to take aggressive action to protect future \ngenerations. We can start by working on some fixes for the current \nsystem. We need to shore up the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, \nprotect Social Security, and address the problems facing the Nation's \ncorporate and multiemployer pension plans. We should also consider \nimprovements to 401(k) plans like improved disclosures and lifetime \nincome solutions. But all of those things are just short-term fixes.\n  We need to go further. We need to work toward comprehensive reform of \nour retirement system. Americans who have worked hard and played by the \nrules deserve a secure retirement. They deserve to be able to enjoy \ntheir golden years, to spend time with their families, and to rest \nafter a lifetime of hard work. We need to help people to work toward a \nsecure retirement by expanding access to retirement plans, making it \neasier for workers to save, and finding ways to make sure they do not \nhave to worry about outliving their savings.\n  The retirement crisis is just too big to ignore, so as chairman of \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, I am making \nretirement security a priority. The committee will be holding a series \nof hearings to explore the difficult issues surrounding retirement \nsecurity, and I am hopeful that, together with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, we will be able to come up with creative solutions \nto our Nation's retirement challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/16/senate-section/article/S7171-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 ARLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL ENVIROTHON TEAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, today I pay tribute to retired \nU.S. Air Force LTG Thomas Patten Stafford, a former National \nAeronautics and Space Administration astronaut and the first U.S. \ngeneral officer to travel into space, being one of only 24 people to \nfly to the Moon. A command pilot in both the Air Force and NASA, \nGeneral Stafford gave a lifetime of service to the Nation in space \nexploration, logging multiple flights into space to further our \nunderstanding and capabilities in space exploration. As one of the \npioneers of our country's space program, General Stafford established \nprotocols, procedures, and even a few records, that are still present \nin today's contemporary space programs and operations. He has been a \nnational treasure and an unsung hero, willingly taking on the \nchallenges associated with our innate fascination with what lay beyond \nour terrestrial home.\n  General Stafford graduated with honors from the U.S. Naval Academy in \n1952 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. He \nattended pilot training at Connally Air Force Base, Waco, TX, in 1953 \nand after completing advanced interceptor training was assigned to his \nfirst tactical duty station at Ellsworth Air Force Base, Rapid City, \nSD, as a pilot with the 54th Flight Interceptor Squadron with the \nmission of planning for and executing the air defense of the United \nStates. It was in 1955 that General Stafford received an overseas \nassignment to Hahn Air Base, Germany, where he joined the 496th Fighter \nInterceptor Squadron, at the tip of the spear as part of the United \nStates defense of Europe during the Cold War. At the time, the 496th \nflew F-86D model aircraft, known as the ``Sabre Dog.'' It was a \ntransonic jet, all-weather interceptor designed to intercept Soviet \nattack and bomber aircraft. It was during this time that General \nStafford developed and honed his flying abilities and understanding of \nflight operations and performance testing, which would prove vital to \nhis influence over our Nation's space program and guarantee many \nsuccesses in those endeavors.\n  In 1962, General Stafford was selected among the second group of \nastronauts to participate in Projects Gemini and Apollo, the two fabled \nnational space programs that epitomize our country's tremendous quest \nfor space exploration. In December 1965, General Stafford piloted \nGemini VI, the first rendezvous in space, thus developing and proving \ntechniques for space rendezvous that would be critical for future \noperations. In June 1966, he commanded Gemini IX and demonstrated a \nrendezvous technique that would be used in the Apollo missions to the \nMoon. And because of this expertise, he headed the mission planning \nanalysis and software development responsibilities for the astronaut \ngroup for Project Apollo.\n  The most pivotal piece to this was his development and implementation \nof the techniques a pilot would use to manually fly the Saturn booster \ninto orbit and the descent and ascent to and from the Moon's surface. \nAll of this culminated with his command of the Apollo 10 mission in May \n1969, when General Stafford personally performed the first lunar module \nrendezvous around the Moon and the entire lunar landing mission except \nfor the actual landing.\n  It was with this expertise that General Stafford assumed the role of \nDeputy Director of Flight Crew Operations at the NASA Manned Space \nFlight Center, where he was responsible for the planning and \nimplementation of programs for the astronaut group and all aircraft \noperations. General Stafford's time with NASA culminated with his \nfourth space flight as the Apollo commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test \nProject mission in 1975. This was a joint space flight with the Soviet \nUnion that culminated in the historic first meeting in space between \nAmerican Astronauts and Soviet Cosmonauts.\n  General Stafford was the first member of his Naval Academy Class of \n1952 to pin on the first, second and third stars of a general officer. \nHe flew six rendezvous in space, logged over 507 hours in space flight \nand wore the Air Force Command Pilot Astronaut Wings. In his life time \nhe has flown over 127 different types of aircraft and helicopters and \nfour different types of spacecraft. And in his later years in the Air \nForce, General Stafford was personally involved in the development of \ntwo of our most critical Air Force stealth aircraft: the F-117A Stealth \nFighter and the B-2 Stealth Bomber.\n  Though General Stafford retired from the Air Force in 1979, his \nefforts in our country's space program continued. In his post \nretirement period, General Stafford continued to influence our efforts \nin space, chairing independent think tank teams focused on developing a \n30 year roadmap for both Presidents Bush and Clinton for returning and \ninhabiting the Moon and extending our exploration efforts to Mars. And \nhe currently sits as the Chairman of the NASA Advisory Council Task \nForce on International Space Station Operational Readiness and the \ncochairman\n\n[[Page S7172]]\n\nof the Stafford-Covey Space Shuttle Return to Flight Task Group.\n  General Stafford is a true American hero; an amazing testament to the \nspirit and the selflessness of the American public servant. There are \nvery few that have obtained the level of historic influence as he has, \nleaving behind a true legacy for all of us to follow. General Stafford \ncelebrates his 80th birthday this Friday, September 17, 2010. There is \na lot to be said for 80 years of life that have seen some two-thirds of \nthat spent in the service to our Nation. I, for one, take my hat off to \na great national icon and applaud him for what he has done for this \ngreat nation. On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I \nthank General Stafford and his family for their lifelong commitment, \nsacrifice, and contribution to this great Nation and I wish him a happy \n80th birthday with many more to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/16/senate-section/article/S7172-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/16/senate-section/article/S7172-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "16", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/16/senate-section/article/S7172-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n PERSONS WHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM THAT WAS \n   ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2006--PM 66\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend chapter 5 of title 40, United States Code, \nto include organizations whose membership comprises substantially \nveterans as recipient organizations for the donation of Federal surplus \npersonal property through State agencies; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation to add military veterans to the list of groups eligible to \nreceive excess property donations from the Federal Government. The \nsacrifices that members of our armed forces make every day for us and \nour country cannot be overstated, and I welcome any opportunity to \nrecognize their services. While this bill is a small token, it is \nanother effort to give back to our military veterans. I encourage the \nSenate to act swiftly and pass this bill.\n  The FOR VETS Act will enable military veterans to receive surplus \ngoods donations through the Federal Government's property distribution \nprogram. The types of property donated through this program include \ncomputers, trucks, snowmobiles, home appliances, and electronics. These \nare items that would be of good use to our military veterans, and which \nthey should have the opportunity to claim.\n  The administrator of General Services oversees this property \ndistribution program, which currently donates property to medical \ninstitutions, providers of assistance to the homeless, universities, \nand child care facilities, among others. Given the surplus of available \ngoods, military veterans' groups are simply being added into this pool \nof recipients for goods that might otherwise go unused.\n  I am pleased to be joined by the Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee Ranking Member, Senator Collins, in sponsoring this \nlegislation. This is a bipartisan effort, as legislation to support our \nveterans should always be, and I hope Congress will come together to \npromptly send this legislation to the President to be signed into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3794\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations of \nUnited States assistance to help eliminate conditions in foreign \nprisons and other detentions facilities that do not meet minimum \nhuman standards of health, sanitation, and safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  \n  The Record has been corrected to read: S. 3798. A bill to \nauthorize appropriations of United States assistance to help \neliminate conditions in foreign prisons and other detention \nfacilities that do not meet minimum human standards of health, \nsanitation, and safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join today with the \nSenator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, in introducing a piece of \nlegislation that has already attracted broad support from across the \nsocial and political spectrum.\n  This bill, titled the Foreign Prison Conditions Improvement Act of \n2010, seeks to address a much neglected, global human rights problem--\nthe inhumane treatment of people in foreign prisons and other detention \nfacilities.\n  On any given day, millions of people are languishing in foreign \nprisons, many awaiting trial not yet having been formally charged or \nproven guilty of anything, deprived of their freedom for years longer \nthan they could have been sentenced to prison if convicted. Others \nconvicted of crimes, often after woefully unfair trials, including for \nnothing more than peacefully expressing political or religious beliefs \nor defending human rights. Regardless of their status they have one \nthing in common. They are deprived of the most basic rights and \nnecessities--safe water, adequate food, essential medical care, \npersonal safety, and dignity.\n  Anyone who has been inside one of these facilities, or seen \nphotographs or the press reports of what they are like, understands \nthat I am talking about the mistreatment of human beings in ways that \nare reminiscent of the Dark Ages.\n  A few examples are all that are needed to illustrate the point. In \nHaiti's National Penitentiary before the January 12th earthquake, more \nthan 4,000 prisoners were confined in a space built for less than 900. \nMany did not have room to lie down and had to sleep standing up. \nSanitation was practically non-existent. Deadly contagious diseases \nwere rampant. The overwhelming majority of inmates had never been \nformally charged, never seen a lawyer or a judge. The earthquake \ndamaged the prison and the prison guards fled, leaving the inmates to \nfend for themselves without food or water. They managed to get out, but \nthe squalid facility is quickly filling up again. Today I am told the \nconditions there are worse than ever.\n  A recent newspaper article described how in Benin, in West Africa, \nmaggots digest the bodies of dead prisoners. The skin of prisoners is \nragged from the extraction of fly larvae, a scourge that is symptomatic \nof the deplorable conditions. Many inmates suffer from tuberculosis, \nscabies, parasites, lung infections or other illnesses. The prison in\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\nAbomey, located in southern Benin, was built in 1904 to house a maximum \nof 150 prisoners. These days, more than 1,000 are reportedly confined \nthere.\n  It is common in prisons from Central America to Central Africa to \nCentral Asia for inmates to be severely malnourished and to go for \nmonths without being able to wash. Many prisoners depend for survival \non food brought to them by their relatives. In many countries \nindividuals awaiting trial, young and old, are housed together with \nconvicted, violent criminals.\n  Prisoners and other detainees in many countries are also routinely \nvictimized by poorly trained, abusive guards, who are virtually \nunsupervised and unaccountable to any higher authority. Sexual abuse of \nmen, women and children is common.\n  A government commission in Cameroon reported that an average of five \nprisoners die per month in a prison there, simply from lack of proper \nmedical care. Inmates in many countries suffer from HIV/AIDS and other \nillnesses, in prisons with no medical records, where doctors do not \nenter. Prisoners intentionally cut or otherwise harm themselves in the \nhope of receiving medical attention for life-threatening illnesses. If \nand when they are released, they infect the local population.\n\n  A recent New York Times article described how in Zambia prisoners are \npunished by being stripped naked and held in solitary confinement in \nsmall, windowless cells, sometimes for days on end, in ankle-to-calf-\nhigh water contaminated with their own excrement. It is like something \nout of The Count of Monte Cristo, only worse because it is happening in \nthe 21st Century.\n  But the article went on to describe how the Zambian Prison Service \ncompleted its own internal audit, appointed a new medical director and \nallowed human rights workers access to its facilities.\n  The bill Senator Brownback and I are introducing seeks to provide \nincentives for those kinds of improvements. Our bill would do the \nfollowing:\n  First, it calls attention to this long ignored problem. Most people \nknow little if anything about what goes on inside foreign prisons, and \nmany would prefer not to know.\n  Second, it sets forth minimum standards for the elimination of \ninhumane conditions in foreign prisons and other detention facilities, \nsuch as human waste facilities that are sanitary and accessible, and \nadequate ventilation, food, and safe drinking water.\n  Third, it requires the Secretary of State to report annually on those \ncountries that receive United States assistance that do not meet \nminimum standards for the elimination of inhumane conditions but are \nmaking significant efforts to comply, and those that are not making \nsuch efforts.\n  Fourth, it encourages the Secretary and the Administrator of the U.S. \nAgency for International Development to assist countries that are \nmaking significant efforts to eliminate inhumane conditions. And for \nthose that are not, it requires the Secretary to enter into \nnegotiations with such governments to eliminate inhumane conditions. It \nauthorizes the Secretary and the Administrator to restructure, \nreprogram, or reduce assistance, or to furnish or deny U.S. visas to \nthe officials of the government of such a country, if doing so would \nhelp achieve that goal.\n  The bill also provides for training of Foreign Service Officers, and \ncreates a new full time equivalent Deputy Assistant Secretary position \nat the Department of State's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and \nLabor to monitor foreign prison conditions, which has long been needed.\n  Finally, it authorizes the expenditure of funds to implement the \nbill.\n  Once enacted, the Foreign Prison Conditions Improvement Act of 2010 \nwill help foreign governments ensure that prisoners in their countries \nare treated as any people deprived of their freedom should be--as human \nbeings, with dignity, in safety, and provided the basic necessities of \nlife.\n  In countries around the world, the United States is helping to reform \njustice systems and strengthen the rule of law. No justice system can \nclaim to deliver justice if prisoners and other detainees are treated \nlike animals, or worse. By helping to change attitudes, and showing how \nwith relatively little money, conditions in a prison can be \ndramatically improved, we can help advance the cause of justice more \nbroadly.\n  Millions of people around the world still look to the United States \nas a defender of justice. This bill will further that goal, and it \nreflects the best instincts of the American people.\n  This bill has already been endorsed by a wide range of groups, \nincluding the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern \nBaptist Convention, Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, \nInternational Justice Mission, Open Society Policy Center, Penal Reform \nInternational, Prison Fellowship, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, \nNational American Religious Liberty Association, United Methodist \nChurch General Board of Church and Society, National Advocacy Center of \nthe Sisters of the Good Shepherd, Disciples Justice Action Network, and \nthe National Spiritual Assembly of the Bandais of the United States.\n  An identical bill is being introduced today in the House of \nRepresentatives by Representatives William Delahunt and Joseph Pitts, \nso this is a bipartisan, bicameral effort.\n  I want to thank Senator Brownback, and his staff, who have been \nextremely helpful in the drafting and introduction of this bill. At a \ntime when some people seem to get satisfaction from calling Washington \nbroken, this is a tangible example of how two Senators, of different \nparties, whose political views often differ, can work together in \nfurtherance of a just cause.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3801. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase \nthe maximum age for children eligible for medical care under the \nCHAMPVA program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am proposing a needed adjustment to current \neligibility requirements for children who receive health care under the \nCivilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  CHAMPVA, established in 1973 within VA, provides health care services \nto dependents and survivors of certain veterans. CHAMPVA enrollment has \ngrown steadily over the years and, as of fiscal year 2009, covers \nnearly 336,300 unique beneficiaries. Servicemembers continue to deploy \nand return home from Afghanistan and Iraq, and CHAMPVA plays a vital \nrole in caring for veterans' loved ones.\n  Under the current law, a dependent child loses eligibility for \nCHAMPVA upon turning 18 years old, unless the child is enrolled in \nschool on a full time basis. Also, after losing full-time status at \nschool, or upon turning 23 years old, an eligible child of a veteran \nwould lose eligibility.\n  With the passage earlier this year of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148, many veterans' families have \nexpressed concern regarding their own children's health care coverage. \nThe PPACA contains a provision that extends health insurance coverage \nto dependent children until age 26. I believe it is only fair to afford \nchildren who are CHAMPVA beneficiaries the same eligibility as \ndependent children whose parents have private sector coverage. Though \nthis Congress is in its final month, we need to open the discussion on \nthis issue now so that, if we must wait until next year to act, we can \ndo so quickly.\n  My hope in introducing this legislation is to ensure that CHAMPVA \nrecipients, without regard to their type of coverage, student status, \nor other limitation, are eligible for health care coverage under their \nparent's plan in the same way as their peers. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this necessary modification.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3801\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I want to explain why I will vote no on \nthe nomination of Robert D. Reischauer to serve as a public trustee of \nthe Social Security and Medicare Programs.\n  Although he has a Ph.D. in economics and extensive experience with \nFederal budgetary matters as former head of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, Dr. Reischauer claimed that he did not understand his basic \nresponsibility under Federal law to report income on his tax returns \nfrom 2004 to 2008. He only paid back taxes on rental property in Canada \nwhen he brought his failure to the attention of the White House during \nthe vetting process.\n  On his Finance Committee questionnaire, which he signed under penalty \nof perjury, he claimed this was an ``oversight'' he did not discover \nuntil 2009. But in discussions with bipartisan committee staff, he \nappeared to tell a different story and said it was a deliberate choice \nhe made at the time he filled out his tax returns. In the same meeting, \nhe said he was sorry that he told the White House.\n  And while he said that he had offsetting expenses that would have \ncanceled out his tax liability and produced a loss, Dr. Reischauer kept \nno receipts or records of those expenses, saying that he paid off \nworkers in cash.\n  It appears that Dr. Reischauer was not truthful or careful about his \nFederal responsiblity to report income. Someone who has not earned the \npublic trust is not qualified to be a public trustee, and that is why I \noppose his confirmation.\n  I ask that the Record reflect my vote against Dr. Reischauer's \nconfirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6102, which was received \nfrom the House and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6102) to amend the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010 to extend the \n     authority of the Secretary of the Navy to enter into \n     multiyear contracts for F/A-18E, F/A-18F, and EA-18G \n     aircraft.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the bill H.R. 6102 is an important bill. \nBased on authority provided in two acts, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 and the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010, the Navy and contractor team \nnegotiated a multiyear contract for purchasing F/A-18E/F and E-18G \naircraft.\n  The Secretary of Defense approved the Navy's request to sign such a \ncontract. The Secretary also provided the necessary certifications \nrequired by title 10, United States Code. The independent cost \nestimators within the Department of Defense, the office of Cost \nAnalysis and Program Evaluation, or CAPE, agreed with the Navy's \nestimate that the multiyear contract would save an estimated $590 \nmillion. Unfortunately, the Navy and the contractor team were unable to \nconclude negotiations by the deadlines set forth in the two acts \nauthorizing and appropriating funds for the multiyear contract.\n  We should not let these savings slip through our fingers just because \nthe Navy and contractors were not as prompt as the Congress envisioned \nwhen we passed the two acts last year. This bill would allow the Navy \nand the taxpayer to achieve those savings by authorizing the Navy to \nsign a multiyear contract for the F/A-18E/F and E-18G program despite \nhaving missed those deadlines.\n  I urge that the Senate pass this bill immediately.\n  Mr. GOODWIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read the third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 627, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 627) designating September 16, 2010, \n     as ``The American Legion Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise in support of legislation with \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Collins, and Senator Chambliss, which would \nofficially recognize The American Legion and its vital role in \ncommunities across the Nation, by designating September 16, 2010, as \n``The American Legion Day.''\n  Nothing describes the role of The American Legion more beautifully \nthan the preamble to its constitution which is recited by its members \nat the beginning of every official meeting. ``For God and Country, we \nassociated ourselves together for the following purposes: to uphold and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States of America; to maintain \nlaw and order; to foster and perpetuate a one hundred percent \nAmericanism; to preserve the memories and incidents of our associations \nin the Great Wars; to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the \ncommunity, state and nation; to combat the autocracy of both the \nclasses and the masses; to make right the Master of Might; to promote \npeace and good will on earth; to safeguard and transmit to posterity \nthe principles of justice, freedom and democracy; and to consecrate and \nsanctify our comradeship by our devotion to mutual helpfulness.''\n  I think we all would agree that these are extremely lofty goals for \nany organization, but amazingly for over 90 years The American Legion \nhas worked towards these objectives--not for themselves, but for \nAmerica.\n  Most people are surprised to learn that The American Legion was \nactually founded in Paris, France. World War I veterans remembered the \nchallenges facing wartime veterans from previous generations and vowed \nnot to let their fellow comrades face the same hardships, especially \nthose with service-connected disabilities. They wanted employment \nopportunities for returning combat veterans. They were concerned about \nthe survivors of combat veterans who had paid the ultimate sacrifice in \nservice to their country. And most importantly, they wanted medical \ncare provided to the wounded and ill returning service members.\n  Now, as it did at its founding, The American Legion remains focused \non supporting veterans, military service members, and their families. \nSince December 2008, The American Legion's Operation Comfort Warriors \nhas raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy merchandise for \nWounded Warriors in military medical centers around the country. \nThrough the ``Heroes to Hometowns'' program The American Legion helps \nlocal communities prepare ``welcome home'' events when wounded warriors \nare finally released from military or veterans' affairs medical \ncenters. Since the first gulf war, The American Legion has maintained \nits Family Support Network which assists deployed service members and \ntheir families, especially members of the National Guard and Reserves. \nSome requests are for financial assistance, but other requests are \nsimply for household chores, such as lawn work or car maintenance, that \nwould normally be done by the soldier, sailor, airmen, or marine, were \nthey not deployed. No request is too large or too small.\n  Many Legionnaires can be found in public schools on Veterans' Day or \nMemorial Day talking about their military service during periods of \narmed conflict to make sure the next generation of Americans \nunderstands the sacrifices and hardships of previous generations of \nwartime veterans. Legionnaires also teach students about the proper \ndisplay and care of the flag of the United States.\n  The American Legion works closely with the American Red Cross--the \nlargest organization of blood donors and a working partner in disaster \nassistance. Many American Legion Posts serve as Red Cross and Federal \nEmergency Management Agency work centers in areas hit by natural \ndisasters. Members of more than 14,000 American Legion Posts donate \nnearly 100,000 pints of blood to the American Red Cross each year.\n  The American Legion is also proud of its membership's spirit of \nvolunteerism. Each year, Legionnaires volunteer about 1 million hours \nof services in VA and military medical facilities, State veterans' \nhomes, and other such community volunteer opportunities.\n  And one of the most solemn of functions performed by The American \nLegion is providing burial details for fallen comrades of every \ngeneration. The American Legion Color Guards, Buglers and Rifle Squads \nperform thousands of burials in veterans' and private cemeteries around \nthe Nation.\n  As all of us in this Chamber know, The American Legion remains today \nan active and vigorous advocate for service members, veterans, and \ntheir families here on Capitol Hill. Among its greatest legislative \nachievements was the enactment of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of \n1944, the GI Bill of Rights. The initial draft of the GI Bill was \nwritten by Legionnaires at the Mayflower Hotel here in Washington, DC. \nMany consider the GI bill to be one of the greatest pieces of \nlegislation ever enacted.\n  Congress presented The American Legion its Federal charter on \nSeptember 16, 1919. Therefore, I think it only fitting that we proclaim \nSeptember 16, 2010, ``The American Legion Day.'' I sincerely hope that \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting this well-earned measure, \ndemonstrating our respect and esteem for this outstanding organization.\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\n  Mr. GOODWIN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 629, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 629) recognizing Hispanic Heritage \n     Month and celebrating the heritage and culture of Latinos in \n     the United States and their immense contributions to the \n     Nation.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise today to recognize September 15 \nthrough October 15 as Hispanic Heritage Month. America has always \ncelebrated its diverse heritage with pride. It has always honored those \nwho have contributed and made this Nation great.\n  Irish Americans, Italian Americans, African Americans, Asian \nAmericans--all Americans--have come to this Nation and added to the \nrich and colorful patchwork quilt of American democracy.\n  This resolution recognizes Hispanic Americans for the contributions \nthey have made to the rich fabric of America. It designates the next 30 \ndays as Hispanic Heritage Month and in so doing celebrates the long \nhistory of Latinos in the United States and the extraordinary \ncontribution they have made to this Nation throughout our history. That \nhistory is clear--written boldly but sometimes little known. But this \nis our history in America, and it is America's history.\n  Latinos have proudly served this Nation, helped build it and defend \nit, and continue to serve today.\n  We have been contributing to and have been part of the American \ntapestry for hundreds of years. Hispanics fought for freedom alongside \nthe patriots in the American Revolution.\n  Increasingly, we find references to those who came before us--\nBernardo de Galvez, a Spanish army officer--the Governor of Louisiana \nfrom 1775 to 1785--who played a role in blocking British advances \nagainst George Washington in the American Revolution. And Jorge \nFarragut, a Spanish ship captain who came to America and fought for the \ncolonies against the British.\n  He was the father of the Civil War hero ADM David Farragut, known for \nhis famous rallying cry, ``Damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead.''\n  I would imagine that few who walk past Farragut Square in \nWashington--not far from this Chamber--realize that Admiral Farragut \nwas of Hispanic origin.\n  Latinos fought and died on both sides of the Civil War and have \nparticipated in every war since. There were at least 10,000 Mexican \nAmericans fighting for the Union during the Civil War and a number of \nothers fighting for the Confederacy.\n  In one of the folkloric tales of the Civil War, there was the story \nof Loretta Velasquez who was born in Cuba and claimed that she \ndisguised herself as a male lieutenant and fought against Union forces \nat several battles, including Bull Run, and later claimed to have \nworked as a spy for the Confederacy.\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\n  Even in the Spanish-American War, a dozen Latinos were among Teddy \nRoosevelt's Rough Riders.\n  In World War I, an Army pilot, David Cantu Barkley of Laredo, TX, of \nMexican decent volunteered to penetrate German lines in France. With a \ncomrade, he drew maps of German positions and supplies.\n  Barkley drowned on the return trip, but his partner survived and \ncarried back the logistical information. Praised by General Pershing, \nBarkley won the Medal of Honor. Among the heroes of World War II was \nmarine PFC Guy ``Gabby'' Gabaldon who won the Navy Cross for capturing \nmore than a thousand enemy soldiers in the South Pacific during the \nsummer of 1944.\n  The honor and patriotism of these brave soldiers cannot be \noverstated.\n  The story of Alejandro Ruiz, an Army private who fought in Okinawa, \nepitomizes their commitment to this Nation and the tragedy some of them \nendured.\n  Private Ruiz's Medal of Honor citation noted his ``conspicuous \ngallantry above and beyond the call of duty.\n  . . . When an enemy soldier charged him his rifle jammed. Undaunted \nPrivate Ruiz whirled on his opponent and clubbed him down . . .\n  . . . Leaping from one opening to another, he sent burst after burst \ninto the pillbox, killing 12 of the enemy and completely destroying the \nposition . . .\n  . . . Private Ruiz's heroic conduct in the face of overwhelming odds, \nsaved the lives of many of his comrades and eliminated an obstacle that \nlong would have checked his unit's advance.''\n  Private Ruiz wrote in a letter: ``I never questioned my duty because \nI believe that as Americans we have a responsibility to serve our \ncountry and preserve our way of life and freedoms. All I can say is I \ndid what I had to do.''\n  Private Ruiz served this Nation with honor. Madam President, 14,000 \nHispanic soldiers served in Korea and more than 300 died; 80,000 \nHispanics served in the Vietnam war, representing 5.5 percent of those \nwho made the ultimate sacrifice for their country in those years--even \nthough, at the time, Latinos comprised only 4.5 percent of the \npopulation.\n  As we speak, 28,000 Latinos currently serve with distinction in \nAfghanistan and Iraq; 561 casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan have been \nHispanic casualties.\n  In fact, there are almost 1.5 million Hispanic veterans of the Armed \nForces in this country today who also served with honor.\n  And of the Hispanics who have served in uniform, 41 of them have been \nawarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, including David Cantu Barkley \nand Private Ruiz.\n  This month we celebrate the contribution of all Latinos to the \nhistory of this Nation.\n  We celebrate the contribution of the many community leaders and local \nheroes in our neighborhoods, our cities, and towns, and in every State \nin America.\n  All across this Nation, the Latino population is growing. We are now \nthe largest minority group in the country--contributing to the \ncommunity, the economy, and the political debate.\n  Today, Hispanics hold 29 seats in the U.S. Congress, 2 in the \nCabinet, and 1 on the Supreme Court.\n  We are no longer on the outside looking in. We are at the table on \nevery major issue before Congress--every major issue before the courts.\n  I stand here, a United States Senator, a lawyer, a Hispanic American \nwho took his seat on the floor of this Chamber not long ago and proudly \ncast my vote for Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic Justice of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  That was a historic moment for me, a historic moment for the Hispanic \nAmerican community, one we will never forget, but I can say with some \nmeasure of confidence, I believe it is only the beginning.\n  This month let us celebrate not only Hispanic Heritage but let us \nproudly celebrate and proclaim the history of Hispanics in America \ngoing back to the Revolution, and then let us recognize the role a new \ngeneration of young Latinos will play in making this, the 21st century, \nanother American century.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and join with me in \ncelebrating the heritage and culture of Latinos in the United States \nand their immense contributions to this Nation.\n  Mr. GOODWIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
