Madam President, the American people are asking us to \nstart over on health care. They are asking us to scrap the massive \nbills Democrats have been trying to force on them. They want us to \nfocus on cost instead. That has been their clear message now for over a \nyear. But yesterday Democrats in Washington said they know better. The \nPresident and his allies in Congress made up their minds to turn aside \nany pretense of bipartisanship and plow ahead on a partisan bill--a \npartisan bill, by the way, that Americans don't want. In a last-ditch \neffort to get their way, they have staked themselves to a flawed vision \nof reform over the wishes of the public. What is that vision? It is a \nvision of health care whereby the Federal Government would become more \ninvolved in the health care decisions of every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica; where small businesses get hit with new job-killing taxes; \nwhere Medicare is slashed for millions of seniors, insurance premiums \ngo up, and Federal taxpayers are required, for the first time ever, to \ncover the cost of abortions.\n  The administration and its allies in Congress have tried repeatedly \nto jam this vision of health care through Congress without success. Now \nthey are doubling down. They have one more tool in their arsenal, and \nthey are deploying it. Meanwhile, the American people are watching all \nthis in utter disbelief. Americans do want reform, but they don't want \nthis. They are fed up because the longer Democrats cling to their \nflawed vision of reform, the longer Americans have to wait for the \nreforms they really want, the longer they will have to wait for us to \nfocus on jobs and the economy.\n  The President did a very good job of laying out the problem \nyesterday. But the heart of the problem, as he himself described it, is \nthe high cost of care, and the simple fact is, the bill he wants \ndoesn't lower cost. On the contrary, the administration's own experts \nsay the Democratic plan increases cost. This alone should be reason \nenough to start all over and put together a list of commonsense, step-\nby-step reforms that will actually lower cost.\n  The good news is we already have the list. At last week's health care \nsummit at the White House, both parties acknowledged a handful of \nreforms on which all of us could agree. That is where we should start, \non the things on which we agree.\n  Unfortunately, even before the summit began, Democrats were already \nintent on pushing the same old version they were pushing before the \nsummit by any means possible. They couldn't get the old version over \nthe finish line, even with all the backroom deals, the kickbacks, and \nthe buy-offs, so sometime after the Massachusetts election,\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\nthey hatched a plan to win over wavering Democrats in the House by \npromising to use some legislative sleight of hand that will only \nrequire a slim partisan majority in the Senate. This is outrageous on \ntwo counts--first, because the method they are proposing has never been \nused on such a sweeping piece of legislation; second, because Americans \nhave already told us, loudly and clearly, they don't want this partisan \napproach. What about public opinion do our friends in the majority not \nunderstand? The American people are saying loudly and clearly they \ndon't want us to do this.\n  What is worse, many of the same Democrats who are now pushing this \nparty-line vote are on record as being foursquare against it for major \nlegislation such as this. Here is what one senior Democratic Senator \nhad to say about party-line votes on major legislation only a few years \nago:\n\n       I've never passed a single bill worth talking about that \n     didn't have as a lead co-sponsor a Republican. And I don't \n     know of a single piece of legislation that has ever been \n     adopted here that didn't have a Republican and a Democrat in \n     the lead. That's because we need to sit down and work with \n     each other. The rules of this institution have required \n     that--that's why we exist.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. Americans expect big bills to command big \nmajorities. That is why this is not a fight between Democrats and \nRepublicans; it is a fight between Democrats inside the beltway and \ntheir constituents beyond it.\n  There is a better way. There is a better path to reform that none of \nus will regret. It is time to listen to the American people. It is time \nto work together on the kinds of step-by-step reforms they are asking \nfor. Americans aren't stupid. They know the option they are being \npresented with--the option of some massive bill or nothing. That is a \nfalse choice.\n  So let's drop the partisan plan. Let's drop this unsalvageable bill, \nand let's start over.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1126-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we are now on our fourth day of \nconsideration of this important legislation to create jobs and extend \nvital safety net and tax provisions. This legislation would prevent \nmillions of Americans from falling through the safety net. It would \nextend vital programs that were extended on a short-term basis earlier \nthis year. It would put cash into the hands of Americans who would \nspend it quickly, boosting economic demand. It would extend critical \nprograms and tax incentives that create jobs.\n  This is the legislation that will help half a million workers who \nlose their jobs nationwide to get help paying for their health \ninsurance under COBRA. This is the legislation that will help nearly 40 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries and nearly 9 million TRICARE \nbeneficiaries keep access to their doctors. This is the legislation \nthat will help 400,000 Americans get unemployment insurance benefits.\n  This is urgent legislation. We must enact it soon.\n  We had a productive day yesterday. We disposed of six amendments and \nrejected a point of order against the bill. As I count it, there are \nabout 10 amendments pending. Those amendments are the underlying \nsubstitute amendment, Senator Sessions' amendment to impose \ndiscretionary spending caps, Senator Landrieu's amendment on the GO \nZones, Senator Murray's amendment on summer employment for youth, \nSenator Coburn's amendment on transparency, Senator Webb's amendment on \nexecutive bonuses, Senator Stabenow's amendment on AMT credits, a \nFeingold-Coburn amendment to rescind unused transportation earmarks, an \namendment by Senator Brown of Massachusetts on a payroll tax holiday, \nand Senator Burr's amendment on a sales tax holiday.\n  Before Senators offer additional amendments, we need to start \nprocessing the pending amendments. I have been advised there will be \nobjection to setting aside the pending amendments for Senators to offer \nadditional amendments until we have addressed some of the pending \namendments.\n  Some of the amendments appear to me to be the sort of thing we could \nadopt by voice vote, and we are exploring that possibility in \nconnection with at least two of them. On amendments that require a \nrollcall vote, I am hopeful we can schedule a number of votes starting \nat 2 p.m. this afternoon to dispose of several amendments. Then we will \ncontinue to process the pending amendments throughout the day.\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1126-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1126-S1127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORTING FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AGREEMENT IN \n                                 SUDAN\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Res. 404\n\n       Whereas violent civil conflict between North and South in \n     Sudan raged for 21 years,\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\n     resulting in the deaths of an estimated 2,000,000 people and \n     displacement of another 4,000,000 people;\n       Whereas the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \n     (CPA) by the National Congress Party (NCP) and Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement (SPLM) on January 9, 2005, brought a \n     formal end to that civil war;\n       Whereas the United States Government, particularly through \n     the efforts of the President's Special Envoy for Sudan Jack \n     Danforth, worked closely with the parties, the mediator, \n     General Lazaro Sumbeiywo, the members of the \n     Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and the \n     United Kingdom and Norway to bring about the CPA;\n       Whereas the CPA established a 6-year interim period during \n     which the Government of Sudan would undertake significant \n     democratic reforms and hold national elections, and at the \n     end of which the South would hold a referendum on self-\n     determination, with the option to forge an independent state;\n       Whereas, while the parties have made progress on several \n     parts of the CPA, limited national government reforms have \n     been made and several key issues remain outstanding, notably \n     border demarcation, resolution of the census dispute, and \n     certain preparations for the 2011 referenda for southern \n     Sudan and Abyei;\n       Whereas the NCP's delay and refusal to follow through on \n     some of its commitments under the CPA has fueled mistrust and \n     suspicion, increasing tensions between northern and southern \n     Sudan;\n       Whereas research by the Small Arms Survey, published as \n     recently as December 2009, shows that both sides are building \n     up their security forces and covertly stockpiling weapons in \n     anticipation of a possible return to civil war;\n       Whereas the Government of Southern Sudan continues to face \n     a range of challenges and continues to struggle with problems \n     of financial management, insufficient capacity, and a limited \n     ability to provide security in parts of its territory, \n     especially in the face of increasing inter-ethnic and \n     communal violence;\n       Whereas humanitarian organizations and the United Nations \n     report that more than 2,500 people were killed and an \n     additional 350,000 displaced by inter-ethnic and communal \n     violence within southern Sudan throughout 2009;\n       Whereas the Lord's Resistance Army, a brutal rebel group \n     formed in northern Uganda, has reportedly resumed and \n     increased attacks against civilians in southern Sudan, \n     creating another security challenge in the region;\n       Whereas the Government of Southern Sudan and the United \n     Nations Mission (UNMIS) have not taken adequate steps to \n     address the rising insecurity and to protect civilians in \n     southern Sudan;\n       Whereas, despite 5 years of peace, most of southern Sudan \n     remains severely underdeveloped with communities lacking \n     access to essential services such as water, health care, \n     livelihood opportunities, and infrastructure;\n       Whereas Sudan is scheduled to hold national elections in \n     April 2010, and the people of southern Sudan and Abyei are to \n     hold their referendum on self-determination in January 2011 \n     under the terms of the CPA;\n       Whereas the holding of these elections, Sudan's first \n     multiparty elections in 24 years, could be a historic \n     milestone for the country and a step toward genuine \n     democratic transformation if the elections are fair and free \n     and all communities are able to participate;\n       Whereas the existence of laws that grant powers to \n     government security services in Sudan to arrest and detain \n     citizens without charge and recent actions taken by the \n     security forces to restrict freedom of speech and assembly by \n     opposition parties have raised concerns that conditions may \n     not exist for fair and free elections in Sudan;\n       Whereas the conflict in Darfur is still unresolved, the \n     security situation remains volatile, and armed parties \n     continue to commit humanitarian and human rights violations \n     in the region, raising concerns that conditions may not exist \n     for Darfurians to freely and safely participate in the \n     elections;

and\n       (D) to begin negotiations to resolve post-referenda issues, \n     including resource allocation and citizenship rights in the \n     case of separation;\n       (5) calls on the Government of National Unity to amend or \n     repeal laws and avoid any further actions that would unduly \n     restrict the freedom of speech and assembly by opposition \n     parties or the full participation of communities, including \n     those in Darfur, in the upcoming national elections;\n       (6) encourages the international community and the United \n     Nations to engage with local populations to provide \n     assistance for elections in Sudan and popular consultations \n     while also closely monitoring and speaking out against any \n     actions by the Government of Sudan or its security forces to \n     restrict or deny participation in a credible elections \n     process;\n       (7) calls on the Government of Southern Sudan to work with \n     the assistance of the international community to design and \n     begin implementing a long-term plan for security sector \n     reform that includes the transformation of the army and \n     police into modern security organs and the training of all \n     security forces in human rights and civilian protection;\n       (8) urges the United Nations Security Council to direct and \n     assist the UNMIS peacekeepers to better monitor and work to \n     prevent violence in southern Sudan and to prioritize civilian \n     protection in decisions about the use of available capacity \n     and resources;\n       (9) supports increased efforts by the United States \n     Government, other donors, and the United Nations to assist \n     the Government of Southern Sudan to improve its governing \n     capacity, strengthen its financial accountability, build \n     critical infrastructure, and expand service delivery;\n       (10) urges the President to work with the permanent members \n     of the United Nations Security Council, other governments, \n     and regional organizations at the highest levels to develop a \n     coordinated multilateral strategy to promote peaceful change \n     and full implementation of the CPA;

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 414) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 414\n\n       Whereas on January 12, 2010, Haiti suffered an earthquake \n     measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale, the greatest natural \n     disaster in Haiti's history, which--\n       (1) devastated Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas;\n       (2) killed more than 100,000 people;\n       (3) injured hundreds of thousands more people; and\n       (4) left many hundreds of thousands of people homeless;\n       Whereas Haiti, which is the poorest country in the Western \n     Hemisphere--\n       (1) has an estimated 54 percent of its population living on \n     less than $1 per day;\n       (2) has approximately 120,000 people living with HIV;\n       (3) had 29,333 new cases of Tuberculosis in 2007; and\n       (4) has nearly 400,000 children living in orphanages;\n       Whereas despite these challenges, cautious signs of \n     developmental progress and stability were beginning to emerge \n     in Haiti prior to the earthquake;\n       Whereas although initial recovery efforts must continue to \n     assist the people of Haiti struggling to secure basic \n     necessities, including food, water, health care, shelter, and \n     electricity, Haiti cannot afford to only focus on its \n     immediate needs;\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\n       Whereas various United States and international assessments \n     indicate that the next priority for the Government of Haiti \n     should be to repair the country's basic infrastructure, \n     including its schools, roads, hospitals, telecommunications \n     infrastructure, and government buildings;\n       Whereas Haiti's leaders have advocated that--\n       (1) reconstruction should not follow the inefficient \n     practices of the past; and\n       (2) Haitians should be given the opportunity to accelerate \n     and implement long planned reforms and new ways of doing \n     business in every sector;\n       Whereas Haiti enjoys several advantages that can facilitate \n     its rebuilding, including--\n       (1) people committed to education and hard work;\n       (2) duty-free, quota-free access to United States markets;\n       (3) a large pool of low-cost labor;\n       (4) a large, hardworking North American diaspora sending \n     money back to Haiti; and\n       (5) regional neighbors who are peaceful, prosperous, and \n     supportive of Haiti's success;\n       Whereas international experience from rebuilding other \n     countries recovering from natural disaster confirms that--\n       (1) stability and security are essential preconditions to \n     longer-term development; and\n       (2) economic development and political reform should \n     relieve poverty and foster governance and social justice;\n       Whereas employment is essential to breaking the vicious \n     cycle of poverty, corruption, insecurity, and loss of faith \n     in democracy;\n       Whereas the Haitian people, like all people, deserve the \n     income and dignity that gainful employment provides;\n       Whereas, in addition to providing emergency assistance and \n     relief, the Government of Haiti must grapple with the longer-\n     term issue of how to provide permanent, sustainable shelter \n     to an estimated 1,000,000 Haitians displaced by the \n     earthquake;\n       Whereas, the impact of natural disaster on Haiti is--\n       (1) exacerbated by weak building codes and poor \n     infrastructure; and\n       (2) more fundamentally the result of an impoverished state \n     unable to provide most of its people with minimal public \n     services, including security, clean water, shelter, \n     electricity, health care, and education;\n       Whereas assistance to Haiti should be delivered in a manner \n     that enhances, not diminishes, the ability of the state to \n     provide services to its people;\n       Whereas the Haitian state should be rebuilt with \n     communities in a central role in the national recovery \n     process led by the Government of Haiti, so that foreign \n     assistance upholds and empowers Haitian mayors, local \n     councils, and municipalities in areas outside of Port-au-\n     Prince; and\n       Whereas international donors and nongovernmental \n     organizations, which have a responsibility to support the \n     Government of Haiti in its rebuilding efforts, should not \n     supplant the ability of local institutions and the government \n     to manage resources and provide essential services: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the United States Government and the \n     international community to provide resources, manpower, and \n     technical assistance to support the Government of Haiti's \n     leadership of international assistance efforts and to conduct \n     a comprehensive post-disaster needs assessment that will \n     focus on--\n       (A) social sector services, including access to, and \n     delivery of, basic services, including--\n       (i) health care delivery, including reinstating disrupted \n     care and addressing new needs;\n       (ii) all levels of education, including ensuring access to \n     lessons as quickly as possible;\n       (iii) social support for communities;\n       (iv) improving the welfare of children; and\n       (v) recognition of the importance of gender equality and \n     the role of women as economic guardians;\n       (B) population resettlement, including services and \n     sustainable livelihoods to support new communities and \n     settlements;\n       (C) stable and democratic governance, ensuring that the \n     Government of Haiti will appropriately steward state \n     resources through a process embracing transparency, civic \n     participation, political moderation, and institutional \n     accountability;\n       (D) economic sustainability, emphasizing employment \n     generation, macroeconomic stability, and market economy \n     sustainability;\n       (E) security, ensuring legitimate state efforts to prevent \n     and respond to crime, especially violence, and instilling \n     public order and confidence in Haitian security forces; and\n       (F) rule of law, developing a just legal framework that--\n       (i) is accountable;\n       (ii) provides access to justice; and\n       (iii) ensures public order;\n       (2) encourages the United States Government and the \n     international community to support the leadership of the \n     Government of Haiti and key nongovernmental and private \n     sector Haitian stakeholders to create a comprehensive \n     national strategy for recovery and development that will--\n       (A) be led by the Government of Haiti;\n       (B) address the findings from the needs assessment \n     conducted under paragraph (1);\n       (C) coordinate new resources flowing into Haiti;\n       (D) channel such resources in concrete and specific ways \n     towards key sectoral objectives identified by the Government \n     of Haiti and its people;\n       (E) take feasible steps to recognize and rectify the social \n     injustice of poverty, and decrease the vulnerability of the \n     poor, through job creation, the provision of health care, the \n     provision of safe shelter and settlements, food security, and \n     education;\n       (F) place communities at the center of the rebuilding \n     process, by employing local labor and consulting local \n     leaders and communities for their experience and vision;\n       (G) encourage rebuilding and development of programs that \n     are environmentally sustainable and respectful and \n     restorative of Haiti's natural resources;\n       (H) work with the Government of Haiti and the international \n     community to reduce the risk of future disasters, including \n     floods and hurricanes, through the relief and recovery \n     efforts focusing on the most vulnerable communities; and\n       (I) address the difficult issues related to land use, land \n     tenure, the need for land for reconstruction, and land price \n     escalations;\n       (3) applauds the international community's response to the \n     preliminary appeal for assistance made at Montreal, Canada, \n     on January 25, 2010;\n       (4) affirms that--\n       (A) the international donors conference for Haiti, which \n     will be held in New York on March 22-23, 2010, is an \n     opportunity for Haiti to accelerate and implement long-\n     planned projects and priorities in key infrastructural, \n     economic, and social sectors outlined in a comprehensive \n     national strategy;\n       (B) large-scale international assistance provides \n     significant leverage to promote change and reform in Haiti; \n     and\n       (C) the international community should be prepared to fully \n     commit to the outcomes of the New York donors conference, \n     including full disbursement and subsequent implementation;\n       (5) encourages international financial institutions and \n     international organizations, including the United Nations and \n     the World Bank, to continue their engagement and leadership \n     in support of critical economic and security priorities, \n     including--\n       (A) economic and social assistance programs;\n       (B) strengthening Haitian national institutions;\n       (C) security sector reform;\n       (D) ensuring fair and legitimate elections; and\n       (E) supporting political and governance reform;\n       (6) encourages the International Monetary Fund, the World \n     Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank, which hold the \n     majority of Haiti's existing external debt obligations, to--\n       (A) work together to relieve Haiti of its external debt \n     obligations to the multilateral community and bilateral \n     lenders; and\n       (B) seek considerable new resources for Haiti without \n     adding to Haiti's existing debt obligations, primarily \n     through provision of grants; and\n       (7) urges the United States Government to ensure unity of \n     effort by assigning a single person to--\n       (A) coordinate all aspects of United States assistance to \n     Haiti; and\n       (B) work with Congress to responsibly ensure sufficient \n     appropriations to facilitate the long-term and sustainable \n     recovery, rehabilitation, and development of Haiti.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1128-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1128-S1129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT PROGRESS MADE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF \n                   DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Res. 426\n\n       Whereas the importance of school social work through the \n     inclusion of school social work programs has been recognized \n     in the current authorizations of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) and the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 \n     et seq.);\n       Whereas school social workers serve as vital members of a \n     school educational team, playing a central role in creating a \n     positive school climate and vital partnerships between the \n     home, school, and community to ensure student academic \n     success;\n       Whereas school social workers are especially skilled in \n     providing services to students who face serious challenges to \n     school success, including poverty, disability, \n     discrimination, abuse, addiction, bullying, divorce of \n     parents, loss of a loved one, and other barriers to learning;\n       Whereas there is a growing need for local educational \n     agencies to offer the mental health services that school \n     social workers provide when working with families, teachers, \n     principals, community agencies, and other entities to address \n     emotional, physical, and environmental needs of students so \n     that students may achieve behavioral and academic success;\n       Whereas, to achieve the goal of the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) of helping all children \n     reach their optimal levels of potential and achievement, \n     including children with serious emotional disturbances, \n     schools must work to remove the emotional, behavioral, and \n     academic barriers that interfere with student success in \n     school;\n       Whereas fewer than 1 in 5 of the 17,500,000 children in \n     need of mental health services actually receive these \n     services, and research indicates that school mental health \n     programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences, \n     decreasing discipline referrals, and improving academic \n     achievement;\n       Whereas school mental health programs are critical to early \n     identification of mental health problems and in the provision \n     of appropriate services when needed;\n       Whereas the national average ratio of students to school \n     social workers recommended by the School Social Work \n     Association of America is 400 to 1; and\n       Whereas the celebration of ``School Social Work Week'' \n     highlights the vital role school social workers play in the \n     lives of students in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of February 28 through March 7, \n     2010, as ``School Social Work Week'';\n       (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of school \n     social workers to the success of students in schools across \n     the Nation; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     ``School Social Work Week'' with the appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities that promote awareness of the vital role of \n     school social workers, in schools and in the community as a \n     whole, in helping students prepare for their futures as \n     productive citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1129-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1129-S1131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CHILDREN'S DENTAL HEALTH MONTH\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AWARENESS WEEK\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SUPPORTING THOSE AFFECTED BY THE NATURAL DISASTERS ON MADEIRA ISLAND\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     IRAQI PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        READ ACROSS AMERICA DAY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I come from a background of having earlier been in the State senate \nand then, after that, the U.S. House of Representatives. Sometimes when \nI was a State legislator and it looked as though we were making a hash \nof legislation on the senate side, someone would say: Well, let's pass \nthe bill anyway, and we will clean it up in conference. It was always \ntempting to send it to conference and hope that cooler heads would \nprevail and we would get a better work product. Sometimes that happened \nand worked out well, and sometimes it turned out that we didn't clean \nit up in conference.\n  I am reminded of that when I hear about what is being discussed and \nwhat now seems to be the clear plan for this Democratic majority and \nPresident Obama in moving forward with health care legislation. The \nHouse has passed a flawed bill with $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to \nMedicare, with huge mandates to the States, with tax increases--the \nlargest increase, really, in entitlement big government, in my memory--\nand the Senate has passed its flawed version not only with those flaws \nI just mentioned in the House version but also special deals: a special \ndeal for Nebraska, a special deal for Florida and Louisiana, and on and \non and on. That is where we are now.\n  The plan now seems to be that this mistaken bill--the flawed bill the \nSenate passed on Christmas Eve--is now at the desk at the House of \nRepresentatives, and leadership over there is tempted to take that \nflawed product, pass it without any changes whatsoever, and send it to \nthe President for his signature. The plan there is not the old \nlegislative trick of we will clean it up in conference; the plan is we \nwill clean it up in reconciliation.\n  As I mentioned, sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't. The \nproblem with cleaning it up in reconciliation is that if this \nDemocratic scheme goes forward and we do that, we will not only have a \nbill in conference to be worked out where if a mistake is made we can \nvote against it in the end, we will have a statute.\n  The plan is for the President to sign this flawed Senate product with \nall the taxes, with all the mandates, with all the special deals and \npurchases, sign it into law, and then hope the Senate can correct all \nof those mistakes in reconciliation. If that scheme fails, we will be \nstuck with a very bad product, and it will be the law of the land and \nup to some future Congress to deal with. Certainly, it will be the key, \ntop, paramount election issue for the next several months.\n  If the plan works, if the Democratic scheme works, we will still have \nthis. Maybe the ``Louisiana purchase'' will be taken out, the \n``Cornhusker kickback,'' the ``Gator Aid''--all of the special deals, \nand then we will have the President's additional taxes and additional \nFederal regulation that he has recently proposed. So when it is all \nsaid and done, even at their best, most optimistic predictions, we will \nhave massive funding mandates to the States. We will have a $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion cut to Medicare. We will have huge tax increases and a large \nnew entitlement program.\n  The people don't want this. I heard a Democratic Member of the House \nof Representatives very articulately stating this on television just \nthis morning. He said people must be out of their minds. This is wrong, \naccording to this Member of the House of Representatives, a Democrat \nwho says he has voted against it before, and he is not going to be one \nof those who is willing to change his mind.\n  So I don't want to spend the rest of this year with this flawed \nlegislation as the only campaign issue. It may be our only choice. But \nI can assure everyone within the sound of my voice of this: If this \nscheme goes through, if the flawed Senate version is signed into law \nand we have this reconciliation debate, this will be the No. 1 issue, \nif not the only issue, and there will be devastation for my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle if they persist in thumbing their noses at \nthe American people and defying the clear will of the American people \non this issue.\n  I am glad to be joined by my friend, Senator Barrasso, a legislator \nin his own right with considerable experience, and a physician. So I am \nhappy to hear the comments of my colleague from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank the Senator very much.\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\n  I agree exactly with what the Senator has said because my experience \nhas been very similar. I served 5 years in the State senate in Wyoming, \nand before that I was a physician practicing in Wyoming, taking care of \nso many families.\n  Just this Monday I was at the Wyoming Medical Center, the largest \nhospital in our State. It is a hospital where I have previously been \nchief of staff. What I hear from the people of Wyoming is, I am sure, \nwhat the Senator has heard from the people at home in Mississippi.\n  They say: Why don't you just stop and start over? It is not just the \npeople from our States. In a recent CNN poll, 50 percent of all \nAmericans say it is time to stop and start over. We do need health care \nreform, but we don't need this 2,700-page bill with all of the \nunintended consequences that may come with it, all of the new \ngovernment boards and commissions, a program that cuts $500 billion \nfrom our seniors who depend upon Medicare for their health care, and \nraises taxes by another $500 billion.\n  The American people are saying stop and start over. They know we have \ngood ideas. They listened to that summit last week that I was able to \nattend at the White House, and they have heard Republicans say to let \npeople buy insurance across State lines. That will help 12 million more \npeople get insurance today. They say let's deal with lawsuit abuse. \nThat will help cut down the cost of these unnecessary tests which are \ndone as defensive medicine.\n  The American people understand the value of allowing small businesses \nto join to help more effectively get down the cost of care. That is why \nhalf of all Americans say stop and start over. One in four say just \nstop. Only one in four Americans say, yes; pass the bill. So three and \nfour do not want what the President seems to be wanting to shove \nthrough Congress and shove down the throats of the American people. The \nAmerican people are incensed. That is what I heard in Wyoming this \nweekend, and I am sure that is what my colleague from Mississippi heard \nas well.\n  So the President made his speech yesterday, which seemed to be a new \nsales pitch, but it is for the same bill. It is why so many folks have \nsaid stop, start over, focus on ideas that we know will work. Give \nindividuals as patients, as citizens, rights to make more choices that \naffect their own lives. Give them those opportunities. We don't need a \ngovernment bureaucrat standing between the doctor and a patient. We \ndon't need a government bureaucrat. We don't need an insurance \nbureaucrat.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Coburn, is on the Senate floor, another \nphysician who has, as have I, fought against government bureaucrats and \ninsurance company bureaucrats all for our patients because we need a \npatient-centered health care program, and we need health care reform, \nbut we do not need this massive bill.\n  I also see my colleague from Florida has joined us. He knows we have \npositive ideas that will make a difference because we need to be \nfocused also on the cost of care. People like the quality of care they \nare getting. They like the fact it is available. But the cost is what \nis affecting us. That is why Warren Buffett just on Monday has said we \nneed to focus on cost. They need to take 2,000 pages of nonsense out of \nthe bill and focus on getting the costs under control. And so many of \nthe ideas that the Republicans have brought forth have focused \nspecifically on that.\n\n  So I would ask my colleague from Florida, are there things he has \nheard as he has visited with his constituents and the people in his \nState that he might wish to add to this discussion right now?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I appreciate my colleague, Dr. Barrasso, for referring \nthat question to me.\n  Certainly, the people of Florida are concerned about this bill. They \nwant their costs to go down. They thought the whole reason we were \ndoing this health care bill was to address the skyrocketing costs of \nhealth care, which have gone up 130 percent on average over the past 10 \nyears. But what we find out with this bill is not only does it not \nlower the cost of health insurance for Americans, some Americans are \ngoing to have to pay more.\n  So why would we undertake this huge enterprise of creating a $1 \ntrillion new program, multitrillion dollars over time, a program that \ncuts $\\1/2\\ trillion out of health care for seniors, and raises taxes \nby $\\1/2\\ trillion, why would we undertake all of that if we weren't \ngoing to reduce the cost of health insurance for most Americans? That \nis what they think we are doing. They don't think we are creating some \nbrand new entitlement program. They don't want us to do that. They want \nus to lower the costs.\n  So Republicans have put forward proposals, and some of them my \ncolleague just mentioned: allowing insurance companies to sell across \nState lines, trying to get rid of junk lawsuits.\n  My wife Meike is pregnant with our fourth child. She goes and sees \nher doctor in Tallahassee, FL--not a big town. He is paying $120,000 a \nyear in medical malpractice insurance. That affects not only the cost \nof care, but it also creates defensive medicine which runs up costs. We \nhave some real, concrete, step-by-step solutions on our side of the \naisle that will make things better and reduce the cost of health care.\n  One thing I have had the privilege of working on with Dr. Coburn is \ngoing after waste, fraud, and abuse. In the Medicare system, we know \nthere is $60 billion a year--$60 billion--in waste, fraud, and abuse. \nMy State of Florida, unfortunately, is the capital of this health care \nfraud. I will give my colleagues one statistic that I think says it \nall.\n  In Miami Dade County, we have 7 percent of the country's AIDS \npopulation. Yet reimbursements for health care for AIDS patients in \nMiami Dade County constitutes 83 percent of what is spent in the entire \ncountry. Now, why is that? It is because folks are committing fraud on \nthe system. Health care providers in warehouses and strip shopping \ncenters, or nonexistent offices at all--they are not providers; they \nare just scam artists running the codes, running these medical codes \nand submitting them to Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Why shouldn't the first thing we do be to fix the system we have, \nstop this bleeding of billions of dollars and put it back into Medicare \nand Medicaid which are programs that are going broke? The President is \nright. There is a health care emergency in this country, and the No. 1 \nemergency is Medicare and Medicaid, not creating a new program.\n  We should make sure that Medicare for seniors is viable. We should \nstop the waste, fraud, and abuse, and get the money back in Medicare. \nThen we should do the same thing for Medicaid. Once we have those \nprograms more solvent and we meet the commitments we have already made, \nthen we could take the step-by-step approach on trying to provide lower \ncost health insurance for people who have it and more access for people \nwho do not.\n  We have offered solutions, but as we understand it, what is going to \nhappen is they are going to take the Senate bill that was passed on a \nparty-line vote in December on Christmas Eve, send it over to the \nHouse, and then try to convince the House Democrats they are going to \nhave a makeup bill that is going to fix their problems and try to send \nthat over here and make us vote on that on a simple majority, which is \nnot what was intended by the rules.\n  I am new to the Senate, so I want to defer to my colleagues and \nperhaps the Senator from Oklahoma can speak to this point and whether \nthat is appropriate to do, and also speak to the good step-by-step \nmeasures we have to combat the problems with health care.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Florida. I, \nalong with Senator Barrasso, attended the summit with the President. If \nI recall his words, we were going to take 4 to 6 weeks to see if we \ncouldn't work out some compromises to get a bill the American people \nwould accept but we also would accept.\n  Today marks a week since we had that summit. We had an announcement \nyesterday that it is time to quit talking, it is time to quit \nnegotiating, and they are going to ram a bill through.\n  I think there is a big contrast. I appreciate what my colleagues have \nsaid. The problem in health care in America is not quality, it is cost. \nWhatever we do is going to expand the amount of dollars we spend on \nhealth care if we add people to it. But if we attack the cost, what we \ncan do is add more people with no increase in cost.\n  The thing that denies somebody access to health care is not not \nhaving an\n\n[[Page S1133]]\n\ninsurance policy, it is having a cost of the system that is \nunaffordable, whether you have insurance or not.\n  Malcolm Sparrow from Harvard said he believes 20 percent of all the \nbillings in Medicare are fraudulent. That is over $100 billion a year. \nThat is $100 billion just in Medicare. We have good indications there \nis $15 billion in fraud in New York City alone in Medicaid, in one \ncity. Why would we not go after the fraud, which is the second largest \ncomponent of wasted dollars in health care? Some of it the President \nhas accepted. But the No. 1 cost that does not benefit anybody in this \ncountry is defensive medicine, and defensive medicine costs up to $250 \nbillion a year.\n  Let me tell my colleagues why it is so bad and it is terrible for us \nto ignore that issue. It is not just that we spend money doing tests on \npatients. When we do tests on patients, we put them at risk. Let me \ngive an example.\n  If you go to any emergency room in this country this summer on a \nweekend, you will see a kid in there who has gotten hit with a \nbaseball. What the standard is now because of the legal system in this \ncountry is that child is going to be exposed to radiation from a CT \nscan, not because they need it but because the ER doctor needs it.\n  The standard of care should be, if you have reliable adults around \nthe child and the child has no neurologic damage and neurologic signs, \nwatching to see, an expectation in case some signs show up and then you \nreturn. But the legal system in this country has entrapped us where we \ndo hundreds of thousands of CT scans on children that none of them need \nbecause they get hit with a baseball. The ones who have true neurologic \nchanges do need it. The vast majority do not. There are billions of \ndollars in one summertime event that gets chewed up that is not there \nto take care of somebody at a level which they can afford because we \nhave added that on to the cost, not because a patient needs it, because \nthe system demands it because doctors have to protect themselves \nagainst untoward extortion lawsuits. To ignore that as a part of this \nbill says you are not going to go where the money is to cut the costs.\n  I will summarize very shortly. It is said that Republicans do not \nhave any plans. We have not said that, the President has. Then when he \nacknowledges a plan, he acknowledges only one that covers 3 million. We \nhave a plan. I have a plan. Senator Burr has a plan. Senator Gregg has \na plan. Senator DeMint has a plan. Senator Enzi has a plan. They all \ncover 20 million to 25 million more Americans. They do it by not \nraising taxes, not stealing money from Medicare, which has a $37 \ntrillion unfunded liability over the near term. We do all that without \nincreasing the cost. We get a true expansion of coverage without an \nincrease in cost.\n  What we think would be the right thing to do is to center health care \non patients, not the government. This plan has 898 new government \nprograms. It has 1,695 times where the Secretary of HHS will write new \nregulations for health care. What do you think the consequence of \ncomplying with those regulations is going to be in terms of cost? We \nare adding more cost into the system that does not go to help anybody \nget well but become compliance costs.\n  We believe in patient centered, not government centered. We believe \nin expanding options available to patients--patients--not expanding \ngovernment. We believe in increasing access, not increasing taxes on \npeople. We believe in reducing costs, not quality.\n  The bill we are going to have before us, no matter what the \nshenanigans are to pass it, does not attack the underlying problem, and \nthat is cost. Until we look at cost, we will never get out of the \nproblems with Medicare, and we will never truly improve access for \nAmericans.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I think Senator LeMieux and I agree on \nthis point. We owe a debt of gratitude to our colleagues, our two \nphysicians, for making it clear on national television over the course \nof 7\\1/2\\ hours last week that Republicans have positive ideas, ideas \nthat will work and, frankly, ideas the American people believe in.\n  I am astonished that after we had such a clear demonstration of ideas \nnot only that are popular, but ideas that need to be given a chance to \nwork, the whole thrust of that 7\\1/2\\-hour discussion has been cast \naside, and we are back at this proposal of passing the flawed bill with \nall of the mistakes that people on the other side of the aisle agree we \nhave made and signing it into law before we do anything else.\n  I have some comments I want to make about what Senator Coburn called \n``shenanigans,'' the reconciliation process.\n  Let me say this: ``Never intended for this purpose.'' ``An outrage.'' \n``A nonstarter.'' ``I will not accept it.'' ``Ill advised.'' ``A real \nmistake.'' ``Not appropriate.'' ``Undesirable.'' Those are all comments \nof Democratic Members of the Senate about the concept of cramming this \nbill through and this procedure I have described and coming back with \nreconciliation. It is not simply a Republican objection. It is an \nobjection where we have our Democratic colleagues on record.\n  I hope they will recall their words. I hope there is not some \npressure that is going to be issued against my colleagues in the House \nand in the Senate to do something they do not believe in simply because \nsomeone in the White House wants it and is exerting pressure.\n  The comments I have read were all made by Democrats. I happen to \nagree with them. We have never under reconciliation attempted something \nof this magnitude and this substance. It would forever change the \nlegislative process in the House and Senate of the United States if we \nbegin with health care.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. If I may, one of the phrases the Senator used about \nusing reconciliation was ``hijacking,'' hijacking the system, hijacking \nthe way this works. That specific word was used by then-Senator Barack \nObama when he was a Senator and very much opposed to this approach.\n  One of the other things he has said, when we talk about the $500 \nbillion being cut from our seniors on Medicare, he talks about a \nprogram called Medicare Advantage. That is only a part of the area that \nis involved. For people on Medicare Advantage--and there are about 10 \nmillion of them--they know they are on it, and they like the program. \nThere are some advantages. One is it actually works to help coordinate \ncare. It works with preventive care. Those are things that are very \nimportant. But there are also cuts in Medicare for nursing homes, for \npayments to doctors, for home health care, which is a lifeline for \npeople, for hospice care, for care at the end of someone's life. That \nis all going to get cut under these $500 billion of Medicare cuts.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Absolutely.\n  Mr. COBURN. The one problem with the $500 billion worth of cuts, if \nyou read what the CBO said about that, they said it is highly unlikely \nCongress will ever effectuate those cuts. If that is true, then that \nmeans there is $500 billion in costs that are not accounted for. So, \none, either you are going to undermine the trust fund and actually \nlessen the available funds for seniors today or you are not, and you \nare using a ruse and saying we are going to charge this to our children \nand grandchildren.\n  Having been in this body for 5 years, this body will not make those \ncuts. It will not do it.\n  I want to make one other point. It is this: We recognize there are \ndifficulties in health care. We recognize that the No. 1 difficulty \nthat is keeping somebody from getting care is the cost of care. This \nbill does nothing for that. I would go back and worry that when the \nPresident said we will look at this for 4 to 6 weeks and now we are \nless than a week later and he is ramming this through, what is it the \nAmerican people want us to do? Do they want us to create another \nentitlement system when every entitlement system we have today is \nbankrupt and in creating that steal from the bankrupt entitlement \nsystems we have today or do they want a commonsense approach that will \ngo after the cost, that will lessen the cost of care for everybody in \nAmerica because we will never solve the problem with Medicare and its \nunfunded liabilities and address the costs.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona is here, and I am glad he has shown \nup.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, now that my two favorite doctors are on\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\nthe floor, I wish to refer them to and ask a question of both of them \nabout a statement that the President just gave. He said:\n\n       I believe it's time to give the American people more \n     control over their own health insurance. I don't believe we \n     can afford to leave life-and-death decisions about health \n     care to the discretion of insurance company executives alone. \n     I believe that doctors and nurses like the ones in this room \n     should be free to decide what's best for their patients.\n\n  By the way, I hope from now on our doctors will wear white coats on \nthe floor. It would be impressive to me. But that is neither here nor \nthere.\n  Isn't it true that on page 982 there is created a new board of \nFederal bureaucrats--the Independent Payment Advisory Board, it is \ncalled--required to make binding recommendations to reduce the costs of \nthe Medicare Program? How does that work if the President is saying \ngive the American people more control and there is an independent \npayment advisory board that is making binding recommendations, I ask my \ntwo doctor friends.\n  Mr. COBURN. There are three very worrisome provisions in this bill. \nOne is the Medicare Advisory Board that the Senator from Arizona just \ntalked about that will decide what gets paid for and what does not, and \nCongress will either have to agree to it or agree to some other cuts.\n  The second is the Cost Comparative Effectiveness Panel which says: We \ndo not care what is best for you, this is the cheapest; therefore, this \nis what you are going to get, which ignores the doctor-patient \nrelationship in terms of what is best for you as an individual patient.\n  Finally, the Task Force on Preventive Services, which we saw during \nthe debate in December, had recommended women under 50 not get \nmammograms because it was not ``cost-effective.'' When you look behind \nthat data, it is 1 to 1,480 versus 1 to 1,460, versus 60 years and \nabove, versus 40 to 50.\n  What happens is, you now have three government agencies that are \ngoing to step between the doctor and the patient when it comes to \nMedicare and Medicaid in this country, and actually it will fall over \nand they will mandate it on your own private coverage. That is very \ninconsistent in terms of saying you want doctors to be in control of \nhealth care but you have a bill that has three organizations in it that \nare designed to allow bureaucrats to make the decision on what your \ncare is going to be.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask Dr. Barrasso, if these provisions \nwere operative at this time, how would that have affected his practice?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, it would have affected me in several ways. It \nwould have affected my life in that my wife Bobbi is a breast cancer \nsurvivor. She had a screening mammogram when she was in her forties--\nsomething this Task Force on Preventive Services says was unnecessary. \nIf it hadn't been for that screening mammogram, her cancer would not \nhave been detected. And by having the screening mammogram, which the \nAmerican Cancer Society and others recommend for women in this country, \nand following the guidelines of the cancer society as opposed to this \nnew government-mandated guideline, her cancer was detected. She has had \nthree operations, several bouts of chemotherapy, and is alive today, a \nbreast cancer survivor, 6 years later, because she did what scientists \nand what those who know what is best for patients recommended as \nopposed to what a government panel might have recommended trying to \nfocus on their cost-effectiveness.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So a patient comes to you with a certain orthopedic \nrequirement that requires a certain level of treatment, and what does \nthat do to you as a physician, as well as the patient?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It puts the government between you and your patient, \nwhich is what you never want to have happen. As Dr. Coburn said, that \nis the wrong approach. It is not the way medicine has ever been \npracticed in America. It is not the way patients want it; it is not the \nway doctors want it. We don't want bureaucrats, whether government or \ninsurance company bureaucrats, between doctors and patients.\n  As we saw at the health care summit on Thursday of last week, the \nPresident kept talking about covering people, health coverage, but he \nwants to put 15 million more people on Medicaid--a program where half \nthe doctors don't see them because the government pays so little; a \nprogram where the Mayo Clinic, which the President has held up as a \nmodel for health care in America, says: We can't continue to see \nMedicaid patients from a number of States because we lose too much \nmoney. And now they have said the same with regard to Medicare. So when \nthey are talking about $500 billion of cuts to Medicare, the Mayo \nClinic, on January 1, said they can't handle additional Medicare \npatients because last year they lost, they said, $800 million by taking \ncare of Medicare patients because the government pays so little.\n  Mr. McCAIN. On the issue of coming between the doctor and the \npatient, this legislation, the 2,733 pages, has 159 new boards, \nbureaucracies, and programs created--159.\n  When the President says you will be able to choose your health care, \nhow in the world does that in any way comport with the fact that it \nrequires every American to buy health insurance whether they want to or \nnot, which, to me, raises a fundamental question, a constitutional \nquestion. Where in the Constitution does it say that we require every \nAmerican to have a health insurance policy?\n  Finally, I would say there were a lot of impressive statements made \nduring the Blair House meeting. I thought, frankly, Dr. Barrasso gave \none of the most impressive ones I have heard. The perspective from \npracticing physicians is something that has all too often been absent \nfrom this debate.\n  I know my colleague paid attention when Congressman Paul Ryan gave \nhis statement as far as the budgetary implications and the costs to \nAmericans. It has been reprinted in the Wall Street Journal this \nmorning. In 5 or 6 minutes, I think he encapsulated what this \nlegislation does in laying out, in his view, a true 10-year cost of \n$2.3 trillion. He points out the gimmickry, and one of them, of \ncourse--the elephant in the room--is that you have 10 years of tax \nincreases for $\\1/2\\ trillion and 10 years of cuts and $\\1/2\\ trillion \nto pay for 6 years of spending. Now, where in the world would you have \na program that you pay for 10 years in taxes and cuts in benefits and \nhave 6 years of benefits? So the true cost, the true cost over 10 years \nwithout the budget gimmickry is $2.3 trillion, and things such as $72 \nbillion in claims and money from the CLASS Act--the list goes on and \non.\n  So what I would ask Dr. Barrasso--we all trust the Congressional \nBudget Office. There is no doubt we all trust these people and their \nestimates, but their estimates are only as good as the proposals that \nare given to them. And I might add--again, I would request Dr. \nBarrasso's comments on this--that the President's proposal that was \nonline was really an 11-page statement, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice said they could not give a cost estimate because they didn't \nhave sufficient information. So it is very clear, when you delay \nrevenues until the year 2016, that obviously has budgetary impacts.\n  Finally, I would ask Dr. Barrasso to talk about this so-called doc \nfix which has been counted in the budget as reducing cost, and \neverybody knows we are not going to cut physician payments for \ntreatment of Medicare patients. I think that would be an important one \nfor Dr. Barrasso to discuss because I think it really encapsulates the \nkind of budget gimmickry that has gone on in the formation of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to continue \nfor an additional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, if I could, several things. There is a \nwonderful Paul Ryan op-ed in today's Wall Street Journal, and I would \nrecommend it to anyone to look at that because he specifically points \nout that the President's own chief Medicare actuary says the Senate and \nHouse bills are bending the cost curve up, making the costs go up, \nwhich is what you hear if you go to a town meeting in Arizona or in \nWyoming. When you ask people: If this bill passes, will the cost of \nyour own care go up, the hands go up. When you say: Well, how about the \nquality; will the quality of your care go down? Again, the hands go up. \nSo that is a\n\n[[Page S1135]]\n\ncontinual concern of people all across America, which is why three-\nquarters of Americans have told CNN it is time to either just \ncompletely stop or stop and start over and only one-quarter of \nAmericans support this proposal, because they realize this is going to \ndo that.\n  The Senator from Arizona mentioned, and it was interesting, the 11 \npages from the President. The gimmicks are still there. They may have \ntaken out one of the gimmicks, but the spending gimmicks are there, \nplus the Louisiana purchase, the special carve-out for 800,000 people \nin Florida who are on Medicare Advantage. They are protected, but there \nare another 10 million Americans who will lose their Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Then the question came up of what we refer to as the ``doc fix.'' The \nway the numbers are moved around----\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the benefit of our colleagues, could the Senator \nexplain exactly what the doc fix means and how we got to it?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Right now--and we just passed a 1-month extension the \nother night--Medicare is supposed to cut the fees for all doctors \nacross the country by 21 percent. Seniors know Medicare underpays right \nnow. As one of my colleagues in the State senate in Wyoming used to \nsay, government is the biggest deadbeat payer because they do not even \npay enough to cover the cost of the care that is delivered in our \nhospitals. With ambulances, they do not cover enough to pay for the gas \nto fill up the ambulances to go the long distances we have in Arizona \nor in Wyoming.\n  But right now, to deal with some promises that were made years ago, \nthe fees for physicians should be cut 21 percent, according to \nMedicare. A number of years ago, they were supposed to cut it by 1 or 2 \npercent, and they said: Well, we will not cut it, but next year we will \ncut it by 4 percent and then next year 8 percent and then 10 percent. \nWell, now they have continued to kick the can down the road enough so \nthat this year they are supposed to cut the fees for physicians by 21 \npercent.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Which could not happen.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It could not. According to the President's budget \nnumbers and the way this bill is written and the financial gimmickry, \nthey want to cut physician fees for Medicare by 21 percent and keep \nthem frozen for the next 10 years. So it is cut and freeze for 10 \nyears, and they use that as one of the additional financial gimmicks.\n  Well, if you do that to the doctors in the country, who are already \nreluctant to see Medicare patients because the payment is so low--the \nMayo Clinic said they are not going to see new Medicare patients \nbecause the reimbursement at today's rates is so low--if you drop them \n21 percent additionally at a time when the Congressional Budget Office \nsays one-fifth of the hospitals and one-fifth of the doctors' offices \nin this country will be unable to continue to be solvent 10 years from \nnow if this bill goes into place--we know without a question that we \ncannot allow that to happen. Congress knows that, the doctors know \nthat, the American people know it. Everybody knows it except, \napparently, the people writing the health care bill, who say: Oh, this \nis actually going to save money in the long run. When people look at \nthis in an honest way, they know this is going to drive up the cost of \ncare and make the quality of care for our American citizens go down.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the Wall Street Journal piece authored by Congressman \nPaul Ryan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                 Dissecting the Real Cost of ObamaCare\n\n                           (By Paul D. Ryan)\n\n       (The following are remarks made by Congressman Paul Ryan of \n     Wisconsin, the ranking Republican on the House Budget \n     Committee, about the cost of the House and Senate health-care \n     bills at President Obama's Blair House summit on health care, \n     Feb. 25:)\n       Look, we agree on the problem here. And the problem is \n     health inflation is driving us off of a fiscal cliff.\n       Mr. President, you said health-care reform is budget \n     reform. You're right. We agree with that. Medicare, right \n     now, has a $38 trillion unfunded liability. That's $38 \n     trillion in empty promises to my parents' generation, our \n     generation, our kids' generation. Medicaid's growing at 21 \n     percent each year. It's suffocating states' budgets. It's \n     adding trillions in obligations that we have no means to pay \n     for .  .  .\n       Now, you're right to frame the debate on cost and health \n     inflation. And in September, when you spoke to us in the well \n     of the House, you basically said--and I totally agree with \n     this--I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our \n     deficits either now or in the future.\n       Since the Congressional Budget Office can't score your \n     bill, because it doesn't have sufficient detail, but it \n     tracks very similar to the Senate bill, I want to unpack the \n     Senate score a little bit.\n       And if you take a look at the CBO analysis--analysis from \n     your chief actuary--I think it's very revealing. This bill \n     does not control costs. This bill does not reduce deficits. \n     Instead, this bill adds a new health-care entitlement at a \n     time when we have no idea how to pay for the entitlements we \n     already have.\n       Now let me go through why I say that. The majority leader \n     said the bill scores as reducing the deficit $131 billion \n     over the next 10 years. First, a little bit about CBO. I work \n     with them every single day--very good people, great \n     professionals. They do their jobs well. But their job is to \n     score what is placed in front of them. And what has been \n     placed in front of them is a bill that is full of gimmicks \n     and smoke-and-mirrors.\n       Now, what do I mean when I say that? Well, first off, the \n     bill has 10 years of tax increases, about half a trillion \n     dollars, with 10 years of Medicare cuts, about half a \n     trillion dollars, to pay for 6 years of spending.\n       Now, what's the true 10-year cost of this bill in 10 years? \n     That's $2.3 trillion.\n       [The Senate bill] does [a] couple of other things. It takes \n     $52 billion in higher Social Security tax revenues and counts \n     them as offsets. But that's really reserved for Social \n     Security. So either we're double-counting them or we don't \n     intend on paying those Social Security benefits.\n       It takes $72 billion and claims money from the CLASS Act. \n     That's the long-term care insurance program. It takes the \n     money from premiums that are designed for that benefit and \n     instead counts them as offsets.\n       The Senate Budget Committee chairman [Kent Conrad] said \n     that this is a Ponzi scheme that would make Bernie Madoff \n     proud.\n       Now, when you take a look at the Medicare cuts, what this \n     bill essentially does [is treat] Medicare like a piggy bank. \n     It raids a half a trillion dollars out of Medicare, not to \n     shore up Medicare solvency, but to spend on this new \n     government program.\n       .  .  . [A]ccording to the chief actuary of Medicare .  .  \n     . as much as 20 percent of Medicare's providers will either \n     go out of business or will have to stop seeing Medicare \n     beneficiaries. Millions of seniors .  .  . who have chosen \n     Medicare Advantage will lose the coverage that they now \n     enjoy.\n       You can't say that you're using this money to either extend \n     Medicare solvency and also offset the cost of this new \n     program. That's double-counting.\n       And so when you take a look at all of this; when you strip \n     out the double-counting and what I would call these gimmicks, \n     the full 10-year cost of the bill has a $460 billion deficit. \n     The second 10-year cost of this bill has a $1.4 trillion \n     deficit.\n        .  .  . [P]robably the most cynical gimmick in this bill \n     is something that we all probably agree on. We don't think we \n     should cut doctors [annual federal reimbursements] 21 percent \n     next year. We've stopped those cuts from occurring every year \n     for the last seven years.\n       We all call this, here in Washington, the doc fix. Well, \n     the doc fix, according to your numbers, costs $371 billion. \n     It was in the first iteration of all of these bills, but \n     because it was a big price tag and it made the score look \n     bad, made it look like a deficit .  .  . that provision was \n     taken out, and it's been going on in stand-alone legislation. \n     But ignoring these costs does not remove them from the backs \n     of taxpayers. Hiding spending does not reduce spending. And \n     so when you take a look at all of this, it just doesn't add \n     up.\n       .  .  . I'll finish with the cost curve. Are we bending the \n     cost curve down or are we bending the cost curve up?\n       Well, if you look at your own chief actuary at Medicare, \n     we're bending it up. He's claiming that we're going up $222 \n     billion, adding more to the unsustainable fiscal situation we \n     have.\n       And so, when you take a look at this, it's really deeper \n     than the deficits or the budget gimmicks or the actuarial \n     analysis. There really is a difference between us.\n       .  .  . [W]e've been talking about how much we agree on \n     different issues, but there really is a difference between \n     us. And it's basically this. We don't think the government \n     should be in control of all of this. We want people to be in \n     control. And that, at the end of the day, is the big \n     difference.\n       Now, we've offered lots of ideas all last year, all this \n     year. Because we agree the status quo is unsustainable. It's \n     got to get fixed.\n       It's bankrupting families. It's bankrupting our government. \n     It's hurting families with pre-existing conditions. We all \n     want to fix this.\n       But we don't think that this is the .  .  . the solution. \n     And all of the analysis we get proves that point.\n       Now, I'll just simply say this. .  .  . [W]e are all \n     representatives of the American people. We all do town hall \n     meetings. We all\n\n[[Page S1136]]\n\n     talk to our constituents. And I've got to tell you, the \n     American people are engaged. And if you think they want a \n     government takeover of health care, I would respectfully \n     submit you're not listening to them.\n       So what we simply want to do is start over, work on a \n     clean-sheeted paper, move through these issues, step by step, \n     and fix them, and bring down health-care costs and not raise \n     them. And that's basically the point.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, Madam President, I find it incredibly cynical to \ntell the American people that the cost of this reform is going to be I \nbelieve $371 billion less than we all know it actually will be.\n  I ask Senator Barrasso, if those cuts were ever enacted, what is the \nprospect of any of the overwhelming majority of doctors just saying: I \nam not going to treat Medicare patients.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. We are going to see that. We will see that across the \nboard. I was at our hospital in Wyoming on Monday talking to physicians \nwho take care of everyone, and they have great concerns because they \nsay at that rate they can't afford to keep the doors open, if the \nMedicare cuts go through, the cuts the President says will have to go \nthrough if, in fact, he wants to hold up the numbers he continues to \ntalk about.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, I hope we will continue to be on the floor. Again, \nwe need to talk about what the President said during his campaign about \nmany things but including what I saw this morning on FOX News where he \nsaid you shouldn't govern with 50-plus-1 votes, that he was in \nopposition to that. I am sorry he does not remain in opposition to \nthat.\n  I thank Dr. Barrasso and the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we are now on a bill to extend tax cuts, \nto extend certain payments for unemployment insurance, COBRA subsidies, \nand so forth. This is a jobs bill. This is a safety net extenders bill. \nThis is not a health care bill.\n  Four Senators just spoke--I think there were four; six of them \naltogether--basically being very critical of the health care reform \nbill we passed in the Senate, very critical of the President's effort \nto pass health care reform. I think some of the misstatements made \ndeserve a response.\n  The Senator from Mississippi called the Senate health care bill a \nmassive tax increase. The Senator is simply mistaken. That is not \ncorrect. The health care reform legislation is, in fact, a major tax \ncut. It is not a tax increase but a major tax cut. The Senate passed a \nhealth care bill that provided more than $400 billion in tax cuts for \nAmericans to buy health insurance--$400 billion in tax cuts. Those were \ntax credits given to Americans to buy health insurance. That sounds \nlike a tax cut to me. This is the largest tax cut for individuals since \nthe record tax cuts of 2001.\n  The junior Senator from Wyoming said: We need to stop and start all \nover again. Anyone who has paid any attention to the debate on health \ncare reform for any amount of time knows the opportunity to pass health \ncare reform comes around about once in a generation. It doesn't happen \nall the time. In fact, I think it was Teddy Roosevelt who first \nattempted to pass health care reform. So it has been 67 years.\n  We are on the cusp of passing major health care reform now. We all \nknow health care reform must pass. Why? To address the Draconian cost \nincreases that families, companies, and budgets are facing; to reform \nthe health care insurance industry. If we do not do it now, don't \nreform health care now, believe me, this country is going to be digging \nitself into a pretty deep hole.\n  This comes along once in a lifetime. So a call to stop and start over \nagain in reality is a call to kill health care reform. That is what \nthat is. When you hear anybody saying let's stop and start all over \nagain, really what they want to do is kill health care reform. That is \nthe whole point of it all. Stopping and starting all over again sounds \nto me like nobody has paid any attention to where we are.\n  This Senator does not like to be partisan at all. Most Senators don't \nlike to be partisan. But the fact is, the other side of the aisle never \npresented a comprehensive health care reform proposal. There was never \nan alternative. In my judgment, it was a disservice to the American \npeople that the other side did not present anything that could be \ncalled comprehensive health care reform so we could debate it. The \nproposal offered by the Finance Committee and offered by the HELP \ncommittee, merged together into one, that was basically the Democratic \nversion. There was an opportunity to debate that as well as debate the \none offered by the other side, but they didn't ever offer one. Instead, \nwhat did they do? They just picked and tried to find holes and \ncriticize.\n  It is easy to criticize; anything can be criticized. If you are \nhalfway intelligent you can make any criticism that is inaccurate sound \npretty good. That is basically what has happened, a constant barrage of \ncriticism and very little good-faith effort to try to find a common \nsolution.\n  There was an effort a while ago when Senator Grassley and I and \nSenator Enzi, Senator Conrad, and Senator Snowe worked hard to try to \nfind a solution. We worked for days and months. Frankly, to be totally \ncandid about it, the other side decided it was better politics just to \nkill health care reform than it was to try to find a solution. That is \nwhy the three Republicans I was working with, frankly, had to withdraw. \nThey withdrew because there was so much political pressure on them from \ntheir leadership to kill the bill.\n  Senator Snowe stayed with us for a while, but even--I don't want to \nput words in Senator Snowe's mouth or try to speak for her. She can \ndecide what she wants. But even she came under tremendous pressure not \nto find a solution.\n  Any effort to start all over again is really a very thinly veiled \ncall to kill health care reform.\n  Instead of passing health care reform, the Senator from Wyoming said \nhe wanted a series of ideas. One idea he talked about is to allow \npeople to buy health insurance across State lines. I am sure he did not \nreally mean this, but if he thinks that is the sole solution to health \ncare reform, I think most Americans who were denied coverage because of \npreexisting conditions, who face all kinds of problems from the health \ninsurance industry, wouldn't agree with that. But, nevertheless, I \nmight say the bill that passed the Senate does allow insurance to be \nsold across State lines--maybe not quite as freely as the opponents on \nthe other side of the aisle would prefer, but we do allow insurance to \nbe sold across State lines. Why? Because we want competition. We want \npeople to choose. People should have the ability to choose what health \ninsurance plan they want.\n  There is very little competition now. In many States maybe one or two \ncompanies dominate. There is very little competition. That is not \nright. Allowing insurance companies to sell across State lines will \nallow more competition, allow people a better choice, but it should be \ndone in a way that is fair to the American public.\n  One of the big problems is, if companies are allowed to sell across \nState lines willy-nilly without some protections, I will tell you what \nis going to happen. It is going to be a race to the bottom. Insurance \ncompanies are going to race to find the State that has the lowest \nstandards, and that is where they will set up and then they will sell \nacross the country.\n  What that means is somebody who resides in a State that has pretty \nhigh standards but finds the only policies being sold are those sold by \ncompanies registered in a State with low standards is going to have \nvery low-quality insurance.\n  What we want is fairness, evenhandedness, some balance so people are \nable to buy insurance freely and have their choice to buy insurance; \nwhich is to say, the basic approach the majority has taken in health \ninsurance reform is to basically maintain the current system.\n  Today we spend about $2.4 or $2.5 trillion on health care. That is a \ntotal figure--about half public and half private. The half public is \nMedicaid, Medicare, Children's Health Insurance. That is about half. \nThe other half is private; it is commercial insurance. That is the way \nit should be. That is our American way. We are not Canada. We are not \nGreat Britain. We are not Sweden. We are not Japan. We are America. In \nAmerica we have a system which is basically 50-50: half public, half \nprivate.\n\n[[Page S1137]]\n\n  This legislation before us today maintains that allocation, maintains \nthat ability for people to continue to buy private insurance. It \nmaintains the ability for people to have more--in fact more choices, \nmore competition, more opportunity to buy insurance, especially when \nthe exchanges are set up.\n  I say to my good friend from Wyoming, who says: Gee, here is an idea. \nWhy not let people buy insurance across State lines, we do that. We do \nallow people to buy across State lines, but that is after we have a \nlevel playing field. We want to make sure insurance sold across State \nlines is quality insurance, not insurance that is of very low quality. \nWe also allow in the major legislation insurance to be sold across \nState lines when the exchange is set up.\n  The Senators from Wyoming and Oklahoma talked about something else. \nThey talked about tort reform. I must say, when the Senator from \nOklahoma, one who talks about tort reform, speaks--first of all, he \nsaid our bill ignores tort reform. That is not true. Our legislation \ndoes not ignore tort reform. Frankly, we begin with a series of steps. \nWe begin to build, State-by-State, programs to try out some of the best \nideas to address lawsuit reform in which, basically, States have the \nability to try different measures. They can try courts, health courts; \nthey can try something similar to workers comp or they can set up a \nsystem similar to tort reform--lawsuit reform in the State of Michigan. \nIt is called ``sorry works.'' If it is a bad outcome, the hospital, the \nphysician goes to the patient and says: I am sorry, it didn't work out. \nThey have a long talk about it and negotiate out a settlement. If they \nreach an agreement, that is great. If they do not, then the statements \nused by the physician, if there is a subsequent suit, cannot be used. \nWe do begin to go down the road of lawsuit reform in the major bill.\n  The Senator also talked about people joining to buy insurance in \nassociations. I might say, again, our bill allows that. Our bill allows \nthat and much more. When you hear people talk about the bill to join in \nassociation health plans, it is important to also point out to people \nthat is quite restrictive. First of all, it is restrictive in the sense \nit is available only to members of that association. It is not \navailable to other people. I think we want to make sure we set up \npooling arrangements so all Americans have the availability of pooling.\n  In addition, who joins associations? The companies join them. What \nabout the employees? The employees--the companies might be members of \nan association, pooling, but it might not be in the best interests of \nor what the employees want. It really cuts out employees.\n  The pooling we allow in our underlying bill is real pooling. It is \nhonest-to-goodness pooling. Frankly, the real pooling will occur when \nthe exchange is set up because then companies will be able to sell \nacross lines in the insurance exchange and also where a lot more people \nwill be involved, which will enable us to have the same benefits of \npooling.\n  I might also say a point about the exchange. Right now, if you get on \nyour computer, if you want to find the lowest airline ticket, what do \nyou do? You go to Orbitz or you go to Expedia; you go to Travelocity, \nto these various outfits, and you look around and say: Oh, I like this \nfare. Oh, no, wrong day.\n\n  So you can shop online. That is basically what we are talking about \nin the insurance exchange. Just like Orbitz, just like Expedia, you get \nonline and you can shop and you can find the right fares. It is going \nto be easier because we are requiring insurance forms to be \nstandardized and much more simplified so people can understand the \nchoices they are pursuing and make the choices they want.\n  I just want to make clear the Senate knows when the Senator from \nWyoming talks about associations, he is really talking about pooling. \nOur underlying bill has pooling, and I think even better pooling.\n  The Senators from Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Wyoming expressed shock \nat the prospect of health care being addressed in a budget \nreconciliation process. The Senator from Oklahoma said the \nreconciliation process means ``ramming it through.''\n  What my colleagues fail to remember is that this body has used budget \nreconciliation 22 times. This is nothing new. And 17 of those times it \nwas the Republican Party, controlling either the Congress or the White \nHouse, when reconciliation was used. Most of the time that we had \nreconciliation bills they included measures on health care. Health care \nis no stranger to the reconciliation process. I want to make that \nclear. Health care is no stranger to the reconciliation process.\n  I am not talking about just minor provisions in health care. The \nbudget reconciliation was the process by which the Republican Senate \npassed the COBRA health insurance bill--under reconciliation, the \nRepublican Senate passed it. COBRA, after all, stands for Consolidated \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.\n  The Senate used that process, reconciliation, to create the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program in 1997. That was a very \nsignificant health insurance program created under reconciliation in \n1997. So health care is no stranger to this reconciliation process. It \nis actually the exception when Congress has done health care reform \noutside of reconciliation. That is the real truth.\n  The Senator from Arizona questioned the constitutionality of \nrequiring people to buy insurance. My colleagues want health care to be \nthrown out if these charges are true. The fact is, the vast majority of \nscholars who have considered the matter said the commerce clause and \nrevenue clause in the Constitution give the Congress ample authority to \naddress the responsibility of people to buy insurance. This has been \naddressed many times.\n  Certainly, somebody can trot out a law professor or somebody who can \nmake a contrary claim. But our committee, the Finance Committee, looked \nat this issue very thoroughly. We searched out lots of law professors. \nWe had to find out if this is constitutional, and the weight, the far \nweight of constitutional scholarship is, in fact, this is \nconstitutional.\n  So when the Senators stand here and say it is not constitutional--\nthey are entitled to their own opinions. That is fair. That is why we \ndebate. But I might say, when one studies literature and quizzes \nconstitutional law professors, the vast majority, the balance of \nopinion is that this is constitutional.\n  I might add that most States require people to buy auto insurance \nright now. Is that unconstitutional? Is that unconstitutional for the \nState to require purchase of liability insurance if you want to operate \na car? I don't think so.\n  The Senator from Wyoming said our bill would bend the cost curve. He \nsaid the bill would raise health care costs. That is not true. Flatly, \nsimply, categorically, positively not true. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office says the underlying bill would reduce the \nFederal Government's commitment to health care in the second 10 years--\nreduce. That does not sound like costs are going up.\n  Our bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would also \ncut costs for the taxpayer. First of all, the CBO said the legislation, \nthe health care legislation reduced the deficit by $132 billion in the \nfirst 10 years and between $630 billion and $1.3 trillion in the second \n10 years. That is a cut--cut deficits.\n  Let me just make a point there. We have large budget deficits, as the \nrest of the world knows. They have to be reduced.\n  Health care reform is a step toward reducing our fiscal deficits. It \nis a very significant step. As Peter Orszag said, the once head of the \nCongressional Budget Office, now head of OMB: The path to reducing our \nfiscal deficit situation is through health care reform.\n  We need health care reform to get budgets--family, company, and \ngovernment--under control. To repeat, our bill, according to CBO, would \ncut costs to taxpayers, reduce deficits by $132 billion the first 10, \nthe point I just made, and then about $1 trillion in the next 10.\n  To summarize, our bill provides real cost control. That is what is \nneeded, real cost control. Our bill reforms incentives for the Tax Code \nto encourage smarter shopping for health insurance.\n  I might say, if this side over here wants us to stop and start all \nover again, what is going to happen? It means all those people today--\nand\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\nthere are millions of them--who are denied quality health insurance \nbecause of a preexisting condition will be unable to get good health \ninsurance.\n  Basically, those who say, stop and start over are saying: We want you \nwho cannot get good health insurance because of a preexisting condition \nto continue to not get good health insurance because of a preexisting \ncondition. That is basically what they are saying. That is not right. \nThat is not right at all.\n  It reminds me, too, of a fellow in my home State of Montana. A few \nyears ago, I was talking to him and he said: Max, I feel just awful. I \nhave a small construction firm, I have six or seven people in my firm, \nand there is one person who has been with me for 20 or 30 years. My \ninsurance company informed me my premiums are now going to go up 40 \npercent. I asked why. Because one of your long-time employees has a \npreexisting condition, and you have to either let him go--and then your \nrates will only go up 20 percent--or if you keep him, your rates are \ngoing to go up 40 percent.\n  That put this fellow, the owner of the firm, the guy I was talking \nto, in an untenable position. So what did he do? He shopped around. He \nlooked and looked to try to find another insurance company that would \nnot raise his premiums so much. Finally, he found one. His rates went \nup but not a full 40. I have forgotten how much they went up. But it \nwas wrong for him to be in that position because he was not going to \nfire that person who was such a good person who had been with him for \nsuch a long period of time.\n  So our bill would begin reforming the way the government pays for \nhealth care. Right now the government pays for the number of services \nperformed; our bill will begin to help the government pay for quality--\na very important point. I think this is the real game changer, this is \nwhat is going to make a difference over time, is how we pay for health \ncare. About 5, 6, 7 years from now, when these provisions kick in, we \nare going to be very happy we took the first step because that is what \nis going to make a big difference.\n  So I say my colleagues on the other side of the aisle threw a whole \nlot of criticisms at our bill just now, but because you say something \ndoes not mean it is true. Frankly, that is why I thought it important \nto stand and set the record straight because what they are saying is \nnot true.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we have before us a number of issues. On \nthe floor today is a jobs bill. It is a critically important bill \nbecause so many Americans are out of work, and we are trying to find \nways to keep families together while they are unemployed, but also to \nprovide health care, which is one of the first casualties of losing \none's job. This bill also tries to help several States facing disasters \nby providing assistance on an emergency basis. It extends tax relief to \nindividuals and businesses and helps workers to plan for their futures \nby helping businesses afford their pensions. It is a good bill. It \nshould pass. Yesterday we had a series of amendments filed, eight \ndifferent amendments. There are others that will be pending soon. I \nhope this particular bill will not be filibustered by the Republican \nside of the aisle. There ought to be at least bipartisan agreement that \nif we allow amendments on both sides and everybody gets their chance, \nat the end of the day we will actually vote for the bill. I am afraid, \nthough, that we are facing another filibuster such as the Bunning \nfilibuster on unemployment.\n  What that does is drag this out additional days, additional weeks. \nWhile the people of this country are impatient, if not angry, with \nCongress, unfortunately these filibusters from the other side of the \naisle just add to the frustration. I hope the Republican leadership \nwill join us now in a bipartisan effort to help create jobs. We need to \nhave help for small businesses. Most of us understand that is the \nengine that will help bring us out of the recession. These small \nbusinesses, if they can stay in business and add an employee, can make \na significant difference in terms of whether this recession is long or \nshort. I hope the Republicans will decide to work with us in good faith \non this jobs bill. It is in the best interest of all Americans, \nregardless of party. If we are going to get our country moving again--\nand we get moving again--we have to stop these filibusters such as the \none that tied us up for 5 or 6 days over the weekend and literally cut \noff the unemployment checks for thousands of Americans who are out of \nwork through no fault of their own.\n  We also have to look at the issue which is perhaps one of the major \nchallenges facing us between now and the next few weeks, and that is \nthe issue of health care. Yesterday the President came forward, after \nhis health care summit, and said to Republican leaders: We will accept \nfour major provisions you brought up at the health care summit in a \ngood-faith effort to bring you into this conversation so that we can \nhave a bipartisan bill, a good dialog, and a bipartisan vote.\n  Unfortunately, the President's gesture did not lead to this kind of \nRepublican cooperation. It is never too late. I hope some will still \nconsider joining us. I think they should understand the President \nbelieves, as I do, that there are good ideas coming from the other side \nof the aisle and that the sooner we can bring them into one bill for \nthe good of the country, the better.\n  Only this morning, I received an e-mail from a member of my family. \nShe told me about a situation in Texas where one of the workers at an \noffice where she knows some people was diagnosed with a serious cancer \nand is now facing an extraordinary effort to save her life. \nChemotherapy and radiation are going to be her lot in life for some \ntime as she struggles with this dread disease which has affected the \nlives of so many of us and our families. It is going to cost about \n$5,000 a week for the therapy she needs to save her life.\n  She was notified not only of this diagnosis and the need for this \nextraordinary care, she was also notified that her health insurance had \nbeen canceled. It is a situation which, sadly, faces too many people. \nPeople who have paid their health insurance premiums for a lifetime \nfind out when they need this health insurance the most, it is canceled \nfor a variety of reasons. One of the most common is the argument of the \ninsurance company that one has a preexisting condition which they \nfailed to disclose. I saw a list recently of preexisting conditions. It \nis a very long list. It includes things which most people would be \nsurprised to read. Did you have acne as a teenager? Is there an adopted \nchild in your household? Things such as this are used by insurance \ncompanies to deny coverage to people. The health care reform bill we \nare working on wants to put an end to these outrageous practices by \nhealth insurance companies. It makes it clear that to deny coverage for \na preexisting condition is going to become a thing of the past. I would \nsay that any and all of us should take heart in knowing that protection \nwill be there for us when we need it.\n\n  It also will stop health insurance companies from putting limits on \nthe amount of money they will pay out. We know what happens when you \npay $5,000 a week for cancer therapy. It runs into large amounts of \nmoney, and some insurance companies at some point just walk away from \nyou.\n  We also try to expand the coverage of young people under health \ninsurance. My wife and I raised three children. When they reached the \nage of 24, our family health insurance no longer covered them. We want \nto extend that to age 26. That will mean many young people who are \ncoming out of college--out of work and looking for a job--will at least \nhave the health insurance protection of their family while they are \nlooking for their first job and their own health insurance protection. \nI think that is reasonable.\n  When some argue, as we have heard from the other side of the aisle, \nthat we are really going too far and too fast when it comes to health \ninsurance, I would say these basic facts I have given you are the \nrealities that face Americans, and if we do not deal with these health \ninsurance injustices, if we do not deal with this unfairness, then, \nfrankly, we will continue to pay huge amounts for health insurance and \nit will not be there when you need it.\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\n  This week, the mayor of a downstate city in Illinois--Kankakee--told \nme that this city of 28,000 people, with 200 employees and an annual \nbudget of $20 million, 10 percent of which goes for the health \ninsurance for their employees, was rocked to learn they are not only \nfacing a recession, which has cut back on city revenues, but they face \nan 83-percent increase in their health insurance premiums next year. \nThey are going to try to negotiate with the health insurance company, \nincrease the copays and deductibles individuals have to pay, cut the \ncoverage. That is their only way out of this terrible situation.\n  But they are not alone. Blue Cross and Blue Shield's Anthem policies \nfor individuals in California recently announced they were going to \nincrease annual premiums by 39 percent. Another friend of our family \nwas notified yesterday her insurance premiums are going up 35 percent \nnext year.\n  How long can families and businesses deal with this? The answer is, \nnot long at all. And the larger question is, What are we going to do \nabout these health insurance companies? Most companies in America--\nvirtually all companies in America, save two categories--are bound by \nantitrust laws. What it means is, if you make an automobile or provide \na service, you are bound by laws in terms of fair competition. There \nare two exceptions. One exception is organized baseball. Do not ask me \nwhy, but it is. And the second one is insurance companies.\n  It started back in the 19th century when insurance companies said: We \nare not national companies. We are regulated and chartered by States. \nWe do business in States. Therefore, national antitrust laws should not \napply.\n  Then, in the 1940s, someone took note of the fact that insurance \ncompanies were now doing business across State lines and therefore \ninvolved in interstate commerce and should be subject to antitrust \nlaws. A law was passed, which started here in the Senate, called \nMcCarran-Ferguson, which exempted insurance companies from antitrust \nlaw.\n  What it means is that insurance companies--like no other companies in \nAmerica--can literally collude and conspire on the premiums they \ncharge. They can legally sit down and decide how much they will charge \nfor life insurance, casualty insurance, medical malpractice insurance. \nIt is legal because of this McCarran-Ferguson exception. They can also \nparcel out territory: Insurance company A is going to take over Los \nAngeles; insurance company B will do New York; insurance company C will \nfocus on Chicago--perfectly legal under current law but perfectly \nwrong.\n  To allow this sort of thing to occur is to fly in the face of our \nfree market capitalism and competition. I am heartened by a vote that \ntook place just a week or so ago in the House of Representatives where \nthe vote to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act received more than 400 \nvotes--435--a strong bipartisan voice.\n  I spoke to Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the chairman of our \nSenate Judiciary Committee, this morning and said: I hope you will call \nthis bill soon in the Senate. We need to repeal this antitrust \nexemption for health insurance companies and medical malpractice \ncarriers to stop this collusion when it comes to pricing and this \nallocation of markets which we do not allow for any other businesses. I \nthink if we do that, it is going to create a more competitive \natmosphere, so insurance companies will compete with one another. \nConsumers win if there is real competition. Currently, it is perfectly \nlegal to stifle competition in insurance, to limit the availability of \ninsurance, and to dictate prices by industry, not by company. That has \nto come to an end. I hope we can either include it in health care \nreform or pass it separately. We need to do that.\n  Another element on which we need to focus is these increased costs. \nHow do we start to bring down the costs of health insurance? For those \nwho suggest premiums are going to drop precipitously in the passage of \nthis bill, they are just wrong. What we are trying to do is to slow the \nrate of growth, the steep climb in prices. We want to try to flatten it \nout. There are many reasons to do it. We know as a government we cannot \ndeal with our deficit as a nation as long as health care costs are \nskyrocketing for Medicare and Medicaid and Veterans' Administration \ncare and so many other areas where we provide health care. We also \nunderstand that States face the same budgetary pressures, and the \nincreasing costs make it difficult for them, as well as for local \ngovernments, not to mention the impact on businesses and families.\n  We now estimate that some 50 million Americans have no health \ninsurance. They are not the poorest of the poor--those people are \ncovered many times by Medicaid--and they are not the fortunate ones \nlike Members of Congress who have the best health insurance in America. \nMany times, they are people who get up and go to work every single day \nand their small businesses cannot afford to pay the premiums and, of \ncourse, their children at home who may be denied coverage just because \nthe parent works in a place where health insurance is not available.\n  There are things we can and should do about this. This health care \nreform bill, when it is signed by the President, will say immediately \nthat there will be a tax credit available for all businesses with fewer \nthan 50 employees that offer health insurance to their employees. We \nunderstand a lot of people work for these small businesses. If the \nowners of the businesses are really trying to provide basic coverage \nfor their employees, we want to help them. We want the Tax Code to help \nthem. The same thing is true for individuals. If the amount of health \ninsurance premium you need to pay exceeds a certain percentage of your \nincome, you will be eligible for a tax credit.\n  The critics of this bill talk about how much it costs. Well, it is an \nexpensive undertaking, but more than half of the money that is raised \nfor this bill is used in tax breaks and tax cuts for businesses and \nindividuals to help pay for their health insurance, trying to get \npeople through this difficult time so they have coverage and can afford \nto pay for that coverage. That is an essential part of what we are \ntrying to do with this health care reform bill.\n  We also create insurance exchanges. The idea behind an exchange is to \nbring together private insurance companies--private companies--that \nwill compete with one another for your business. We know how this works \nin Congress because those of us who are Members of Congress are under \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. For over 40 years, this \nprogram has offered to Federal employees and Members of Congress the \noption of health insurance bought on an exchange.\n  I think we are the luckiest people in America when it comes to health \ninsurance. As Federal employees and Members of Congress, each year we \nhave open enrollment. My wife and I take a look at the private plans \navailable through the State of Illinois and choose what we think fits \nus best. We have nine different choices of private health insurance \ncompanies--companies that are competing for our business. If we do not \nlike the way we were treated last year by our insurance carrier, come \nSeptember we will change, and we can pick another carrier and see if \nthe coverage is better.\n\n  This is something every Member of Congress currently has, but when we \nwent to the health summit, some on the other side of the aisle argued \nthat the creation of these exchanges was too much government. Well, if \nit is not too much government for their health insurance and my health \ninsurance, why is it too much government when it comes to the people of \nthis country? They are entitled to competition and choice from private \ninsurance companies, just as we are as Senators and Members of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  One other criticism that was said: Well, you know what is wrong with \nthis bill, this bill will not allow us to buy insurance across State \nlines. Now, that is a way we can save some money.\n  That does not tell the story. This bill does allow the purchase of \ninsurance across State lines, multistate compacts, multistate efforts \nto offer insurance, but with one important element: we establish in \nthis bill the minimum standards for coverage.\n  Incidentally, that is exactly what we do with the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program. If you want to be one of the companies \ncompeting for the business of Senators, you have to offer\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\ncertain minimum protection. Some of it is based on State law, some by \nnational standards. Why do we do that? Because many people cannot sit \ndown and carefully go through every line and every page of an insurance \npolicy and try to imagine whether the coverage is adequate.\n  I recall, years ago when I was an attorney working in the State \nsenate in Springfield, IL, a case came to my attention where health \ninsurance was being sold to expectant mothers--family health \ninsurance--but it excluded coverage for newborn infants for the first \n30 days. Think about that for a second. If you and your wife have a \nbaby and the baby has an immediate, costly medical problem, this health \ninsurance plan excluded you, would not pay for it. So we said, as a \nmatter of law in Illinois, if you are going to cover mother and child, \nyou cover that baby from the moment of birth. That is part of the law. \nMaybe you can buy a health insurance plan somewhere in America that \ndoes not have that coverage, but what is going to happen when you have \nthat sick baby and huge medical costs? You may end up in bankruptcy \ncourt. You may end up on a government health insurance plan.\n  So we try to establish basic minimum standards for the health \ninsurance that is offered across America. I think that is the only \nright way to deal with this issue that challenges us.\n  We also expand coverage for uninsured people in America. There are 50 \nmillion uninsured people in America. We would provide coverage for over \n30 million of those 50 million people. These are people who literally \nhave no health insurance at all. What happens when they get sick? They \ngo to the hospital or to the doctor and they are treated. Who pays for \nit? The cost is shifted. The hospital cannot collect from them because \nthey cannot pay for it, so the hospital increases the cost for those \nwho are paying, those who have health insurance. We estimate the \naverage family pays $1,000 a year in extra premiums--almost $100 a \nmonth--just to cover the uninsured. If we bring more people into \ninsurance coverage, fewer charity cases will be at the hospital, fewer \ndollars in cost will be transferred to the policies of the rest of us \nwho have health insurance. It is a good thing to bring more and more \npeople under this tent of coverage.\n  The Republican proposal takes a look at those 50 million uninsured \nAmericans, and instead of covering 30 million, as we do, they cover 3 \nmillion. That is a far cry from 30 million. If our bill passes, it will \nmean that the largest percentage of Americans will have health \ninsurance in our history. That is a good thing for our Nation. It is a \ngood thing for our medical system.\n  We also, in our bill, try to move forward to encourage new innovative \nand productive medical practices. One of them is wellness. We have met \nwith companies that have come to us and said: When we incentivize our \nemployees to be mindful of their weight, the food they eat, their \ncholesterol, their blood sugar, their blood pressure, and to stop \nsmoking, it makes a dramatic difference. They feel healthier, they live \nlonger, and they need less medical attention.\n  So we are creating incentives for wellness. For example, one of the \nthings we do is provide, under Medicare, a free annual exam for every \nsenior citizen so they will be able to come in and be checked out, so \nlittle problems will not become big problems. I think that is sensible \nand responsible.\n  We have to move toward more primary care. Across America, we have \ncommunity health clinics. These clinics are primary care clinics in \ncities and small towns across America. For many people, they are the \nonly source of primary medical care. This bill we will pass--I hope we \nwill pass--will double the number of those clinics and increase the \nnumber of people working there. Is it a good idea? Well, it certainly \nsounds good. But it is also economically smart. Where do sick people go \ntoday if they have no health insurance and they do not have a regular \ndoctor on their child has a fever of 106 degrees? We know where they \ngo. They go to the emergency room and they wait in a queue and \neventually get treatment and it costs a fortune, dramatically more than \nit would cost if they went to a local clinic or primary care physician. \nSo we are trying to provide good care, affordable care, cost-efficient \ncare, and reduce some of the costs within the system. I think that is a \nmove in the right direction.\n\n  The same thing is true when it comes to Medicare. Some of our critics \non the other side of the aisle have said: They are going to cut \nhundreds of billions of dollars out of Medicare, and the simple answer \nis, yes, because we believe there is money there that can be saved \nwithout compromising in any way the basic benefits of the Medicare \nProgram. This program for seniors and the disabled across America has \nbeen a godsend for over 45 years. People live longer and they are \nhealthier and they are more independent because Medicare is there. \nSocial Security and Medicare have given to this modern retired \ngeneration things that others just dreamed of. There was a time--and I \ncan remember it in my own family--when your grandparents, after they \nhad quit working either because of retirement or because of physical \nhealth problems, ran out of money, and what did they do? They moved in \nwith the family. It was not unusual. It happened in our family and \nothers. Along came Social Security which said: We are going to have a \ncheck for you, a monthly check. You will not get rich on it, but you \nwill be able to get by on it, in most cases, and you can live in your \nown place, independent, the way you want to. Medicare said: We will \nhelp pay for your health care bills as part of this. Right now, if we \ndo nothing to Medicare, in a matter of 9 years it goes broke. It starts \nrunning in the red. Doing nothing is not an option. So our bill, the \nhealth care reform bill which we passed in the Senate and which the \nPresident supports, will add another 10 years of solvency to Medicare. \nThat is essential.\n  How do we achieve this by making savings within Medicare? One of the \nways is to look at how care is provided. I took a look at the average \nMedicare cost per recipient in some of the major cities in America. In \nmy hometown of Springfield, IL, with two great hospitals and great \ndoctors, it is about $7,600 a year for every Medicare recipient. If you \ngo up to Chicago, it is $9,600 a year. Over in Rochester, MN, at the \nMayo Clinic it is in the range of $7,600, $8,000 a year. But if you go \ndown to Miami, FL, the average is $17,000 a year for each Medicare \nrecipient. I will concede Miami may be a little bit more expensive than \nthe other cities I mentioned but twice the cost? I don't think so.\n  There are savings we can find in the Medicare system and still \nprovide quality care that seniors need and are entitled to. We have to \nfind ways to do that. If we don't enter into this conversation, in very \nshort order, we are going to see the Medicare system basically facing \ninsolvency. That is one of the real realities we face.\n  How are we going to reach this goal politically? That has become a \nmajor item of discussion. The President made it clear yesterday he \nfeels that after the supermajority vote in the Senate for health care \nreform, we need to move this to conclusion and it should face an up-or-\ndown vote. Let me translate what that means. It means, if the House \nenacts the Senate health care reform bill, they can also turn to \nsomething called reconciliation. Reconciliation is a process that is \nused in both the House and the Senate to deal with budgetary questions. \nWe have not invented it. It has been around for decades and it has been \nused some 22 different times. That, to me, is an indication that \nreconciliation is an accepted practice and procedure in the modern \nCongress. We have seen as well that the Republicans have used it more \nthan half those times for issues that are important to them; issues \nimportant to many of us. Children's health insurance was enacted \nthrough reconciliation. The COBRA program for health insurance for the \nunemployed was enacted through reconciliation. President Bush's tax \ncuts were enacted through reconciliation. In addition, Newt Gingrich's \nContract With America, parts of it were enacted through reconciliation. \nSo we know it has been used.\n  Some of the people on the other side have argued it is unfair to use \nit to modify any basic health care reform. It is interesting the \ncritics of the reconciliation process have voted for it many times. Out \nof the 17 opportunities to vote for reconciliation since he has been in \nthe Senate, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, has voted 13 \ntimes out of 17 for reconciliation.\n\n[[Page S1141]]\n\nSenator Grassley has had 20 occasions to vote for or against \nreconciliation. He has voted for it 18 times. Senator McCain, 13 votes \non reconciliation, he voted for 9 of them. Senator Kyl, 11 \nopportunities to vote for reconciliation, and he voted for them every \ntime. So these Republican Senators who are now saying there is \nsomething flawed or wrong or sneaky about this process have used it \nover and over to achieve legislative goals.\n  I have voted for it myself. We had some provisions relating to reform \nof student loans, for example, that I thought were good for families of \nstudents across America. Through reconciliation I voted for it. There \nis nothing sinister about it. It was right there. What it basically \nmeans is this: Under reconciliation, you can bring a bill to the floor \nand it cannot be filibustered. We all know what a filibuster means. We \njust went through one with the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, who \nput a hold on a bill, and for 5 days we couldn't vote for unemployment \nbenefits for people across this country. Eventually, the Senator agreed \nto a vote and we moved forward on it. So that kind of procedure is \nallowed in the Senate.\n  It takes literally days, if not weeks, to work our way through the \ndeadlines and schedules to get to a final vote. Reconciliation says we \nare going to set the delay tactics and obstruction aside and we are \ngoing to have a majority vote. We bring the issue to the floor, 20 \nhours of debate are equally divided, and then any Senator can offer an \namendment for a vote. That can be abused too. I hope it isn't if we \nmove to reconciliation. But at the end of the day, there is a majority \nvote, up or down. Fifty-one votes will be necessary, I believe, for \nthis to pass, and we will see if we move forward on health care reform \nin this country.\n  I hope we do move forward. I hope, if we can't get cooperation on the \nRepublican side of the aisle to tell us they will not use filibusters \nand delays and obstruction to help do reform, that we do it through the \nreconciliation process.\n  Health care reform and the cost of health care is an issue in my home \nState of Illinois which is topical. A recent press release is entitled \n``Illinois consumers to pay up to 60 percent more'' on individual \nhealth insurance policies. Individual health insurance policy premiums \nare soaring in the State of Illinois. It says:\n\n       Consumers in Illinois who lose their jobs and have no other \n     option but to buy their own health insurance will get socked \n     this year with premium increases of up to 60 percent, \n     according to state records.\n       That group of consumers has been growing, as the recession \n     has created more uninsured Americans looking for ways to \n     protect themselves and their families. Now, Illinois \n     consumers will get a glimpse into just how wide-ranging rate \n     increases among individual health plans can be. The data, \n     obtained by the Tribune, also provide a window into the \n     overall trend of premium increases at large and small \n     employers.\n       For the state's more than half-million consumers in \n     individual health plans--\n\n  We are a State of 12 million--\n\n     base rates will go up from 8.5 percent to more than 60 \n     percent, according to state data. Base rates do not take into \n     consideration health status, gender, age, place of residence \n     and length of a policy--all factors that could affect the \n     premiums further.\n       The individual insurance market is relatively small \n     compared to consumers who get their insurance through their \n     employers, but it has become the fastest growing group in \n     this economy.\n\n  I might add, that is going to happen as fewer and fewer businesses \noffer health insurance and people are on their own, people who might \nhave their own medical history or history in the family that precludes \nan opportunity for this health insurance protection.\n  The Illinois director of insurance, Mike McRaith, says:\n\n       This information is important because the individual market \n     is where an increasing number of people fall when they lose \n     their jobs and become unemployed. Individuals need insurance \n     more and more and they are struggling to hang on to it now \n     more than ever. Because fewer people are employed and fewer \n     employers are offering health insurance, we would expect to \n     see increased applications for individual health insurance.\n\n  When we hear from the other side of the aisle that we need to start \nover on this debate, it basically means to put an end to it. We are not \ngoing to start over. We have been at this for 15 months. We have had \nthe most lengthy committee hearings in our history. The Senate \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions accepted 150 \namendments from the Republican side of the aisle--150. Yet not a single \nRepublican Senator would vote for the bill when it came out of \ncommittee. We have tried our best to not only have open and transparent \nhearings and an amendment process but to engage the other side of the \naisle to bring forth their best ideas so we can try to put them \ntogether and do a package that does address the needs in America. But \nfor those who say start over, end it, put it behind us, how do you \nignore the obvious? The cost of health insurance is going through the \nroof. People know it, businesses know it, families know it, and we know \nit as a government. If we don't address this issue and address it \nopenly and honestly, it will just get worse. That is something families \nunderstand and I think we all understand.\n  We have talked about jobs through the bill before us on the floor \ntoday. I happen to think health insurance is an important part of this \nconversation. When I met with some unemployed people in Chicago a \ncouple months ago, I asked each one of them, and they were struggling \nto continue the health insurance for their family. I remember one \nmother who said: My problem is this. If I lose the health insurance I \nhad where I worked, if I can't make these COBRA payments to keep up \nthis health insurance and I am dropped, I don't think they are ever \ngoing to insure my diabetic son.\n  That is the reality of what people face. They lose costly health \ninsurance, and they may never be able to find replacement. That reality \nneeds to be addressed, and we can address it.\n  I sincerely hope many of my Republican colleagues will accept \nPresident Obama's invitation to join us in this effort. We can do this \ntogether, and we should. If we do it together, it will be a stronger \nbill and a better bill, but we can only invite our colleagues to the \nprom so many times and be turned down until we stop asking. This \ninvitation was sincere yesterday. The President brought up four major \nelements Republicans have asked for and said we will include all of \nthem in our health insurance reform bill. I hope they will join us in \nthis effort. If they do not, we owe it to the American people to move \nforward, to make certain we are ending discrimination against people \nbecause of preexisting conditions; to make certain we are starting to \nbring down costs and increase choice and competition for small \nbusinesses and individuals; to bring into the coverage and protection \nof health insurance 30 million more Americans than we have today; to \ngive Medicare another 10 years of longevity; to bring down the deficit \nin the process as health care costs start to come down. All these \npositive issues argue we need to get this job done.\n  I look forward to working toward that goal and getting it done in a \nmatter of weeks and not months.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3337\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, so often when Members come to the floor \nto offer simple amendments and describe their normal objectives, it \nsounds too good to be true. In my years in the Senate, I have found \nthat when things are too good to be true, they usually are.\n  The amendment from the Senator from Alabama seeks to constrain \ndiscretionary spending at levels agreed to in last year's budget \nresolution. He says his intent is to cap spending for the next 4 years. \nWe all understand that discretionary spending is likely to be frozen \nthis year, as the President has proposed, but this proposal goes way \nbeyond what the President of the United States recommended.\n  The President has proposed a modified spending freeze which caps \nnonsecurity-related spending. The President allows growth in Homeland \nSecurity, but this amendment does not assume growth. The President does \nnot put a cap on emergency spending, but this amendment would. The \nPresident has requested more than $700 billion in this budget for \nDefense, including the cost of war. This amendment only allocates $614 \nbillion. Specifically, this amendment only allows $50 billion for the \ncost of overseas deployments. As such, it fails to fully cover the cost \nof the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  If we want to support our men and women deployed overseas, we will \nneed\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\nto get 60 votes. Does the Senate really want national defense to be a \nhostage to a 60-vote threshold?\n  The critical flaw in this amendment is that it fails to do anything \nserious about deficits. It fails to address the two principal reasons \nour fiscal order is out of balance. It is a fact that the growth in the \ndebt has resulted primarily from unchecked mandatory spending and \nmassive tax cuts for the rich. This amendment fails to respond to \neither one of these two problems. In short, the amendment is shooting \nat the wrong target.\n  Moreover, this amendment also wants to raise the threshold on \ndiscretionary spending increases to a 67-vote approval, allowing one-\nthird of the Senate to dictate the majority. We already have a \nthreshold of 60 votes required to increase spending for emergencies \nabove the budget resolution. I, for one, cannot believe the Senate \nwants to let a mere one-third of the Senate dictate to the other two-\nthirds whether an emergency is a bona fide one. This is the wrong \ndirection for this institution.\n  Mandatory spending has run wild in the last few years. Tax cuts for \nthe rich have constrained revenues. But neither tax cuts nor tax \nincreases nor mandatory spending would be subject to 67 votes.\n  The Senator from Alabama says this approach worked to balance the \nbudget in the 1990s. That is only partially correct, and it is critical \nthat my colleagues understand the difference.\n  In the 1990s, our budget summits produced an agreement to cap \ndiscretionary spending. But they also decreased the mandatory spending \nand increased revenues at the same time. It was only by getting an \nagreement in all three areas at the same time that we were able to \nachieve a balanced budget.\n  Let's be clear. Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare happy to put a cap on discretionary spending, but they do not want \nto put policies in place to make certain we have enough revenues to \nreduce the deficit.\n  Any honest budget analyst will tell you we will never achieve a \nbalanced budget just by freezing discretionary spending. We could \neliminate all discretionary spending increases for defense, other \nsecurity spending, nondefense, and still not balance the budget.\n  Moreover, if we freeze discretionary spending without reaching an \nagreement on mandatory spending and taxes, we will find it very \ndifficult to get those who do not want to address revenues to \ncompromise.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that the administration has just \nannounced it will create a deficit reduction commission to help us get \nour financial house in order. It will look at both revenue and spending \nand find the right balance to restore fiscal discipline. They will make \ntheir recommendations to the Congress, and the majority leader has \ncommitted that the recommendations of that commission will be brought \nto the Senate for a vote.\n  The commission will certainly not focus solely on discretionary \nspending. If we are going to cap discretionary spending, then we must \nhave similar controls on revenues and mandatory spending.\n  The commission has been created precisely for this reason. Rather \nthan rushing to address only one small portion of the issue, the Senate \nshould await the judgment of the deficit reduction commission which \nwill cover all aspects of the problem.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I agree everyone should \ntighten their belts. The problem with this amendment is that all the \ntightening will be done on a small portion of spending, while revenues \nand mandatory spending will still be unchecked.\n  Each of us was elected to serve our constituents, but we do not \nnecessarily agree on the best way of doing that. We have some Members \nwho want to hold down government spending, and so they do not seek \nearmarks or other program increases on behalf of their constituents. I \ndo not agree with them, but I respect their views.\n  We have others who believe the best way to represent their \nconstituents is to seek earmarks on their behalf. But those who seek \nearmarks or other programmatic increases from the committee should \nrecognize that funding those programs puts pressure to increase \ngovernment spending, not cut it.\n  I, for one, believe it is inconsistent to insist on getting earmarks \nfor our constituents and supporting other spending increases while at \nthe same time mandating that we cut spending for discretionary \nprograms.\n  Chairman Byrd once stated on the Senate floor that sooner or later \nevery Member comes to the Appropriations Committee for help.\n  I note that last year, the Appropriations Committee received requests \nfor earmarks from more than 90 Members of this body. The Senator from \nAlabama was among those seeking earmarks. For fiscal year 2010, the \nSenator requested earmarks totaling more than $400 million.\n  I ask my colleagues: How is the Appropriations Committee supposed to \nlive within the tight constraints of these proposed spending limits \nover 5 years and still satisfy those earmarks?\n  I would also point out that like many other Senators, the Senator \nfrom Alabama has come to the floor on several occasions to seek \nadditional billions of dollars in support of building a fence along our \nsouthwest border. The total cost of that fence is estimated to be \naround $8 billion. It would be virtually impossible to provide the \nbillions required for this fence under the terms of the amendment \noffered by the Senator.\n  Other Senators have supported large program increases, such as adding \n$2.5 billion to continue the C-17 program. I have strongly supported \ncontinuing the C-17 program, but all Members should realize if the \nSenate wants to cut discretionary spending programs, such as the C-17, \nthey are unlikely to continue to be funded.\n  We cannot have it both ways. We simply cannot get the funds we \nbelieve are essential for our constituents or support our programs \nwhich we believe are of national importance, such as the border fence \nor the C-17, at the same time as we cut discretionary spending. Each \nand every Member should think about the need for funding for their \nStates, their constituents, and the Nation before they vote on this \namendment.\n  The Senate rejected this flawed plan just 6 weeks ago. This amendment \nhas not gotten any better in that intervening period. It is still \nshooting at the wrong target, and it fails to address the real causes \nof our deficits and national debt. It is not the same as the \nPresident's plan. Therefore, I urge my colleagues, once again, to vote \nno.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I was hoping I could \naddress an amendment I have on the Senate floor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3391\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I come to the floor of \nthe Senate today to give my first speech as one of the Senators from \nMassachusetts.\n  First, let me say I am deeply honored to have been elected and to \nserve in this great and historic Chamber. In addition, I am pleased to \nhave the opportunity to address my colleagues and the American people \nand other folks here watching us for the first time about legislation \nthat I am offering. It is called the immediate tax relief for America's \nworkers amendment.\n  Families in Massachusetts and across this great Nation are suffering \nthrough these tough economic times. One year after Congress passed the \nstimulus package, Americans are still struggling to pay their bills, to \nsave money for college, and to buy groceries to put on their kitchen \ntables. But in Washington, the Federal Government is driving up our \ndebt and creating government waste on projects that, in my opinion, do \nnot create enough private sector jobs or provide immediate relief for \nthe American workers.\n  The hundreds of billions of dollars that we have spent and continue \nto spend on the stimulus package have not created one new net job. Most\n\n[[Page S1143]]\n\nAmericans believe Washington is not using the money effectively enough, \nespecially while many Americans are suffering and needing immediate and \nreal relief.\n  In fact, the Federal Government right now is sitting on approximately \n$80 billion of so-called stimulus funds that are either unused or \nunobligated to specific projects as of this date. That $80 billion in \ntaxpayer money is stuck in what I consider a virtual Washington slush \nfund potentially used for special interest projects or so-called pork \nprojects to which many of us personally object.\n  I believe and others believe it is time to put this money back to \nwork immediately and put it into the pockets of hard-working Americans \nand American families so they can get what they need, so they can \nprovide for their families, they can save for their future, and put \nreal money back into the struggling economy.\n  Providing an immediate across-the-board tax relief for working \nfamilies is not complicated economic policy. I think it is simple and \ncommon economic sense. Leaders on both sides of the aisle, from \nPresidents John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan, have often called for \nacross-the-board tax cuts to put money immediately into people's \npockets to help stimulate the economy. I also believe this is a perfect \nopportunity to do the very same thing. I believe individual citizens \nknow better. People up here watching, they know better how to spend \ntheir own money than we do.\n\n  The immediate tax relief for America's workers amendment I am \nproposing would cut payroll taxes and have across-the-board tax relief \nfor almost 130 million American workers. That number again, 130 million \npeople in the American workforce, including more than 3 million people \nin Massachusetts, would have immediate relief.\n  Madam President, 130 million workers will receive that immediate and \ndirect tax relief. By turning the estimated $80 billion in unobligated \nstimulus moneys, accounts, over to the American people, our workers \nwould see their payroll taxes reduced by almost $100 per month, up to \n$500 per person, $1,000 per couple within a 6-month period. It could be \nimplemented within 60 days.\n  Some people in Washington may not think $100 or $500 or $1,000 is a \nlot of money, but I can tell you; I know the value of a dollar. The \npeople in my State know that is real money, that is money that can be \nput into their pockets immediately and spent to pay for oil, food, \nmedical bills, everyday basic needs. The American people need this \nrelief and they deserve it. Families would immediately get the help \nthey need to pay their bills, and we would put real money back into the \neconomy, helping start a true recovery.\n  Unlike tax cuts of years past, this one is paid for entirely. It will \nnot increase the deficit and could be implemented, as I said, within 60 \ndays. It would be paid for by using the roughly $80 billion in unused \nand unobligated stimulus funds that are currently sitting in a slush \nfund in Washington, DC. In my opinion, it does nothing--nothing--right \nnow to stimulate the economy that is struggling, as we know it.\n  Not to do this, I believe, would be a mistake and a disservice to the \npeople who pay the bills, and those are the American taxpayers.\n  Let me be clear: My amendment would not add one penny to our Federal \ndeficit. Also, let me remind my colleagues in this Chamber that \nbipartisanship is a two-way street. It is not just a one-way street. \nThe Senator has commented to me, as others have, that she appreciated \nmy effort to reach across the aisle last week and help pass a jobs bill \nthe majority leader was pushing to put people back to work not only in \nMassachusetts but in your State--in your State and every State in this \ncountry. I took some heat for it, but I held firm and looked at the \nbill with open eyes, as I told the majority leader and the minority \nleader and all my colleagues I would do. It wasn't perfect, but I felt \nit was a good first step.\n  So that effort of bipartisanship was evident with me last week. Many \nof my colleagues came up to me and said: What a nice new tone you set, \nSenator. We are proud you are here. We are happy to see that \nbipartisanship. Well, let me say that when I see a good idea, I plan on \nsupporting it, whether it be a good Republican idea or a good \nDemocratic idea. As long as it puts people back to work, as long as \nthere is a way to get it paid for and it makes good sense for my State \nand the people of this country, I plan on voting for it, regardless of \nwhat special interest groups say, regardless of my party, and \nregardless of what anyone else says.\n  Here is our chance to show the American people the partisan bickering \nis now over. We can help them right now. We can actually have a \nbipartisan effort on this very important bill that will put money \nimmediately into people's pockets in 60 days--up to $1,000 per couple. \nI know many people who could use that money right now. With so many \npeople struggling, I personally don't feel it is time anymore for \npolitical gamesmanship. The time is now to do the people's business. I \nhave always felt we can do better. The fact that I am here has sent a \nvery strong message across this country. The people in my State and \nthroughout the country who supported me in record numbers are saying: \nYou know what, Scott, we can do better. When you get to Washington, \nwork across party lines, get the engine going a little bit, and let's \nget the people's business done. So this is my first amendment--this \namendment to the jobs bill--and it makes fiscal sense and it is \nsomething that has been done in the past. JFK and Ronald Reagan called \nfor across-the-board tax cuts and it worked.\n  We have tried a whole host of other things--targeted tax breaks, a \nlittle here, a little there--so why don't we give it back to the \nAmerican people and see what they can do with $1,000, see what they can \ndo to stimulate the economy. Let's give them a chance. When the \nimmediate tax relief for America's workers amendment comes to a vote, \nmy colleagues will have a very clear choice: They can support a measure \nthat will immediately put money back into their constituents' pockets \nand into the economy or they can go along with the business-as-usual \napproach in Washington and leave the $80 billion in unused stimulus \nmoney in that slush fund to be used years from now.\n  The money we are talking about is not allocated. It is hanging out \nthere. It is unlikely we are going to put it back to reduce the \ndeficit, so let's put it to work within 60 days so people can use it \nwhen the summertime comes, and they can go out and do whatever they \nwant with it. We can go and create more of a bureaucracy, if we want, \nor more government jobs, but I have confidence in the American people \nthat they will do what they have always done. They have always reached \ndown and tightened their belts. They have made a difference. They are \nthe folks who will help us get out of this struggling economy.\n  I am not going to point any fingers. I am not going to say it is \ntheir fault or their fault. I don't care whose fault it is. The bottom \nline is, I was sent for a reason--to deliver a message from the people \nof Massachusetts and the hundreds of thousands of people who supported \nme. The message is: We can do better. Let's get the economy going.\n  This is a simple amendment, and I am hopeful we are going to get \nbipartisan support. I can tell you it would be very easy to use \nprocedural points of order to try to delay this particular amendment \nand allow it to get lost in the shuffle. That is very easy to do. We \ncan do a procedural point of order to delay action on the economic \nemergency facing American workers. But, by golly, I am not going to do \nit. I am going to do everything I can do every single day to make sure \nI put as much money back into the American people's pockets to do what \nthey do best--to save and to take care of their families. They can do \nwhat they have done for years; that is, to help stimulate this economy. \nAfter all, that is what the Chair was sent here to do and the rest of \nmy colleagues were sent here to do. The people watching in the \ngalleries and the people on TV expect us to do that, to get back to \nwork and solve the problems.\n  Let's move on. This is a great opportunity to do that. I am hopeful I \nam going to get some support. I believe there may be others speaking, \nso I respectfully yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of the junior\n\n[[Page S1144]]\n\nSenator from Massachusetts. He has come off the campaign trail, where \nhe talked to thousands and thousands of people all over his State and \nheard from, I would guess, millions from around the country. We should \nlisten to some of the things he is telling us because it strikes me \nthat we, too often in this body, are a bit insulated, and we fail to \nsee that people are asking us to make some changes in what we do when \nwe think we have to continue to operate the way we have been operating.\n  But that is not what I am hearing at my townhall meetings. I don't \nknow that anybody in this body, if they are listening in their townhall \nmeetings, are hearing business as usual is what the people want us to \ndo. What I am hearing is a great concern and expression of regret, and \nin some cases frustration and anger, over the amount of money we are \nspending and how recklessly we are doing it. I guess that is what I am \nhere to talk about.\n  The bill Senator Claire McCaskill and I are offering is a bipartisan \nbill. It had quite a bit of Democratic support last time. We came \nwithin just a few votes of reaching 60 votes and passing it, and I am \nhopeful today, with the alterations we have made, it will appeal to \nsome of my Democratic colleagues and they will be able to support it \nnow. I believe it will take quite a positive step in how we fund our \ngovernment and how much debt we run up.\n  In the 1990s, an idea was placed into law that said the budgets we \npass should have statutory language and should be made a part of \nstatutory law. So we did that in the 1990s. We began to see, shortly \nafter the passage of that, a containment of the surge and growth in \nspending. The growth was far more modest and, as a result, by the end \nof the 1990s we had a surplus.\n  President Clinton claimed great credit for that. I think sometimes he \nfails to recall the Congress acted, and ultimately it is Congress that \nhas the power of the purse. No money can be spent that we don't \nauthorize and appropriate. Nothing can be spent by the President or any \nother Cabinet person that Congress hasn't authorized and appropriated \nto be spent. Those are the facts.\n  This legislation would put what we call caps or limits on \ndiscretionary spending. That does not include entitlement spending, so \nnot counting Social Security and Medicare and those kind of things. It \nis the discretionary accounts we have in the Senate. This amendment \nwould put some limits on them--the limits we chose for the fiscal year \n2011 through fiscal year 2014. This is the 2010 budget resolution we \nare now under, which was passed by our Democratic majority and \nsupported by the President of the United States. It is his projections \nand our projections--the Congress's projections--for spending growth in \nthe next 4 years. The budget resolution we passed allows for a 2-\npercent increase per year in both defense and nondefense spending. The \ncaps in the amendment are exactly those we voted for in last year's \nbudget.\n  Currently, we are not standing firm with the budgets we pass. We know \nthat is a problem for us and we need to discipline ourselves. We have \nlearned that from 1991 through 2002, the statutory caps on spending \nhelped us contain spending. We did not surge discretionary spending as \nmuch as had been the case earlier. When it ended in 2002, the spending \nstarted back up again. Not only did it start up, it has now reached a \nlevel of growth the likes of which the country has never seen before. \nLast year, our total deficit for the year was $1,400 billion. This year \nit is going to be $1,400 billion or $1,500 billion when we end. We have \nnever had anything like this before. How much we are spending and how \nlittle we are paying for what we spend is a stunning development.\n  This legislation would not impact the bills that have already passed. \nSome say: Well, you might try to contain the stimulus bill we passed. \nNo, that has already passed and wouldn't be covered. None of the other \nbills that have passed would be covered. Indeed, as part of our \ndiscussion with our colleagues in the Senate about their concerns with \nthe legislation the last time we voted on it--a few weeks ago--we \nexempted this year, and we are spending pretty substantially this \nyear--well above our budget. So we had people say: Well, Jeff, I am \nconcerned about this year. I want to spend more this year. But next \nyear we have to get this house in order. Well, we are well into this \nyear already, so my decision would be: OK, that is a request I will \naccept, and Senator McCaskill agreed. So now we are asking that this \nlimit be placed beginning next fiscal year, instead of this fiscal \nyear.\n  It is very similar to the plan proposed by President Obama in his \nState of the Union Message and his fiscal year 2011 budget. In fact, \nPresident Obama actually went further in saying he wanted to see a \nfreeze on a lot of these accounts. Our bill would allow a 1-percent to \n2-percent increase in spending in these accounts. He is saying a freeze \nwould be better. So, Jeff, are you saying you want to spend more than \nthe President? No. I think we should try, and I would be supportive of \ntrying to maintain the freeze the President suggested. But I would say, \nbased on our history and what we have seen from statutory caps, if we \npass caps with this 1- to 2-percent increase, then we might be able to \nat least stay within that because last year our increases were 8 \npercent or more in spending. We all know we have to do better, and our \nbudget says we will do better. So this amendment would give some \nstrength to that.\n  The legislation specifies spending for defense and nondefense \nprograms consistent with the budget resolution. It contains a $10 \nbillion-per-year emergency fund, which fits in with the budget \nresolution. We have set aside $10 billion this year, and we should do \nat least that amount each year to ensure we have resources available if \na genuine emergency arises and we need to respond to an emergency. So \nwe would set that aside. This amendment requires a two-thirds vote of \n67 Senators to waive the annual caps or the emergency $10 billion fund. \nThat is stronger than we have had before. We have had a 60-vote cap. \nBut we know we are spending at a very reckless rate. Contrary to what \npeople say, we have had bipartisan support for all kinds of emergency \nspending, and there is usually 90 or 100 votes for hurricanes, \nearthquakes or similar things. At any rate, we think the 67 votes would \nsay to this Senate that we are serious and there should be a legitimate \nreason that can be defended to waive the budget to spend more money. \nAlso, it would say why don't we find money elsewhere within our budget, \nthrough efficiencies and other ideas, to contain that growth in \nspending and pay for some of it first before we send it to the credit \ncard and add it to the debt?\n\n  This amendment does not apply the caps to spending for any military \naction. I know Senator Inouye and others have raised the question will \nit deny soldiers in the field support. The caps would not apply to any \nmilitary action in which the Congress has provided a declaration of war \nor authorization to utilize military force. That is, I think, the \nappropriate way to handle it. This amendment would be exempting those \nkinds of situations.\n  This is similar to what the President has called for and what \nCongress did throughout the 1990s with bipartisan support. This \namendment has been evaluated by some of the best budget minds in \nAmerica, independent groups that are respected. These experts \nunderstand the nature and problems of our Congress and how we tend to \nbreak our budgets instead of staying within them. They are terribly \nconcerned about our spending; they are issuing reports, and many of \nthem have endorsed us.\n  One of the best known groups is the Concord Coalition. They endorse \nthe amendment. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that \nincludes former OMB, Office of Management and Budget, officials and \nCongressional Budget Office officials. They work together for \nresponsible Federal budgets, and they support it. Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste; the National Taxpayers Union; the Heritage \nFoundation; Alice Rivlin, who was the first head of the Congressional \nBudget Office and was the head of the Office of Management and Budget \nunder President Clinton and is now a Brookings Institute senior \nfellow--she supports it. As does Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former Director \nof the CBO under President Bush, who has spoken out on these issues.\n  This amendment is supported by a majority of the members of the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S1145]]\n\nBudget Committee the last time it was considered, and it gives the \nBudget Committee more ability to make sure their budget is not abridged \nand broken.\n  What about some questions and answers? Will this bill prevent the \nFederal Government from responding to legitimate purchases? The answer \nis no, it will not. We have $10 billion set aside anyway; it is set \naside right upfront. The amount is included in our budget resolution \nfrom last year and that money can be utilized for any emergency.\n  Second, the emergency appropriations, for example after the 9/11 \nattack; the 2004 tsunami; Hurricane Katrina--all passed with \noverwhelming support in the Senate, 93-votes-plus each and every time. \nSo this is far above the 67 votes. Not a single emergency natural \ndisaster bill since the emergency designation was created in 1990--and \nthere have been quite a few--has gotten less than 67 votes. To say it \nwill deny us the right to respond to a legitimate emergency is \nincorrect.\n  Question: Would the Sessions-McCaskill bill prevent Congress from \nfunding the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan? As I said, this threshold \nof 67 votes would not apply in cases ``of the defense budget authority \nif Congress declared war or authorizes the use of force.''\n  In addition, all emergency war supplementals for the global war on \nterrorism have received far more than 67 votes anyway.\n  Question: Would the Sessions-McCaskill bill prevent Congress from \ncaring for veterans? That has been raised a good bit. The fiscal year \n2010 budget resolution incorporates significant increases in funding \nfor veterans, an 11-percent increase in fiscal year 2010, which built \non large increases in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. In addition, a \nsignificant amount of veterans spending is mandatory. Entitlements and \nmandatory spending would not even be covered by this, just as Social \nSecurity and Medicare is not covered by it. Veterans programs have \nalways enjoyed wide support in the Senate and I don't think there is \nany doubt that legitimate concerns for veterans would be properly \naddressed. It should be paid for whenever possible but, if we cannot do \nthat, if we have a crisis for our veterans, I have no doubt there will \nbe 67 votes to take care of the veterans' needs. In fact, the emergency \nsupplemental for veterans' health care that came up in 2005 received 99 \nvotes. Veterans funding, I think most of our Members believe, ought to \ndisplace less priority items.\n  There is a myth out there that the sponsors are saying this will \nbalance the budget by focusing on nondefense discretionary spending and \nthis is a small part of the budget. It is not the biggest part of the \nbudget. And it is not going to balance the budget in itself. But the \nfacts are this. First, the amendment caps growth in both defense and \nnondefense discretionary spending. Second, the sponsors have never \nclaimed the amendment would balance the budget. We have to do a lot \nmore than this. The President himself estimates that his 3-year freeze \nhe proposed--spending not related to defense or veterans or foreign \naffairs--would result in a $250 billion savings over 10 years and that \nis real money.\n  This legislation has the potential to save hundreds of billions of \ndollars. If the choice is between 8 and 10-percent increases, as we \nhave had in the last couple of years, and the 2-percent or so increase \nthat would be allowed under this budget, it would save a lot more than \n$250 billion over a period of time.\n  I want to say how much I appreciate the support and leadership by \nSenator McCaskill on this matter. When we voted before, all Republicans \nbut 1 and 17 Democrats voted for the legislation. I expect there is at \nleast one more vote with our new Senator from Massachusetts. We have \nchanged it to apply to next year and not this year. That should attract \nmore support. I am hopeful that we could pass this. I think it would \nsend a message to our colleagues and to those who appropriate the money \nhere, that we are serious about staying within the budget limits. We \nare saying to the President, not only do we support you but we are \ngoing to create a mechanism where it is going to be harder to spend \nmore than you proposed. We will send a message to the financial \nmarkets, which are wondering what we are doing here.\n  If you read the financial pages, people make statements on Wall \nStreet that indicate they have no confidence we are going to reverse \nthe trend we are on. In fact, the trend is so stunning it puts us on \nthe road to tripling the national debt in 10 years--from 2008 with $5.8 \nbillion in public debt held by people all over the world, including \ngovernments such as China, to 2013 with $11 trillion, to 2019 with $17 \ntrillion--doubling in 5 years, tripling in 10 years.\n  I think we can do better. There is a lot of blame to go around and \nall of us deserve some of it. But we are in a position where I think we \ncan make a difference today. This legislation, I believe, is a good \nstep and would send a message throughout the world, to the financial \nmarkets, that Congress is beginning to take firm steps that would \ncontain the growth of spending.\n  I am pleased to see my colleague from Missouri here. She has been a \nchampion on this and integrity in spending in all areas. She challenges \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. She understands more than most in our body \nthat the money we have extracted from the American taxpayer should be \nspent very carefully in order to guarantee we get a quality benefit \nfrom it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. At the risk of predicting bipartisanship is going to \nbreak out at every corner of this place, I saw my friend was on the \nfloor and I wanted to take a minute to come and talk about what this \namendment represents on several levels. First, it is truly a bipartisan \neffort. My friend from Alabama, with whom I have worked closely on this \namendment, is right. There is plenty of blame to go around and we spend \na whole lot of time on the blame game on this floor. This is a moment \nwe can get beyond that. This is a moment we can support our President, \nwe can speak to fiscal accountability, which many of my friend who are \nin my party and many of my friends in the other party like to talk \nabout. But there is the talk and then there is the walk. We have a lot \nof talk about fiscal accountability but so often we kind of do not want \nto walk the walk. This is a moment we can walk the walk.\n  The President wants to do this. In fact, as my friend pointed out, \nthe President's spending freeze goes further than this amendment. It \ngoes further than what we are proposing to do. This is not an \nunreasonable amendment. In fact, it leaves out emergency spending, \nwhich we have talked a lot about this year. It leaves out this year \nbecause of the kind of critical economic situation in which we find \nourselves. It leaves out wartime spending for those conflicts the \nCongress has authorized. But everybody else is in the pool. Everybody \nelse is in. We have to look at, over the board, the kind of spending \nfreezes where 1 to 2 percent is enough in light of the deficit we are \nfacing.\n  We are so close to passing this. We are so close. I am not sure if we \nsucceed in passing it that confetti is going to drop from the sky or \nballoons are going to come down, but they should, because it will be a \nmoment, maybe the first moment in a long time, that the American \npeople, if they were paying close attention, would think to themselves: \nYou know, maybe they get it, just maybe they get it.\n  If we fail to pass this modest, appropriate path to fiscal \nresponsibility--if we fail to pass this, then I don't blame the people \nfor whom I work. I do not blame them if they shake their heads in \nwonderment. What is it going to take? How much money are we going to \npretend we have, year after year, handcuffing the greatness of this \nNation? Because if we are honest about it, this Nation has been great \nfor many reasons: our values, the strength of our military, but at the \nend of the day, this Nation has been great because we were an economic \npower. We were the country everyone looked to about how we did our \neconomy, how we promoted entrepreneurs, how the free market lifted all \nboats. We will not be able to survive in economic greatness if we do \nnot figure this out.\n  In fact, if we look over our shoulder right now, there are a couple \nof big guys coming up on us and they hold our debt. They hold our debt.\n  I know I have some fence sitters particularly on my side. I say to \nall the\n\n[[Page S1146]]\n\nfence sitters, this is not as aggressive as the President has laid out. \nSupport your President. Freeze spending at a reasonable level, leaving \nout emergencies, leaving out wars that we have in fact signed off on in \nCongress, and let's get busy showing the American people once and for \nall that we get it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3389\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, at 2 o'clock, I believe we are going to \nhave a series of votes, roughly somewhere around 2 o'clock. One of them \nis going to be on amendment No. 3389, an amendment that I offered \nyesterday but chose not to speak on yesterday. I would like to take \nabout 5 minutes just to share with my colleagues what the content of \nthis amendment is.\n  In simple terms, it is a sales tax holiday amendment. I think we all \nagree, there is no partisan difference, that our economy is shut down; \nthat we are in a period of anemic growth; and that with anemic growth \nthere is no hope of reinflating employment. We are almost at a point \nwhere we need a shock and awe in our economy, something that gives \nconfidence back to consumers, and, more importantly, to manufacturers \nof goods.\n  We have experienced, over the last several months, a replenishment of \ninventory of purchases that were made in the fourth quarter, \npredominantly because of the holidays. What we have seen since then is \na decline in, or a stagnation of, retail sales. Once we get past this \nreplenishment period, we are going to see manufacturers who look at \ntheir workforce, not with the intention of growing it but potentially \nof possibly shrinking it if things do not grow with the outlook.\n  I think we are at a point that there is not one silver bullet. I \nthink it takes things such as tax credits to employers that help \nprovide an avenue to bring on somebody new, but it requires something \nto go out the door.\n  So I think we have neglected in many ways two areas: one, the access \nto credit--and there are some bright minds in a bipartisan way working \non that here--but also what do we do to stimulate economic activity.\n  Practically every State in the country, one time a year, at back-to-\nschool time, announces they are going to have a sales tax holiday for \nthe weekend limited to those items that are back-to-school items. \nForget the fact that the week before there were probably 50 percent off \nsigns, and nobody went to the store and took advantage of the 50 \npercent off for backpacks and pencils and paper.\n  All of a sudden, the no sales tax sign goes up for 2 days, and it is \na mass consumer frenzy to try to buy those products while there is no \nsales tax. I cannot explain why. I can tell you it works.\n  In 2001, when we were in an economic downturn, we introduced \nsomething similar.\n  So what does my amendment No. 3389 do? It establishes a national tax \nholiday to provide a needed economic boost for small businesses and for \nconsumers. The legislation would allow States to voluntarily choose to \nparticipate and suspend collection of sales taxes for a 10-day period \nto encourage greater sales.\n  The Federal Government, unlike in 2001, would share with States the \neconomic cost that would be incurred in lost tax revenue during the tax \nsuspension. The Federal share would be 75 percent of the taxes lost at \nthe State and local level. This is cost sharing. We are going to ask \nthe States to share at 25 percent in hopes that the increase in sales \nwill more than make up for the 25-percent cost that States have \nincurred in the program.\n  This sales tax holiday would run for 10 days beginning the first \nFriday 30 days past enactment of the legislation. Now, why is that \nimportant? It is important because starting on the first Friday we get \ntwo weekend cycles in the 10-day sales tax holiday.\n  In my household it does not matter what day of the week it is, we \nwill buy regardless. But there are many Americans who, because of their \nwork schedules, because of their family schedules, the weekend is the \nonly time they have access to do it. This legislation, I believe, would \nprovide increased consumer confidence but, more importantly, stimulate \neconomic activity, stimulate economic activity with tax credits for \nemployers that begin to hire back, and match that with the capital that \nis needed by small businesses in the way of loans. I think all of a \nsudden we have a formula that we can turn this economy in the right \ndirection. It may not be a plan to sustain it, but I think what we have \nto overcome is the lack of confidence of the American consumer right \nnow.\n  The legislation would require the States to notify the Secretary of \nthe Treasury within 30 days of enactment. Let me say for States, no \nlater than 45 days after the end of the holiday, the Secretary of the \nTreasury would pay the participating States their 75 percent. Actually \nin the law it would say: You have 45 days to pay back. Hopefully, it \nwould not be another Cash for Clunkers disaster that we had where the \ndealers were not reimbursed for the money they had out.\n  Again, let me just say, tax holidays have a successful track record \nat the State level. They have provoked strong retail consumer reaction. \nWhile they are still somewhat of a new phenomena, surveys and case \nstudies are showing, and have shown, most shoppers view the sales tax \nholiday favorably. It is an important motivation to them to shop.\n  What do I have to go on to offer this legislation? I have actually \ntalked to retailers. I have listened to them. I have asked them what \nwould change this overnight. Without exception, they all point to one \nthing: Do a tax holiday and you will drastically change the number of \npeople coming in our stores. You will drastically change how much they \npurchase.\n  This is not a tool where I am trying to create grotesque purchasing \nin this country. But I am trying to say to the American people, if we \nwant to turn the economy around, if we want to start reinflating \nemployment, it all starts with creating retail activity. We have an \nopportunity through this legislation to begin to create the retail \nactivity that puts on a path to recovery.\n  I hope my colleagues in the next hour or so will consider this piece \nof legislation. I pay for it with unobligated stimulus money. \nTherefore, I readily expect a point of order on the Budget Act. So the \nlikelihood is, we will not vote on this amendment, but we will vote on \nwaiving the Budget Act. If we waive the Budget Act, that will tell you \nthat we would then agree to this language, and then it would be up to \nthe House to determine whether we have come up with a successful way to \nstimulate retail activities.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 \np.m. today the Senate proceed to vote with respect to the following \namendments, with no amendments in order to the amendments on this list, \nprior to a vote in relation thereto; that prior to each vote listed \nhere there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form; and that after the first vote in the sequence, succeeding \nvotes be limited to 10 minutes each; further, that the debate time \nuntil 2:30 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between the leaders \nor their designees: Stabenow amendment No. 3382, Brown amendment No. \n3391, Burr amendment No. 3389, Sessions-McCaskill amendment No. 3337; \nfurther, that upon disposition of these four amendments, the Senate \nthen proceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. \n609, the nomination of William Conley to be U.S. district judge for the \nWestern District of Wisconsin; that once the nomination has been \nreported, the Senate then proceed to vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, no further motions be in \norder, the President\n\n[[Page S1147]]\n\nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then \nresume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield such time as he desires to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3403\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee and the \nmanager of this bill.\n  I wanted to take just a few moments to talk about an amendment I have \nfiled to extend the TANF emergency fund; that is, the Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families Fund. I hope I can work with the majority \nleader, who is already working with us to work through some of the \ndifficulties in terms of the overall funding levels, to hopefully have \na vote on this at the earliest possible time.\n  We have the opportunity to extend a proven program that provides \ngenuinely desperately needed assistance to the Nation's poorest \nfamilies and their children, the people who are the most vulnerable to \nan economic downturn. I am joined by Senator Specter in offering this \namendment to extend the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Fund, \nthe TANF as we call it, the emergency contingency fund, which was \nincluded in last year's economic stimulus legislation.\n  I am glad to say this policy is supported by Majority Leader Reid, by \nChairman Baucus, Senator Schumer, Senator Feinstein, Senator Specter, \nand others. It is my understanding this amendment is fully offset. \nSenate Finance Chairman Baucus and Majority Leader Reid have been \nintegral to the development of this amendment. I am very grateful to \nthem and their staff for the assistance they have given us and for \ntheir help on this important issue.\n  This is not the moment in our economic recovery effort to walk away \nfrom the neediest families in the country, from a successful program \nthat has bolstered the safety net and created jobs for the unemployed. \nWhat my amendment does is simply extend a program that is already \nworking, and working effectively. It extends a program that was \nspecifically put into the economic stimulus package because it is so \ncritical, so sustaining in support for these neediest families at a \nlevel where it is even harder to get jobs and break back into the \nrecovery.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, more than 30 \nStates are currently using TANF emergency funds to create subsidized \njobs. By this summer, these programs are going to have provided \nsubsidies for more than 100,000 jobs. That number could grow \nsubstantially with more time and more money.\n  Let me just share with colleagues sort of the breadth of these kinds \nof things, some of the examples of the job placements that have been \nmade and created by the TANF emergency fund range from administrative \njobs: project management secretary, legal secretary, data entry clerks, \nmerchandise listers, dispatchers, marketing sales, and so forth; \nconstruction: painters, laborers, installers, land development, general \nlaborers, surveyors, and so forth; customer service: porters, cashiers, \nhousekeeping, front desk clerks; food service: restaurant managers, \ncatering managers, food preparation, food delivery; health care: \nmedical billing, medical record clerk, receptionist, and so forth. \nThere are maintenance jobs, production jobs, human service positions. \nIt covers the full range of the American economy, and it makes a \ndifference in communities to people's, literally sustainability, and to \nfamilies being able to hold together and stick together.\n  Some States are using the TANF fund to extensively help offset higher \nbasic assistance costs and to extend a variety of short-term emergency \naid to struggling families, such as heating assistance, housing \nassistance, domestic violence services, and transportation help.\n  This amendment maintains the current policy of reimbursing States for \n80 cents on every dollar spent on subsidized employment or basic \nassistance or short-term or emergency aid.\n  The amendment aids a fourth category of programs that can receive \nemergency funds, and those are work programs. As families continue to \nstruggle to find jobs with the high unemployment that we are facing, \nthis category has been added in order to give States new options for \nbolstering employment and job preparation.\n  Finally, this amendment would provide States with a maximum \nallocation for fiscal year 2011 equal to 25 percent of the State's \nannual TANF block grant.\n  I am pleased to say that Massachusetts has been one of the top five \nStates in using these emergency funds. We have currently used 65 \npercent of our available funds. It does not mean we are using someone \nelse's funds; those are the funds available to us. But it shows you \nthat where the need is important and necessary what a difference it \nmakes.\n  We are on track to draw down 100 percent of the emergency funds that \nare allowed under the Recovery Act by September of this year. We are \nusing this fund to maintain key existing safety net programs for cash \nassistance, emergency housing, rental vouchers, job programs, and \nfamily services. This basic assistance helps the economy because the \nfamilies receiving it spend virtually every cent of it in their local \neconomy to immediately meet their basic needs.\n  A 1-year extension of the TANF emergency fund could provide us with \nan additional $60 to $108 million to accommodate the 10-percent TANF \ncaseload increase we have seen since the start of the recession. I \nbelieve this is a fundamental continuation of the social contract that \nexists in this country where we have all come to understand that \ncommunities are sustained, an enormous difference is made in the lives \nof children particularly but in families, the neediest families in our \ncountry, many of whom have the hardest time finding jobs because they \nare at the bottom end of the entry level of job levels in many cases, \nand those are the jobs that have been lost the fastest and the quickest \nand they are the slowest to come back in many cases.\n  I am pleased to say this legislation is supported in a bipartisan way \nfrom bipartisan organizations, including the National Governors \nAssociation, the National Conference of State Legislators, the American \nPublic Human Services Association, and the National Association of \nState TANF Administrators.\n  This fund has caused both direct job creation and has provided an \nenormous amount of necessary activity in local communities. A vote \nagainst this amendment would leave an awful lot of folks unemployed, \nlow-income parents without work opportunities or without the vital \nassistance of basic necessities. I hope all colleagues will support the \namendment when the time comes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that time \nunder the quorum call be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3342\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise to speak about amendment No. 3342 \nwhich I have offered with respect to the legislation in question. There \nhas been some confusion among my colleagues about what exactly is \ncontained in this amendment which I introduced with Senator Boxer as an \nindividual stand-alone bill previously and introduced in similar format \nhere on this legislation.\n  I emphasize to my colleagues that this is a carefully drafted, one-\nshot amendment designed to give the American taxpayers a place on the \nupside of the recovery of the financial system that they, quite \nfrankly, enabled. This amendment would provide a one-time 50-percent \ntax on bonuses that are above $400,000 of any initial bonus paid to \nexecutives of financial institutions that received a minimum of $5 \nbillion in the TARP program. It is only for income that was generated \nthrough work in 2009 and compensated in 2010. This is a one-shot matter \nof fairness to balance out the rewards these financial institutions \nreceived which were enabled by the contributions of the American\n\n[[Page S1148]]\n\ntaxpayer in the TARP program. We have had estimates that this amendment \nwill recover for our economic system somewhere between $3.5 and $10 \nbillion. I again emphasize that the American taxpayers did not create \nthis economic crisis. They were required to bail out those people who \ndid create it. They deserve to share in the upside, in the rewards they \nthemselves enabled.\n  Paul Krugman, who is a Nobel Prize-winning economist, wrote in July \nof 2008 about his concern at the very inception of this economic crisis \nthat we were moving toward a tendency in this country to socialize risk \nand individualize reward. In other words, whenever we create a \nsituation where there is an economic challenge, the American taxpayers \nat large are expected to absorb the risk. But then when the reward \ncomes in, only the executives, the people who were managing the \nfinancial system, are able to actually get the rewards.\n  This particular reward in this one-shot tax proposal has come about \nlargely as the result of government intervention, as the result of \nworking people having to put their money forward in order to bail out a \nfinancial system that had gone wrong. As a result, I believe, as a \nmatter of equity, the reward should be shared with taxpayers who made \nit possible.\n  For those who had to vote on the TARP program on October 1, 2008, it \nwas a very difficult vote and a defining moment in the Senate. We need \nto remind ourselves of what was going on at that point. We were called \non a mass conference call in the Senate by the Secretary of the \nTreasury and Chairman Bernanke telling us that if we did not move $700 \nbillion forward without a hearing, on an emergency basis, the world's \neconomic systems were going to go into cataclysmic free fall.\n  I, like a lot of Members, struggled with that vote. I talked with as \nmany people as I could across the philosophical spectrum of how the \neconomy should work. I finally decided in favor of moving that money \nforward. At the same time, I laid down a set of principles. One is that \nwe should look at executive compensation. Another is that we should \nlook at reregulating the financial sector, on which Chairman Baucus has \ntaken the lead. Another is that it would be vital, in terms of \nfairness, that we include the American taxpayer on the upside of any \nrecovery. In other words, if the taxpayers were going to have to put \nmoney in when these troubled assets or toxic assets--whichever term \npeople would like to use--couldn't find a value and were clogging up \nour economic system, clogging up our liquidity, once that situation was \ncleared and a value was placed on these amounts and the economy started \nto recover, a portion of that benefit should go to the taxpayers who \nhad to put the money out.\n  There has been some talk about how with these companies--and we are \nonly talking about 13 companies that got $5 billion or more--TARP money \nhas been paid back. In some cases, a good bit of this money has been \npaid back. But I wish to make two points.\n  The first is, any moneys that were paid back were received at the \nearliest in midyear last year, 2009, meaning that taxpayer assistance \nto these companies was very much in effect. Quite frankly, among the 13 \ncompanies included in our amendment, most of the money has not been \npaid back.\n  I have had some questions here on the floor about whether this \namendment discriminates against New York. Quite frankly, two of the \nlargest companies with respect to bailout commitments are based in DC \nand in my own State of Virginia. This has nothing to do with regional \ndisagreements or class envy of any sort. It is just a matter of how we \nought to deal fairly with the way our taxpayers, our working people, \nhad to step forward.\n  A second point in terms of the TARP money being paid back is that the \nextent of our government's obligation to these bailout companies is \nastronomical. It is beyond the $700 billion. This goes to Paul \nKrugman's point which he has made consistently since 2008 about \ncontinually socializing risk that is enabling these rewards and not \ngiving a benefit to the people who largely took the risk.\n\n  The billions of dollars in bonuses being paid out are a direct result \nnot only of the TARP bailout but also of generous Federal Reserve \npolicies over the last year. We have seen near-zero interest rates, a \ndiscount window, and we have had the toxic assets bought by taxpayers. \nAt the same time, these firms were able to borrow cheaply, to lend at a \nhigher rate, to charge fees, and to leverage their bets into purely \nfinancial transactions.\n  If you examined a quarterly report to the Congress that came out in \nJuly of last year, they indicated that the true potential amount of \nsupport the Federal Reserve was providing these programs was in the \nneighborhood of $6.8 trillion. So these risk takers, these people who \nwere managing at the top level in these companies did so at a time that \nthey had enormous backup from the American taxpayer.\n  Andrew Cuomo, attorney general of New York, wrote a letter in January \nof this year to TARP recipients. In this letter, he made a couple of \nvery important points that go to the intent of our legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WEBB. He writes:\n\n       . . . the Office of the New York Attorney General has been \n     conducting an inquiry into various aspects of executive \n     compensation at many of our nation's largest financial \n     institutions . . . [including] a review of compensation \n     practices at the 2008 TARP-recipient banks.\n\n  He makes a very valid point at the end of his letter. And here, he is \nwriting to a company that had paid back the initial TARP money.\n  He writes:\n\n       . . . when you received TARP funding, your firm took on a \n     new responsibility to taxpayers. While your firm has now paid \n     the TARP money back----\n\n  Again, not all have; most of the money has not been paid back----\n\n       it is not clear that your firm would have been in the same \n     position now had you not received that TARP money.\n\n  We have all struggled with this issue. There have been many different \napproaches. In fact, Chairman Baucus has been out front on this issue \nin a number of different ways. I have in front of me the Compensation \nFairness Act of 2009, which Chairman Baucus introduced last March, \nwhich was one attempt to address this issue of windfall profits \nbonuses. This legislation was sponsored by Senators Grassley, Schumer, \nMenendez, and others. Our bill is much narrower than this bill. This \nbill would tax bonuses of more than $50,000. Our bill taxes bonuses of \nmore than $400,000. This bill would have taxed institutions that \nreceived more than $1 million. Ours requires $5 billion. This bill was \nretroactive and recurring in terms of the taxes. Ours is a one-shot, \njust on this 2009 amount of money that came in as a result or the \nbenefits that came in as a result of our taxpayers stepping forward and \nputting $700 billion into the TARP program. Senator Brown of Ohio has \nintroduced legislation that would put a windfall profits tax on any \nbonus higher than $25,000.\n\n  Our amendment was inspired and designed based on a couple of previous \nwritings and pieces of legislation, the first being the Baucus \nlegislation, which was the starting point for it. The other was, I \nthink, a very powerful article written in the Financial Times--one of \nthe most conservative economic newspapers in the world--last November, \nby Martin Wolf. I am going to read some excerpts from this article. \nFirst, he said:\n\n       Windfall taxes are a ghastly idea. . . . So why do I now \n     find the idea of a windfall tax on banks so appealing? Well, \n     this time, it does look different.\n       First, all the institutions making exceptional profits do \n     so because they are beneficiaries of unlimited state \n     insurance for themselves and their counterparts. . . .\n       Second, the profits being made today are in large part the \n     fruit of the free money provided by the central bank, an arm \n     of the state. . . .\n       Third, the case for generous subventions is to restore the \n     financial system--and so the economy--to health. It is not to \n     enrich bankers. . . .\n       Fourth, ordinary people can accept that risk takers receive \n     huge rewards. But such rewards for those who have been \n     rescued by the state and bear substantial responsibility for \n     the crisis are surely intolerable. . . .\n       Fifth. . . .``Windfall'' support should be matched by \n     windfall taxes.\n\n  His proposal, which inspired the specifics of our amendment, was that \nthere could be a ``one-off windfall tax on bonuses,'' a one-time \nwindfall tax\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\non bonuses to equal the playing field in terms of this unique situation \nour country found itself in.\n  I wish to say to my fellow Members and to other people who are doing \nthe hard work of keeping our economy strong, I respect what it takes to \ntake on risk and get a reward. I respect the entrepreneurship that has \nstrengthened our country throughout its history. But we also need to \nremember the working people in this country strongly and rightly \nbelieve they have borne the brunt of this economic crisis, and they \njust as strongly and rightly believe they are becoming the last to be \nrewarded, as we begin to recover from it.\n  Our taxpayers, our working people, rescued a financial system that \nwas on the verge of collapse because of massive acts of bad judgment by \nthe very companies that are now reaping huge bonuses from the \ngovernment's intervention. It is not too much to ask those who have \nbeen fully compensated, and who have received in excess of a $400,000 \nbonus on top of their compensation, that they pay a one-time tax and \nshare that excess on top of their $400,000 bonus in order to help make \ntheir rescuers a little more secure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                State of New York,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                      New York, NY, Jan. 11, 2010.\n     Re executive compensation investigation.\n\n     Bank of America Corp.,\n     New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. Liman: As you know, the Office of the New York \n     Attorney General has been conducting an inquiry into various \n     aspects of executive compensation at many of our nation's \n     largest financial institutions.

Accordingly, we also \n     ask that the Board inform us of the policies, procedures, and \n     protections the Board has instituted that will ensure Board \n     review of all such company expenditures going forward.\n       As recent government actions have created new issues of \n     public accountability and as private sector financial \n     institutions are grappling with the consequences of these \n     actions, we believe the need for full disclosure and \n     transparency are essential and this reporting will assist in \n     that effort.\n       We ask that you provide the requested information by \n     February 8, 2010.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Andrew M. Cuomo,\n                        Attorney General of the State of New York.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time in \nall quorum calls prior to the vote at 2:30 p.m. be charged equally to \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3358\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to spend a few minutes talking \nabout an amendment I have, No. 3358, which has already been pending, \nbut I think, first, it is important for us to know that last year we \nborrowed $4 billion a day in this country. Mr. President, 43 cents out \nof every $1 the country spent at the Federal level was borrowed.\n  What does that mean? What that means is that over the next 10 years \nwe are going to be paying $4.5 trillion in interest on the additional \n$9.8 trillion we are projected to spend that we do not have.\n  It was less than 3 weeks ago that this body passed a statute. Here is \nwhat the statute said: If you do not have the money to spend, then you \nhave to cut something if you are going to spend new money.\n  As of last night, in the 3 weeks since we passed that bill, this body \nhas said: That does not count. Time out. We are going to spend $120 \nbillion over the next 10 years, but we are not going to pay for it.\n  That is why when that bill came through, to tell America we were \ngoing to finally get some fiscal discipline, we, as a minority, voted \nagainst it, because we knew it was not true. As a matter of fact, one \nof our newer Members wanted to vote for it, as I had in the past when I \nfirst got here because I believed what it meant was real.\n\n  The fact is, the pay-go rules are a ruse. Pay-go means: American \npeople, you pay, and we will go spend it. Even more than that: What you \ndon't pay, we will go spend anyhow and we will charge it to your \nchildren and your grandchildren.\n  So this amendment I am proposing to be a part of this tax extenders \nplan would require three things. It would require the Secretary of the \nSenate to post on the Web site the following three things: the total \namount of spending, both discretionary and mandatory, passed by the \nSenate that has not been paid for. We have this big hullabaloo saying \nwe are going to pay for it and then as soon as the hard choices come of \ngetting rid of something that is a lower priority, we will not do it; \nwe just charge it on the credit card. So this amendment would require \nus to post on our Web site all the spending we are doing that wasn't \npaid for. In other words, we are not going to tell America one thing \nand do another without at least being transparent in knowing we are \ncomplicit in not following our own law we passed that said you have to \ndo this.\n  The second thing it would require is the total amount of spending \nauthorized in new legislation as scored by the CBO. Because what \nroutinely happens here, and what I have been rejected on over the last \n5\\1/2\\ years, is that if you want to start a new program that is well \nintended to help people, one of the things we ought to do is get rid of \nthe ones that aren't helping people, the\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\nones that aren't efficient, the ones that are a lower priority. In \nother words, we ought to have to do what every American family has been \ndoing for the last 2 or 3 years as we have gone through this economic \nconstriction, which is make hard choices. They put priorities on \nthings. The fact is, we are going to have $120 billion inside of 3 \nweeks that we refuse to prioritize. We are just going to spend another \n$120 billion.\n  Finally, the third component of what I am asking for in this \namendment is for us to put on the Senate Web site any new government \nprograms we create. What are the new programs we create? That is \ntransparency.\n  So this amendment is not a gimmick. It is not to try to make people \nlook bad; it is to try to make sure the American people know what we \nare doing and can see what we are doing. It is also to make sure the \nAmerican people know when we say one thing and then do another. It is \nto make sure the American people can see that the Senate has passed \n$120 billion worth of unpaid-for programs that we, in fact, directly \ncharged to the next two generations, after we have passed a pay-go rule \nsaying we will never do this. It is about credibility. It is about \ncharacter. It is about honor. It is about fessing up, if you don't have \nthe courage to make hard choices.\n  So it is very simple. Some of my colleagues think it is a gimmick. I \ndon't think it is a gimmick. It is about being transparent with the \ntruth about our lack of courage to make hard choices.\n  Ultimately, what is going to happen is the world financial system is \ngoing to force us into making hard choices. We all know that is coming. \nWe are going to have a $1.6 trillion deficit this year. Forty-five \ncents out of every dollar we spend we are going to borrow against our \nchildren. When does it stop? When do we start making the difficult \nchoices we were sent to make?\n  So my hope is that my colleagues will support this amendment and we \nwill, in fact, be honest and transparent with the American people about \nwhat we are doing and how we are doing it and how we don't even follow \nour own rules. There is a Senate rule on pay-go, a budget rule, but now \nthere is a statute. What we have done is, we have conveniently voted in \nthe Senate that we are not going to honor the statute, we are not going \nto make the hard choices, and we are going to go on and spend the \nfuture of the generations who follow.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                      Nomination of William Conley\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise in support of \nWilliam Conley's nomination to be district court judge for the Western \nDistrict of Wisconsin. If confirmed, Mr. Conley will replace Judge \nBarbara Crabb, who is taking senior status after more than 30 years of \ndistinguished service on the court.\n  Bill Conley will make an outstanding addition to the Federal bench. \nHe rose from humble roots in the small town of Rice Lake, WI, to \ngraduate with distinction from the University of Wisconsin. He went on \nto the law school at UW, graduating cum laude and Order of the Coif. \nFollowing law school, he clerked on the Seventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals for Judge Fairchild.\n  Bill Conley's career has prepared him well to be a Federal judge. He \nhas practiced law for 25 years at the venerable Madison firm of Foley & \nLardner. Throughout his career, he has earned a reputation as a \nskillful lawyer and top-notch litigator. He has represented a variety \nof national and international companies before State and Federal courts \nand has served as a mediator and arbitrator and helped parties resolve \ntheir disputes outside court.\n  One of Bill Conley's greatest strengths is his frequent \nrepresentation of clients before the court to which he has been \nnominated. From this experience, he has gained a keen understanding of \nthe court as well as the fairness and impartiality the administration \nof justice requires.\n  While managing a busy legal practice, Bill Conley has remained \ncommitted to using his legal talent for the benefit of the local \ncommunity. He has devoted hundreds of hours to pro bono legal work, \nrepresenting refugees, indigent defendants, and others who would \notherwise not be able to afford legal representation. He has also been \nactive with the Remington Center for Criminal Justice at the University \nof Wisconsin, as well as the Wisconsin Equal Justice Fund.\n  Despite the many hours his work demands, Bill Conley makes time for \nhis family and is a devoted husband, father, brother, and son. In sum, \nhe possesses all the best qualities we look for in a judge: legal \nacumen, diligence, humility, and integrity.\n  Bill Conley's nomination was the result of the work of the \nnonpartisan Wisconsin Federal Judicial Nominating Commission. For the \npast 30 years, Senators from Wisconsin, regardless of party, have used \nthe Commission to select candidates for the Federal bench. This process \nensures that a judge's qualifications are always our primary \nconsideration and that politics are kept to a minimum.\n  Bill Conley's nomination proves, once again, that the process we use \nin Wisconsin ensures excellence. So it is no surprise that the American \nBar Association found him to be ``unanimously well qualified'' and that \nthe Judiciary Committee approved of his nomination without dissent.\n  When considering nominees for lifetime appointments for the Federal \ncourts, we must satisfy ourselves that these nominees have substantial \nlegal experience, are learned in the law, have the respect of their \npeers, and, most important of all, will be fair-minded and do justice \nwithout predisposition or bias. William Conley's experience and \nqualifications convince me he well exceeds these requirements.\n  I am confident Bill Conley will be a Federal judge we can be proud of \nand that he will serve the people of Wisconsin well.\n  Thank you very much. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask that I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Arthur Elkins\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today because the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works will soon be meeting to \ndiscuss the nomination of Mr. Arthur Elkins to be the inspector general \nat the Environmental Protection Agency. I support Mr. Elkins moving out \nof committee, and to date he has truthfully answered all the questions \nI posed to him. Before the full Senate votes, I do have some additional \nquestions based on a report I am releasing today.\n  As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight in the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I care a great deal about \nensuring oversight over the agencies within our jurisdiction, the most \nimportant of which is the EPA. Over the last few months, the minority \non the subcommittee has compiled a report. The report is entitled ``The \nStatus of Oversight: A Year of Lost Oversight.'' This report details \nthe severe lack of oversight by the majority of the committee and the \nadministration.\n  When the majority created the Subcommittee on Oversight, it was \nstated that they planned ``to use the subcommittee to explore ways to \nrestore scientific integrity in the EPA, and other Federal agencies \nfocused on the environment, and to strengthen environmental protections \nby once again making the regulatory process more transparent.'' I \nagree. One year later, as my report details, there have only been two \nsubcommittee hearings, and, as the report concludes, ``The result of \nthis is that the majority has let a year go by where they have failed \nto pursue their stated goals.''\n  Over the last year, my colleagues and I have requested a series of \ninvestigations and hearings into key matters related to whistleblowers \nbeing silenced, data being manipulated, and shadow czars holding \nmeetings where nothing is put into writing to avoid Freedom of \nInformation Act requests. We have asked for these hearings and \ninvestigations because we believe the public needs to have trust in \ntheir government.\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\n  At the beginning of this administration, Environmental Protection \nAgency Administrator Lisa Jackson herself stated unequivocally: ``The \nsuccess of our environmental efforts depends on our earning and \nmaintaining the trust of the public we serve.''\n  As this report demonstrates, this administration and the majority \nhave shown little interest in pursuing these matters. Let me read to \nyou the findings and recommendations of the report: In 2009, the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee majority chose not to conduct \noversight over the relevant agencies within the executive branch. The \nlack of any oversight over the activities of the Federal agencies \nweakens the system of checks and balances and invites the potential for \nlarger abuses. Action must be taken to investigate oversight issues \nfrom the last year, and further coordination within the committee \nregarding the oversight jurisdiction and responsibility is needed.\n  I believe that finally receiving a nominee for inspector general at \nEPA gives the public another opportunity to get to the truth about the \nissues raised in this report.\n  In his answers to my questions to date, Mr. Elkins has signaled that \nhe is absolutely willing to chart a new course from where this \nadministration and the majority have taken us.\n  When I asked: Do you believe it is the responsibility of the EPA \ninspector general to investigate instances where whistleblowers are \nsilenced by their superiors at the Agency, he said yes.\n  When I asked: Will you pursue those instances, he said yes.\n  When I asked: Do you believe it is the responsibility of the EPA \ninspector general to investigate and report instances where scientific \nprocedures at EPA are circumvented, he said yes.\n  When I asked: Will you investigate instances where agency employees \nare smeared publicly in the press by higher-ups in an agency or in the \nadministration simply for providing their best advice and counsel, he \nsaid yes.\n  All of these things are not hypotheticals; they all occurred over the \nlast year. My colleagues and I in the minority have asked for \ninvestigations into each of these instances by the majority and the \nadministration. The response we have received each time has been a \nresounding no.\n  If the administration and the majority refuse to provide proper \noversight, then someone else has to. That is why I plan to share this \noversight report with Mr. Elkins, the nominee to be inspector general \nat the EPA. Before a floor vote, I will seek confirmation that he will \ngive the matters I raise in this report due consideration. I am \nconfident based on his response so far that he will answer in the \naffirmative. If so, we will have the sea change at the EPA that will \nrestore the public's confidence in that Agency.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I will.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3382\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3382 offered by the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak on behalf of this \namendment which was cosponsored by Senators Hatch, Schumer, Crapo, \nSnowe, Sherrod Brown, Enzi, Risch, and Collins.\n  This focuses on companies that continue to face significant \nchallenges in raising capital for new investments. It would allow \nstruggling companies that do not benefit from other incentives, such as \nthe NOL carryback and others, to utilize existing AMT credits based on \nnew investments they make in this year for equipment and so on to \ncreate jobs.\n  It encourages companies to invest and to allow companies to be able \nto receive a badly needed source of capital. This is very important for \ncompanies that will be in a position where they are not making a profit \nbut are continuing to invest, to maintain their workforce, or grow \ntheir workforce, and need to be able to have a source of capital.\n  This is dollars they would be receiving at some point anyway, because \nwhen they become profitable, they are able to use the credits. We are \ngoing to allow them to use a portion, just 10 percent of those credits, \nto be able to invest in equipment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. And facilities to create jobs here.\n  I want to thank many businesses: the U.S. Chamber, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Association of Manufacturing \nTechnology, the Equipment Manufacturers, Motor and Equipment \nManufacturers, and many businesses that are in America working to make \nthings, to bring back jobs. This is on behalf of all of them, and I \nwould ask colleagues for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3382) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3391\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3391, \noffered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Brown.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, providing immediate \nacross-the-board tax relief to working families is not complicated \neconomic policy. It is simple and makes economic sense. Under my plan, \nalmost 130 million workers will receive immediate and direct tax \nrelief. If we took the estimated $80 billion in unobligated stimulus \naccounts today, money that is sitting there unused, in what I consider \na stimulus slush fund, and gave it back to the American people, our \nworkers could see their payroll taxes lowered by nearly $100 per month, \nsaving them more than $500 over a 6-month period, and working couples \ncould receive a tax cut worth more than $1,000.\n  This has been done before. JFK and Ronald Reagan called for across-\nthe-board tax cuts to stimulate the economy and we can do that now. I \nmoved last week for a bipartisan effort to get Washington working \nagain. I reached out across party lines and made a sincere effort to \nstop business as usual to get the jobs done that the American people \nare demanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as a former President used to say, ``There \nthey go again.'' There they go again trying to cut back the Recovery \nAct. There they go again trying to scale back what CBO says is a proven \nsuccess in creating jobs. They tried it with the Bunning amendment \nTuesday, they tried it with the Thune amendment yesterday, they tried \nit with the Bunning amendment yesterday, they tried it with the Burr \namendment yesterday. Each time the Senate rejected their attempt to \nraid the Recovery Act, and we should do the same again today.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the Recovery Act \ncreated between 1 and 3 million full-time equivalent jobs. That is real \njob creation. Now is not the time to be scaling back job creation. I \nurge that we do not adopt this amendment.\n  I raise a point of order against section 103(d) of the pending \namendment pursuant to section 403 of S. Con. Res. 13, the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2010.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I move to waive the applicable section of \nthe Budget Act with respect to my amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 44, nays 56, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 40 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The point of order is sustained and the emergency designation is \nremoved.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \nBrown amendment violates section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained and the \namendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3389\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I believe the next amendment is the Burr \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there are now 2 minutes evenly divided \nbefore a vote with respect to the Burr amendment.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I will be very brief, and we can get on with \nthis.\n  My amendment is very simple. In the spirit of trying to restart this \neconomy, get Americans back to work, what this amendment does is create \na 10-day tax holiday. It is voluntary for any State that wants to \nparticipate. It would start 30 days after enactment on the first Friday \nso that we incorporate two weekends of sales.\n  We introduced this in 2001 to handle the economic downturn. States do \nit every year for back-to-school time. It is proven to generate retail \nactivity. Right now we need a shock and awe to this economy if we want \nto get Americans back to work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as Yogi Berra once said: ``It's deja vu \nall over again.'' That is where we are. We have had this amendment--not \nthis precise amendment but many similar to it--many times, taking \nRecovery Act funds out.\n  Just to remind my colleagues, CBO says there are 1 million to 3 \nmillion jobs the stimulus bill has created. There is more yet in the \nrecovery package to continue to create more jobs. Now is not the time \nto cut back on a proven job creator. Therefore, I urge that we do not \nadopt this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending Burr \namendment violates section 201 of S. Con.

Mr. President, this amendment is one of those \nopportunities where we get to walk the walk. There is an awful lot of \ntalk about how we have to do something about spending. There is a lot \nof misinformation out there about this amendment.\n  First of all, it exempts emergencies. It exempts mandatory spending, \nsuch as UI and COBRA. It exempts our wars. It exempts emergency \nspending. It is less aggressive than the President's spending freeze \nthat he has laid out for next year. It does not apply until the next \nfiscal year.\n  This is the moment we can walk the walk instead of just talking the \ntalk and show the American people we get it. Two percent is not \nunreasonable in terms of increases every year when we look at the pile \nof debt we have to deal with in the coming decades.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment says one thing and does \nanother. It says it will help control Federal spending, but it leaves \nmandatory spending off the table when that is the area of rampant \ngrowth over the past decade.\n  It also circumvents the Deficit Reduction Commission, which was \ncreated a few days ago to look at both spending and revenues by \nprematurely cutting discretionary spending, and it may require the \nAppropriations Committee to cut more than $100 billion from national \ndefense.\n  I urge my colleagues to once again reject this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment deals with matters within the \nBudget Committee jurisdiction. Accordingly, I raise a point of order \nthat the pending amendment violates section 306 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the Senate has finally taken action on \nthe nomination of Judge William Conley to be a U.S. district court \njudge in the Western District of Wisconsin. Judge Conley was reported \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee without objection last year, on \nDecember 10. That is almost 3 months ago. He has waited for this day \nfor some time.\n  I had hoped that Mr. Conley's confirmation process would resemble \nthose of Judge Christina Reiss of Vermont and Judge Abdul Kallon of \nAlabama. Those nominees received relatively prompt consideration by the \nSenate, and they should serve as a model for Senate action. Sadly, they \nare the exception rather than the rule. They show what the Senate could \ndo, but does not. Time and again, noncontroversial nominees are \ndelayed.\n  The Senate is far behind where we should be in helping to fill \njudicial vacancies. Vacancies have skyrocketed to more than 100 and \nmore have been announced. We need to do better. The American people \ndeserve better.\n  As with so many other nominations before the Senate, Judge Conley has \nwaited an extraordinary amount of time to be confirmed. Instead of time \nagreements and the will of the majority, the Senate is faced with \ndelays by Senate Republicans. Earlier this week we had to overcome \nRepublican objection and a filibuster to obtain a vote on the \nnomination of Judge Barbara Keenan. She, too, was confirmed \nunanimously, 99 to zero. Yet Republicans would not agree to schedule a \nvote on her nomination. She was forced to wait four months after being \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate was required \nto end the Republican filibuster.\n  In addition to Judge Keenan and Judge Conley, there are 17 additional \njudicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar, all of which \nhave been considered and favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Thirteen of those judicial nominations received unanimous or \nstrong bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee. They should all \nbe considered without further delay. Debate and votes should be \nscheduled on all of the judicial nominees being stalled. Those opposed \nby a minority should be debated and then receive a vote.\n  Only 16 Federal circuit and district court judges have been \nconsidered by the Senate so far during President Obama's 13 months in \noffice. By this date during President Bush's first term, the Senate had \nconfirmed 39 judicial nominees.\n  I remain very concerned about the new standard the Republican \nminority is applying to many of President Obama's district court \nnominees. Democrats never used this standard with President Bush's \nnominees, whether we were in the majority or the minority. In 8 years, \nthe Judiciary Committee reported only a single Bush district court \nnomination by a party-line vote. That was the nomination of Leon \nHolmes, who was opposed not because of some litmus test, but because of \nhis strident, intemperate, and insensitive public statements over the \nyears. During President Obama's short time in office, not one, not two, \nbut three district court nominees have been reported on a party-line \nvote. I hope this new standard does not become the rule for Senate \nRepublicans.\n  In December, I made several statements in this chamber about the need \nfor progress on the nominees reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. I also spoke repeatedly to Senate leaders on both sides of \nthe aisle and made the following proposal: Agree to immediate votes on \nthose judicial nominees that are reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee without dissent, and agree to time agreements to debate and \nvote on the others. I reiterated my proposal earlier this week and do \nso, again, now: I urge Senate Republicans to reconsider their strategy \nof obstruction and allow prompt consideration of all 18 judicial \nnominees currently awaiting final Senate consideration. There is no \nneed for these nominations to be dragged out week after week, month \nafter month.\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\n  After 3 months of delay, today we finally considered the nomination \nof William Conley. Mr. Conley is a partner in the Madison, WI, office \nof Foley and Lardner, where he is widely recognized as a top antitrust \nand appellate lawyer. He has represented clients before the U.S. \nSupreme Court, the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and the Seventh Circuit, \namong others. Mr. Conley attended the University of Wisconsin, where he \nearned his B.A. and J.D. with honors. Mr. Conley also served as a law \nclerk for Judge Thomas Fairchild on the Seventh Circuit. I congratulate \nJudge Conley on his confirmation today. I look forward to the time when \nthe 17 additional judicial nominees being stalled are released from the \nholds and objections that are preventing votes on them and their \nconfirmations.\n  I, again, urge Senate Republicans to reconsider their strategy and \nallow prompt consideration of all 18 judicial nominees awaiting Senate \nconsideration, not just William Conley of Wisconsin but also the \nfollowing nominees: Jane Stranch of Tennessee, nominated to the Sixth \nCircuit; Judge Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania, nominated to the Third \nCircuit; Judge Denny Chin of New York, nominated to the Second Circuit; \nJustice Rogeriee Thompson of Rhode Island, nominated to the First \nCircuit; Judge James Wynn of North Carolina, nominated to the Fourth \nCircuit; Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina, nominated to the Fourth \nCircuit; Judge Edward Chen, nominated to the Northern District of \nCalifornia; and Justice Louis Butler, nominated to the Western District \nof Wisconsin; Nancy Freudenthal, nominated to the District of Wyoming; \nDenzil Marshall, nominated to the Eastern District of Arkansas; Benita \nPearson, nominated to the Northern District of Ohio; Timothy Black, \nnominated to the Southern District of Ohio; Gloria M. Navarro, \nnominated to the District of Nevada; Audrey G. Fleissig, nominated to \nthe Eastern District of Missouri; Lucy H. Koh, nominated to the \nNorthern District of California; Jon E. DeGuilio, nominated to the \nNorthern District of Indiana; and Tanya Walton Pratt, nominated to the \nSouthern District of Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is speaking after me?\n  Mr. BURRIS. Yes, after the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3388\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I rise to speak on H.R. 4213. One \namendment has already been dropped. I do plan to submit a second \namendment. This amendment is dealing with the Recovery Act funds.\n  During my three terms as State comptroller of Illinois, I worked very \nhard to maintain accountability for the money we spent from our State. \nI have been contacted by my State officials, the various auditors, \ncomptrollers, and treasurers, to say the stimulus money that is coming \ninto the States is coming in and they have no funds to do all this \ntransparency and accountability. I put an amendment on this bill to say \nthat we should. I filed amendment No. 3388 which addresses currently \nunderfunding the costs of tracking and reporting the stimulus money.\n  This measure would set aside up to one half of 1 percent of all \nexisting stimulus funds and allow States and local governments to use \nthis administrative expense reserve to distribute and track this money \nas it is received and spent. It would allow the American people to hold \ntheir representatives accountable and it would help ensure that every \ndollar is targeted effectively and spent wisely, without waste, fraud, \nor abuse.\n  Agreeing to this amendment will restore oversight to this process and \nwill keep Americans on the road to economic recovery without incurring \na dime of new spending.\n  In addition to restoring accountability, I believe we need to take an \nactive role--as my second amendment would do, which I have not dropped \nyet; it is coming, though. It would deal with small businesses. I \nbelieve we should take an active role in supporting small and minority \nbusinesses because Main Street will be the engine of the American \neconomic recovery. That is where jobs will be created. That is where \nthe rubber meets the road--where we can turn this crisis around. That \nis why I am proud to offer another amendment which will require the \nTransportation Security Administration, the TSA, to award contracts to \nsmall businesses and disadvantaged businesses wherever and whenever \npossible. This amendment would ensure compliance with existing \nstandards of government contracts and subcontracts and would keep \ndollars flowing into real communities rather than to the corporate \ntreasuries.\n  By strengthening reporting standards and forcing participation goals \nfor TSA projects, we can target Federal spending to the capable worker \nwho has always been at the center of the American economic prosperity.\n  We are also saying we need these two amendments. They will strengthen \nand improve upon the key provisions of our jobs bill as well. I ask my \nfriends in this Chamber to join me in renewing our commitment to \ntransparency, honesty, and accountability. I ask them to stand for \nsmall businesses and minority subcontractors so we can make sure Main \nStreet has a major share of our ongoing economic recovery.\n  The issue is the amendment to H.R. 4213 which would be the amendment \nNo. 3388, and also the other amendment I am getting ready to drop which \nwill deal with small and minority businesses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to go over, for the sake of the \nrecord and also for those people who may be listening and may be \nreading this dialog, where we stand relative to the health care debate. \nI think it is important for people to understand what has happened. \nThere has been a lot of talk about a lot of different things, with \nreconciliation, the term ``reconciliation'' taking a front row seat.\n  What is happening here essentially is this. The House of \nRepresentatives is going to have to make a decision whether they want \nto pass the bill that passed here in the Senate. Remember, the bill \nthat passed here in the Senate was a bill that was produced and \ndelivered to the Senate on a Saturday afternoon, for all intents and \npurposes--the core of the bill, the managers' amendment. No amendments \nwere allowed after that Saturday afternoon and a final vote was taken 3 \ndays later on Christmas Eve.\n  It was a bill that expanded the size of the government by $2.5 \ntrillion, when fully implemented. It was a bill that reduced Medicare \nby $1 trillion when fully implemented and was scored at $500 billion in \nthe first 10-year tranche, by $1 trillion when fully implemented, and \ntook those savings from Medicare, from Medicare recipients, and used \nthem to fund a brandnew entitlement which had nothing to do with \nMedicare, it didn't involve the people who receive Medicare, and to \nextend dramatically an already existing entitlement called Medicaid.\n  It was a bill that basically said to small employers we are going to \nmake it so darned expensive for you to keep the insurance you presently \ngive to your employees that a lot of you are going to decide to throw \nup your hands, stop insuring your employees and send your employees \ndown the street to something called an exchange. It was a bill that \nbasically set up a structure\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\nwhich would manage, in a very micromanaged way, the delivery of health \ncare in this country from a top-down situation so essentially it put a \nbureaucrat between you and your doctor and you and your hospital.\n  It was a bill which was going to create so much new spending and grow \nthe Government so much that we would now have, after this bill is fully \nimplemented, the largest government, as a percentage of our gross \nnational product, we have ever had at any time when we have not been \nengaged in a world war. Think about that. That bill takes the size of \nour government and grows it from its historic level, which is about 20 \npercent of GDP, up to around 25, 26, 27 percent of GDP when it is fully \nimplemented. Most of that, although allegedly paid for--those paid-fors \nwill never come to fruition because we know this Congress doesn't have \nthe courage to stand up and raise taxes at those levels or cut spending \nat those levels. So most of that, in my opinion--and granted, this \nwasn't CBO's score because they had to take the statements as though \nCongress would do something such as cut Medicare by $1 trillion--most \nof those pay-fors would not come to fruition and therefore this would \nfall on the deficit and become debt our children would have to pay off.\n  In addition, it did nothing, absolutely nothing, about reducing the \ncost of health care in this country. In fact--again according to CBO--\nthe cost of health care went straight up under this bill. A lot of \nAmericans, also under this bill, would still not be insured because the \nestimate was 24 million, I believe, would still have no insurance, even \nafter we had spent $2.5 trillion.\n  So this bill, in my opinion, was and is and remains a disaster from a \nfiscal standpoint, because it will so massively expand the size of the \nFederal Government and throw those costs onto our children's backs in \nthe form of debt; and from a health care standpoint, because it will \nundermine, in my opinion, the delivery of health care. But more \nimportant, it doesn't do anything substantively to bend the outyear \nhealth care costs.\n  So now this bill, this giant bill on health care, this asteroid \nheaded toward Earth, is sitting in the House of Representatives. They \ndo not have the votes to pass it. Why? Because the American people have \nspoken. They spoke when they elected Scott Brown in Massachusetts, they \nhave spoken in polls across the country, and they have spoken in town \nmeetings. They have spoken in letters to Senators and e-mails to \nSenators and House Members.\n  They are upset. They know this is bad policy. They know we cannot \nafford it, and they know we should not do it. So there are a lot of \nHouse Members who are a little queasy about voting for this bill. So \nwhat does the administration come up with and the House leadership, \nSpeaker Pelosi? They have come up with this sidecar to this huge bill, \nand this sidecar is called reconciliation. It is a littler bill.\n  What is the purpose of this bill? The purpose of this bill is to go \naround to the different constituencies in the House, the different \nliberal constituencies in the House, ask them what they need to get \ntheir vote for the big bill, and then put it in this little bill. It is \na purchasing process. It is a going-out-and-buying-votes process done \nbehind closed doors, as this bill was.\n  This bill was designed in a back room. The big bill was designed in a \nback room. This is a back room, behind the back room, behind a hidden \ndoor, where they are negotiating with all of these folks: What do I \nneed to do to get you to vote for this big bill, which nobody wants?\n  Someone says: Well, you have to spend more money, so they put in \nsomething that spends more money, or you have to raise taxes on \nsomebody, so they put in a tax increase, or you have to change the \nbenefit structure, so they change the benefit structure. They put all \nof these little changes, which are fairly significant but are nothing \ncompared to the bigger bill, in this smaller bill called \nreconciliation.\n  Why did they choose that bill called reconciliation to do this--or \nwhy will they? Because under the Senate rules anything that comes \nacross the floor of the Senate requires 60 votes to pass. It is called \nthe filibuster. That is the way the Senate was structured.\n  The Senate was structured to be the place where bills which rushed \nthrough the House because they do not have rules that limit--they do \nhave a lot of rules that limit debate and allow people to pass bills \nquickly, but they do not have any rule called the filibuster which \nallows people to slow things down.\n  Bills can rush through the House, and they come over here. Sometimes \nthey are pretty bad ideas, and the Founding Fathers realized when they \nstructured this government they wanted checks and balances. They do not \nwant things being rushed through. They had seen the parliamentary \nsystem. They knew it did not work.\n  So they set up the Senate as the place, as George Washington \ndescribed it, where you take the hot coffee out of the cup and you pour \nit into the saucer and you let it cool a little bit and make people \nlook at it and make sure it is done correctly. So that is why we have \nthe 60-vote situation over here to require that things that pass the \nSenate get thoughtful consideration.\n  Unfortunately, it was totally ignored--the 60 votes were not because \n60 votes were used to override thoughtful consideration. But when the \nbig bill was passed, it was done in a way that basically limited the \nability of the Senate to debate it and to amend it.\n  But now they know they cannot go through that route again because \nthey know there is no longer 60 votes on the other side of the aisle \nwith the election of Senator Brown, who was elected, in large part, \nbecause of people's outrage over what happened when they basically \ntried to jam the Senate, or did jam the Senate procedure, and did not \nallow amendments, did not allow a debate on the biggest piece of social \npolicy and fiscal legislation in history--in my experience, in the \nhistory of my experience in the Congress, the big bill.\n  When they jammed us, jammed that thing through here on Christmas Eve, \nthe American people got outraged. Senator Brown made that point. As a \nresult, people agreed with him in Massachusetts, and they elected him. \nSo there are no longer 60 votes on that side of the aisle. They cannot \nuse that railroad approach. So they decided to go back to an arcane \nSenate procedure called reconciliation and use that approach.\n  Under reconciliation, which is a Senate process, that is the only \nbill around here, the budget and reconciliation, that has the right to \npass with 51 votes and a time limit on debate, and basically a time \nlimit on debatable amendments, although not on amendments generally.\n  So this reconciliation is a hybrid vehicle in the Senate. And what is \nit? Well, reconciliation was structured so that when a budget passed \nthe Senate, there would be a way for the Budget Committee to say to the \ncommittees that were supposed to adjust spending or adjust taxes in a \nway to meet the budget that they had to do it. So if your budget was \ncoming out $10, $20, or $30 billion over where it was supposed to be, \nthe reconciliation structure would say: Change the law to bring it back \nto where it is supposed to be.\n  It has been used around here on numerous occasions. I think 19 times \nreconciliation has been used since the Budget Act instituted \nreconciliation in 1976. But it has always been used for the purposes of \nadjusting issues which either, A, were bipartisan, or, B, were pretty \nmuch purely issues of adjusting numbers, numbers on the tax side, \nnumbers on the spending side.\n  So of the 19 times that reconciliation has been used, every time \nexcept two times, reconciliation has been a bipartisan bill. Twice it \nwas not bipartisan. Twice it was run through here on a partisan vote: \nonce on the tax increases that President Clinton passed, and once on a \nreconciliation bill dealing with adjusting spending. I believe it was \nin 1985; otherwise, there has always been a bipartisan vote for the \nbill. So 89 percent of the time it has been bipartisan. It has always \nbeen, when it has been partisan, used for the purpose of making these \nnumbers adjustments, not for the purpose of creating massive new policy \nthat affects every American in very personal ways in the way they deal \nwith their doctors and their hospitals and their health care treatment.\n  It was never conceived as a concept where the real legislation \ninvolving substantive issues of policies would be done. Tax rate \nadjustments have occurred under it. Absolutely. But when\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\nyou move tax rates from 39 to 35 percent, as the Bush tax cuts did, or \ntax capital gains from 20--I think they went from 25 percent to 15 \npercent--that is not a complex issue. That is just, you know, taxes are \neither going to go up or go down. It takes about 100 pages of actual \nlegislative language. Everybody knows the issue. It is an up-or-down \nvote. Pretty clear.\n  In fact, in these instances, there were opposing positions presented, \nand in those issues, there was actually more than one--people of both \nparties voted for them. That is not like passing an entire rewrite of \nthe health care system of America.\n  The health care system is 17 percent of our economy, one of the most \ncomplex issues we have to deal with. You pull a string over here, and a \nstring 10,000 miles away is affected. It is just a matrix of \nexceptionally complicated interrelated issues with all sorts of policy \nlanguage that is necessary.\n  So reconciliation was never conceived of, and its purpose was never \nto take on big policy like that. Big policy is supposed to be taken on \nthe floor of the Senate in an open procedure where there is debate and \nthere is amendments, and the amendments are debatable.\n  So reconciliation is certainly not the appropriate vehicle to use. \nBut I think the point I am trying to make is that reconciliation is not \nthe real game. I mean, after the House of Representatives--after they \nhave gone around with this reconciliation bill and they bought up the \nvotes they need and said to these people: Well, we will just fix that \nin reconciliation if you will just vote for the big bill--after that \nhas happened and the big bill has passed, this $2.5 trillion \nmonstrosity in spending and government dominance of the health care \nsector, after that is passed, the game is over. That is the law. I do \nnot think there will be much incentive at all for the White House or my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to take up reconciliation. \nThere certainly will not be any energy needed to pass it.\n\n  Because this big bill, which America basically rejects--every poll in \nAmerica says it has a maximum of about 25 percent approval of that bill \nand somewhere around 60 to 70 percent disapproval, at different levels, \n``strongly'' or ``fairly strongly''--that bill will have become law, \nand basically what we will have done, or what will have occurred, then, \nis we will have created a government program that is so large and so \nburdensome that it is very unlikely that this country will be able to \npay for it. As we move into the outyears, our children are going to get \nthese bills. In order to pay those bills, they are either going to have \nto have a massive event of inflation to pay for them or a massive tax \nincrease. Either one of those events, of course, undermine the quality \nof life and the standard of living of the next generation.\n  In addition, of course, we are going to get a health care system \nwhich has become basically a ward of the government, for all intents \nand purposes, for the bureaucracy that is very dominant and that makes \nit very difficult for citizens to have the choices they need to develop \na health care delivery system that is tailored to their needs.\n  A lot of small businesses will just simply give up on the idea of \nsupplying health care. We also know, of course, that the health care \nprices will not come down but will continue to go up. So this is a \nreally dangerous time. It is a time when the House of Representatives \nhas to take a hard look at what actions it is going to take, obviously, \nand I am sure they will.\n  But they have to recognize that voting for that big bill and hoping \nthat the Senate will bail them out with a little bill--well, I would \ntake a second look at that. First, it will be hard to run a \nreconciliation bill across this floor and have it end up with the way \nit started out because of all of the points of order that will be \navailable against it.\n  But, secondly, I am not sure there will be all that much energy to do \nit to begin with because once you pass the big bill, those who want to \nessentially dramatically expand our government, and in the end \nnationalize the health care system with a single-payer approach, will \nbe well on their road to accomplishing those things.\n  There is not going to be a whole lot of energy to do much else. So I \nthink it is important to understand that as much as reconciliation is \nan interesting and entertaining point of topic for discussion around \nhere as to whether it is appropriate and whether--which I do not think \nit is under this type of scenario--and whether the reconciliation bill \nwill actually survive the challenging on this floor from points of \norder, that is an interesting issue too.\n  That is not the question. The question is, is reconciliation even \nrelevant once the big bill passes? I think it is probably not. So if I \nwere a House Member depending on reconciliation, looking to that bill \nas the way that I am going to justify voting for this bigger bill, \nwhich is such a disaster, I would think twice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                          Recovery Act success\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, it has been just over a year since I \ntook office and since President Obama was sworn in. I think it is a \ngood time and appropriate to reflect on just how far we have come. A \nyear ago, the Presiding Officer and I came into office in the midst of \nthe worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n  We had been spiraling deeper and deeper into recession for over a \nyear. Almost three-quarters of a million jobs were lost in the month of \nJanuary 2009 alone. Our credit markets were frozen, major edifices of \nour economic landscape had collapsed or were tottering on the brink, \nfrom Lehman Brothers to General Motors. Alarms were still ringing. \nEmergency policies were thrown in to the breach, things were bad, and \nthere was no way to know how much worse they were going to get. We were \non the precipice.\n  We could have fallen into the abyss, if not for the extraordinary \nactions we took. Those actions saved us from another full-blown \ndepression. We are still not out of the woods, of course. Although we \nhave had some good news recently, too many families, too many \ncommunities have been hit hard by job losses and falling home values. \nBut we are nevertheless beginning to see evidence that we are finally \nturning the corner as a nation. While things are still not good, they \nare no longer getting worse and, in some areas, we have actually seen \nreal improvement. I wish to share with my colleagues some of that \nevidence.\n  Here I have a chart showing the Dow Jones industrial average since \nOctober 2008. We all know it is not always the best indicator of \neconomic health, but since the downturn was precipitated by turmoil in \nour financial markets, I will start with this.\n  As you can see, the market bottomed out just weeks after the Recovery \nAct was enacted, and it has been climbing ever since. The chart clearly \nshows we stopped the free-fall, we stabilized the market, and we are \nallowing it to grow again.\n  Here is another chart showing the Purchasing Managers Index. This is \na survey of purchasing managers who report whether business conditions \nare better than, the same as or worse than the previous month. A score \nof 50 means no change, so anything over that should mean the economy is \nexpanding. Anything below indicates the economy is shrinking. In this \nchart, it is clear business confidence plummeted in the fall of 2008. \nOnly four times in the postwar period has this index fallen so low and \nnever in the last quarter century. We can see it was not until March of \nlast year, right after the Recovery Act took effect, that manufacturing \nconfidence began to return. With other data, we know this occurred as \nbusinesses began rebuilding inventories, confident they had weathered \nthe cash crisis of the winter.\n  This next chart shows our GDP growth over the last 3 years, from the \nbeginning of 2007 to the end of last year, the last date for which we \nhave good data. I have added a smoothing line to show the trajectory \nour economy has taken. As you can see, in 2008, the bottom fell out. It \nwasn't until last spring that we began to restore order. I will not \npretend 6.3 percent growth for one quarter is good enough for me. \nWithout jobs, it isn't. But it is clearly better than what was \nhappening 12 months ago.\n  My last two charts, which address jobs, tell the most important tale. \nWe know from past experience that job growth lags behind economic \nrecovery. This chart shows how long that took in\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\nprevious postwar recessions. In every single postwar recession, jobs \nhave lagged the economic recovery, whether it is 1 month in July 1908 \nor 22 months in November 2001 and everything in between.\n  There is a reason for this. Businesses need to use up their existing \ncapacity, and they need to feel confident in the economic climate \nbefore they start expanding again. This process can be especially \npainful following a financial collapse, where businesses and households \nare forced to pare down their savings and reduce their spending. By \ndoing that, they tamp down economic recovery, reduce spending, and that \nis why jobs have been slower to return than anyone would like. Also \nremember, if you are running a company and you have laid off people, \nthat is a very traumatic experience. You don't want to do that again. \nThe worst situation of all is to start hiring people back and then have \nto lay them off again. Businesspeople, especially those who care, don't \nwant to hire people back until they are sure they can offer them a job \nthey can keep. Can you imagine putting somebody through this twice?\n  It is important to remember this lag. Economists suggest we may be \naround 8 months into economic recovery, and the jobs are coming. We are \n8 months into economic recovery, and the jobs are coming. While the \nrecord of recent recoveries is a sobering one, the last chart I have \nshows the beginning of our good news. With announcements over recent \nweeks, we have seen that unemployment is stabilized and may even be \nturning around. We have staunched the bleeding. All those charts show \nthings started picking up right after we passed the stimulus bill.\n  That is not the only thing we did. There were extraordinary efforts \nto stabilize the financial sector through direct assistance and low \ninterest rates. But passage of the Recovery Act marked the beginning of \nthe turnaround. That is indisputable, looking at the data. Passage of \nthe Recovery Act marked the beginning of the economic turnaround. We \ncannot be satisfied until we have all our jobs back, until our economy \nis working for everyone. But one thing we know for sure is that without \nthe Recovery Act, we would be a lot worse off.\n  I wish to stress, this will not be a smooth path back to a healthy \neconomy. There will be good days and bad days, good news and bad news. \nBut these indicators show we have turned the corner, thanks in no small \nway to Recovery Act money that is still going out. Nationally, nearly 2 \nmillion jobs have been saved or created by activities funded by the \nRecovery Act. This is not something I alone am claiming. Economic \nexperts from Moody's, CBO, Macroeconomic Advisers and more are telling \nthe same story. But that is not all the Recovery Act has done. It has \nalso given a helping hand to millions of Americans out of work by \nexpanding and extending unemployment insurance. Meanwhile, 95 percent \nof working Americans benefited from tax relief. Under the Recovery Act, \n95 percent of all working Americans benefited from the tax relief.\n  State and local governments received badly needed fiscal relief that \nallowed them to maintain essential services, including health coverage \nfor millions of Americans, and retain workers which kept cops on the \nbeat and teachers in the classroom. We will never know how bad the \neconomy would have been if we had not acted. That is the nature of \nthings. But the charts I have shown all tell the very same story, of an \neconomic free-fall that has been slowed, stopped, and reversed.\n  Do any of my colleagues believe we would be in a better situation \ntoday without the Recovery Act? The timeline is clear. The data are \nclear. The Recovery Act is what brought the economy back.\n  The challenge we faced 1 year ago was a roughly $2 trillion hole in \nthe economy. Consumer spending, fully two-thirds of the whole economy, \nwas in free-fall. Failing to plug the gap would have continued the \nfree-fall or, just as badly, condemned us to a lost decade similar to \nwhat Japan saw in the 1990s. During 1990s, the Japanese did not come \nback with a major effort such as the Recovery Act, and they had GDP \nlevel for a decade. You can imagine what that did to revenues, their \ndeficit, and their jobs. That is what we would have been condemned \nwith, if we had not gone with the Recovery Act.\n  Let's tell the truth about how we got here. It is absolutely \nessential to remember what the situation was 1 year ago when the \nadministration came into office, not to go back and go over things that \nhappened in the past but to make sure we don't do it again and to \nunderstand what caused this recession. The circumstances we inherited \nat the end of 8 years of the prior administration were the worst we \nhave seen in generations. When the Bush administration came to office \nin 2001, the Federal budget was not only balanced, it was in surplus, \nin surplus to the tune of $236 billion, the largest surplus in half a \ncentury. Remember that. That was not that long ago. We were actually \ndebating how quickly we were going to be free of debt as a country. We \nwere on a path to financial independence, able to save for retirement \nof the baby boom generation, able to set aside something for a rainy \nday. That was only 10 years ago.\n  Tragically, that inheritance was squandered. Instead of a surplus of \n$710 billion that was projected in 2001 for last fiscal year, 2009, we \nwound up with a $1.6 trillion deficit. I hear my friends on the other \nside talk about deficits. This $1.6 trillion deficit didn't just \ndevelop. It came out of the policies of the last 8 years.\n  Two major factors account for the bulk of this reversal of fortune. \nFirst were the economic and budget policies of the last administration \nwhich gave no thought to paying for tax cuts or spending increases. We \njust had a debate about paying for the $10 billion for an employment \nextension. But we actually passed tax cuts, Medicare, other things that \nwere never paid for that were hundreds of billions of dollars, not $10 \nbillion, hundreds of billions. Tax cuts primarily for the wealthy and \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan together accounted for more than $500 \nbillion of the 2009 deficit and $7.1 trillion over the next decade and \nnone of it was paid for.\n\n  Second, we had the regulatory failures which permitted, even \nencouraged, the financial excesses that brought our markets down. They \nnot only permitted it; they encouraged it. There was a feeling you \ndidn't have to do any kind of regulation, only self-regulation. Alan \nGreenspan himself said he was dismayed self-regulation didn't work. \nThat financial collapse battered our economy, reducing revenues and \nincreasing necessary spending on unemployment insurance, food stamps, \nand other support programs. Here we are on the floor debating \nunemployment insurance, food stamps, and other support programs, when \nin the previous administration, when Congress was controlled by the \nother side, they didn't talk about these issues that cost over $7.1 \ntrillion. They were not funded. There was no funding for the Medicare \nprescription drug program. There was no funding for the tax cuts. It is \ntrue the budget for next year will not be as close to balance as we all \nwould wish, but I believe that is because of the hand we were dealt.\n  The best way to bring the budget back into order over the long run is \nto grow our economy. This is something everybody in this building \nbelieves in. Our inheritance from the previous administration was tax \ncuts, overwhelmingly tilted toward those who were already well off, \nunfunded new entitlement programs, and two wars paid for with borrowed \nmoney. All these transformed our country's finances, leading us down \nthe path to where we are now, potentially on the brink of fiscal ruin. \nInstead of saving for the future, we are borrowing billions from China, \nJapan and other countries and falling deeper into debt.\n  There are two kinds of deficits, and we have not done a good job \nexplaining this. Economists will agree. There is the deficit you create \nin good times by profligate spending and tax cuts. That is one kind of \ndeficit. When the economy is going well, you should be building \nsurpluses. However, once you are in the hole, you have to get out of \nthe hole, and that is a different kind of deficit. For that kind of \ndeficit, you need to get the economy moving again because growth is the \nonly way you are going to get out of the hole.\n  President Bush inherited a balanced budget, a vast fiscal surplus \nprojected at the time to be $5.6 trillion over 10 years. Instead, he \nleft office having added nearly $5 trillion to the national\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\ndebt. That is a swing of $10 trillion. That means the Bush years cost \nroughly $30,000 for each and every American. I hear people from the \nother side talk about the deficit. This was a $10 trillion swing \nstarting just 10 years ago and going up 2 years ago. What amnesia. Take \na look at what happened. What I am telling you are the facts. We can \nargue about policy but, in fact, we were in surplus and had a projected \n$5.6 trillion surplus when President Clinton left office. We ended up \nwith a swing of $10 trillion, adding $5 trillion to the national debt. \nThose are facts. Senator Moynihan from New York used to say everybody \nis entitled to their opinion but not to the facts. The facts are, there \nwas a $5.6 trillion projected surplus when President Bush took office, \nand we are left with a $5 trillion deficit. That adds up to $10 \ntrillion. In fact, it adds up to $10.6 trillion.\n  I think those of us who supported the Recovery Act need to own up to \nour own mistake: We have done a lousy job of explaining why the \nRecovery Act was needed and how it is working. We are doing a good job \nexplaining the Web sites, but we have not done the macroeconomic \nexplanation of why you cannot have jobs come back until the economy \ncomes back. You cannot have the economy come back without having the \nRecovery Act.\n  To start with, I will say I know it increases the deficit in the \nshort term. I don't like it, but that was an unavoidable byproduct. The \nbest long-term solution to our debt problems is not a little frugality \nthat cuts down on growth. It is a robust, healthy, growing economy. \nThat is why most economists believe--when I say ``most,'' I should say \nthe vast majority--that in spite of the short-run deficit hit of the \nRecovery Act, it will bring us closer to fiscal balance over the long \nterm.\n  I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will take \nissue with this statement. I would simply remind them it is economic \ngrowth--something they have talked about for years--and economic growth \nalone, that will get us out of our present mess.\n  There is another mistake we made. As we were diligently working to \nensure accountability for the program--and we have done a great job of \nthat; and that is important--and connected specific parts of the \nRecovery Act to specific jobs created, we have missed the forest for \nthe trees in our explanation. We have lost track of the real objective: \nto jump-start the broader economy. That is where the jobs are going to \ncome from--the main jobs.\n  While the Recovery Act itself has created or saved 2 million jobs--\nindependent analysis confirms this--perhaps its most important impact \nhas been the renewed confidence it has given to our economy. I \nabsolutely totally, completely believe that. The jobs will come. The \njobs will come. They always lag behind the economy. When the economy \ngoes up, the jobs are not far behind.\n  The charts do not lie. We are rebounding. By returning faith to our \nconsumer economy, the Recovery Act has had a much greater effect than \nthe sum of its parts. To those who opposed the Recovery Act, I ask: \nWhat was your plan? Some said--and I presided and listened to the \narguments--we should fill a $2 trillion hole in our economy with $200 \nbillion. That was a plan doomed to failure. That is what the Japanese \ndid, and they were faced with a decade of no growth.\n  Economists far and wide said that a $200 billion Recovery Act would \nhave failed to halt a fall into depression. No reputable economists--\nnone--said this would have taken us from where we were--where we were a \nyear ago, with 730,000 jobs being lost--to a 6-percent growth in gross \ndomestic product for the fourth quarter of last year.\n  We have come a long way in this past year. We have not come far \nenough yet. We have a long way to go. But I believe to move forward we \nmust remember how bad things were when we began, just how deep a hole \nwe were in, and we are pulling ourselves out of it now. The Recovery \nAct has done its job and will continue to do its job.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3354 To Amendment No. 3336\n\n     (Purpose: To encourage energy efficiency and conservation and \n    development of renewable energy sources for housing, commercial \nstructures, and other buildings, and to create sustainable communities)\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside \nthe pending amendment and call up amendment No. 3354, and at the \nconclusion of my remarks that amendment No. 3354 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  My amendment, cosponsored by Senators Schumer, Bingaman, and Merkley, \nwould authorize a series of new programs designed to encourage energy \nefficiency in homes. I am offering this amendment--based on S. 1379, \nthe Energy Efficiency in Housing Act--to the job creation bill we are \ndebating today because of the enormous potential of green housing to \ngrow the economy, create jobs, and, of course, save energy.\n  Clean energy is the next big global industry. According to the U.S. \nGreen Building Council, buildings account for 39 percent of all energy \nconsumption and 38 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. Clearly, the \nhousing sector must be a vital part of our energy efficiency efforts.\n  Venture capitalists and companies from Google to General Electric \nhave testified before the Senate that this revolution--the clean energy \nrevolution--could be even bigger than the digital revolution. The \ncountries at the forefront of this clean energy revolution will be the \neconomic powerhouses of the next century. Right now, the United States \nis at risk of falling behind in the race to lead this new economy.\n  Of the top 10 solar companies in the world, only one is from the \nUnited States. Of the top 10 wind power companies in the world, only \ntwo are from the United States.\n  When President Obama met with Senate Democrats a few weeks ago, he \ntold us:\n\n       China is not waiting, it is moving. Already the \n     anticipation is that they will lap us when it comes to clean \n     energy.\n\n  Well, we can do better than that. We are a country of innovators, a \nnation that has always sought to be on the cutting edge, always sought \nthe new frontier. All we need is for the Congress to put the right \npolicies in place to promote energy efficiency and encourage the growth \nof the green economy so our companies can compete head to head with \ntheir international competition.\n  My amendment is endorsed by over 35 groups, including Enterprise \nCommunity Partners, the Alliance for Healthy Homes, and the Local \nInitiatives Support Corporation. The U.S. Green Building Council has \nincluded it in its list of ``Top 10 Pieces of Green Building \nLegislation in the 111th Congress.''\n  These groups know that the provisions included in this legislation \nwill boost the green housing sector in a number of different ways.\n  First, it would jump-start the market for green mortgages by \ndirecting HUD to develop incentives for buyers--such as reduced rates \nand greater lending ability--and by boosting the secondary green \nmortgage market.\n  Second, it would establish a revolving loan fund for States to carry \nout renewable energy activities, such as retrofits and incentives for \ngreen construction. It would also encourage the participation of \ncommunity development organizations in our most hard-hit neighborhoods \nin the recession by authorizing a grant program that can be used to \nhelp those organizations train, educate, and support the workforce for \nthese green energy, clean energy projects.\n  The final provision I will highlight would provide incentives for \npublic housing entities to achieve substantial improvements in their \nown energy efficiency. I believe we can maximize energy efficiency \nsavings when we can split the incentives between landlords and tenants. \nThe landlords will take an interest in pursuing the clean energy \ninitiatives because of the savings they can make from the upgrades, and \nthe tenants can participate in the savings through their conservation \nefforts. It has to be joint to be at its most effective.\n  As we continue to debate ways to put Americans back to work, I \nencourage my colleagues to take a serious look at the green housing \nsector and at my amendment. I think it merits our attention. I hope it \nwill have my colleagues' support on an appropriate bill\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\nin the near future--I hope--and I speak on it today to put a spotlight \non it so I have that opportunity.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, my colleagues and I have spent much of \nlast year debating the issue of health care reform. After nearly a \ncentury of false starts and broken promises, Democrats came to Congress \ndetermined to enact comprehensive reform. We were confident that this \ntime we would not fall short as our predecessors had done; this time we \nwould deliver the changes the American people have been demanding for \nso many years. But over the course of the debate an unfortunate pattern \nemerged, a pattern of obstructionism and delay and scare tactics \ndesigned to derail our efforts to make a difference.\n  My Democratic colleagues and I worked hard under President Obama's \nleadership to craft sweeping legislation, but our Republican friends \nwere not interested in passing health care reform. They had no desire \nto take action and no plan of their own. Instead, they found every \nopportunity to stall, to clog up the Senate, and score political points \nby attacking those who supported our efforts. They spread \nmisinformation about death panels and higher costs and rationing \ncoverage even though they knew these things were not in our bill. But \nthey kept repeating this bad information and repeating it until it \nfinally started to take hold.\n  The ordinary folk who heard these distortions had no reason to \nbelieve their elected officials would try to misinform them, so they \nretained this bad information and they did exactly what our Republican \nfriends wanted them to do--they got angry. They held rallies. They \ncalled their Senators and Representatives. They regurgitated the \ntalking points that had been written for them by obstructionists and \nspecial interests and the insurance lobby.\n  As a result, our Republican friends succeeded in holding up our \nhealth reform bill. By misinforming the American people, they stirred \nup an opposition that was tailor made to create confusion and gridlock \nno matter how hard some people tried to explain the truth because the \nfacts are these.\n  No Democratic health care proposal has ever included a so-called \n``death panel.''\n  None of our legislation would result in rationing of any kind.\n  And, rather than driving costs up, as my Republican friends have \nargued, nonpartisan analysis consistently shows that the Senate bill \nwould lower costs significantly.\n  It would reduce the deficit by more than $130 billion in the first 10 \nyears, and almost $1 trillion in the decades after that.\n  In addition, our bill would extend health coverage to 31 million \nAmericans.\n  It would prevent corporations from discriminating against their \ncustomers because of pre-existing conditions.\n  And it would reduce health premiums for individuals and families, to \nthe tune of hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars per year, depending \non income level.\n  From the very beginning of this debate, I have called for a bill that \nfulfills the three goals of a public option:\n  A bill that creates competition in the insurance market. A bill that \ngives us the tools to hold insurance companies accountable. A bill that \nwill provide cost savings to millions of Americans.\n  I believe our current proposal can accomplish all of these things. \nThis legislation is not perfect, but it represents\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\na major step in the right direction. So I would urge my Republican \nfriends to thoroughly examine the legislation we have introduced. And I \nwould ask that they fulfill the public trust that has been placed in \nthem, by being honest with the American people. By building their \narguments on facts, not misinformation, and offering constructive \nsuggestions rather than partisan talking points.\n  We all agree that our health care system is badly broken. And we owe \nit to everyone in this country to have a vigorous national debate about \nhow to fix it.\n  In spite of the obstructionism and the delays that we have seen from \nthe other side over the last year, I remain confident that my \ncolleagues and I can pass a comprehensive health reform bill in the \ncoming weeks. We have come further than any Congress in history. So it \nis time to finish the job. In light of recent developments, I think it \nis more likely than ever that our efforts will be successful.\n  Just last week, President Obama invited a group of Republicans and \nDemocrats to join him for an open conversation about health care \nreform. Millions of Americans watched on TV as leaders from the House, \nthe Senate, and the executive branch laid out their respective ideas \nfor reform.\n  Yes, we heard some partisan talking points from a few on the other \nside. But for the most part, both Republicans and Democrats seemed \neager to engage in a real conversation. They challenged each other's \nideas. They debunked some of the myths that have taken hold over the \npast year. In the end, I think we discovered that we share more common \nground than many people thought.\n  So it is time to move forward. President Obama has announced that he \nis open to four specific Republican ideas that emerged from last week's \nhealth care summit. I share the President's support for these \nproposals, which include eliminating waste and fraud, funding \ndemonstration grants, increasing Medicaid doctor reimbursements, and \nexpanding health savings accounts. I hope that my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle will give these ideas a hard look, so we can \nincorporate them into our existing legislation. And I hope that my \nRepublican friends will recognize that, while our current bill is not \nperfect, it contains a number of things they can strongly support.\n  So let us end the obstructionism and the delays. Let's stop spreading \nmisinformation, and continue the conversation that emerged from the \nPresident's health care summit. And once we have a final bill that \nincorporates some of these suggestions, let us have an up or down vote.\n  The American people are tired of hearing excuses. They are tired of \nwatching some members of this chamber manipulate the rules to prevent \nus from taking action. That is not how this Senate is supposed to work. \nSo, whether my colleagues support or oppose the final legislation, I \nhope they will have the courage to let it come to a vote, rather than \nhiding behind the threat of filibuster.\n  This debate has been going on for a year. And the American people \nhave been calling for comprehensive reform for almost a century. So I \nthink it is high time to move forward together. Let's get this done. \nLet's do it right. Let's do it now.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris).

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of reconciliation to consider changes in \n                               Medicare)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PROTECTING MEDICARE.\n\n       Section 310(g) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 \n     U.S.C. 641(g)) is amended by inserting before the period the \n     following: ``or to the medicare program established by title \n     XVIII of such Act''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the President of the United States and the \nmajority in both Houses have now signaled that regardless of how \nclearly the American people oppose the pending legislation concerning \nhealth care in America, it will be attempted to be forced down their \nthroats under the parliamentary process that is intended\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\nfor our Nation's budgetary matters, whether they want it or not.\n  This amendment that is pending would remove our important Medicare \nProgram from the partisan procedural process known as budget \nreconciliation. We must protect the Medicare Program from being used as \na piggybank to create the new health care entitlement proposed by \nSenator Reid and President Obama. In addition to increasing taxes by \n$500 billion, the health care ``reform'' bill cuts $500 billion from \nMedicare to put the government in charge of a new $2.3 trillion health \ncare entitlement that we can't afford.\n  My constituents in Arizona and Americans across the country know the \npartisan games that are being played here, and they are opposed to it. \nOur entitlement programs should not be the subject of reconciliation. \nIn 1974, the Budget Act excluded Social Security from the 51-vote \nreconciliation process. That was intentional, by one of the major \narchitects, Robert Byrd, one of the most revered Members of the Senate, \nwho has also said that health care reform should not be the subject of \nreconciliation. That makes sense, because if you exclude Social \nSecurity because it is an entitlement program, then, obviously, \nMedicare should also be excluded. We have a crisis with our entitlement \nprograms and they need to be reformed, but they shouldn't be subject to \na 51-vote majority.\n  This amendment removes the Medicare Program from the reconciliation \nprocess. Medicare reforms need to be made, and this amendment doesn't \naffect that, but what the amendment says is that reforms to the \nMedicare Program should be treated differently just as the Social \nSecurity program is. A program as important as Medicare should not be \ncut or increased through a partisan 51-vote process. Something this \nimportant should be held to a higher standard and include bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the view of then-Senator Obama in 2007 \nwhen we were considering the ``nuclear option.'' He said at that time:\n\n       You've got to break out of what I call, sort of, the 50-\n     plus-one pattern of presidential politics. Maybe you eke out \n     a victory of 50-plus-one, then you can't govern. You know, \n     you get Air Force One, I mean there are a lot of nice perks, \n     but you can't deliver on health care. We're not going to pass \n     universal health care with a 50-plus-one strategy.\n\n  On the use of reconciliation, then-Senator Obama went even further \nand said:\n\n       You know, the Founders designed this system, as frustrating \n     [as] it is, to make sure that there's a broad consensus \n     before the country moves forward . . . And what we have now \n     is a President who--\n\n  he was obviously referring to then-President Bush--\n\n       . . . [h]hasn't gotten his way. And that is now prompting, \n     you know, a change in the Senate rules that really I think \n     would change the character of the Senate forever . . . And \n     what I worry about would be you essentially still have two \n     chambers--the House and the Senate--but you have simply \n     majoritarian absolute power on either side, and that's just \n     not what the founders intended.\n\n  I have been around this body for quite a while. Back a few years ago, \nwhen this side was in the majority and there was a movement toward the \n``nuclear option''--in other words, 51 votes to confirm judges--I stood \nup as a member of the majority and said we should not erode the 60-vote \nmajority rule that has prevailed here in the Senate for many years. At \nthat time, that was not greeted on this side of the aisle, frankly, \nwith approval by a lot of people. But what we did then was preserve the \nSenate tradition and process of 60 votes, and we should maintain that \nnow.\n  Certainly, having been in the majority and in the minority, I \nunderstand the frustrations of the majority. But I think history will \nshow there have been numerous occasions where the requirement for a 60-\nvote majority has prevented the Congress of the United States from \nacting at the will of the moment or the fancy or the issue; that when \ntime passes and cooler heads prevail, the 60-vote majority prevented \nthe Congress from acting in a way that would have been harmful to the \nUnited States of America and its citizens.\n  All of my other colleagues have also commented on this issue at \ndifferent times, depending on whether they are in the majority or the \nminority. But I wish to point out again a fundamental fact of the way \nthe Congress of the United States has done business in general, and the \nway the Senate of the United States has done business. We have never \nhad in our history a major reform, whether it be the Civil Rights Act \nor whether it be the passage of Medicare, whether it be welfare reform \nor any other major reform made without a majority, and a significant \nmajority, that was bipartisan in nature. That doesn't mean there was \n100 percent, but there has always been, whenever major structural \nreforms have been made, a consensus that was a significant majority on \nboth sides.\n  So as we have time after time on this floor, we will be coming to the \nfloor every day, my colleagues and I, to urge the majority and the \nPresident of the United States to start over and sit down and work \ntogether.\n  Overwhelming majorities of the American people believe we should \neither stop or start over. Overwhelming majorities of the American \npeople want us to reform the system. But they do not like this unsavory \nprocess of vote buying, and they certainly do not like the product.\n  We will continue to carry the message to our constituents and to the \nAmerican people. I believe there is still sufficient time for the will \nof the American people to prevail.\n  Mr. President, the hour is late. I appreciate the patience of the \nChair and his willingness to serve in the chair at this late hour, 7 \no'clock at night. I appreciate him being here at this time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on my \namendment No. 3416, Senator Voinovich be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to let my colleagues know that we \nhave worked in a bipartisan way on the underlying amendment, and we \nworked in a bipartisan way to see how we could make these modifications \nto bring $30 million of additional savings to the overall bill.\n  I look forward to working to complete this bill. I think we have a \ngreat opportunity to create jobs and to look to the future to how we \ncan put our economy back on track in this country and put people back \nto work with some of the great ideas and great opportunities that exist \nin the underlying bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to resolve a dispute that arose \non the floor earlier this morning.\n  There were differing opinions on whether the Senate-passed health \ncare reform bill cuts taxes or raises taxes.\n  During the month-long floor debate on health care reform--ending with \na final vote on Christmas Eve--I took to the floor on five occasions to \naddress this question.\n  Let me top-line it for my Senate colleagues and my friends in the \nmedia.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, only about 7 percent of \nAmericans would actually receive the government subsidy for health \ninsurance under the Senate-passed health care reform bill.\n  The remaining 93 percent of Americans would not be eligible for a tax \nbenefit under the bill.\n  How can a person receive a tax cut if they do not receive a tax \nbenefit?\n  Here is another powerful statistic that every policymaker needs to \nknow: While only about 7 percent of Americans under $200,000 would \nactually receive the subsidy for health insurance, 25 percent of \nAmericans under $200,000 would see their taxes go up.\n  This is even after taking into account the government subsidy.\n  This means that for every one middle class family that would receive \nthe government subsidy, three middle class families would pay higher \ntaxes.\n  Again, this is all according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the \nnonpartisan experts.\n  Now, let's get to specifics. JCT tells us that in 2019 a little more \nthan 13 million individuals, families, and single parents would receive \nthe government subsidy for health insurance.\n  JCT also tells us that the total number of tax filers in 2019 would \nbe 176 million.\n  That means that out of 176 million individuals, families, and single \nparents only 13 million of them would receive a government subsidy for \nhealth insurance.\n  That is only about 7 percent of tax filers.\n  Let me repeat that. Only about 7 percent of Americans will benefit \nfrom the subsidy for health insurance.\n  I have a pie chart here so my friends can see.\n  You can see here, out of 176 million tax returns, around 13 million \nof them get the government subsidy for health insurance.\n  This means that 163 million individuals, families, and single parents \nor 93 percent of all tax returns receive no tax benefit under the Reid \nbill.\n  So what does this mean?\n  It means that there is a small beneficiary class under the Reid \nbill--about 7 percent of Americans.\n  And a very large nonbeneficiary class--93 percent of Americans.\n  Is this nonbeneficiary class affected in other ways?\n  Yes. While one group of Americans in this class would be unaffected--\nanother group of Americans will see their taxes go up.\n  And this group won't have a tax benefit to offset their new tax \nliability.\n  That means that these Americans will be worse off under the Reid \nbill. What happened to their ``net tax cut''?\n  What they will see instead is a net tax increase.\n  JCT data backs up this claim.\n  Specifically, based on JCT data, in 2019, 42 million individuals, \nfamilies, and single parents with income under $200,000 will see their \ntaxes go up.\n  This is even after taking into account the subsidy for health \ninsurance.\n  Again, this is on a net basis.\n  Now, if we were to identify (1) those Americans who are not eligible \nto receive the tax credit and (2) those whose taxes go up before they \nsee some type of tax reduction from the subsidy, this number climbs to \n73 million.\n  I have a chart here that illustrates this: The first bar illustrates \nwhat we have already established, but looks at Americans earning less \nthan $200,000. Here, 13 million individuals, families, and single \nparents would receive the subsidy.\n  The middle bar shows the net tax increase number of 42 million \nAmericans under $200,000.\n  Finally, when we identify those Americans who get no benefit under \nthe bill--and those Americans who see a tax increase--we find there are \n73 million individuals, families, and single parents under $200,000 in \nthis category.\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\n  I want to close by referring to a final chart that illustrates the \nwinners and losers under the Reid bill.\n  What we see here is that there is a group of Americans who clearly \nbenefit under the bill from the government subsidy for health \ninsurance.\n  This group, however, is relatively small--about 7 percent of \nAmericans.\n  There is another much larger group of Americans who are seeing their \ntaxes go up. This group is not benefiting from the government subsidy.\n  Also, there is another group of taxpayers who are generally \nunaffected.\n  But, JCT tells us that this group may be affected by other tax \nincreases like the cap on FSAs or the individual mandate penalty tax.\n  The bottom-line is this. My Democratic friends (1) cannot say that \nall taxpayers receive a tax cut and (2) cannot say that the Reid bill \ndoes not raise taxes on middle-income Americans.\n  JCT tells us differently.\n  No one can dispute the data.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Reiners\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of SSG John A. Reiners. Sergeant \nReiners, a member of the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th \nInfantry Division at Fort Carson, CO, died on February 13, 2010. \nSergeant Reiners was serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom \nin Kandahar, Afghanistan, when he was killed by an improvised explosive \ndevice that detonated while he was on patrol. He was 24 years old.\n  A native of Lakeland, FL, Sergeant Reiners and his family moved to \nFort Carson in 2009 when he was assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. \nSergeant Reiners joined the Army in July 2004. He served bravely during \ntwo tours in Iraq, before being deployed to Afghanistan in November of \nlast year.\n  During 5\\1/2\\ years of service, Sergeant Reiners distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to \ntake on any challenge--no matter how dangerous. Commanders recognized \nhis extraordinary bravery and talent, bestowing on Sergeant Reiners \nnumerous awards and medals, including the Purple Heart, the Army \nCommendation Medal, two Army Achievement Medals, the Army Good Conduct \nMedal, and the National Defense Service Medal. He also attended Ranger \nSchool in 2007, where he earned the prestigious Ranger Tab.\n  Sergeant Reiners worked on the front lines of battle, patrolling the \nmost dangerous areas of Zhari district in Kandahar. He is remembered by \nthose who knew him as a consummate professional with an unending \ncommitment to excellence. His friends recall Sergeant Reiners saying \nthat Army boot camp was too easy. Most of all, they remember his \ndevotion to his wife, his son, and his country.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Sergeant \nReiners' service was in keeping with this sentiment--by selflessly \nputting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived without \nfear.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was \nuncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Sergeant Reiners will forever be remembered as one of our \ncountry's bravest.\n  To Sergeant Reiners' mother Ronna, his father Gregory, his wife \nCasey, his son Lex, and all his friends and family--I cannot imagine \nthe sorrow you must be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your \nloss will be eased by your pride in John's service and by your \nknowledge that his country will never forget him. We are humbled by his \nservice and his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1164-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1164-S1165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LAS VEGAS ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the beginning \nof an exciting chapter for the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce. For \nmore than 20 years, this group of entrepreneurial southern Nevadans has \nworked together to provide resources\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\nand promote economic growth in the Asian community. Today, they will \ninstall the first woman to be president of their esteemed organization. \nVida Chan Lin steps into this role--respected by her peers and \nenergized by her passion for furthering the goals of the Las Vegas \nAsian Chamber of Commerce.\n  While this leadership role is a new opportunity for Ms. Lin, her \nlifetime of experience has prepared her to take on this role. As a \nchild, she was exposed to running a business as she saw firsthand the \ndaily challenges and joys in the restaurants her family owned. She then \nfound great satisfaction in the insurance industry where she continued \nto exceed expectations and eventually start her own company.\n  Ms. Lin has always balanced her business drive and success with her \ncommitment to community service. She has been an instrumental force \nbehind the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce for many years. Her \nability to bring people together, develop innovative programming, and \nmentor young leaders has helped ensure the long-term success of the \nAsian Chamber well beyond just her tenure.\n  She has been recognized by countless organizations for her business \nacumen and her heartfelt commitment to public service. I am proud to \ncongratulate Vida Lin on this special day, and I wish her great success \nin the coming term of her presidency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1165-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  49TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

I commend them for \ntheir efforts on our nation's behalf, and I am pleased to recognize the \nPeace Corps and all those who help the organization help others in \nAmerica's name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1165-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GEORGE WIDMAN\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I offer my congratulations \nand warm regards to George Widman, the ``Candy Man'' of Grand Forks, on \nthe momentous occasion of his 90th birthday.\n  Throughout his life, George Widman has been an example of what it \nmeans to be a great North Dakotan and a great American. Growing up in \nthe Great Depression taught George the value of hard work, something he \nhas never forgotten. To this day, George and his wife Betty work 6 days \na week at Widman's Candy Store in downtown Grand Forks.\n  George demonstrated his lifelong patriotism through his service in \nWorld War II. During that war, he served as a naval A1C aviation \nmechanic on the USS Bunker Hill aircraft carrier from 1942 until it was \nhit by kamikazes in 1945. The ship suffered the loss of 346 men, but, \nmiraculously, George survived.\n  After the war, George returned home to work in the family business. \nSixty years later, Widman's Candy Store is best known for its \nChippers--Red River Valley potato chips covered in delicious Red River \nValley chocolate. They are truly a treat. They have become famous not \nonly in North Dakota but in Washington, DC, with fans at the White \nHouse, in the office of the Vice President, at the Pentagon, and here \nin the Senate.\n  To me, the story that best defines George and Betty is how they \nresponded to the 1997 flood that devastated the city of Grand Forks. \nAfter their store was destroyed by the floodwaters that took out most \nof Grand Forks, George offered Betty the opportunity to rebuild \nanywhere in the world. They chose Grand Forks.\n  Ten years ago, George said his secret to longevity was ``lots of \ncandy.'' Today, it is my pleasure and honor to wish George a wonderful \n90th birthday. He is representative of the best of North Dakota, and he \nhas my respect and admiration. I can never forget George's birthday, \nbecause it is my birthday too. Happy 90th, George, and here's to many \nmore! \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1165-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DORIS THOM\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am very pleased to \nrecognize the accomplishments of Doris Thom, a Wisconsinite from my \nhometown of Janesville who has blazed a trail for women's rights, and \nshown a tremendous commitment to public service, throughout her 90 \nyears. I have known Doris for many years, and I greatly admire the many \ncontributions she has made to Janesville. She is a good friend who has \nshown outstanding leadership in her community. I am also grateful for \nthe excellent work of her granddaughter Sara Thom-Agress, who worked in \nmy Washington, DC, office.\n  Doris's life story is one of great determination and outstanding \nachievement. Working at Gilman Engineering in Janesville during World \nWar II, she received the U.S. Army and Navy ``E'' for Excellence Award \nfor her work to produce emergency landing gear for fighter planes, and \nserved as the first woman on the Executive Committee for Machinists \nLocal 1266.\n  Her life has been a series of firsts for women in Janesville, \nparticularly during her years at the General Motors' Fisher Body Plant. \nThere she served as the first woman committee member of United Auto \nWorkers Local 95, and then the first woman to sit on the executive \nboard of Local 95. She also opened doors for women at the plant when \nshe filed a successful grievance after being denied a transfer from a \ntraditionally female line at the plant to an all-male one. Her \ngrievance resulted in all of the plant's jobs being open to women for \nthe first time.\n  All the while, as Doris was breaking new ground for women in \nJanesville, she was raising a family and making countless other \ncontributions to her community and her state. Among many other \nactivities, Doris served on the Wisconsin Governor's Commission on the \nStatus of Women from 1971 to 1975.\n  I am very pleased to recognize Doris's many achievements, and send \nher my warmest wishes as she celebrates her 90th birthday. I thank her \nfor everything she has done for our shared hometown, and for women in \nWisconsin and nationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1165-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1165-S1166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nthank the director of the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs and \nmembers of his staff for attending to the medical needs of MAJ James E. \nGibson.\n  Back in January of this year, I received a letter from Mrs. Barbara-\nlea Gibson Wright of Bull Shoals, AR. Barbara wrote to me, soliciting \nhelp in extending her sincere gratitude to the Arkansas Department of \nVeterans Affairs for tending to the medical needs of her father with \nunfailing diligence until his unfortunate passing. Major Gibson was \nwounded in Omaha Beach back in 1944, and passed away at the age of 90 \nin 2009. Although he lost the use of his right arm, Army doctors and \nnurses brought him back from the brink of death on multiple occasions. \nMajor Gibson eventually retired and was able to live a long and \nprosperous life with his wife and children thanks to the superior \nmedical attention he\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\nreceived from the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  In fiscal year 2009, there were more than 3 million Americans \nreceiving VA disability compensation, with 41,000 of them receiving \nservice in the State of Arkansas. The VA works tirelessly to address \nthe needs of the American public, whether through times of peace, times \nof war, or times of grief.\n  It is important that we recognize the accomplishments and extend our \nsincere thanks to the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs for not \nonly a job well done, but for the men and women in desperate need of \ngreat service so evidently shown for Major Gibson. They make the State \nof Arkansas proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1166-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO STEVE COLE AND FRANK ADAMS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

He replaces retiring \nChancellor Frank Adams, both of whom have dedicated their careers to \ninspiring and training students to become our next generation of \nArkansas leaders.\n  Cossatot Community College is a pillar of the communities it serves. \nWith campuses in DeQueen, Ashdown and Nashville, the college serves \nnearly 1,500 students in western Arkansas. The college offers technical \ncertificates in 7 programs, certificates of proficiency in 13 programs, \nand 5 associate's degree programs.\n  Both Representative Cole and Chancellor Adams have played an integral \nrole in the development and success of Cossatot Community College.\n  Since 2007, Representative Cole has served as vice chancellor and \ndean of academics. He has also served as a faculty member and \nadministrator for the past 13 years. Representative Cole is a dedicated \npublic servant in the Arkansas State Legislature, representing Howard \nand Sevier Counties.\n  Chancellor Adams will retire on June 30 after 18 years at Cossatot. \nHe led the college into the UA system in 2001 and spearheaded the \ndevelopment of satellite campuses in Ashdown and Nashville.\n  I salute Representative Cole and Chancellor Adams for their \nleadership, and for their efforts to inspire the next generation of \nleaders.

The Arkansas Agriculture Hall of Fame is \nsponsored by the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce and Arkansas Farm \nBureau.\n  This year's recipients are a distinguished group, comprised of \nArkansas leaders in beef cattle, conservation, crop production, and \nextension efforts.\n  Philip Alford Jr. of Lewisville, Lafayette County, is a founding \nmember of the Arkansas Cattlemen's Association. He introduced stocker \ncattle grazing operations and, by organizing drainage districts, helped \nconvert thousands of acres of nonproductive bottomland into productive \ncrop and pasture land.\n  Devoe Bollinger of Horatio, Sevier County, led the effort to \neradicate brucellosis from cattle herds in the State. Bollinger's \ncareer has been devoted to improving the image of the cattle rancher. \nHe served three terms on the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission, \ntwo of those as chairman.\n  Mark Bryles of Blytheville, Mississippi County, led a significant \nincrease of cotton acreage while serving as an extension agent in \nMississippi County. His career as an agent with the University of \nArkansas Division of Agriculture Cooperative Extension Service spanned \n35 years, 22 of those in Mississippi County.

He spent 24 years on the Arkansas Farm Bureau \nboard of directors, 17 of those as vice president.\n  Leonard Sitzer of Weiner, Poinsett County, developed one of the most \nsuccessful rice farming operations in northeast Arkansas.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor a Maine small \nbusiness that has patriotically devoted itself to giving members of our \nNation's military a relaxing surprise by providing Maine soldiers home \nfrom the warfront with a comforting night's stay in the picturesque \nwestern Maine town of Paris. Opened by Janice and Glenn Davis in 1999, \nthe King's Hill Inn is a beautiful Victorian inn surrounded by scenic \nmountains and lakes in historic and peaceful Oxford County. And for \nMaine soldiers who have just returned from a theater of war, the King's \nHill Inn simply promises ``. . . the best, quietest night's sleep with \ntheir loved one, far from the cold battlefield.''\n  This historic inn got its start in 1998 when Janice and Glenn Davis \nbought and restored the farm property, which was the 1811 birthplace of \nHoratio King, who served as Postmaster General under President James \nBuchanan. The rural town of Paris, frequently known as the home of King \nand Hannibal Hamlin, President Abraham Lincoln's first Vice President \nand a prominent Maine political figure, is also recognized for its \npanoply of natural wonders, many of which are accessible from King's \nHill Inn. From the inn, guests can experience much of Maine's serene \nlandscape which includes the beautiful Oxford Hills region, the \nexciting Saco River, as well as area mines that celebrate Maine's gem \nand mineral concentrations. The inn offers guests six stunning suites, \neach with a unique and charming setting--perfect for a weekend getaway.\n  To give back to our Nation's bravest men and women who have served \noverseas, the King's Hill Inn offers a free overnight stay with a \ncomplimentary breakfast for each Maine soldier returning from the \nwarfront and his or her significant other. In addition, the Davises \noffer a 28-percent discount to ``all military personnel stationed \naround the world'' in honor of their 28-year-old son CAPT Aaron Davis, \na member of the U.S. Air Force who has served in Afghanistan. The \nDavises also work with various local business owners wishing to make \ndonations of their own to the soldiers spending the night at the King's \nHill Inn, including restaurants offering a free dinner and florists \nproviding beautiful floral arrangements.\n  After experiencing firsthand how difficult it was to part with her \nson when he was leaving to serve a year in the war in Afghanistan, \nJanice realized how such departures would be even more heartbreaking \nfor the spouses of active-duty military personnel. Her objective in \noffering this magnanimous promotion is to provide soldiers with ``. . . \nthat escape from the war front and that reunification with their spouse \nor loved one. My goal is that it will start a grassroots effort right \nhere in Western Maine that will spread all the way to California, where \nmy son is.''\n  The King's Hill Inn has truly offered a noble gift to our servicemen \nand women who have sacrificed so much for\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\nthe people of our great Nation. I am hopeful that this gracious \naltruism will be mirrored in the actions of other businesses, small and \nlarge, wishing to make a positive difference for some of the most \ndeserving members of our communities. I offer my sincerest thanks to \nthe the Davises for their compassionate and philanthropic support of \nour military personnel and offer my best wishes for the future success \nof King's Hill Inn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1167-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:54 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2968.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nprotect and restore the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Today, I introduced the Great Lakes Ecosystem Protection \nAct as co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force with Senator George \nVoinovich and several of our colleagues here in the Senate and in the \nHouse. This bill is important for our efforts to protect and restore \nthe Great Lakes now and for future generations. The Great Lakes are \nvital not only to Michigan but to the nation. Roughly \\1/10\\ of the \nU.S. population lives in the Great Lakes basin and depends daily on the \nlakes. The Great Lakes provide drinking water to 40 million people in \nthe U.S. and Canada. They provide the largest recreational resource for \ntheir 8 neighboring States. They form the largest body of freshwater in \nthe world, containing roughly 18 percent of the world's total. Only the \npolar ice caps contain more freshwater. They are critical for our \neconomy by helping move natural resources to the factory and to move \nproducts to market.\n  While the environmental protections that were put in place in the \nearly 1970s have helped the Great Lakes make strides toward recovery, a \n2003 GAO report made clear that there is much work still to do. That \nreport stated: ``Despite early success in improving conditions in the \nGreat Lakes Basin, significant environmental challenges remain, \nincluding increased threats from invasive species and cleanup of areas \ncontaminated with toxic substances that pose human health threats.'' \nMore recently, many scientists reported that the Great Lakes are \nexhibiting signs of stress due to a combination of sources, including \ntoxic contaminants, invasive species, nutrient loading, shoreline and \nupland land use changes, and hydrologic modifications. A 2005 report \nfrom a group of Great Lakes scientific experts states that ``historical \nsources of stress have combined with new ones to reach a tipping point, \nthe point at which ecosystem-level changes occur rapidly and \nunexpectedly, confounding the traditional relationships between sources \nof stress and the expected ecosystem response.''\n  Asian carp represents a massive threat and a number of important \nactions are required to deal with it. The zebra mussel, an aquatic \ninvasive species, caused $3 billion in economic damage to the Great \nLakes from 1993 to 2003. In 2000, 7 people died after pathogens entered \nthe Walkerton, Ontario drinking water supply from the lakes. In May of \n2004, more than 10 billion gallons of raw sewage and storm water were \ndumped into the Great Lakes. In that same year, more than 1,850 beach \nclosures in the Great Lakes. Each summer, Lake Erie develops a 6,300 \nsquare mile dead zone. There is no appreciable natural reproduction of \nlake trout in the lower four lakes. More than half of the Great Lakes \nregion's original wetlands have been lost, along with 60 percent of the \nnative forests. Wildlife habitat has been destroyed, diminishing \nopportunities necessary for fishing, hunting and other forms of outdoor \nrecreation.\n  These problems have been well known for several years, and this bill \nis an effort to address those problems. First, the bill authorizes the \nPresident's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a multi-agency effort, \nwhich provides the needed federal funds to federal programs as well as \nnon-federal partners through grants.\n  Building on past success, there are a number of programs that need to \nbe authorized and reauthorized in federal law. For instance, the bill \nauthorizes the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, established by \nExecutive Order in 2004, so that the many federal agencies operating in \nthe Great Lakes will coordinate with each other. Restoring the Great \nLakes involves many stakeholders including the Federal Government, \nstates, cities, tribes and others, and Congress needs to be sure that \nthe Federal agency efforts are in order.\n  The bill also reauthorizes and expands the Great Lakes Legacy program \nwhich has been extremely successful and has cleaned up about 900,000 \ncubic yards of contaminated sediments at Areas of Concern throughout \nthe Great Lakes. This is a partnership program which requires a non-\nfederal cost-share to address the legacy of contaminated sediment in \nour region. The Legacy program expires at the end of 2010.\n  The bill reauthorizes the EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office \nwhich has been and will continue to be a key to moving forward with \nGreat Lakes protection and restoration. This office has been the lead \nin renegotiating the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, implementing \nthe Great Lakes Legacy program, and implementing its own grant program.\n  Finally, the Great Lakes region needs a process for advising the EPA \nand other Federal agencies on Great Lakes matters. While there have \nbeen various advisory groups that have been pulled together over the \nyears, there has never been a standing advisory entity, and that has \nbeen a gap in the governance and management of the Great Lakes. This \nbill authorizes a new advisory group to provide expertise to the EPA on \ngoals and priorities for Great Lakes restoration and protection.\n  The Great Lakes are a unique American treasure. We are but their \ntemporary stewards. We must be good stewards by doing all we can to \nensure that the Federal Government meets its ongoing obligation to \nprotect and restore the Great Lakes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 3075. A bill to withdraw certain Federal land and interests in \nthat land from location, entry, and patent under\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\nthe mining laws and disposition under the mineral and geothermal \nleasing laws; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to talk about one of the most \nmagnificent, the most inspiring places on Earth, the Flathead region of \nMontana. The landscape in this area is so vast, so unique, it is hard \nto put into words. But let me feebly attempt to describe the aura of \ncolors you see as the Sun rises over the deep blue of Lake McDonald. \nWords cannot capture the joyful screams of families shooting down the \nMiddle Fork of the Flathead through rapids with names like ``Bone \nCrusher'' and ``Could be Trouble.''\n  Words cannot do justice to the awe that comes from almost touching \nMontana's legendary Big Sky at the top of Heavens Peak. The Flathead \nregion, there is nothing like it. It is the crown of the continent. It \nis God's country. It is Montana.\n  There is one particular area of this region that holds a special \nplace in my heart; that is, the North Fork of the Flathead River. When \nI was a freshman Member of the House of Representatives, I took a hike \nwith my friends, Jack Stanford and Ric Hauer, to the top of Mount \nHarding.\n  Mount Harding is a little ways from the Flathead River, but this hike \ncaptured the feelings I have for the area. Thirty-five years ago, I \nstill remember that hike, and I am not alone.\n  Similar to everyone who ventures into the Flathead, every Montanan, \nevery American, every Canadian, everyone who happens to be touched by \nthe beauty of this place could not help but be stunned by the beauty of \na place carved by glaciers a millennia ago and still untouched by \nmodern development.\n  That day on the Flathead, each of us knew we must do everything we \ncould to protect this one-of-a-kind landscape for our children and our \nchildren' children. I would say, at that time, 35 years ago as a Member \nof the House, very proudly enacted the first multiyear environmental \nimpact statement baseline study so we could assess what future impacts \nmight be in the area, whether it was Federal, State, private or from \nBritish Columbia, just north, whatever it might be, so we knew what we \nhad to do to protect the area.\n  That promise has not always been easy to keep. Back then, I was so \ndetermined to protect this area, I flew up to Toronto and met with a \nfellow named Ron Sadler. Rod Sadler was president of Sage Creek.\n  I was like a young lawyer, armed with tons of questions and \ndepositions, and kept asking him--I kept asking him all these \nquestions: What is your intention here? What is your intention there? \nThis is such a special place. He is like: Why are you asking me all \nthose questions?\n  I explained: This is so special, I am going to do everything I can to \nprotect it. The reason is because of the potential mining across the \nborder, the place where all the water and the pollution would flow \nsouth into the North Fork of the Flathead. All the environmental \ndegradation from that flowed south, but all the economic benefit would \nflow north. So, for me, I will not let this happen. I said to myself: I \nam going to protect this as much as I possibly can.\n\n  For decades, the Flathead has been threatened by mining proposals in \nBritish Columbia. Over the years, coal mining, coalbed methane \nextraction, and gold mining have all been successfully beaten back. It \nhas been a coordinated effort, one I am very proud to be a part of, to \nhelp protect the area. We have been working so hard.\n  Finally, the Premier of British Columbia made a historic decision. He \npersuaded his Parliament to pass a resolution to protect and prevent \nany mining development in the North Fork. He made that on the eve of \nthe Olympics. The Olympics--Mount Whistler and that part, the southern \npart of British Columbia, he made that decision just before the \nOlympics. I was overjoyed. I called him up, and I said: Mr. Premier, I \ncannot tell you how happy I am that you have done this. It means so \nmuch to Montanans, and we will do our part too.\n  That is when I told him my plan. My plan, the legislation Senator \nTester and I introduced today, will ban future mining, oil and gas, and \ncoalbed methane development on the American side of the border; that \nis, in the Flathead National Forest, a portion of the North Fork \nwatershed which is over 90 percent federally owned. Senator Tester and \nI have also pledged to work to retire the existing leases to protect \nthis area once and for all.\n  Many folks know about a book written by Norman McLean. Norman McLean \nwrote a story about Montana entitled ``A River Runs Through It.'' \nThough McLean's story focuses on another Montana river, the Blackfoot, \nalso very special, I think the final line from his book resonantes here \nas well. This is what McLean wrote:\n\n       Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs \n     through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood, and \n     runs over rocks from the basement of time. . . . I am haunted \n     by waters.\n\n  I am very proud to be here today to introduce the North Fork \nWatershed Protect Act and ask my colleagues to join me in preserving \nthese waters and the land that surrounds them so that every generation \nacross the country, across the world, has the privilege of being so \nhaunted by Montana's waters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \n        Reed, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 3078. A bill to provide for the establishment of a Health \nInsurance Rate Authority to establish limits on premium rating, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \ncreate a Health Insurance Rate Authority and rate review process to \nprotect American consumers from unfair health insurance rate increases.\n  This legislation is based on an amendment I filed during the health \nreform debate. While it was not included in the reform legislation that \npassed the Senate, I strongly believe consumers need additional \nprotections from insurance company abuses now.\n  I am pleased that President Obama has included it in his health \nreform proposal, and I look forward to continuing to work with the \nadministration to see that this bill becomes law.\n  This bill ensures that all American consumers are protected by a rate \nreview process, not just those in states with aggressive laws.\n  This legislation requires companies to submit justifications for \nunreasonable increases in premiums, using a process that will be \nestablished by the Secretary, in conjunction with States.\n  The bill gives the Secretary of HHS authority to deny or modify \npremium increases or other rate increases, like deductibles, that are \nfound to be unjustified. State Insurance Commissioners will retain this \npower in states in which they have sufficient authority and capability.\n  To help the Secretary with this process, the legislation establishes \na Health Insurance Rate Authority as an advisory body for all the \nSecretary's rate review responsibilities.\n  Health insurance companies continue to demonstrate their willingness \nto slap consumers with astronomical increases in their health insurance \nrates.\n  Anthem Blue Cross has notified thousands of Californians that they \nwill face rate increases of as much as 39 percent. Meanwhile, \nWellPoint, the corporate parent of Anthem Blue Cross, earned a $4.7 \nbillion profit in 2009.\n  I find this unbelievable. Imagine the typical family, or individual, \ntrying to find the money to pay 39 percent more for health care \ncoverage. Especially during these difficult economic times, with so \nmuch uncertainty. Meanwhile, the health insurance company is doing \nbetter than ever.\n  I would like to share a few of the letters and comments I have \nreceived from Californians that vividly describe what these increases \nmean to them.\n  Arthur Hirsch, 63, and his wife Eileen have had Blue Cross for 30 \nyears. They live in Laguna Beach and own a small business. They \nrecently received notice that their monthly premiums would increase \nfrom $787 per month to $1,035 per month. Arthur said he was told that \nhe could raise his annual deductible to $5,000 or higher to keep the \npremium increases down. But he said he fears he is stuck with the \npolicy. He said: ``I can't leave my assets and my family uncovered. If \nsomething happens . . . well that's what insurance is about.''\n  A Monterey, CA couple recently found out their premiums with Anthem\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\nBlue Cross will increase 36 percent--from $734 a month to $998 a month. \nThey own an antique print business. The economy has hurt sales--their \n2008 gross household income was $42,000, and they don't expect their \nincome will increase much in 2009 or 2010. More than 25 percent of \ntheir household income goes toward premiums--far more than their \nmortgage. They are wondering if they should go into debt, use the \nequity in their home or withdraw money from their retirement accounts \nto pay for the rate hikes. Because of pre-existing conditions, the \nwoman is a breast cancer survivor, they don't believe they can get a \nmore affordable policy elsewhere.\n  A family of four from Pacific Palisades, California, has a $5,000 per \nperson deductible. They pay $917 per month premiums for the family--\n$11,000 per year. Their insurance plus out of pocket expenses were more \nthan 25 percent of the family's gross income for each of the past 2 \nyears and no member of the family ever satisfied the deductible. They \njust received notice that their premium will go up 38 percent, to \n$1,263 per month. Anthem offered this family another deal: increase \npremium payments just 10 percent to $1,011 a month if the family agrees \nto an increased deductible of $7,500 per person. The father in the \nfamily hasn't had a checkup in 6 years. He's 56 years old.\n  This is not how our system should function.\n  In some States, insurance commissioners have the authority to review \nhealth insurance rates and increases, and block the rates that are \nfound to be unjustified. According to a 2008 Families USA report, 33 \nStates have some form of a prior approval process for premium \nincreases.\n  The same report describes several notable successes among states that \nuse this process, including: Regulators in North Dakota were able to \nreduce 37 percent of the proposed rate increases filed by insurers.\n  Maryland used their State laws to block a 46 percent premium increase \nafter a company charged artificially low rates for 2 years. The \ndecision was upheld in court.\n  New Hampshire regulators were able to reduce a proposed 100 percent \nrate increase to 12.5 percent.\n  But in other States, including California, insurance commissioners do \nnot have this ability. Instead, my State's insurance commissioner has \nhad to ask Anthem/Blue Cross to delay its proposed increase in \npremiums. He has no authority to order this delay.\n  Some States have laws like this on the books, but do not have \nsufficient resources to review all the rate changes that insurance \ncompanies propose.\n  Consumers deserve full protection from unfair rate increases, no \nmatter where they live.\n  This legislation ensures that all Americans have some level of basic \nprotection. The bill is based in part on a provision included in the \nSenate's version of health reform legislation, which required insurance \ncompanies to submit justifications and explain increases in premiums. \nThey must submit these justifications to the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, and they must make these justifications available on \ntheir website.\n  The bill asks the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to \nproduce a report, detailing the rate review laws and capabilities in \nall 50 States. The Secretary of HHS will then use these findings to \ndetermine which States have the authority and capability to undertake \nsufficient rate reviews to protect consumers.\n  In States where Insurance Commissioners have authority to review \nrates, they will continue to do so.\n  In States without sufficient authority or resources, the Secretary of \nHHS will review rates, and take any appropriate action to deny unfair \nrequests.\n  This could mean blocking unjustified rate increases, or requiring \nrebates, if an unfair increase is already in effect.\n  This will provide all American consumers with another layer of \nprotection from an unfair premium increase.\n  The amendment would also require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to establish a Health Insurance Rate Authority as part of the \nprocess in the bill that enables her to monitor premium costs.\n  The Rate Authority would advise the Secretary on insurance rate \nreview and would be composed of seven officials that represent the full \nscope of the health care system including: at least two consumers; at \nleast one medical professional; and one representative of the medical \ninsurance industry.\n  The remaining members would be experts in health economics, actuarial \nscience, or other sectors of the health care system.\n  The Rate Authority will also issue an annual report, providing \nAmerican consumers with basic information about how insurance companies \nare behaving in the market. It will examine premium increases by State, \nas well as medical loss ratios, reserves and solvency of companies, and \nother relevant behaviors.\n  This data will give consumers better information, enabling them to \nmake better choices and avoid purchasing plans from companies that do \nnot provide them the best value for their dollar.\n  This concern about premium increases stems from the fact that we are \nthe only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit \nmedical insurance industry to provide basic health care. I believe, \nfundamentally, that all medical insurance should be not for profit.\n  The industry is focused on profits, not patients. It is heavily \nconcentrated, leaving consumers with few alternatives when their \npremiums do increase.\n  As of 2007, just two carriers--WellPoint and UnitedHealth Group--had \ngained control of 36 percent of the national market for commercial \nhealth insurance.\n  Since 1998, there have been more than 400 mergers of health insurance \ncompanies, as larger carriers have purchased, absorbed, and enveloped \nsmaller competitors.\n  In 2004 and 2005 alone, this industry had 28 mergers, valued at more \nthan $53 billion. That is more merger activity in health insurance than \nin the 8 previous years combined.\n  Today, according to a study by the American Medical Association, more \nthan 94 percent of American health insurance markets are highly \nconcentrated, as characterized by U.S. Department of Justice \nguidelines. This means these companies could raise premiums or reduce \nbenefits with little fear that consumers will end their contracts and \nmove to a more competitive carrier.\n  In my State of California just two companies, WellPoint and Kaiser \nPermanente, control more than 58 percent of the market. In Los Angeles, \nthe top two carriers controlled 62 percent of the market as of 2008.\n  Record levels of market concentration have helped generate a record \nlevel of profit increases.\n  Between 2000 and 2007, profits at 10 of the largest publicly-traded \nhealth insurance companies soared 428 percent--from $2.4 billion in \n2000 to $12.9 billion in 2007.\n  The CEOs at these companies took in record earnings. In 2007, these \n10 CEOs made a combined $118.6 million.\n  The CEO of CIGNA took home $25.8 million.\n  The CEO of Aetna took home $23 million.\n  The CEO of UnitedHealth took home $13.2 million and the CEO of \nWellPoint took home $9.1 million.\n  Even last year, a time of enormous economic distress for average \nAmericans, was a good year for the health insurance industry. According \nto Health Care for America Now!, the 5 largest health insurers--\nWellPoint, United Health, Humana, Cigna, Aetna--saw profits increase 56 \npercent from 2008 to 2009, from $7.7 billion to $12.1 billion. Only \nAetna saw their profits decrease.\n  Yet we see insurance companies like Anthem/Blue Cross, owned by Well \nPoint, increasing consumer premiums.\n  Frankly, I would go further than this legislation if I could: I \nbelieve the health insurance industry should be non-profit. There is no \nreason that any company or shareholder should make a penny off of basic \nhealth care coverage for our citizens.\n  But we do have a system that heavily relies on for-profit insurance \ncompanies. Regardless of the outcome of the broader debate on health \ncare reform, that is unlikely to change.\n  So this bill becomes very necessary. Premiums are increasing every \nday, and people in many states have no recourse, and no way to know if \na particular increase is unfair.\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\n  This cannot continue. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3078\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to assist in the creation of new jobs by providing \nfinancial incentives for owners of commercial buildings and multifamily \nresidential buildings to retrofit their buildings with energy efficient \nbuilding equipment and materials and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp create jobs and lower energy bills for businesses and multi-family \nresidences. This bill would create a program called Building Star, \ndesigned to promote energy-saving commercial building renovations \nthrough rebates and low-cost financing options.\n  I believe, as do many of my colleagues, that energy efficiency should \nbe a central component of our national energy policy because energy \nefficiency creates jobs, reduces our dependence on foreign oil, and \nreduces the pollution of our air and water. Central to the program we \nare proposing today is its ability to help businesses afford the up-\nfront costs of energy-efficient renovations by helping state and local \nprograms offer low-interest loans that can be paid back through savings \non energy bills.\n  As we take action to put Americans back to work, we need to set our \nsights on programs that provide the biggest bang for our buck in terms \nof immediate job creation and set our economy up for future growth. \nClean energy is not only the next great growth industry, but it's an \nengine for job creation today. Energy-efficiency programs like Building \nStar will put Americans to work in construction and manufacturing and \nsave small businesses money as we strive for American energy \nindependence.\n  I would like to thank Senator Pryor for his leadership on this bill \nas well as Senators Stabenow, Brown, and Sanders in joining the push \nfor a common-sense idea that can create jobs right away and pave the \nway for future growth in America's clean energy industry.\n  I would also like to recognize Senator Warner's great leadership in \ndeveloping Home Star, a parallel program that offers energy-efficiency \nassistance to homeowners. I am proud to stand with my forward-thinking \ncolleagues, Senator Bingaman and Senator Sanders in supporting Home \nStar and I look forward to continued discussions about how we can \nmaximize the economic benefits of these valuable programs.\n  I would like to focus for a moment on the immediate positive impact \nthat Building Star will have on our economy.\n  Building Star would begin creating jobs immediately and is projected \nto create as many as 150,000 jobs in some of the economy's hardest-hit \nsectors including construction, manufacturing, and distribution over \nthe next 2 years.\n  Building Star will stimulate new jobs in the 55,000 construction and \nmanufacturing firms that deal in building, mechanical and low-slope \nroof insulation, windows, and window films. Eighty-six percent of these \nfirms are small businesses employing less than 20 people.\n  Building Star will maximize Federal investment by leveraging $2 to $3 \nin private investment for every Federal dollar spent, making it an \nexcellent model for a public-private partnership and maximizing \nresource efficacy.\n  In addition, Building Star is expected to save building owners more \nthan $3 billion annually on their energy bills by reducing enough peak \nelectricity demand to avoid the need for 33 300-Megawatt power plants.\n  It will also reduce the pollution that contributes to climate change \nby 21 million metric tons each year, or the equivalent of nearly 4 \nmillion cars' emissions, according to the American Council for an \nEnergy-Efficient Economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the outstanding opportunity that \nenergy-efficiency renovations offer in putting Americans back to work, \nsaving money for our working families, and moving us toward energy \nindependence.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3079\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for judicial determination of injury in \ncertain cases involving dumped and subsidized merchandise imported into \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Unfair Foreign Competition Act of 2010. This legislation \nprovides a private right of action for domestic manufacturers injured \nby illegal subsidization and dumping of foreign products into U.S. \nmarkets. These anticompetitive, predatory trade practices steal jobs \nfrom our workers, profits from our companies, and growth from our \neconomy.\n  Job creation and job retention in this country depend in large part \non our ability to enforce existing trade laws. At a time when \nunemployment remains at nearly 10 percent and our economic future is at \nstake, it becomes even more important that we focus on trade priorities \nwhich too long have been sacrificed for foreign policy and defense \ninterests.\n  The latest trade numbers demonstrate that the U.S. trade deficit with \nChina in November 2009 was $20.2 billion. Over the years, imports from \nChina have exceeded our imports by a staggering $208.6 billion. This is \nnot evidence that American manufacturers cannot produce goods \nefficiently or compete with foreign markets; rather, it is evidence of \nunlawful behavior on the part of China. Such behavior is tantamount to \ninternational banditry, and it must not be tolerated.\n  In the current environment, I believe it is necessary for an injured \nindustry to have an opportunity to go into Federal court and seek \nenforcement of our country's trade laws.\n  My legislation addresses two specific types of illegal trade \npractices: dumping, which occurs when a foreign producer sells a \nproduct in the United States at a price that is below the producer's \nsales price in its home market or at a price which is lower than its \ncost of production, and subsidizing, which occurs when a foreign \ngovernment provides financial assistance to benefit the production, \nmanufacture, or exportation of a good.\n  Under current law, the International Trade Commission and the \nDepartment of Commerce conduct antidumping and countervailing duty \ninvestigations and 5-year reviews under title VII of the Tariff Act of \n1930. U.S. industries may petition the ITC and Commerce for relief from \ndumped and subsidized imports. If Commerce finds that an imported \nproduct is dumped or subsidized and the ITC finds that the petitioning \nindustry is materially injured or threatened with material injury, an \nantidumping duty order or countervailing duty order will be imposed to \noffset the dumping or subsidies.\n  Because current administrative remedies have not been consistently \nand effectively enforced, I am introducing private right of action \nlegislation to enforce the law. My legislation would allow petitioners \nto choose between the ITC and their local U.S. district court for the \ninjury determination phase of their investigation. Doing so gives \ninjured domestic producers the opportunity as private plaintiffs to \ncontrol the litigation in seeking enforcement of our trade laws. If \ninjury is found, U.S. Customs and Border Protection would then assess \nduties on future importation of the article in question. The legal \nstandard for determining dumping margins, established by the Commerce \nDepartment, would remain unchanged.\n  This legislation is similar to legislation I have introduced as far \nback as 1982 when I originally sought injunctive relief. But this bill \nhas been modified to comply with World Trade Organization rules.\n  In December 2004, the United States took action to comply with WTO \nrulings on the Antidumping Act of 1916 which provided a private cause \nof action and criminal penalties for dumping by prospectively repealing \nthe act. The United States also took action in February 2006 to comply \nwith WTO rulings on the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act which \nrequires the distribution of collected antidumping and countervailing \nduties to petitioners and interested parties in the underlying trade \nproceedings. In both cases, the WTO panel found that U.S. law allowed \nan impermissible specific action against dumping and subsidization.\n  The legislation I introduce today has been adapted to these changes \nin law and allows for a determination of injury in accordance with our \ninternational obligations. Aggressive policy measures, such as this \nlegislation, are necessary to prevent foreign producers--China in \nparticular--from causing a major crisis for our domestic producers.\n  In testimony before the ITC earlier this year, I noted that we have a \ncomplicated relationship with China. I was one of 15 Senators who \nopposed China's entrance into the WTO in 2000. With China's economy \nstill widely under state direction and characterized by dubious trade \npractices, I believed Chinese membership in the WTO would present a \nlikelihood of trade distortion and market disruption. And that is why I \nvoted against it in 2000.\n  Congress heeded some of the concerns which I and others expressed and \ninserted a China-specific safeguard provision under section 421 of the \nTrade Act. But such a safeguard is only as effective as the President's \nwillingness to enforce it. Seven petitions have been filed under \nsection 421 since its inception. Of these, the ITC has made an \naffirmative determination of injury in five cases. Yet only one \ndetermination, handed down in the most recent Chinese tires case, has \nbeen upheld by the President. Despite overwhelming evidence to support \nthe ITC's findings of\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\ninjury, President Bush rejected all four previous petitions for relief \non the ground that providing import relief was not in the economic \ninterest of the United States. Since President Bush's decision, \ncountless jobs in my State and across the country have been lost and \nthe trade deficit has widened. It is difficult to understand how \nproviding import relief was not in our economic interest.\n  President Obama's decision to uphold the ITC rulings in the Chinese \ntires case last year is a step in the right direction, but much more \nneeds to be done to ensure that domestic industries enjoy the \nprotection afforded to them by existing trade laws.\n  While it is my hope that this administration and future \nadministrations will evaluate trade remedies objectively in terms of \neconomic consequences, this act will provide a valuable tool for the \ndomestic industry. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in supporting this legislation.\n  The enforcement of trade laws should not be a partisan issue. To \nthose who decry our enforcement mechanisms as unabashedly \nprotectionist, let me be clear. I believe in free trade. International \ntrade and open markets are crucial to the economic prosperity of this \ncountry. But the essence of free trade is selling goods at a price \nequal to the cost of production and a reasonable profit. When one \ncountry engages in dumping or subsidization at the expense of other \ncountries, it is the antithesis of free trade.\n  Let me remind those who criticize our domestic safeguards that \nPresident Ronald Reagan, a staunch advocate of open markets, signed \ninto law agreements limiting the imports of autos and steel and pushed \nfor the Plaza Accord in 1985 which raised the value of the yen and made \nJapanese imports more expensive. President Reagan understood that free \ntrade did not mean wholly unfettered, unregulated trade. Free trade \ndoes not mean turning a blind eye to illegal and unsavory practices \ncommitted by our trading partners.\n  I have argued that enforcement of our trade laws is critical to \nensuring that our domestic manufacturers have a fair opportunity of \ncompeting with foreign producers. But even the most stringent \nenforcement will be insufficient to fully counter the effects of \nsubstandard labor, trade, and environmental practices, particularly \nthose practiced by China. The safeguard measures the United States \nnegotiated in advance of China's entry into the WTO were designed to \nlimit the destructive effects of surging Chinese imports on domestic \nproducers. As a result, China's succession to the WTO accelerated a \n``race to the bottom'' in wages and environmental quality.\n  Given these factors, in addition to China's mixed record on providing \nmarket access to the United States and its failure to provide \nprotection of U.S. intellectual property rights, I urge that the \nCongress reexamine our trade agreement the United States signed with \nChina and, if necessary, seek to withdraw permanent normal trade \nrelations status from China. Such a withdrawal would be a serious \nmeasure, but we must be willing to demonstrate that we are serious \nabout holding China to its international commitments.\n  When the United States granted most-favored-nation status to China in \n2000, we lost our ability to demand that China play by the rules. We \nmay have to regain this leverage if we are to maintain an equitable \ntrading relationship with China and keep our domestic industry strong.\n  As President Obama recently noted in his remarks at the Senate \nDemocratic Conference, the United States is home to some of the most \ninnovative, skilled, and efficient workers in the world. But advances \nin efficiency and innovation by our producers cannot make up for the \nunfair advantage held by countries that engage in illegal trade \npractices. Our industries can compete if the playing field is level, \nbut if foreign exporters are not held accountable, and can freely \nundercut American producers with dumped goods and government subsidies, \nthis country's economic future will be at risk. We must take a stand \nand we must do it now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Brown \n        of Massachusetts, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. LeMieux, Mr. \n        Sessions, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 3081. A bill to provide for the interrogation and detention of \nenemy belligerents who commit hostile acts against the United States, \nto establish certain limitations on the prosecution of such \nbelligerents for such acts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that sets \nforth a clear, comprehensive policy for the detention, interrogation \nand trial of enemy belligerents who are suspected of engaging in \nhostilities against the U.S. This legislation seeks to ensure that the \nmistakes made during the apprehension of the Christmas Day bomber, such \nas reading him a Miranda warning, will never happen again and put \nAmericans' security at risk.\n  Specifically, this bill would require unprivileged enemy belligerents \nsuspected of engaging in hostilities against the U.S. to be held in \nmilitary custody and interrogated for their intelligence value by a \n``high value detainee'' interagency team established by the President. \nThis interagency team of experts in national security, terrorism, \nintelligence, interrogation and law enforcement will have the \nprotection of U.S. civilians and civilian facilities as their paramount \nresponsibility and experience in gaining actionable intelligence from \nhigh value detainees.\n  These experts must, to the extent it is possible to do so, make a \npreliminary determination whether the detainee is an unprivileged enemy \nbelligerent within 48 hours of a detainee being taken into custody. The \nexperts then must submit their determination to the Secretary of \nDefense and the Attorney General after consultation with the Director \nof National Intelligence, the Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The \nSecretary of Defense and the Attorney General make a final \ndetermination and report it to the President and the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress. In the case of any disagreement between the \nSecretary of Defense and the Attorney General, the President will make \nthe final call.\n  A key provision of this bill is that it would prohibit a suspected \nenemy belligerent from being provided with a Miranda warning and being \ntold he has a right to a lawyer and a right to refuse to cooperate. I \nbelieve that an overwhelming majority of Americans agree that when we \ncapture a terrorist who is suspected of carrying out or planning an \nattack intended to kill hundreds if not thousands of innocent \ncivilians, our focus must be on gaining all the information possible to \nprevent that attack or any that may follow from occurring. Under these \ncircumstances, actionable intelligence must be our highest priority and \ncriminal prosecution must be secondary.\n  Additionally, the legislation would authorize detention of enemy \nbelligerents without criminal charges for the duration of the \nhostilities consistent with standards under the law of war which have \nbeen recognized by the Supreme Court. Importantly, if a decision is \nmade to hold a criminal trial after the necessary intelligence \ninformation is obtained, the bill mandates trial by military commission \nwhere we are best able to protect U.S. national security interests, \nincluding sensitive classified sources and methods, as well as the \nplace and the people involved in the trial itself.\n  It should come as no comfort to any American that nearly 8\\1/2\\ years \nafter the attacks of 9/11 we still don't have a clear mechanism, legal \nstructure, and implementing policy for dealing with terrorists who we \ncapture in the act of trying to bring about attacks on the U.S. and our \nnational security interests at home and abroad. What we saw with the \nChristmas Day bomber was a series of missteps and staggering failures \nin coordination among the most senior members of the administration's \nnational security officials that have continued to be compounded by \nadministration apologists who still don't seem to understand that \nrepeating the same mistakes that were made in 2001 and 2002 is going to \nlead to the deaths of many more Americans.\n\n  The vast majority of Americans understand that what happened with the \nChristmas Day bomber was a near catastrophe that was only prevented by\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\nsheer luck and the courage of a few of the passengers and crew. A wide \nmajority of Americans also realize that allowing a terrorist to be \ninterrogated for only 50 minutes before he is given a Miranda warning \nand told he can obtain a lawyer and stop cooperating is not sufficient.\n  Let me be clear about where I think the fault lies with our current \npolicy. I believe that the local FBI agents who were involved with \ninvestigating the Detroit attack are patriotic Americans who are \nexperts in the field of law enforcement. I hold the FBI in the highest \nregard and believe they set the standard for law enforcement \nprofessionalism not only in the U.S., but internationally. But it is \nimpossible for FBI field agents to know all the information that is \navailable to the U.S. intelligence community worldwide during the first \n50 minutes of interrogation of a suspected terrorist. We must ensure \nthat the broad range of expertise that is available within our \ngovernment is brought to bear on such high-value detainees. This bill \nmandates such coordination and places the proper focus on getting \nintelligence to stop an attack, rather than allowing law enforcement \nand preparing a case for a civilian criminal trial to drive our \nresponse.\n  Deliberate mass attacks that intentionally target hundreds of \ninnocent civilians is an act of war and should not be dealt with in the \nsame manner as a robbery. We must recognize the difference. If we \ndon't, our response will be hopelessly inadequate. We should not be \nproviding suspected terrorists with Miranda warnings and defense \nlawyers. Instead, the priority and focus must be on isolating and \nneutralizing the immediate threat and collecting intelligence to \nprevent another attack.\n  In closing, let me say that I hope that Congress and the \nadministration support this legislation as part of a comprehensive \nsolution for detaining, interrogating and prosecuting suspected enemy \nbelligerents. However, there is a lot more work that must be done. I am \ncontinuing to work with Senator Graham, Senator Lieberman, and others \nto address other crucial aspects of detainee policy.\n  As part of that effort, I believe we must establish a system for \nlong-term detention of terrorists who are too dangerous to release, but \nwho cannot be tried in a civilian court. While the law of war \nauthorizes detention until the end of hostilities--something the \nSupreme Court has recognized and which is reinforced in this bill--I \nbelieve that a review system for the long-term detention of detainees \nshould be set out in law. Additionally, both the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Columbia and the D.C. Circuit Court have urged \nCongress to provide uniform guidelines to apply in the habeas corpus \ncases that have been brought by detainees. Currently, the outcomes in \nthe Guantanamo detainee habeas cases are inconsistent because of \ndifferent interpretations of novel questions of law the judges face in \napplying habeas to wartime prisoners for the first time in our history. \nI will continue to work on a bipartisan basis to improve this process \nto obtain better, more uniform results. I do not believe that we will \nhave addressed all the necessary detainee policy challenges until we do \nso, and my efforts will not stop until we have addressed all the \ndetainee issues in a comprehensive fashion.\n  While other detainee policy challenges remain, I believe the handling \nof the Christmas Day bomber--including the law enforcement focus and \nthe decision to read a Miranda warning after only 50 minutes of \ninterrogation--demand that Congress and the administration first \naddress the issue which is most crucial to our national security. For \nthat reason, we must have a clear policy, legal foundation, and \nmechanism for the detention, interrogation and trial of enemy \nbelligerents who are suspected of engaging in hostilities against the \nU.S. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1182-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 434--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN'S DENTAL HEALTH \n            MONTH AND HONORING THE MEMORY OF DEAMONTE DRIVER\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Rockefeller, \nand Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following resolution, which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Job Impact Analysis Act \n     of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 842. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,100,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 45 \n     percent, or $7,647, more per employee than larger firms in \n     annual regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) The Federal Government should fully consider the costs, \n     including indirect economic impacts and the potential for job \n     creation and job loss, of proposed rules.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, \n     enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job \n     creation or job loss.\n       (8) To the maximum extent practicable, the Director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office should, in certain estimates the \n     Director prepares with respect to bills or joint resolutions \n     reported by congressional committees, estimate the potential \n     job creation or job loss attributable to the bills or joint \n     resolutions.\n\n     SEC. 843. JOB IMPACT STATEMENT FOR REPORTED BILLS AND JOINT \n                   RESOLUTIONS.\n\n       Section 424 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \n     Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 658c) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(2)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) if the Director estimates that the total amount of \n     direct costs of all Federal intergovernmental mandates in the \n     bill or joint resolution will equal or exceed $5,000,000,000 \n     (adjusted annually for inflation), to the extent practicable, \n     the potential job creation or job loss in State, local, and \n     tribal governments as a result of the mandates.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)(2)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) if the Director estimates that the total amount of \n     direct costs of all Federal private sector mandates in the \n     bill or joint resolution will equal or exceed $5,000,000,000 \n     (adjusted annually for inflation), to the extent practicable, \n     the potential job creation or job loss in the private sector \n     as a result of the mandates.''.\n\n     SEC. 844.

Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nEnsign, and Mr. Bond) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill H.R. 4213, to amend the Internal Rvenue Code of 1986 to \nextend certain expiring provisions, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                         DIVISION __--FOOTWEAR\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Affordable Footwear Act \n     of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Average collected duties on imported footwear are among \n     the highest of any product sector, totaling approximately \n     $1,700,000,000 during 2008.\n       (2) Duty rates on imported footwear are among the highest \n     imposed by the United States Government, with some as high as \n     the equivalent of 67.5 percent ad valorem.\n       (3) The duties currently imposed by the United States were \n     set in an era during which high rates of duty were intended \n     to protect production of footwear in the United States.\n       (4) Footwear produced in the United States supplies only \n     about 1 percent of the total United States market for \n     footwear. This production is concentrated in distinct product \n     groupings, which are not affected by the provisions of this \n     Act.\n       (5) Low- and moderate-income families spend a larger share \n     of their disposable income on footwear than higher-income \n     families.\n       (6) Footwear duties, which are higher on lower-price \n     footwear, serve no purpose and are a hidden, regressive tax \n     on those people in the United States least able to pay.\n\n     SEC. _03. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the reduction or elimination of duties on the \n     importation of certain footwear articles would provide \n     significant benefits to United States consumers, particularly \n     lower-income families;\n       (2) there is no production in the United States of many \n     footwear articles;\n       (3) the reduction or elimination of duties on such articles \n     will not negatively affect manufacturing or employment in the \n     United States; and\n       (4) the reduction or elimination of duties on such articles \n     will result in reduced retail prices for consumers.\n\n     SEC. _04. TEMPORARY ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF DUTIES ON \n                   CERTAIN FOOTWEAR.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--The U.S. Notes to subchapter II of \n     chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n     States are amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``20.

Res. 372\n\n       Whereas autoimmune diseases are chronic, disabling diseases \n     in which underlying defects in the immune system lead the \n     body to attack its own organs and tissues;\n       Whereas autoimmune diseases can affect any part of the \n     body, including the blood, blood vessels, muscles, nervous \n     system, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine glands, and \n     multiple-organ systems, and can be life-threatening;\n       Whereas researchers have identified over 80 different \n     autoimmune diseases, and suspect at least 40 additional \n     diseases of qualifying as autoimmune diseases;\n       Whereas researchers have identified a close genetic \n     relationship and a common pathway of disease that exists \n     among autoimmune diseases, explaining the clustering of \n     autoimmune diseases in individuals and families;\n       Whereas the family of autoimmune diseases is under-\n     recognized, and poses a major health care challenge to the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates \n     that autoimmune diseases afflict up to 23,500,000 people in \n     the United States, 75 percent of whom are women, and that the \n     prevalence of autoimmune diseases is rising;\n       Whereas NIH estimates the annual direct health care costs \n     associated with autoimmune diseases at more than \n     $100,000,000,000, with over 250,000 new diagnoses each year;\n       Whereas autoimmune diseases are among the top 10 leading \n     causes of death in female children and adult women;\n       Whereas autoimmune diseases most often affect children and \n     young adults, leading to a lifetime of disability;\n       Whereas diagnostic tests for most autoimmune diseases are \n     not standardized, making autoimmune diseases very difficult \n     to diagnose;\n       Whereas because autoimmune diseases are difficult to \n     diagnose, treatment is often delayed, resulting in \n     irreparable organ damage and unnecessary suffering;\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies \n     reported that the United States is behind other countries in \n     research into immune system self-recognition, the cause of \n     autoimmune diseases;\n       Whereas a study by the American Autoimmune Related Diseases \n     Association revealed that it takes the average patient with \n     an autoimmune disease more than 4 years, and costs more than \n     $50,000, to get a correct diagnosis;\n       Whereas there is a significant need for more collaboration \n     and cross-fertilization of basic autoimmune research;\n       Whereas there is a significant need for research focusing \n     on the etiology of all autoimmune-related diseases, in order \n     to increase understanding of the root causes of these \n     diseases rather treating the symptoms after the disease has \n     already had its destructive effect;\n       Whereas the National Coalition of Autoimmune Patient Groups \n     is a coalition of national organizations focused on \n     autoimmune diseases, working to consolidate the voices of \n     patients with autoimmune diseases and to promote increased \n     education, awareness, and research into all aspects of \n     autoimmune diseases through a collaborative approach; and\n       Whereas designating March 2010 as ``National Autoimmune \n     Diseases Awareness Month'' would help educate the public \n     about autoimmune diseases and the need for research funding, \n     accurate diagnosis, and effective treatments: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 2010 as ``National Autoimmune Diseases \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) supports the efforts of health care providers and \n     autoimmune patient advocacy and education organizations to \n     increase awareness of the causes of, and treatments for, \n     autoimmune diseases; and\n       (3) supports the goal of increasing funding for aggressive \n     research to learn the root\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\n     causes of autoimmune diseases, as well as the best diagnostic \n     methods and treatments for people with autoimmune diseases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/04/senate-section/article/S1207-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EXPRESSION TO THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF CHILE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 431\n\n       Whereas the massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake that struck \n     Chile in the early hours of Saturday, February 27, 2010, has \n     claimed approximately 800 lives, according to government \n     officials of Chile, and the death toll is expected to \n     continue to rise as assessments of the devastation continue;\n       Whereas the earthquake hit most strongly in 6 central and \n     south regions, from the capital, Santiago, and the nearby \n     port of Valparaiso in central Chile, to the Bernardo \n     O'Higgins, Maule, Bio Bio, and Araucania regions of the \n     south;\n       Whereas the regions most strongly hit are home to about 60 \n     percent of the 17,000,000 inhabitants of Chile and account \n     for approximately 70 percent of the gross domestic product of \n     Chile;\n       Whereas the earthquake generated some tsunami activity, in \n     addition to the earthquake, and several hundred people were \n     killed in the coastal towns of Constitucion and Talcahuano as \n     a result;\n       Whereas many of the villages in the Juan Fernandez \n     archipelago were destroyed by tsunami activity;\n       Whereas the earthquake left an estimated 2,000,000 people \n     homeless and damaged more than 1,000,000 homes, \\1/3\\ of \n     which may have to be demolished;\n       Whereas the earthquake, classified as a ``megathrust'' \n     earthquake, unleashed an estimated 50 gigatons of energy and \n     broke about 340 miles of the fault zone, according to the \n     United States Geological Survey's National Earthquake \n     Information Center;\n       Whereas aftershocks have continued, seriously complicating \n     efforts to survey the damage and rescue survivors despite the \n     noble efforts of local teams;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense has estimated that \n     reconstruction costs could exceed $30,000,000,000, equivalent \n     to 20 percent of the 2009 gross domestic product of Chile;\n       Whereas damage to ports and other infrastructure will \n     hinder important exports and economic recovery;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Chile on \n     March 2, 2010, and promised an extensive aid package, and the \n     United States Ambassador to Chile requested emergency relief \n     funding;\n       Whereas Chile enjoys excellent relations with the United \n     States since its transition back to democracy, and both \n     countries have emphasized similar priorities in the region, \n     designed to strengthen democracy, improve human rights, and \n     advance free trade;\n       Whereas Chile and the United States also maintain strong \n     commercial ties, which have become more extensive since a \n     bilateral free trade agreement between the two countries \n     entered into force in 2004;\n       Whereas since 2004, the Government of Chile has worked with \n     the Government of the United States and the international \n     community as part of the multinational peacekeeping force in \n     Haiti, first as a part of the Multinational Interim Force-\n     Haiti (MIFH) and subsequently as a part of the United Nations \n     Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), committing more \n     human material resources to MINUSTAH than it has to any \n     previous peacekeeping mission; and\n       Whereas the Government of Chile and the Government of the \n     United States and other regional partners have worked \n     together in recent years to resolve a number of political \n     issues in the Western Hemisphere, including crises in \n     Venezuela, Bolivia, and Honduras, among others: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its profound concern, deepest sympathies, and \n     solidarity on behalf of the people of the United States to \n     the people and Government of Chile following the massive \n     earthquake;\n       (2) applauds the friendship between the Governments and \n     people of the United States and Chile and recommits to \n     mutually beneficial cooperation in bilateral, multilateral, \n     and Hemispheric contexts;\n       (3) strongly encourages the United States Government, with \n     full consideration of the necessary institutional \n     instruments, to offer all appropriate assistance, if \n     requested by the Government of Chile, to aid in the immediate \n     rescue and ongoing recovery efforts undertaken by the \n     Government of Chile;

Senator Murray would like to cooperate with the prosecution's \nrequest.
