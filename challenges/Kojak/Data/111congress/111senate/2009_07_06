Mr. President, I, of course, wish to welcome you and all my \ncolleagues back after the July 4 recess. Now we are closer to the end \nof this year than the beginning of this year. We have much to be proud \nof, but our time is short and we have much to do in the coming weeks \nand months. So far this year we started to get our country back on \ntrack by passing bills that have already started to revive our economy. \nHave we revived it enough? Of course not. But what position would we be \nin, what kind of financial meltdown would the world be in, had we not \nmoved forward? We have already started to strengthen our national \nsecurity. We have started to protect our environment. We have started \nto demand accountability from government agencies and entities. We have \nstarted promoting equality and ensuring progress, as America returns to \nbeing positively viewed by the world community.\n  Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American \nEnterprise Institute, calls this Congress ``as active and productive as \nany I can remember.'' He went on to say: ``The number of major bills \npassed and enacted into law--serious, sustained activities in areas of \nbroad, complex and\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\ncritical importance--are all truly impressive.''\n  Some pundits have said the work we have done so far this year is \nunmatched except during the first year President Franklin Roosevelt was \nin office. I can assure Republicans that this serious, sustained \nactivity will not stop. We will finish this year in the same active, \nproductive way in which it started, and I encourage my Republican \ncolleagues to join us. I am confident the steps we have taken in the \nfirst half of this year, and that we will continue to take, will \ncertainly anchor our recovery. It has anchored our recovery and it will \ndo even more so. But I also know we must keep going. We must do more, \nlots more.\n  One of the most important steps we can take is reforming health care \nand doing so the right way. It has to wind up being health care reform \nthat helps the middle class, that helps everyone, not just reform to \ntake care of those who have none. It has to be a program that takes \ncare of those who are afraid they are losing their insurance and those \nwho have lost their insurance. That is why we will soon bring to the \nSenate floor a plan that lowers the high cost of health care. We will \nalso make sure every American has access to quality, affordable care, \nand we will make sure people can still choose their own doctors, \nhospitals, and health plans.\n  We will no longer let insurance companies use a patient's preexisting \ncondition as an excuse to deny the needed coverage, and we will help \nsmall businesses give their employees health care while keeping costs \nas low as possible. We are committed to a plan that protects what \nworks, fixes what is broken, and ensures that if you like the coverage \nyou have, you will be able to keep it. We will lower costs by \npreventing disease in the first place, reducing health disparities, and \nencouraging early detection and effective treatments that save lives \nand money.\n  This is the year we must act, and when we do we must act as partners, \nnot partisans. Rising health care costs and the risk of losing one's \nhealth care is now greater than ever. The status quo is unacceptable. \nDoing nothing is not an option because the costs of inaction are too \ngreat.\n  Americans are paying too much for health care. They can lose this \nhealth care they have with just one pink slip, one accident or one \nillness. Every day, more Americans go bankrupt or lose their homes \ntrying to stay healthy, and every year we do not act health care costs \nincrease by the billions of dollars. We must, and we will, pass health \ncare reform.\n  But health care is not the only issue on our agenda. We will also \ncontinue working on a number of appropriations bills to keep our \ngovernment running, funding our government. With Republican \ncooperation, we can finish these bills, starting today by funding the \nlegislative branch and tomorrow by doing the same for the Department of \nHomeland Security. We will continue working to confirm President \nObama's many nominees for critical positions, including his outstanding \nnominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Sotomayor. Those who have chosen \nto serve our country must be able get to work without delay. We have \nfar too many nominees who have not moved forward because of Republican \nholds.\n  The Independence Day holiday was one where all Americans observed the \nbirth of our country. The Independence Day holiday was one that \nreminded us of the debt we owe to the first patriots who stood for \nliberty and the many who died for liberty. Brave Americans have never \nstopped sacrificing so we can now know the self-evident truths and \nexercise the inalienable rights Jefferson described.\n  Keeping the Department of Defense strong is one of the ways we can \nsupport and thank those patriots. This work period we will do just that \nby passing the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  The revolutionary document Congress adopted on July 4, 1776, declared \nthat power derives from the consent of the governed. In the 233 years \nsince that day, we have also learned we must govern by consensus. \nAlthough we will discuss, debate and disagree, I urge my colleagues to \nremember that finding common ground is in our common interest. I ask \nthem not to forget that the governed, those who sent each of us here, \nsent us with their hopes we will work with each other, not against each \nother.\n\n  Finally, let me say that the long Senate race in the State of \nMinnesota is over. Al Franken will be sworn in as a Senator tomorrow \nbefore the weekly party caucuses. History will write about that race \nfor generations to come. Three million votes were cast by hand. The \nrecount was long, deliberate, and fair. Al Franken won by 312 votes.\n  He is a good man. He is someone who is extremely smart--he is Harvard \neducated. He had chosen as his life's work the entertainment world. He \nhas been on many USO caravans and trips. He has a great love for the \nAmerican soldier. I met with him in my office today, and I was so \nimpressed that his first piece of legislation is going to be one \ninvolving veterans--unique and very important.\n  I want everyone within the sound of my voice to understand that we \nhave 60 Senators on the Democratic side. That means that now more than \never we have to work together. We have no intention--I have no \nintention of running roughshod over the Republicans. I think we have \nproven that during this first 6 months. We want cooperation from the \nRepublicans, we deserve cooperation from the Republicans as they do \nfrom us.\n  I started my remarks by talking about what a terrific legislative \nsession it has been so far. We have accomplished, I repeat, as much as \nany other legislative first 6 months, other than the first Roosevelt \nyear. We have accomplished all that, and we needed Republican votes to \nget it done. We haven't gotten a lot of Republican votes--I wish we had \ngotten more--but we have gotten enough to get it done.\n  I hope in the next few weeks we all realize we have so much important \nwork to do. I laid that out with my remarks here today. We have to get \nas many appropriations bills done as we can; we have to finish the \nDefense Department bill; we have to do health care reform; we have to \ndo Judge Sotomayor. We have a huge schedule. As I have said and we all \nknow--everyone has been alerted, this is no message the people have not \nheard--this period is going to be a long hard slog.\n  We have lots to do. We are going to be working in the evenings, \nMondays and Friday--weekends, if necessary, to get all our work done.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues I, of course, am very thankful for \nAl Franken. It is terrific that Minnesota now has two Senators. For \nover 8 months, they have gone with just one. But I repeat, this is not \nthe time for people to be arrogant or attempt to throw their weight \naround. Things have not changed. We still need to work together. That \nis what the American people want and that is what the message is to my \nRepublican colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/06/senate-section/article/S7116-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have heard some debate recently centered \non whether it is appropriate for judges to consider foreign law and \npublic attitudes when interpreting our U.S. Constitution and laws.\n  In our constitutional system, the American people, through their \nelected representatives, make the laws by which we are governed. As \nJames Madison said in Federalist 49:\n\n\n[[Page S7117]]\n\n\n       The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and \n     it is from them that the Constitutional charter, under which \n     the several branches of government hold their power, is \n     derived.\n\n  Judges have the responsibility to faithfully interpret the \nConstitution and the laws that have been adopted through our democratic \nprocesses. Again, judges do not make the law, they interpret it.\n  Within our constitutional structure, the growing idea of using \nforeign law to interpret our own laws and Constitution is troubling and \nproblematic for two main reasons:\n  First, as Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out during his \nconfirmation hearings, the consideration of foreign law by American \njudges is contrary to the principles of democracy. Foreign judges and \nlegislators are not accountable to the American electorate. Using \nforeign law, even as a thumb on the scale, to help decide key \nconstitutional issues devalues Americans' expressions through the \ndemocratic process. An analogy would be to allow noncitizens to vote in \nour elections, thus devaluing the votes of every American.\n  Second, even if the use of foreign law were not inconsistent with our \nconstitutional system, its use would free judges to enact their \npersonal preferences under the cloak of legitimacy. If an American \njudge wants to find a foreign judicial decision or legislative \nenactment consistent with his or her preferred outcome in a case, he or \nshe could find it in the laws of at least 1 of the 192 United Nations \nmember states. That would be judicial activism compounded by the error \nof using inappropriate precedent.\n  As we soon begin the consideration of Judge Sonya Sotomayor's \nnomination to the Nation's highest Court, both the American people and \nthe Senate deserve to know where she stands on the issue of the use of \nforeign law to interpret the U.S. Constitution. Although we do have \nsome materials that suggest her views, we are still waiting on a number \nof important documents that will help us better understand her views. \nFor example, in response to the Senate Judiciary Committee's \nquestionnaire, Judge Sotomayor identified 200 public speeches or \nremarks she has given. Of those, we have not received a draft, video, \nor a sufficient topic description for more than 100 of them. These \ninclude four occasions in which she publicly spoke on the issue of \nforeign law. On one of these occasions, Judge Sotomayor apparently \nparticipated in a panel discussion with foreign judges at St. John's \nLaw School in November of 2006. According to her Judiciary Committee \nquestionnaire, she said she ``spoke on the permissible uses of \ninternational law by American courts.'' And in October 2008, Judge \nSotomayor participated in a roundtable discussion at New York \nUniversity's law school on the ``Dynamic Relations Between \nInternational and National Tribunals.''\n  With hearings scheduled to begin in a couple of weeks, getting this \ninformation is critical to our understanding of her judicial \nphilosophy. The most notable of the materials we do have is a 22-minute \nspeech Judge Sotomayor gave to the ACLU of Puerto Rico on April 28, \n2009, entitled ``How Federal Judges Look to International and Foreign \nLaw Under Article VI of the U.S. Constitution.'' From that speech, we \nbegin to see how foreign law could shape Judge Sotomayor's \njurisprudence in the future. Her views were not casual observations but \ndirected to this specific topic. In this speech, she says:\n\n       [I]nternational law and foreign law will be very important \n     in the discussion of how we think about the unsettled issues \n     in our own legal system. It is my hope that judges everywhere \n     will continue to do so because . . . within the American \n     legal system we're commanded to interpret our law in the best \n     way we can, and that means looking to what other, anyone, has \n     said to see if it has persuasive value.\n\n  What on Earth does this have to do with judging, asking what ``anyone \nhas said to see if it has persuasive value''? How about using the \ntraditional rules of judicial construction, precedents, and our \njudicial tests based on our common law heritage.\n  Judge Sotomayor also reveals that she believes foreign law is a \nsource for ``good ideas'' that can ``set our creative juices flowing.'' \nDeciding an antitrust case or a commerce clause dispute or an Indian \nlaw issue or an establishment of religion case does not require \n``creative juices.'' Indeed, it could interfere with specific rules of \nconstruction or application of precedent. But Judge Sotomayor says that \nnot considering foreign law would be ``asking American judges to close \ntheir minds to good ideas.'' What is ``closedminded,'' I would ask, \nabout requiring that American judges interpret our laws and our \nConstitution? That is what they take their oath of office to do.\n  Let's also remember that Judge Sotomayor has previously stated that \nappellate courts are ``where policy is made.'' When you combine the \nnotion that judges may usurp the legislative power of policymaking with \nthe view that foreign law is an incubator of creative ideas for a judge \nto employ as he or she sees fit, you open the door to the worst form of \njudicial activism, one completely untethered from American legal \nprinciples. Judges do not have the responsibility of finding new good \nideas that would make good policy. That is the role for our elected \nrepresentatives. The ideas expressed by Judge Sotomayor threaten to \nundermine a system that has served us well for over two centuries.\n  Judge Sotomayor went on in the same ACLU speech to criticize two \nsitting justices and align her views with those of Justice Ginsburg, \nwho recently endorsed the use of foreign law at a symposium at the \nMoritz College of Law at Ohio State University.\n  Specifically, Judge Sotomayor stated that ``[t]he nature of the \ncriticism comes from . . . a misunderstanding of the American use of \nthat concept of using foreign law and that misunderstanding is \nunfortunately endorsed by some of our own Supreme Court justices. Both \nJustice Scalia and Justice Thomas have written extensively criticizing \nthe use of foreign and international law in Supreme Court decisions. . \n. .''\n  She continues: ``I share more the ideas of Justice Ginsburg in \nthinking . . . that unless American courts are more open to discussing \nthe ideas raised by foreign cases, and by international cases, that we \nare going to lose influence in the world. Justice Ginsburg has \nexplained very recently . . . that foreign opinions . . . can add to \nthe story of knowledge relevant to the solution of a question, and \nshe's right.''\n  Judge Sotomayor's rationale for judges looking to foreign law--so \nthat the United States does not ``lose influence in the world''--is \nabsolutely irrelevant to the role of judges in America. It is the \nprovince of the President and the legislative bodies--not activist \njudges--to make policy and manage foreign affairs.\n  In defending the Supreme Court's use of foreign law, Judge Sotomayor \nmade an astonishing argument: Courts, she said, ``were just using that \nlaw to help us understand what the concepts meant to other countries, \nand to help us understand whether our understanding of our own \nconstitutional rights fell into the mainstream of human thinking.'' But \nthe words of our Constitution were not intended to reflect the \n``mainstream of human thinking.'' Think about mainstream public opinion \nin Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America at the end of the 18th \ncentury. Even today, it is doubtful the United States would be \nsatisfied being governed by the thinking of most of the governments in \nthe world, such as China, much of the Muslim world, and the dozens of \nkleptocracies around the world.\n  As I noted in my remarks that related my concerns about Harold Koh's \nviews on foreign law, if the Founding Fathers had been given to \ntransnationalism, America would not be the leading light of freedom in \nthe world that it is today. Nor would it be a leader in convincing \nother nations to protect free speech, assembly and other political \nfreedoms, such as are being asserted in Iran right now.\n  Do we really want judges to look to the laws of foreign countries \nwhen deciding our most treasured, constitutional provisions, such as, \nfor instance, the Second Amendment? I do not, and the American people \nshare my view. Judicial activism is not a popular concept.\n  While I do not intend to judge her qualifications to decide cases on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court based on this one speech, I believe it is fair \nto ask what else she has said on the subject. There are apparently \nother speeches that we do not have. The nominee should either\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\nfind these speeches or ask whather there are other records--for \nexample, transcripts, tape or video recordings, press accounts, and so \non--that would indicate whether her April 28 speech is indicative of \nher approach to judging.\n  As we begin to consider the nomination of Judge Sotomayor, we will \nneed this information to properly evaluate her qualifications, \nespecially as it relates to her view that using foreign or \ninternational law is an appropriate way for U.S. Supreme Court Justices \nto interpret the U.S. Constitution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tragedy has struck. It is not \nlike we haven't been warned. With the proliferation of the Burmese \npython being brought into the United States, these pythons people buy \nas pets, and then they get so big that the people don't want them \naround the house anymore and they release them. Of course, in south \nFlorida they are releasing them into a natural habitat which is the \nFlorida Everglades, so much so that the superintendent of the \nEverglades National Park has now estimated that they have proliferated \nto the tune of 150,000 to 180,000 of these Burmese pythons.\n  When Secretary Salazar came down a month ago for us to take him into \nthe Everglades so he could see that extraordinary feature of Mother \nNature, the river of grass, we took him in an airboat out across this \nriver of grass. We also wanted to show him what is lurking beneath that \ngrass now. We took him to two captured Burmese pythons. One was about \nan 8 footer and another one was a 16 footer. A 16-foot Burmese python \nin his midsection is that much in diameter. It took three grown men to \nhold that python. The oldest registered Burmese python in captivity has \ngrown to 27 feet. Indeed, an 18 footer was captured and killed in the \nEverglades, and it was a female. They found inside of her 56 eggs that \nwere ready to hatch. That is why we have a proliferation.\n  We have spent a lot of money, along with the State of Florida, to \nrestore the Everglades, one of the great natural wonders of the world. \nMankind, over the course of three quarters of a century, has diked and \ndrained the Everglades, and we are trying to restore them now. But here \nwe have an invasive species that has been introduced that is upsetting \nthe entire ecological balance. Already we have found, for example, \nsomehow a Burmese python swam across the ocean to Key Largo in the \nupper Florida Keys. They found inside this Burmese python the \nendangered Key Largo wood rat. They have found a full size bobcat. They \nhave found a full size deer. Indeed, the Burmese python is at the top \nof the food chain. These pythons, in fact, get into fights with \nalligators, and they found inside one of the Burmese pythons a 6-foot \nalligator.\n  I want to show what I am talking about. I want colleagues to see this \ncritter. This is only a 6 footer. This Burmese python is 2 feet shorter \nthan the Burmese python 4 days ago that, after it had escaped from its \nglass container at midnight, the man of the house found missing. He \nwent and got the Burmese python, put it back in the container and, \nunfortunately, did not secure the top of the container, put, if we can \nbelieve it, a quilt over the top and secured down the edges of the \nquilt. Guess what an 8-foot Burmese python can do coming out of a glass \ncontainer? Tragedy struck, because that python slithered throughout the \nhouse and up into a baby crib where there was a 2-year-old little girl \nnamed Shaiunna Hare. That Burmese python attached its fangs to the \nforehead of that child and then did what they do, wrapped its body \naround the body of the little child and proceeded with all of that \nmuscle to strangle the child to death. This is what we have been saying \nwas going to happen. This happened with a domestic pet in a home. This \nis what is capable of happening with 180,000 of these pythons in the \nFlorida National Everglades Park.\n  Sooner or later, a Burmese python will get the endangered Florida \npanther. Sooner or later, for an unsuspecting tourist in the Everglades \nNational Park, there will be an encounter with a human. Tragically, it \ntook this event of the strangulation by one of these snakes of a child \nwithin her own home in the child's crib to bring this to our attention.\n  This Wednesday there will be a hearing in the committee chaired by \nSenator Boxer. I will be testifying. I will bring further evidence than \nthese photographs. Here are wildlife officers encountering a snake with \nan attachment that grabs the snake from right behind the head. In this \ncase, it is probably a 6\\1/2\\ footer--relatively small. But we can see \nthe size. This is solid muscle. That is why these constricter snakes \nhave the capability of asphyxiating their prey before they then consume \ntheir prey. We have heard the old adage, a pig in a python. That is \nexactly what it is. Once they asphyxiate their prey, then their jaws \nare capable of totally opening and they ingest the entire victim into \ntheir body. There is the old phrase: a pig in a python with the hump. \nThat is exactly what it is.\n  That is the alligator that was found, the 6-foot alligator, within \nthe stomach of the snake. That is the same thing.\n  There is something we can do about this. No. 1, the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service has the capability under law now to declare this an \ninjurious species. Since they have been studying this for the last 2\\1/\n2\\ years and have still not acted, although I believe that Secretary of \nthe Interior Salazar is getting them off dead center and is going to \nget them to start moving, there is something else we can do. We can \nchange the law. We can stop the importation by changing this from being \na species that is allowed to be imported into one that is injurious. \nThat change of definition in the law would stop the importation of \nthese snakes into this country and would stop the exporting of these \nsnakes from one State across State lines to another.\n  The State of Florida has a registration fee. They now require the \nimplantation of a chip so that if the snake gets loose, we will have a \nchance of chasing it down. Nevertheless, when we have 150,000 to \n180,000 of these snakes in the Everglades National Park alone, we can \nsee that the ecological balance of Mother Nature is definitely being \nupset. We must change it. We must do it quickly.\n  Therefore, in front of the Boxer committee will be the legislation I \nhave offered with a number of other Senators, trying to put a halt to \nthe things that led to this tragedy of this little girl being strangled \nto death by a Burmese python.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/06/senate-section/article/S7118-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the past several weeks, Americans \nhave heard a number of proposals for reforming health care, and they \nare increasingly concerned about many of the details. Americans want \nreform, but they want the right reform, not a reform that ends up \ncosting them much more for worse care than they already receive. \nUnfortunately, the government-run plan that some are proposing would do \njust that.\n  A government-run plan would force millions of Americans to give up \nthe care they currently have and replace it with a system in which care \nis denied, delayed, and rationed. Instead of increasing access and \nquality, it could limit access and options. It could lead us into \ndeeper debt. And millions could well remain uninsured.\n  Americans are skeptical about all of this. They do not want to be \nforced to\n\n[[Page S7119]]\n\nchange the coverage they have for a government system they do not \nparticularly want. Some of the advocates of a government plan are \nbeginning to sense this growing public opposition to their proposal. \nBut rather than make their case on the merits, they are basing their \narguments on the urgency of the moment.\n  We keep hearing that time is running out, that the clock on reform is \nabout to expire, that the entire health care system and the whole \neconomy will soon collapse without this particular reform. Well, we \nhave been down this road before.\n  Earlier this year, we heard the same dire warnings about the \nstimulus. If Congress did not pass the stimulus, we were told, \nunemployment would continue to rise and the economy would continue to \nfalter. We did not just have to pass it, we had to pass it right away. \nThe results are now coming in: higher unemployment, soaring job losses, \nhigher debt, huge deficits, and growing fears about inflation.\n  Many of us saw this coming. That is why we proposed an alternative \nstimulus that would not add a trillion dollars to the debt and would \nhave gotten to the root cause of our economic problem, which is \nhousing. That is why in the debate over health care Republicans are \nproposing reforms that would make health care more accessible and less \nexpensive without destroying what people like about our health care \nsystem and without sending the Nation deeper and deeper into debt.\n  Every cost estimate we have heard about the administration's plans \nfor health care is astronomical. The administration realizes this is a \nproblem, and yet they have no good plan for covering the cost. Some of \nthe ideas that have been floated are a series of taxes, including a tax \non soft drinks. But even that would not come close to covering the \ncost. So they have been looking frantically for money, and the target \nthey seem to have landed on is Medicare--the government health plan for \nthe elderly.\n  Last month, the administration proposed hundreds of billions of \ndollars in cuts. It said by taking this money out of Medicare and \nputting it into a new government-run plan for all Americans, we could \nhelp pay for health care reform. Not only is this aimed at concealing \nthe cost of the new government plan, it is also a reckless misuse of \nfunds that should be used to stabilize Medicare instead.\n  Weeks before the administration proposed its cuts to Medicare, the \ngovernment board that oversees this vital program issued an urgent \nreport on its looming insolvency. Let me say that again. Just weeks \nbefore the administration recommended Medicare cuts in order to pay for \na new program, the government board that oversees this program issued \nan urgent report on its looming insolvency. Already, Medicare is \nspending more money than it is taking in. It runs out of money \naltogether in 8 years. And over the coming decades, Medicare is already \ncommitted to spend nearly $40 trillion that it does not have.\n  If there were ever a crisis that cannot wait another day for reform, \nit is Medicare. Yet rather than do the hard but necessary work to put \nthis program on a sound financial basis, the administration wants to \ntake money away from it and use it to create an entirely new \ngovernment-run system that would presumably have the same fiscal \nproblems down the road that Medicare has today. This makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  Savings from Medicare should be put back into Medicare--not a \ngovernment plan that could drive millions of Americans out of the \nprivate health care plans they have and like and lead to the same kind \nof denial, delay, and rationing of health care that we have seen in \nother countries.\n  We must be committed to reform but not a so-called reform that raids \none insolvent government-run health care program in order to create \nanother insolvent government-run health care program. The \nadministration should be applauded for trying to fix what is wrong with \nour Nation's health care system, but it needs to slow down and take a \ndeep breath before taking over what amounts to about one-sixth of our \nNation's economy with a single piece of legislation that lacks \nbipartisan support.\n  The administration rushed ahead with a poorly conceived stimulus plan \nthat added a trillion dollars to the national debt and has not stopped \nhalf a million Americans a month from losing their jobs. It should \nlearn from that and not rush a poorly conceived health care plan with \nmoney we do not have. We do not need more rush-and-spend policymaking. \nWe need to reform health care, but we do not need to weaken Medicare to \ndo it. We can reform both, but we should start with Medicare.\n  At a time when Americans are increasingly concerned about the future \nof health care and also about a political system in which they see \nfewer and fewer checks on the party in power, now would be the ideal \ntime to advance a truly bipartisan reform. The President has repeatedly \nexpressed openness to reforming Medicare in the past. We stand ready to \nwork with him to strengthen and preserve Medicare if he chooses to \nfollow through on those assurances.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Republican leader on \nhis remarks. I remember Senator McConnell's first address following \nPresident Obama's election at the National Press Club. It was to the \nPresident, saying: Mr. President, we look forward to working with you, \nand the pressing issue is the entitlements facing this country, the \nautomatic spending that means more and more and more debt.\n  I would ask the Republican leader whether there has been any response \nfrom the administration to him about the opportunity to work together \nacross party lines to deal with Social Security which, as I remember in \nJanuary, was your proposal?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my good friend from Tennessee, unfortunately, \nthere has been no followup whatsoever. There seemed to be, on the part \nof the President and the President's Chief of Staff at the beginning of \nthe administration, a willingness to support the Conrad-Gregg proposal, \nwhich would have given us a way to get a handle on at least Social \nSecurity--they did not seem to want to deal with Medicare, and I think \nwe now know why--at least Social Security, with an expedited procedure \nand an up-or-down vote guaranteeing a result. But I would say to my \nfriend from Tennessee, there has been no word on that lately.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in my visits in Tennessee this past \nweek, if I heard two things, one was too many Washington takeovers; the \nother was too much debt. I found in people--and I hesitate to use the \nword--a great deal of fear about the amount of debt we are piling up \nhere in Washington.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think there is a genuine alarm. \nAmericans see the government now running banks, insurance companies, \nautomobile companies. The Senator from Tennessee points out student \nloans. Now they fear the government wants to take over health care as \nwell. I think there is a growing suspicion that this is exactly the \nwrong way to go.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comment \nabout checks and balances. There is something innate in the American \ncharacter about checks and balances. Alexis de Tocqueville warned, in \nthe early 1800s, about the tyranny of a majority. We like to see \nresults, but we do not want to see one party or one faction run away \nwith policy. We seem to know it is better if there is a check and a \nbalance. And the genius of the American system is we have many checks \nand balances.\n  I wonder, Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Acting President pro tempore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/06/senate-section/article/S7119-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7119-S7121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NUCLEAR POWER\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, health care is not the only issue \nbefore the Senate. We have the nomination by the President of a \ndistinguished jurist, Judge Sotomayor. Hearings will begin next week on \nwhether she should be confirmed for the Supreme Court.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate, in the Environment and Public Works Committee,\n\n[[Page S7120]]\n\nbegins discussion on climate change and global warming--a subject we \nhave talked about a lot. The House of Representatives has made that an \nissue by passing, about 10 days ago, another one of these bills that by \nall reports no one in the House of Representatives read before it was \npassed--1,200 pages served up the day before they voted. They voted and \nsent it on over to us. So we have energy and climate change to deal \nwith, which is the subject of my remarks this afternoon.\n  My question is this: Why is Congress and, to a great extent, the \nadministration ignoring the cheap energy solution to global warming--\nnuclear power?\n  Consider this: No. 1, coal-burning powerplants produce about 40 \npercent of carbon, and carbon is the principal greenhouse gas causing \nglobal warming. That is the first fact.\n  Second, nuclear powerplants, which produce only 20 percent of all of \nour electricity in America, produce 70 percent of our carbon-free, \npollution-free electricity.\n  So coal-burning powerplants produce 40 percent of the carbon, and \nnuclear powerplants produce 70 percent of the carbon-free electricity, \nand our goal is to get rid of the carbon to slow down global warming. I \nthink that is the goal anyway.\n  So if that is the goal, if global warming is your issue, why not \nbuild 100 new nuclear powerplants during the next 20 years to deal with \nit? Nuclear power costs less than one-half cent per kilowatt hour to \nproduce, which means it is cheap enough to pay for building the plants \nand will still leave electric rates low.\n  The rest of the world seems to understand this a little better than \nwe do in the United States today. France gets 80 percent of its \nelectricity from nuclear and has among the lowest carbon emission rates \nand electricity prices in the European Union. The United States--our \ntaxpayers--is helping India and China build nuclear plants. Japan is \nbuilding one nuclear plant a year. The President has even said that \nIran has the right to build nuclear powerplants. But the United States \nhas not built one new nuclear plant in 30 years, even though we \ninvented the technology.\n  So instead, the House of Representatives, 10 days ago, chose the \nhigh-cost solution to the climate change energy dilemma, narrowly \npassing an economywide so-called cap-and-trade bill, the Waxman-Markey \nbill. This is a job-killing $100 billion a year new national energy \ntax, which would add a new utility bill to the budget of every American \nfamily.\n  The House also mandated the use of solar and wind power, which is 6 \npercent of our carbon-free electricity. Remember, nuclear is 70 percent \nof our carbon-free electricity. So the House, ignoring nuclear, says: \nLet's expand solar and wind, which is 6 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity, even though both are more expensive and more unreliable \nsince solar and wind power cannot be stored today, which means you have \nto use it when the Sun shines and the wind blows. Wind, especially, \nbarely works in some parts of the country, such as the Southeast.\n\n  So the choice is between a high-priced or a low-priced clean energy \nstrategy. I think we all want a clean energy future, but do we want a \ndeliberately high-priced clean energy future or a low-priced one? High \npricers want taxes and mandates. Cheap energy advocates--almost all \nRepublicans in Congress and some Democrats, and I hope a growing \nnumber--say build nuclear plants and double research to make renewable \nenergy cheaper and reliable. High-priced energy sends American jobs \noverseas looking for cheap energy. I see that in all of the auto plants \nwe have in Tennessee, and the auto suppliers. They are operating on a \nvery thin margin. Add a little cost and those cars and trucks are built \nin Mexico and Japan instead of Tennessee and Michigan.\n  Cheap energy not only creates jobs, it will reduce global warming \nfaster than taxes and mandates. Here is why: 100 new plants in 20 years \nwould double U.S. nuclear production, making it more than 40 percent of \nall electricity production. Add 10 percent or so for Sun and wind and \nbiomass, another 10 percent for hydroelectric, and we begin to have a \ncheap as well as a clean energy policy.\n  Some predict renewable sources will be 20 percent of electricity in \n20 years. I predict it will be about half that, after Americans \nunderstand its costs and its lack of reliability and they begin to see \nwhat some conservationists are calling the ``renewable energy \nsprawl''--50-story wind turbines along the foothills of the Great \nSmokey Mountain National Park and the Blue Ridge Parkway and the \nShenandoah Valley and solar thermal plants 5 miles wide next to \nnational parks, all with big new transmission lines. Plus, since the \nSun shines and the wind blows only about one-third of the time--\nremember, you can't store it--we will still need nuclear plants for \nbase load power.\n  Step 2 for a clean and cheap energy policy is to electrify half our \ncars and trucks. There is so much unused electricity at night, we can \nalso do this in 20 years without building one new powerplant if we plug \nin vehicles while we sleep. This is the fastest way to reduce \ndependence on foreign oil, keep fuel prices low, and reduce the one-\nthird of carbon that comes from gasoline engines.\n  Step 3 is offshore exploration for natural gas--that is low carbon--\nand oil. We should use less but use more of our own.\n  Finally, we should double energy research and development to make \nrenewable energy such as solar more cost competitive.\n  Obstacles to nuclear power are diminishing. Used fuel can be stored \nsafely onsite for 40 to 60 years while scientists figure out the best \nway to reduce its mass and recycle or reuse it. New plants can be one-\ntenth the size and one-tenth the cost of the big ones we are accustomed \nto today and can be put together at an American factory and shipped to \nthe site and assembled like Lego blocks--all of this American made--and \nwith air cooling towers, not water cooling, and the towers are only two \nstories tall.\n  I have introduced legislation to deal with global warming ever since \nI came to the Senate, but I am not in favor of economy-wide cap and \ntrade. It is unnecessary. It is complex. It has unintended \nconsequences. Our economy can't tolerate it. A simpler way to do it \nwould be to focus on smokestacks, tailpipes, and find alternative ways \nto deal with the coal and the oil we want to use less of. We have that \nwith tailpipes, cars, and trucks. We can shift to electric cars and \ntrucks and the cost to the consumer will be as low or lower as they \nplug in at night to electricity. We also have that with smokestacks. We \ncan shift some of our dirtiest coal plants to nuclear power, and \ninstead of increasing the cost of energy, we could keep it steady or \nprobably reduce it. So why would we want to deliberately proceed with a \nhigh-cost energy strategy when cheap energy is the key to our national \nsecurity, to rebuilding our economy, and the key to so much of what is \nimportant to America's future?\n  There is an old rule of thumb that sometimes in government we take a \ngood idea and expand it until it doesn't work. I am afraid we are doing \nthat with renewable energy--which is a good idea--the idea of putting \nup your own windmill in your backyard, put some solar panels on your \nroof, use biomass, and cut your energy costs and cut your use of fossil \nfuels. That is a good idea, but it is only going to produce a small \npercentage of what we actually need to run a country such as this which \nuses 25 percent of all of the energy in the world.\n  Biomass, for example, to produce the amount of energy that one \nnuclear powerplant produces, you would have to forest continuously an \narea the size of the entire Great Smokey Mountain National Park, which \nis 550,000 acres. To produce enough electricity to equal a nuclear \npowerplant from solar power you would have to cover an area about the \nsize of 270 square miles, and that is 5 or 6 miles on each side. The \nsame with wind, or the same with hydroelectric, and we are not going to \nbe building any big, new reservoirs anymore of that size.\n  So we should take what we can get in appropriate places of wind and \nsolar and biomass. We should put a few turbines in the Mississippi \nRiver and pick up some megawatts for the TBA, for example, but that is \na few hundred megawatts for a system that needs to produce 27,000 \nmegawatts of reliable, low-cost, clean electricity every year.\n  The only technology we have available to produce large amounts of \nclean,\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\nreliable electricity in the next 20 years is nuclear power. We invented \nit. We know how to use it. The rest of the world is taking advantage of \nit. Why don't we? Especially in this economy, when we have nearly 10 \npercent unemployment, when in Tennessee and Virginia and in the Midwest \nwe are trying to find ways to rebuild the economy, when we know that \ncheap energy is the key to new jobs and that high-priced energy drives \njobs overseas looking for cheap energy, why are we ignoring the cheap \nenergy strategy for dealing with global warming, cheap energy based on \nnuclear power, No. 1; electric cars and trucks, No. 2; offshore \ndrilling for natural gas and oil which we are still going to need, and \npushing ahead with mini Manhattan projects in energy research and \ndevelopment to figure out renewable energy and help make it cost \ncompetitive while we move ahead?\n  This is not only the fastest way to increase American energy \nindependence, clean the air, and reduce global warming, it is the best \nway to help strained family budgets and a sick economy with 10 percent \nunemployment.\n  I thank the President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask for the clerk to report \nthe bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 2918, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2918) making appropriations for the \n     Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2010, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Nelson (NE) amendment No. 1365, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       McCain amendment No. 1366 (to amendment No. 1365), to \n     strike the earmark for the Durham Museum in Omaha, NE.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, we are returning to the \nLegislative Branch Committee bill for further consideration today. It \nis my understanding that my colleague from Oklahoma has an amendment he \nwould like to offer. He was here. Perhaps he will rejoin us shortly.\n  To recap, this is the legislative branch bill, which has a number of \ndifferent important issues in it, not the least of which is the fact \nthat when you compare the percentage of increase this year with \nprevious years, it is an effective 2.4-percent increase. We controlled \nthe growing costs associated with the new Visitor Center, which were \nsignificant in the last budget.\n  Let me, at this point, yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1369 to Amendment No. 1365\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes talking \nabout the legislative branch and us and where we find ourselves. I do \nhave an amendment and I appreciate the consideration of it.\n  Right now, the average income in this country is down four-tenths of \n1 percent this year. Historically, people wonder why Congress cannot \ncontrol spending. They cannot control spending because they cannot even \ncontrol their own budget. We are going to see about a 3.2-percent \nincrease in the bill. The House is coming in at 6.1. In conference, we \nwill decide what the legislative branch increase in expenses is on the \nAmerican public. The reason that spending is out of control and the \nreason we are shackling our grandchildren with an enormous amount of \ndebt--another $5 trillion in the next 5 years--is because we don't even \ndo a good job managing our own office budgets.\n  I am on the floor a lot complaining about wasteful spending, \nearmarks, and other issues. I don't do that without setting the proper \nexample in my own office. I have been here 4 complete years. I am in my \nfifth year. During that time, I have turned back, in 2005, $321,000; in \n2006, $529,000; in 2007, $516,000; and in 2008, $491,000--about 16 to \n17 percent of my budget.\n  If I can do that, the question the American people ought to ask is: \nWhy can't everybody up here do that? Why can't we manage our own \nlegislative branch expenses? With the economic environment in which we \nfind ourselves today, the American people ought to be asking what are \nour elected leaders doing to cut their expenses because we are \nborrowing a good portion of this money. Why are we not setting an \nexample? If we don't do it, then we are certainly not going to have the \nvarious Federal agencies do it.\n  If you look at spending increases, outside the omnibus and the \nRecovery Act, Congress increased spending almost 7.2 percent last year. \nThe budget has in it 7.3 percent. That is three times the rate of \nincome growth prior to this recession. Yet we are growing the \ngovernment three, four times faster, and we are growing our own budgets \ntwo and a half or three times faster. This time, it will be five or six \ntimes faster than Americans' income is growing.\n  The question has to be asked: If we are not good stewards with our \nown offices, how can we be good stewards with the money entrusted to \nus?\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1369 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1369 to amendment No. 1365.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require expenditures by every Senate office be posted \n                    online for the public to review)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Section 105(a) of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act \n     1965 (Public Law 88-454; 2 U.S.C. 104a) is amended--\n       (1) in the last sentence of paragraph (1), by striking \n     ``shall'' and inserting ``may''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) Beginning with the report covering the first full \n     semiannual period of the 112th Congress, the Secretary of the \n     Senate--\n       ``(1) shall publicly post on-line on the website of the \n     Senate each report in a searchable, itemized format as \n     required under this section;\n       ``(2) shall issue each report required under this section \n     in electronic form; and\n       ``(3) may issue each report required under this section in \n     other forms at the discretion of the Secretary of the \n     Senate.''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It says \nwe will take the money we spend and make available online to the \nAmerican people how we spent it. Right now, there are a limited number \nof books published. We transfer it from computers to a book, but we \ndon't give it to the American people so they can see how we are \nspending money on our office accounts. Senators Nelson of Nebraska and \nReid have graciously said they support this amendment. We will have \nlimited debate.\n  The one way to get this spending under control in our individual \noffices, as well as in the Federal Government, is to make available to \nthe American people how we spend it. So my hope is this will be a short \nperiod of time, and at the end of this year, the American people can go \non a Web site and see how Tom Coburn spent his money, in terms of \nrunning the office of the junior Senator from Oklahoma. I think they \nwill find I am as frugal with their money in my office as I am trying \nto be frugal on the floor when it comes to wasteful spending. There is \n$350 billion worth of waste that will go through this year, without one \nstroke of it being eliminated--$350 billion worth of waste and not one \nlegitimate stroke will be eliminated as we go through the \nAppropriations Committees and the President's budget--and he is trying \nto eliminate some. But we won't even do a line-by-line review.\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\n  I hope we will accept this amendment and lead by example, and the \nAmerican people can hold us accountable for how we spend their money.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I know of no further debate on the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there is no further debate, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1369) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, when it comes to health care, \nDemocrats and Republicans all agree that we need and we want health \ncare reform. Having practiced medicine for over two decades in Wyoming, \nI know that doing nothing is simply not an option. But let me tell you \nfrom experience that the devil is always in the details. We must be \ncareful, we must be thoughtful, and we must be deliberate about the \nchanges we make.\n  Health care is a very complex and intensely personal issue. It \ndeserves a serious, open, and transparent national debate. Any changes \nCongress makes are going to impact millions and millions of American \nfamilies. These are people of our Nation; these are not nameless or \nfaceless statistics; these are husbands, mothers, neighbors; these are \nour wives, our friends, and our coworkers; these Americans are our \nchildren--the Nation's most precious resources.\n  We must act, but still at issue is whether Congress will act without \nsacrificing our health care system's greatest strengths. And what are \nthose strengths? The freedom to choose your own doctor, the freedom to \nchoose the hospital you want, and the freedom to choose the health care \nplan that fits you and fits your family's needs.\n  I travel home to Wyoming every weekend. I was there yesterday. One of \nthe top issues I hear about is health care. The people of Wyoming are \nconcerned about the cost of their health care. Many families worry they \nwill lose the health care coverage they currently have. Still others \ncan't afford health insurance at all. This is what is wrong with the \ncurrent health care system. This is what we need to fix. Wyoming \nfamilies want to purchase health insurance coverage at an affordable \nprice. They do not want to be denied coverage because of preexisting \nconditions. They do not want to lose coverage if they change jobs. But \nmost of all, these families do not want Washington telling them--do not \nwant Washington telling them--whom they have to see for their medical \ncare. Everyone should have the freedom to choose the doctor, the \nhospital, and the health care plan they want. No Washington bureaucrat \nshould ever be allowed to deny that right.\n  Some in Congress continue focusing solely on government solutions. \nThey want Washington, in its enduring wisdom, to take over health care. \nSome in Congress want to create a government-run health care plan. \nTheir plan creates a government-run insurance model that could limit \npatient choice, eliminate personal freedoms, and decrease the quality \nof care. What starts out as one option could quickly lead to being the \nonly option.\n  We all know how this happens. Unlike regular health insurance, \ngovernment health plans have unlimited access to taxpayer money. They \ncan use the money to temporarily subsidize the cost of services, but \nultimately someone must pay for the care.\n  According to the Lewin Group, 119 million Americans would lose the \nprivate coverage they currently have if we have a government-run \nsystem. I know some in the Senate and the administration keep saying: \nIf you like your insurance coverage, you will get to keep it. The Lewin \nGroup's data proves otherwise. Their study shows that businesses will \nface a situation where it is cheaper for them to insure their employees \nthrough the government-run plan, so employers will then transfer their \nworkers from the private insurance that they currently have--and that \nthey may like--to this new Washington-run government plan. So where is \nthe personal choice? At this point, the individual has no option. The \ngovernment-run plan is their option, it is their plan, unless that \nperson changes jobs to an employer who is willing or can afford to \noffer private coverage. So what happened to the ``If I like my health \ninsurance plan offered by my employer, I will be able to keep it''? \nWell, that promise is out the window.\n  Some say we can create safeguards that will ensure a level playing \nfield between private insurance and a government-run plan. Well, as a \ndoctor, I can tell you from personal experience that the government \nwill never, ever compete on a level playing field with private \nbusiness. Washington will never let its health care plan go bankrupt. \nNever. It will lose money, it will hide costs, and ultimately taxpayers \nwill pay the difference. Private plans will not enjoy this same kind of \nsupport. That is exactly how the heavy hand of government can drive out \ncompetition.\n  So how does government compete with private business? Well, \nCongressman Mike Pence of Indiana summed it up pretty well. He said: \n``The government competes with private business the way an alligator \ncompetes with a duck.''\n  Supporters of the government-run Washington takeover of health care \nsay the plan will keep costs low. How? By paying hospitals, doctors, \nnurses, home health agencies, hospice providers, and long-term care \nfacilities less than private insurers pay. This should sound familiar. \nThis is what already happens with Medicare and Medicaid. Any \nparticipating Medicare or Medicaid provider will tell you that today, \nright now, doctors and hospitals have to shift costs onto private \ninsurers just to keep their doors open. The cost shift is to make up \nthe difference between what a procedure costs and what the government \nis willing to pay for it. That is what they call cost shifting. We see \nit every day.\n  A government-run plan will not encourage competition; it will take \naway your access to private health insurance. The private plans \nmillions of Americans have today--the program they like, the one they \nwant to keep--will be gone. The only choice remaining will be the \ngovernment plan.\n  So what does this all mean to someone who is listening in--to the \npatient? Well, it means politicians will be making health care \ndecisions, not patients making those decisions with their doctors. It \nmeans Washington bureaucrats will be deciding whether you can have the \nhip or the knee procedure you need. It means the government will be \nsaying you cannot have lifesaving medical treatment because it is too \nexpensive or because you are too old. It means Washington will be \nrestricting your and your child's access to the most advanced medical \ntesting equipment. It means testing delays, it means diagnosis delays, \nand it means treatment delays. Delayed care is denied care, and we do \nnot want that in America.\n  Take a close look at what is going on in Canada right now. Last year, \nin Calgary, ophthalmologists--eye doctors--had no waiting lists for \npeople needing cataract surgery. Then Alberta's cash-strapped \ngovernment made a decision to arbitrarily lower the number of cataract \noperations it would pay for. They arbitrarily said: We are going to pay \nfor 2,000 fewer cataract operations this year in Alberta than we did \nlast year. So what did that mean for the people there? Well, many \npatients now have to wait a year for treatment--a year. Why? Well, the \ncutbacks forced surgeons to cancel all of the operations they had \nscheduled on people with moderately severe cataract conditions. So now \nthey only book the most severe cases. Ophthalmologists are now \nconcentrating their efforts only on the patients who are about to go \nblind--not the people who have a hard time seeing, the people about to \ngo blind.\n  Patients living in Alberta have to almost be going blind to get \ncataract\n\n[[Page S7123]]\n\nsurgery. Is that the kind of medical care we want for Americans? \nAbsolutely not. America should strive to offer its citizens the highest \nquality, most timely health care services in the world. That means \nAmericans should not have to wait weeks at a time for tests and \ntreatments they need. It means no one should be denied health care \nservices because of government limits or government restrictions. It \nmeans no government bureaucrat should interfere in the doctor-patient \nrelationship.\n  Currently, the Senate HELP Committee has been debating a reform plan \nthat has been put forth by Senator Kennedy and Senator Dodd. The \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office told us--first, it told us the \nKennedy-Dodd plan increases spending by more than $1.3 trillion in the \nfirst 10 years. Once it is fully operational, the 10-year fee would be \ncloser to $2.6 trillion. The number was staggering. People cried \n``sticker shock.'' What did they do? They tweaked it around a little \nbit and came out with a new estimate.\n  They are just guessing. Even more disturbing is the plan is \nincomplete. The Congressional Budget Office still has additional \npolicies to score to come up with a pricetag. Clearly, this estimate \ndoes not reflect the bill's true cost because they left out Medicaid, \nsomething they have been forcing onto the States, and Governors all \naround the country have been crushed by these Medicaid-increased fees \nand increased expenses.\n  Ten years and trillions of dollars later, the Congressional Budget \nOffice also tells us this plan only reduces the number of people who do \nnot have insurance by 17 million. That leaves over 30 million Americans \nstill without health insurance, and they are spending $1 trillion.\n  Finally, the Congressional Budget Office indicates that about 15 \nmillion people would actually lose the insurance they have now, be \nforced off of their employer-paid-for insurance under this trillion-\ndollar plan.\n  To me, this Kennedy-Dodd plan suffers from what I call the three Cs: \nit costs too much, it covers too few, and it causes too many people who \nalready have insurance to lose the coverage they have.\n  Some in Congress believe unless we completely dismantle the current \nhealth care system and build it up in the image of big government, then \nreform, they say, is simply not worth doing. I disagree. Americans do \nnot want the same government bureaucracy that has given us the \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles controlling our medical decisions. \nAmericans don't want increased bureaucratic hassles, we don't want long \nwaits, and we don't want restrictions on our medical care.\n  What we need is a serious, transparent health care debate. That is \nwhat Americans want. They want us to listen to their ideas, their \nconcerns, their suggestions. The only way they can give us their ideas, \nconcerns, and specifically their suggestions about a health care bill \nis if they actually get to read the bill.\n  Whether we should reform our health care system is no longer in \nquestion. Americans have answered with a resounding yes, and they don't \nwant to continue to wait. They want simple, practical, affordable \nchanges now: Changes such as prohibiting the use of preexisting \ncondition clauses, changes such as allowing people to take their health \ninsurance with them when they switch jobs. Madam President, you have a \nyoung family; I have a young family. Our children are going to have \nseven or eight jobs over the course of their lifetimes. They will need \nto take their insurance with them. We need to have changes such as \noffering premium breaks for making healthy lifestyle choices, changes \nsuch as having the same tax breaks for people who buy their own \ninsurance as big companies get when they pay for insurance for their \nemployees--we need families to have those same tax breaks. We need \nchanges such as allowing people to shop across State lines to look for \nbetter deals, keeping their costs down.\n  I want to continue to come forward with commonsense ideas. I want the \nmajority in Congress to work with me and with members of my party on a \nbipartisan health reform plan. That is the need. That is the need the \ncountry is expecting us to address. That is what I would like to do. We \ncannot simply put government in charge of health care and put \nbureaucrats in between patients and their doctors.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1370 to Amendment No. 1365\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I hope everyone had a good break. I \ncan't say that I am glad to be back, but there are some important \nthings to do. I start by calling up amendment No. 1370, which is at the \ndesk, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1370 to Amendment No. 1365.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Architect of the Capitol to engrave the Pledge \nof Allegiance to the Flag and the National Motto of ``In God We Trust'' \n                     in the Capitol Visitor Center)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. ENGRAVING OF THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG \n                   AND THE NATIONAL MOTTO IN THE CAPITOL VISITOR \n                   CENTER.\n\n       (a) Engraving Required.--The Architect of the Capitol shall \n     engrave the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag and the National \n     Motto of ``In God We Trust'' in the Capitol Visitor Center, \n     in accordance with the engraving plan described in subsection \n     (b).\n       (b) Engraving Plan.--The engraving plan described in this \n     subsection is a plan setting forth the design and location of \n     the engraving required under subsection (a) which is prepared \n     by the Architect of the Capitol and approved by the Committee \n     on Rules and Administration of the Senate and the Committee \n     on House Administration of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, this amendment is about the Capitol \nVisitor Center. Among other things, we all know the new Capitol Visitor \nCenter, which is very beautiful, welcomes folks from all over the \ncountry and the world to the Capitol. It includes interesting and \nvaluable museum-style exhibits about the history of the Capitol and \nCongress. Unfortunately, the way the Capitol Visitor Center has been \nbuilt and the way the displays have been set up, it conspicuously \nignores America's unique religious heritage and the role that heritage \nplayed in the founding of the Republic. Indeed, the original exhibits \nnow there seem to suggest the Federal Government was the solution to \nall our problems and the fulfillment of all human aspirations, as if we \nwere a government with a nation instead of the other way around. Even \nthe national motto was misrepresented--as out of many, one.\n  My unanimous consent agreement will help correct the record as it is \ndisplayed at the Capitol Visitor Center. It will authorize the \nengraving of our true national motto, which is: In God we trust. It \nwill also order the engraving of the Pledge of Allegiance with its \nreference to one Nation under God in a prominent position in the \nCapitol Visitor Center. From the beginning many of us were concerned \nabout what looked like a historical whitewash of our Nation's faith \nheritage from the Capitol Visitor Center. I thank Senators Feinstein \nand Bennett for their support. I have a letter they both signed \nformalizing our agreement for the historical corrections in my \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                      Rules and Administration\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 2008.\n     Hon. Jim DeMint,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim: After many years of anticipation the Architect of \n     the Capitol is preparing for the opening of the new Capitol \n     Visitor Center (CVC) on December 2, 2008.\n       Delaying the opening of the CVC has serious security \n     implications. The CVC was designed so that public visitors \n     will be screened at one secure location, improving security \n     in the U.S. Capitol for constituents, staff and Members.\n\n[[Page S7124]]\n\n       Delaying the opening of the CVC also has significant \n     financial consequences. As you are aware, the CVC has already \n     cost $621 million for construction. The Architect is \n     currently paying the cost of salaries and benefits for staff \n     preparing to open and operate the facility for the American \n     public. Every day the CVC is closed to the public, it will \n     cost the taxpayer $72,040 in unused staff resources.\n       In response to your letter dated September 25, 2008, we \n     agree in principle to support engraving ``In God We Trust'' \n     in stone in a prominent location within the CVC; engraving \n     ``The Pledge of Allegiance'' in stone in a prominent location \n     within the CVC; and removing the words ``Our Nation's Motto'' \n     from the Unity panel on the Wall of Aspirations of the \n     Exhibition Hall in the CVC, and replacing it with a new \n     panel.\n       We recognize that one of your suggestions (renaming ``Our \n     Nation's Motto'') is a correction, and the ``Pledge'' and \n     ``In God We Trust'' are additions. The approximate cost of \n     doing all three projects, according to the Architect of the \n     Capitol, is $150,000.\n       We are pleased that you have agreed to Senate consideration \n     of the CVC legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dianne Feinstein,\n       Chairman.\n     Robert F. Bennett,\n       Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I also want to make a point about the unfortunate expense \nassociated with these design corrections. I regret these funds must be \nspent. That the historical whitewash of the original design contained \nthese inaccuracies was unfortunate, certainly. But the $150,000 this \nproject will cost is less than 1/10th of 1 percent of the cost of the \nCapitol Visitor Center. Anyone interested in finding offsets can count \non my support in identifying waste in the underlying bill that is \nfunding Congress for next year. When these engravings are completed and \nwhen we can welcome God back into the Capitol Visitor Center, visitors \nto the Capitol will see a fairer and more historically accurate \ndepiction of the all-important relationship between faith and freedom \nin America.\n  I understand the majority is prepared to accept the amendment by a \nvoice vote or unanimous consent.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1370) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1367 to Amendment No. 1365\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I have another amendment I have been \ninformed the majority plans to block consideration of, which is No. \n1367 regarding transparency at the Federal Reserve. I wish nonetheless \nto take a few moments to discuss it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. The unelected central bank of the United States, the \nFederal Reserve, enjoys a monopoly over the flow of our money and \ncredit but has never been completely transparent and accountable to \nCongress since its creation in 1913. Since 1913, our dollar has lost \nmore than 95 percent of its purchasing power. My amendment is called \nthe Federal Reserve sunshine amendment. It is modeled after legislation \nsponsored by Representative Ron Paul of Texas in the House and our \ncolleague Senator Sanders of Vermont in the Senate. This amendment \namends section 714 of title 31 of the United States Code to remove \nexisting restrictions on how the Government Accountability Office can \naudit the Federal Reserve. With these limitations gone, the Fed's \ndiscount window operation, funding facilities, open market operations, \nand agreements with foreign central banks and governments would all be \nfinally open to congressional oversight. The Government Accountability \nOffice would be required to audit the Fed by the end of 2010 and to \nreport its findings to Congress.\n  Every dollar created by the Fed has an effect on the value of the \ndollars in our pockets and bank accounts. We need to pay more attention \nto the effect of Washington decisions, whether fiscal policy made by \nCongress or monetary policy made by the Fed. They all are ultimately \nborne by the American people. The Federal Reserve will create and \ndisburse trillions of dollars in response to our current financial \ncrisis. Americans across the Nation, regardless of their opinion on the \nbailout, want to know where the money has gone, exactly how much has \nbeen spent, and what collateral has been taken in return. That is why \nwe see so much bipartisan support in the House, in Bernie Sanders and \nJim DeMint being on the same side in the Senate. Inflation is a hidden \ntax. We, unfortunately, forget about it too often when we are debating \nspending bills in Congress.\n  Our fiscal actions, higher deficits, increased long-term debt, and \nentitlement obligations will necessarily need to be paid for by \nprinting new money or borrowing more money from an increasingly \nskeptical world. Either option results in higher interest rates for \nconsumers and a devaluing of the dollars they have already earned and \nsaved. Allowing the Fed to operate our Nation's monetary system in \nalmost complete secrecy leads to abuse, inflation, and a lower quality \nof life for every American. Unfortunately, the majority has decided to \nuse a procedural tactic to block a vote on this amendment by invoking \nsomething called rule XVI. This is a rule that prevents policy being \nadded to spending bills. The majority claims we do not legislate on \nappropriations bills. Of course, that is false. In fact, there are \nalready rule XVI violations in the bill we are trying to amend. We saw \nthis majority airdrop the cash for clunkers program into the recent \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  The majority may claim this amendment is not relevant to the \nunderlying bill, but in fact there are already provisions in this bill \nrelated to Government Accountability Office audits, so this language is \nquite appropriate on this bill. The legislation has already received \nthe support of more than one-half of the House of Representatives \nwithin a few short months of its introduction. It is time for the \nSenate to show its support.\n  I ask the majority leader again to allow a vote on amendment 1367 \nregarding a GAO audit of the Federal Reserve.\n  I call up amendment 1367.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1367 to amendment No. 1365.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 31, United States Code, to reform the manner \n   in which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is \naudited by the Comptroller General of the United States and the manner \n       in which such audits are reported, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. AUDIT REFORM AND TRANSPARENCY FOR THE BOARD OF \n                   GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (b) of section 714 of title 31, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking all after ``shall \n     audit an agency'' and inserting a period.\n       (b) Audit.--Section 714 of title 31, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) Audit and Report of the Federal Reserve System.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The audit of the Board of Governors of \n     the Federal Reserve System and the Federal reserve banks \n     under subsection (b) shall be completed before the end of \n     2010.\n       ``(2) Report.--\n       ``(A) Required.--A report on the audit referred to in \n     paragraph (1) shall be submitted by the Comptroller General \n     to the Congress before the end of the 90-day period beginning \n     on the date on which such audit is completed and made \n     available to the Speaker of the House, the majority and \n     minority leaders of the House of Representatives, the \n     majority and minority leaders of the Senate, the Chairman and \n     Ranking Member of the committee and each subcommittee of \n     jurisdiction in the House of Representatives and the Senate, \n     and any other Member of Congress who requests it.\n       ``(B) Contents.--The report under subparagraph (A) shall \n     include a detailed description of the findings and conclusion \n     of the Comptroller General with respect to the audit that is \n     the subject of the report, together with such recommendations \n     for legislative or administrative action as the Comptroller \n     General may determine to be appropriate.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I make a point of order \nagainst the DeMint amendment that it is legislation on appropriations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The \namendment falls.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I regret the objection. Since the other \nside is arguing that rule XVI applies here, my amendment contains \nlanguage to an existing GAO audit of the Federal\n\n[[Page S7125]]\n\nReserve. Because it is legislative in nature--in other words, because \nit actually addresses the audit itself and not just the funds for the \nGeneral Accountability Office--they say it is out of order. I have a \nparliamentary inquiry: Is the language in section 1501(b) dealing with \nan existing GAO audit of the National Transportation Safety Board \nlegislative?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair. Does it violate rule XVI?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does.\n  Mr. DeMINT. So the Democrats are suggesting that it is somehow \nillegitimate for me to offer an amendment dealing with an existing GAO \naudit when they themselves have included language dealing with other \naudits that flatly violates rule XVI.\n  Further parliamentary inquiry: Is the language in section 1501(c) \nregarding a GAO audit of local educational agency spending legislative \nin nature and in violation of rule XVI?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair. What about section 1501(d) which \nrepeals a GAO audit of the small business participation in the Alaska \nnational pipeline; is that legislative in nature and does it violate \nrule XVI?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I have a long list here for which I \nunderstand from the Parliamentarian the answers will continue to be \nyes. We have several provisions, obviously, dealing with the GAO and \nGAO audits in this bill. The other side cannot stand behind a rule they \nhave flagrantly violated themselves.\n  There is an earmark in this bill for Nebraska. It is the only earmark \nin the bill.\n  I would ask the Chair, what about the provision in the Library of \nCongress section containing a $200,000 earmark for the Durham Museum in \nOmaha, NE? Is that a legislative item? And does it violate rule XVI?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is legislative, but the Chair is aware of a \ndefense in germaneness.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Madam President. Then, would it be accurate to \nsay the provision contains legislative language that meets the \ndefinition of rule XVI, even though it is arguably germane to the House \nlanguage?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is legislative in nature.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I think I have made my point, and I will not take this any further. \nClearly, there is a double standard.\n  One of the most sought after amendments we have probably brought up \nin the House and the Senate since I have been here is an audit of the \nFederal Reserve. Everywhere I went last week people were thanking me \nfor finally looking at what the Federal Reserve was doing and trying to \nlet the American people know what is happening.\n  This is an audit that has broad support, and I would encourage my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side to allow this amendment to be voted \non. But, apparently, the other side has decided to challenge it with \nrule XVI, which they do not apply to their own language.\n  But as I said, Madam President, I have probably said enough and I \nthank you for your indulgence.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1366\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 10 minutes of debate, \nequally divided and controlled between the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain, and the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I hope my colleagues will vote to strike \nthis earmark for the Durham Museum in Omaha, NE. Strangely enough, this \namount has been inserted by the Senator from Nebraska--this $200,000 \nfor the Durham Museum in Omaha, NE.\n  Lest there be any confusion about this, in the last tax return of the \nDurham Museum in Omaha, NE, they had $10,917,319. So the museum is \nfairly well off. They have assets of about $11 million. Apparently, the \nSenator from Nebraska thinks they need a couple hundred grand extra--on \nthe Legislative Branch Appropriations bill.\n  Again, I am interested in hearing the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations connection to the Durham Museum in Omaha, NE. I am sure \nit is a fine museum, a wonderful museum, and it gets many visitors from \nall over the great State of Nebraska. I just came from the great State \nof Arizona, and do you know what. Storefronts are closing, people are \nlosing their jobs, and unemployment is up. So what are we doing here in \nWashington, our Nation's capital? Business as usual. But what is an \nearmark of just $200,000? What is $200,000 in the trillions we are \nspending? The legislation says that amount ``shall remain available \nuntil expended for the purpose of preserving, digitizing, and making \navailable historically and culturally significant materials related to \nthe development of Nebraska and the American West.''\n  What makes this museum so needy of the taxpayers' dollars? What is it \nabout the Durham Museum in Omaha, NE, that says we need $200,000? Well, \nthey don't, obviously. They had nearly $11 million in net assets at the \nend of 2007. Why are we earmarking $200,000 of taxpayer funds for this \nmuseum?\n  We should not be earmarking these kinds of funds. This is a \nLegislative Branch Appropriations bill to fund the functioning of \nCongress, the legislative branch, not a museum in Omaha, NE, which I am \nsure is a wonderful place.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. My colleague from Arizona is right. It is a \nwonderful, an outstanding museum.\n  As a quick refresher for my colleagues, this is a project that was \nrequested by the Durham Museum in Omaha, NE. This is a well-respected, \nnot-for-profit organization with a longstanding and close relationship \nwith the Library of Congress.\n  The $200,000 requested in this bill for the Durham Museum to begin \nthe preservation and digitization of the museum's photo archive \ncollection will preserve our history and improve access to these \npriceless treasures.\n  The museum will provide a public service of Federal interest making \nit appropriate to promote a public-private partnership. This truly is a \npublic-private partnership--the funding for the project in this bill is \nonly 10 percent of the total cost. The Durham Museum will privately \nraise the remaining 90 percent and incur all ongoing operating costs.\n  The Library of Congress is an expert in the area of digitization and \npreservation of fragile photos and images. Taking that into \nconsideration with the fact that the library enjoys ``a remarkable \nlong-term relationship with the Durham Museum,'' to use the words of \nthe Librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, it makes this \npartnership worthy of support and further makes this funding \nappropriate in this legislation.\n  To reiterate some of the points I made prior to the recess, this \nproject is more than just a ``photo exhibit.'' In addition to making \nthese images available to the public, the Durham will work with and \nassist the Library of Congress to establish conservation and \npreservation training programs, and on incorporating digitized primary \nsource materials into school curricula.\n  While I understand my colleague and I may disagree on the larger \nphilosophical issue about the role of Congress to set spending \npriorities, I note that this project relates explicitly to the goals \nand purposes of the Library to expand access to our Nation's most \ntreasured documents and artifacts. It will, through this partnership, \nmake these historical images accessible nationally. It is funded here \nfor that reason.\n  Lastly, not all treasures are located inside the beltway. The Durham \nMuseum seeks to preserve a significant collection of images and photos \nthat document the western expansion of this great Nation. These images \nwill include, among others, a number of wonderful images of Presidents \nRoosevelt, Kennedy, and others; growth and development of the \ntranscontinental railroad--the Union Pacific is headquartered in Omaha, \nNE--\n\n[[Page S7126]]\n\nNative American tribes from across the country dating back to the \n1880s; photographs taken by prominent early photographer William Henry \nJackson, who lived and worked briefly in Omaha; stockyards and \nmeatpacking industries, which brought many immigrants and settlers to \nthat part of the country in the early and mid-20th century; early \ntransportation, including steamboats, streetcars, and cityscapes.\n  Again quoting Dr. Billington:\n\n       Digitization of the Durham Museum's nationally significant \n     collection of more than 500,000 images in prints, negatives, \n     and glass plate negatives will greatly enhance citizens' \n     access to these treasures and preserve them for future \n     generations.\n\n  The project will be moved significantly forward by the able \nassistance of the Library of Congress, and I thank Dr. Billington for \nhis willingness to assist with this important project. I ask my \ncolleagues to support its inclusion in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, let me get this straight. We now have an \nunauthorized earmark, and there has never been a hearing or a request \nfrom the administration for this vital project in Omaha, NE. There has \nnever been a hearing of any kind or a request from the administration, \nnor, to my knowledge, scheduling of any kind of hearing on it.\n  Of course, this is one of the classic examples of an earmark being \nput in because of the judgment of a Member of Congress who believes \nthis project is important to his or her State or locality, and there \nhas never been any competition for it. I am sure there are libraries \nall over America--including in Arizona--that would love to have a \ncouple hundred grand to digitize and preserve materials related to the \ndevelopment of the West.\n  Let's get this straight. This is a Legislative Branch Appropriations \nbill intended to fund the legislative activities of the Congress of the \nUnited States, which has some connection to the Library of Congress, \nwhich I imagine that hundreds, if not thousands, of libraries \nthroughout the country do, and then we connect it now as a rationale \nfor $200,000 for the Durham Museum.\n  Again, all I say to my colleague from Nebraska is that Americans are \ntired of earmarking and projects that are not authorized, that there is \nno competition for, but are directly related to the influence of \nMembers of Congress. It is wrong. We should remove this, and we should \nuse this as an example of the kind of fiscal discipline that maybe we \nought to start exercising, and I intend to go to the floor on earmark \nafter earmark, and the American people are going to have tea parties \nall over America in direct objection to the kind of conduct we are \nexercising in Congress. I hope that sooner or later we will listen.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I respectfully urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1366. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from \nWashington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) \nare necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of S. 1294, the\n\n[[Page S7127]]\n\nLegislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2010.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $3.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal year \n2010, which will result in new outlays of $2.6 billion. When outlays \nfrom prior-year budget authority are taken into account, discretionary \noutlays for the bill will total $3.3 billion.\n  The Senate-reported bill is below its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority by $1.5 billion and below its allocation for outlays \nby $1.3 billion. The Senate-reported bill does not include funding for \nHouse-only items. Funding for these items will be included in the \nconference agreement. No points of order lie against the committee-\nreported bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          S. 1294, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               General\n                                                               purpose\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority-......................................        3,136\n    Outlays-...............................................        3,275\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n    Budget Authority-......................................        4,622\n    Outlays-...............................................        4,615\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority-......................................        3,675\n    Outlays-...............................................        3,810\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority-......................................        5,154\n    Outlays-...............................................        4,912\n \n                    Senate-Reported Bill Compared To:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:-\n    Budget Authority -.....................................       -1,486\n    Outlays-...............................................      -1,340-\nHouse-Passed Bill:-\n    Budget Authority -.....................................         -539\n    Outlays-...............................................        -535-\nPresident's Request:-\n    Budget Authority -.....................................       -2,018\n    Outlays-...............................................      -1,637-\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: The Senate-reported bill does not include funding for House-only\n  items.-\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes tonight \ntalking about what is going on in Honduras. I have a lot of friends in \nHonduras, and I have this peculiar worry that we find ourselves on the \nwrong side of freedom in the situation that is happening in Honduras.\n  As you read the press clips, what we have heard is there was a \ncoup. That, in fact, is not true. The Supreme Court of Honduras, under \nthe direction of the Congress, asked the military to intercede because \nthe President of Honduras had violated their own laws. Yet our State \nDepartment and our foreign policy sided with Hugo Chavez, Raoul Castro, \nand the former President.\n\n  There is no question that improvements have been made in the past in \nCentral and South America, but tonight we find ourselves supporting an \nanticonstitutional President of Honduras when, in fact, the Congress of \nHonduras and the Supreme Court of Honduras have said he is violating \ntheir laws. So rather than look at the whole picture, we have decided \nwe will intervene in our diplomacy on the side of a Chavez-type, would-\nbe dictator because what was happening in Honduras was an effort to \nchange so you could have a President for life in Honduras. That is what \nwas going on. That is why the Congress and that is why the Supreme \nCourt of Honduras acted. We now are siding against the people of \nHonduras.\n  What is little known is 800 to 1,000 Venezuelan thugs were admitted \ninto Honduras, in the week prior to this, with Honduran passports to \ncreate chaos or a systematic attempt to create upheaval and discord and \nrioting by Chavez's thugs. So now we find ourselves, the free United \nStates, siding with somebody who wants to make sure the Honduran people \nare not free, to create another petro czar dictator in South Central \nAmerica.\n  It is tremendously important we get this right. I think we are \nheading in the wrong direction right now. I think we are heading in the \ndirection where we are going to make sure Honduras falls into the fold \nof Hugo Chavez, the last thing any of us should want. He has become the \ndictator in charge of Venezuela. He has nationalized American assets. \nHe has corrupted the free Democratic process, and he seeks to do that \nin all the other areas where he can maintain influence. In fact, he was \ndoing it.\n  The other thing that is important that is not well published is that \nthe President of Honduras was totally associated with drug cartels, \ncash, the distribution and transmission of drugs into this country, and \nthe moneys associated with that were used to buy people to support his \npursuit of permanent power. Now we find ourselves out there on a limb \nwith our foreign policy without looking at the whole story.\n  My main concern is about all those people who do want freedom in \nHonduras, who do believe we model in this country what they aspire to, \nand now the country they aspire to is siding against the vast majority \nof the people in Honduras. No illegal acts took place under the orders \nof the supreme court by the military--no illegal acts. Yet we didn't \nlook at it close enough, and we have made now foreign policy decisions \nI fear are going to be irreversible.\n  There is no question things could be done better in Honduras, but \nthere is also no question things could be done better here. For us to \ndecide to side with the factors that are going to force Honduras into a \nsituation similar to Cuba and Venezuela makes my blood boil, because \nnot only are we going to eliminate and limit the freedom of those great \npeople, we are going to help perpetuate the loss of freedom in that \nhemisphere.\n  So I call out to the President and the Secretary to do a \nreassessment. Let's relook at the facts. Let's talk to the people on \nthe ground. Let's make sure we have the facts and the knowledge about \nwhat the vast majority of people\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\nin Honduras want. You can stimulate chaos if you pay enough money and \nbring enough people in to do that, which was the intent of President \nZelaya.\n  My hope is that we will slow down, that we will use caution at every \nturn as we interface with the situation. The Honduran people have the \nright to have their Constitution followed. That is what they did when \nthey executed the imposition of removal of the President of Honduras. \nThey followed their own law, their own Constitution. They don't have \nthe right of impeachment, but they do have the right of carrying out \nthe orders of the supreme court, which were given. For us to take this \nposition--and this strong of a position--on what I feel has been a \ndiplomatic lack of information of what is truth in Honduras speaks \npoorly for us as a nation and, most importantly, undermines the hopes \nof the people from Honduras.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Dr. Zumkley's work to commemorate the 60th anniversary of \nthe Berlin Airlift is truly appreciated.\n  In the spring of 1948, Berlin was isolated within the Soviet \noccupation zone and had only 35 days' worth of food and 45 days' worth \nof coal remaining for the city. A massive American, British, and French \nairlift mounted to save the city and provide supplies necessary to \nsustain life in Berlin. Mr. President, 2008 marked the 60th anniversary \nof the Berlin Airlift, one of the largest and longest running \nhumanitarian airlift operations in history.\n  Dr. Zumkley's group was given the mission to commemorate the 60th \nanniversary of the Berlin Airlift, honor Airlift veterans, and tell the \nstory of this great humanitarian effort. They planned and implemented \nthe successful ``Friends-Always: 60 Years After the Berlin Airlift'' \noutreach program, and designed, produced and managed ``The Berlin \nAirlift--A Legacy of Friendship'' exhibit at more than 25 venues across \nthe United States. It is estimated that more than 150,000 people will \nhave visited the exhibit personally and learned about the legacy of the \nBerlin Airlift during its tour of the United States. Dr. Zumkley \nensured that Airlift veterans personally received the German-American \nFriendship award as an expression of appreciation and gratitude from \nthe German people. Additionally, Dr. Zumkley has worked far above and \nbeyond his duties and displayed outstanding leadership qualities in the \nfulfillment of the team's mission.\n  I know my fellow Senators join me in thanking Dr. Zumkley and his \nteam for their endeavors to promote U.S.-German friendship and to honor \nand celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/06/senate-section/article/S7133-4", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING JANIS LAZDA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I recognize one of the most \ndedicated members of my staff, Janis Lazda. Janis joined the Senate \nFinance Committee in 2005 to work on international trade matters, and \ntoday he leaves us to become senior policy adviser to the Deputy U.S. \nTrade Representative. USTR's gain truly is our loss.\n  For the past 5 years, Janis has demonstrated a quiet intelligence, \nunquestionable loyalty, and an unwavering commitment to the great State \nof Montana and this great country. He has worked hard to keep U.S. \nrelations with Asia strong during these challenging economic times, and \nfocused on improving America's competitiveness around the globe. He has \nspearheaded policies to increase U.S. exports to the world, and \nbrainstormed ways to make international institutions more meaningful.\n  He has performed all of these tasks diligently and with careful \nthought. And he has put the needs of Montanans and the American people \nfirst. Janis has witnessed the majestic mountains of Missoula, the \nbucolic beauty of the Big Hole Valley, and the memorable music of Molt. \nHe met with hard-working people in all of these areas, and across \nMontana, to hear their thoughts and understand their needs. And he used \nthese experiences to ensure that the policies crafted in Washington are \nmeaningful for folks across America.\n  Janis has been a sound and knowledgeable adviser. His experience and \nanalysis have been critical to many of the trade policies formulated by \nthe Finance Committee. I thank Janis for his hard work, and wish him \nwell as he takes the next step to what I am sure will be a brilliant \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/06/senate-section/article/S7133-5", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7133-S7134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n                                  ____\n\n               COMMENDING VICE ADMIRAL BRUCE E. MacDONALD\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I honor VADM Bruce E. \nMacDonald, Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Navy, who is retiring \nafter more than 31 years of faithful service to our Nation, culminating \nin his service as the Judge Advocate General of the Navy.\n  VADM Bruce MacDonald was born in 1956 in Cincinnati, OH. He graduated \nfrom the College of the Holy Cross in 1978 with a bachelor of arts \ndegree in English, and entered the Navy in May of that year.\n  Vice Admiral MacDonald was commissioned an ensign in the unrestricted \nline through the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps. Following \nsurface warfare training, he reported to the USS Hepburn, FF 1055, in \nOctober 1979, where he served as the Main Propulsion Assistant and \nNavigator. After a 2-year tour at Fleet Combat Training Center, \nPacific, where he served as Intermediate Combat Systems Team Training \nand Advanced Multi-Threat Team Training Course Director, he was \nselected for the Navy's Law Education Program in 1984. He received his \ndegree of Juris Doctor from California Western School of Law in 1987.\n  In 1987, Vice Admiral MacDonald reported to Naval Legal Service \nOffice, San Diego, where he served as Senior Defense Counsel, Trial \nCounsel, and Medical Care Recovery Act claims officer. In 1990, he \nreported aboard USS Independence, CV 62, as the Command Judge Advocate. \nAfter receiving a master of laws degree from Harvard Law School in \n1992, he was transferred to Seoul, Republic of Korea, where he served \nas Chief, Operational Law Division, on the staffs of United Nations \nCommand, Combined Forces Command and United States Forces Korea. He \nalso served as Staff Judge Advocate on the staff of U.S. Naval Forces \nKorea.\n  In August 1994, Vice Admiral MacDonald reported aboard Naval Legal \nService Office Northwest as its executive officer. In November 1996, he \nbecame the Officer-in-Charge of Trial\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\nService Office West Detachment, Bremerton, WA. In July 1997, he \nreported to Commander Seventh Fleet in Yokosuka, Japan, as the Fleet \nJudge Advocate. Vice Admiral MacDonald assumed command of Naval Legal \nService Office, Northwest, in August 1999, serving as commanding \nofficer until June 2002. He was assigned to the Pentagon as the Special \nCounsel to the Chief of Naval Operations from June 2002 through October \n2004. In November 2004, Vice Admiral MacDonald became the Deputy Judge \nAdvocate General of the Navy and Commander, Naval Legal Service \nCommand. In July 2006, Vice Admiral MacDonald assumed his current \nposition as Judge Advocate General of the Navy.\n  Vice Admiral MacDonald is admitted to practice before the courts of \nthe State of California and the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of California. His military decorations include the Navy \nDistinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with two Gold Stars, \nthe Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Meritorious Service \nMedal with Gold Star, the Navy Commendation Medal with Gold Star, and \nthe Navy Achievement Medal with Gold Star.\n  It is through the commitment and sacrifice of Americans such as Vice \nAdmiral MacDonald that our Nation is able to continue upon the path of \ndemocracy and strive for the betterment of mankind. I am proud to thank \nhim, his wife Karen, and daughter Erin for his honorable service to our \nnation in the U.S. Navy. I wish him fair winds and following seas as he \nconcludes a distinguished naval career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/06/senate-section/article/S7134-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING VINCE NESCI\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I recognize Vince Nesci who, \nin a few months, will retire from Amtrak after 33 years as its chief \nmechanical officer. Vince has dedicated his adult life to improving \npassenger rail transportation in America, and I wish him the very best \nin retirement.\n  Railroaders are not employed; they serve, and Vince's retirement will \nculminate a lifetime of service to the railroad and country. He began \nhis service in the Air Force as a flight engineer, flying on the \nremarkably durable C-130 Hercules transports. He performed aerial \ndelivery missions of every kind--paratroop drops, low altitude \nequipment and cargo drops, and heavy equipment drops.\n  After leaving the Air Force, Vince went to work on the Penn Central \nRailroad in 1974. Since that day, he has never drawn a paycheck that \nwasn't issued by a railroad. He began in the traditional way, as a \nlaborer in the mechanical department, working on the famous GG-1 class \nelectric engines that Penn Central had inherited from its 1930s-era \npredecessor, the Pennsylvania Railroad. He qualified as an electrician \nand a machinist, putting his natural engineering aptitude to the task \nof learning the tics and tricks of 40-year-old locomotives with \nmillions of miles on them.\n  His skill was rewarded, and he rose through the ranks. Promotion \nfollowed promotion, and he soon became a foreman and then a general \nforeman with Penn Central. When Amtrak took over its labor force from \nthe freight railroads, Vince continued the unforgiving job of making \nsure that engines and cars would be ready to roll when the minute hand \ntouched the top of the hour in Washington, Boston, or New York each \nday. He was there to work on each generation of new engines and to \nsupervise the men and women who were working on them. He witnessed the \nend of the GG-1s and saw three new generations of locomotives emerge \nfor Northeast Corridor service.\n  When the time came to rebuild the 20-year-old AEM-7 locomotives in \n2001, Vince took on the job as the company's chief mechanical officer. \nThis was a demanding job, and the shops accomplished it in large part \nbecause Vince was there to keep the process moving, to wade into a \nproblem on the shop floor, and to figure out the answers to tough \ntechnical questions that manuals and instructions couldn't answer. He \nwas no mere manager--he was that very traditional combination of expert \npractical mechanic, engineer, and operating man that railroad chief \nmechanical officers have always had to be. And through some of the \ntoughest times Amtrak has ever faced, when money to keep the trains on \nthe road was scarce, he kept things moving. He was famous on the \nrailroad for his good humor, his skill, and his understanding of how \nlocomotives worked. He was liked, but more importantly, he was \nrespected, and his opinion carried weight in both the board room and on \nthe shop floor.\n  Vince begins almost every day of his work with a smile. There is \nhardly ever a time that, when you talk to Vince, he does not greet your \nquestions or begin his answers without a smile. When he talks about the \ncars and locomotives in his care, he speaks quickly because he is \nenthusiastic and wants you to feel the enthusiasm he has for the work \nhe does. Whether the temperature is 100 degrees or 10 below zero, Vince \nalways wears a short-sleeved white cotton shirt. If one asks him why he \nonly wears a short-sleeved shirt, he will tell you without a moment's \nhesitation that when you wear short sleeves, you don't have to roll up \nyour sleeves when you get to work.\n  People like Vince Nesci don't come along very often, and when they \ndo, we should be thankful that we get to spend time with them and learn \nfrom them. The railroad is a better and safer place because of Vince, \nand the good news is that he has helped train a cadre of people who \nwill be there after he leaves to carry on the work that needs to be \ndone.\n  Now he has come to the end of his long career, and will soon depart \ninto a well-earned retirement. His working life has encompassed the \ntransformation of the Northeast Corridor, from a tentative experiment \nto a modern, high-speed intercity passenger rail system. Nobody has \nworked harder than Vince to build the railroad that may one day become \na model for transportation in our country, and no one can take more \njustified pride in the safe, reliable, and frequent passenger rail \nservice that travelers enjoy today than Vince Nesci.\n  I thank Vince for the warm friendship that we share, and I \ncongratulate him on a truly remarkable and distinguished career. I wish \nhim, his wife Donna, and their family the very best in all that lies \nahead for each of them. As we say in the Navy on occasions like this, \n``fair winds and a following sea.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/06/senate-section/article/S7134-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              150TH ANNIVERSARY OF JEFFERSON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 150th \nanniversary of the founding of Jefferson, SD. This community in \nsoutheastern South Dakota has a rich heritage, as well as a promising \nfuture.\n  Jefferson was first settled in 1859 by three families on the site of \nLewis and Clark's first settlement in South Dakota. Its original name \nwas Adelescat after young girl, Adele, lost her cat and all the \nsettlers joined together to find it. In 1876, the town built their \nGrasshopper Cross to keep their crops safe after 2 particularly hard \nyears. The town was formally organized in 1885 after the arrival of the \nrailroad and renamed for President Thomas Jefferson.\n  The people of Jefferson celebrate this momentous occasion on the \nweekend of July 10-12, 2009. South Dakota's small communities are the \nbedrock of our economy and vital to the future of our State. One \nhundred and fifty years after its founding, Jefferson remains a \nprogressive community and a great asset to the wonderful State of South \nDakota. I am proud to honor Jefferson on this historic \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/06/senate-section/article/S7134-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7134-S7135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING MARIA CAROLINA HINESTROSA\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of the people of \nMaryland, and breast cancer fighters worldwide, I wish to express my \nheartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Ms. Carolina \nHinestrosa, who passed away last week after battling soft tissue \nsarcoma, a side effect of past breast cancer treatment. Ms. Hinestrosa \nserved for 5 years as the executive vice president of the National \nBreast Cancer Coalition, in which capacity she fought passionately for \nthe coalition's work to eradicate breast cancer. My thoughts and \nprayers are with Ms. Hinestrosa's family and friends during this \ndifficult time.\n  After a 1994 breast cancer diagnosis, Ms. Hinestrosa turned her \nsuffering into an opportunity when she joined\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\nwith a group of survivors and health care professionals to form Nueva \nVida, the only comprehensive support network for Latinas with breast \nand cervical cancer in the Washington metropolitan area.\n  As executive director of Nueva Vida, Ms. Hinestrosa gave voice to the \nstruggles of Latinas with breast cancer, representing them on the board \nof directors of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and the National \nCancer Institute's Central Institutional Review Board. She also played \na leading role in the development of the International Latina Breast \nCancer Advocacy Network.\n  While serving as executive vice president of the National Breast \nCancer Coalition, Ms. Hinestrosa was a member of many national panels \nincluding the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program and \nnumerous committees for the Institute of Medicine. Most recently she \nwas an appointee to the IOM Committee on Comparative Effective \nResearch.\n  Ms. Hinestrosa is remembered by those who knew her as an \nextraordinary woman who contributed so much to women's health, breast \ncancer, and minority rights. An outpouring of admiration has come from \nthe many people she touched.\n  Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said \nMs. Hinestrosa ``was incredibly brilliant, analytical and at the same \ntime warm and compassionate. Nothing intimidated Carolina because of \nher determination to change the system.'' Director of the National \nCancer Institute John Niederhuber wrote ``she was a remarkable woman. \nShe was the type of person who you never forgot encountering. She was \nsmart and passionate; committed and accomplished. The cancer community \nhas lost an important voice.'' The director of the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality, Carolyn Clancy, worked frequently with \nCarolina and wrote that ``her legacy is that patients and consumers are \nrecognized voices in efforts to improve health care quality. Her \ncontribution has inspired physicians, scientists, employers to focus on \npatients needs.''\n  Ms. Hinestrosa was born in Bogota, Columbia, and came to the United \nStates in 1985 on a Fulbright scholarship to pursue a master's in \neconomics. Carolina impacted countless people in her work both here in \nWashington, DC, and elsewhere. She was just 50 years old at the time of \nher passing and leaves behind a husband and daughter.\n  We must carry on Ms. Hinestrosa's work in eradicating breast cancer \nfrom our midst. Until then, we must continue to support one another and \nhonor the legacy of passion and commitment that Carolina left \nbehind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/06/senate-section/article/S7135-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING KEVIN McENEANEY\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN.

A bill to direct the Administrator of the United States \nAgency for International Development to carry out a pilot program to \npromote the production and use of fuel-efficient stoves engineered to \nproduce significantly less black carbon than traditional stoves, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to reduce \nthe production of black carbon, a potent contributor to global climate \nchange. I am pleased to be joined on this bill by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, as the lead cosponsor.\n  Black carbon is a particulate produced during the incomplete \ncombustion of carbon-containing materials. It has been estimated to \nhave, on an equivalent mass basis, more than 500 times the global \nwarming potential of carbon dioxide. Reducing the production of black \ncarbon would help stabilize the global climate.\n  Black carbon is produced by some events, such as forest fires, that \ncannot easily be corrected by Senate actions. My bill addresses a \nmechanism of black carbon production that we can influence.\n  Throughout the world today, an estimated two billion people cook with \nsolid fuels over an open fire or with primitive stoves. More than 50 \npercent of the controllable black carbon emissions in the world are due \nto these practices. Modern stoves, designed to efficiently burn fuel, \ncan eliminate up to 90 percent of the black carbon produced during \ncooking and home heating.\n  Additionally, cooking and heating with poorly designed stoves emits \nnoxious gases and particulates. Experts believe that these pollutants \ncause the premature deaths of over 1 million people, chiefly women and \nchildren, each year. Replacing these stoves with modern alternatives \nwill strongly reduce the number of these deaths. There is a real need \nto find alternatives to those poorly performing stoves to improve \nglobal environmental and human health.\n  The U.S. Agency for International Development carries out activities \nunder a number of existing projects to place low-cost, fuel efficient \nstoves in poor communities. It has found that, to be successful, the \nnew stoves must be customized to fit the needs and cooking traditions \nof the community. These programs have had a very positive impact. But, \nthey have not had the resources to optimize stoves to minimize black \ncarbon emissions.\n  Our bill authorizes $1 million per year for 2 years for the U.S. \nAgency for International Development to conduct a pilot program to \ndevelop and test stoves that optimize both fuel efficiency and black \ncarbon reduction.\n  This measure addresses an issue, global climate change, that we must \ntake very seriously. It also provides funding that, while addressing an \nimportant global pollutant, also alleviates a public health disaster \naffecting developing nations. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7143]]\n\n                                S. 1396\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to establish a \nmarket for the trading of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Carbon \nMarket Oversight Act, which is cosponsored by Senator Snowe.\n  I believe this bill is necessary to ensure that future markets \ncreated by proposed climate change legislation are transparent and free \nfrom manipulation.\n  Our legislation would establish a comprehensive framework to regulate \nboth primary and derivative carbon markets at the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, CFTC.\n  Trading would be transparent and electronically monitored.\n  Manipulation, fraud, and excessive speculation would be prohibited, \nand violations would be severely punished.\n  All carbon permits and standardized carbon derivatives would have to \nbe traded through facilities that monitor trading, establish fair \ntrading rules, and follow established regulatory principles.\n  All standardized contracts would have to be cleared through a \ncentralized counterparty clearinghouse, to reduce systemic risk.\n  CFTC would maintain a centralized position accounting system to \nmonitor all large traders across multiple markets.\n  Traders, dealers, and brokers would have to be educated, would have \nto pass an exam to demonstrate competence, and would need to maintain \ncertification.\n  Bottom line: the legislation would use lessons learned in other \nmarkets to establish the most comprehensive and efficient market \noversight structure in the U.S.\n  This legislation is necessary because cap and trade legislation would \ncreate, in an unprecedented manner, an extremely large new financial \nmarket.\n  Without regulation, this market would likely emerge quickly into one \nof the largest over-the-counter derivatives markets in the world.\n  Resources for the Future Economist Dallas Burtraw recently testified \nin Congress that putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions through \n``a cap and trade program would constitute the greatest creation of \ngovernment-enforced property rights since the 19th century.''\n  Depending on the stringency of the cap, the breadth of the program, \nand the cost containment measures employed, the annual value of the \npollution permits alone is estimated to range from $100 billion to $370 \nbillion. Secondary markets for futures, options, and over-the-counter \nderivatives are expected to be considerably larger than that market.\n  If we fail to establish a framework for oversight, the greenhouse gas \nmarket could turn into a wild west.\n  The market would invite the worst kind of manipulation, fraud, and \nabuse.\n  The resulting volatility would affect consumer energy costs and harm \nthe environmental goals of the system.\n  My concerns regarding the emergence of new over-the-counter \nderivatives markets are based on real experience, not hypothetical \nsituations.\n  In 2000 and 2001, newly created California energy markets lacked the \nbasic protections proposed in this legislation.\n  Specifically, there was no federal oversight to assure transparency, \nno limits on speculation, no prohibition on manipulation, no \nrequirements to prevent systemic risk, no monitoring of trading to \naddress price spikes and irregularities, and no professional \nrequirements to ensure that energy traders and dealers knew the law and \nfollowed a professional code of conduct.\n  In short, the electricity and related natural gas markets emerged \nbefore the law caught up, and much of the manipulation that resulted, \nshock-\ningly, was legal.\n  The market that looked more like the wild west than an efficient \nprice discovery tool.\n  Enron, for instance, ran a market where only it knew the prices. It \nwas able to manipulate natural gas and electricity prices beyond the \nview of any third party, and it swindled the people of California to \nthe tune of billions of dollars.\n  Not until enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, years after the \ncrisis, were we able to amend the Natural Gas Act and the Federal Power \nAct to clarify that this manipulation was unlawful.\n  Not until the Farm Bill in 2008 were we able to close the infamous \n``Enron Loophole'' that had allowed Enron to operate an unregulated \nelectronic energy trading exchange in which prices were not public, \nspeculation was unlimited, and there was no audit trail.\n  More recently, our government failed to establish a regulatory \nframework for over-the-counter, OTC, credit default swap and energy \nderivative markets.\n  First, energy swaps markets wreaked havoc on oil and other energy \ncommodity prices during the speculative energy bubble of 2008.\n  Then, credit default swaps emerged from the shadows to bring our \nentire financial system to the brink of collapse.\n  According to the Treasury Department's recent report titled Financial \nRegulatory Reform: A New Foundation, a ``lax regulatory regime for OTC \nderivatives'' can be blamed for creating a situation in which \n``regulators were unable to identify or mitigate the enormous systemic \nthreat that had developed.''\n  The Obama administration has called for Congress to rectify this \nfailure by giving regulators tools to provide transparency, limit \nexcessive speculation, require margins, and require clearing and other \nsystemic risk mitigation measures.\n  First in California, then in energy derivatives markets, and finally \nin financial swaps markets, we have learned the same three lessons.\n  First, unregulated and non-transparent markets do not perform the \nprice discovery function effectively. They are more volatile than \nsupply and demand can explain.\n  Second, transparency leads to informed buyers and sellers, improving \nmarket functionality and price discovery. Economics stands on a basic \ntenet: perfect markets require perfect information. The more \ntransparent the market, the more likely it is functioning efficiently.\n  Third, totally unregulated markets are prone to increased risk taking \nand manipulative schemes that can bring about market failure, posing a \nrisk to our financial system.\n  In each of the cases I have described, we in government have learned \nthese lessons the hard way.\n  A systemic or near-systemic collapse in each market reminded us that \nregulation plays an essential role in market functionality.\n  Scientists tell us that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by \napproximately 80 percent by 2050, and\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\neconomists believe that a cap and trade system with a greenhouse gas \nemissions allowance market would be the most cost-efficient way to \nguarantee specified levels of emissions reductions.\n  The economists also tell us that markets are most efficient when: \nbuyers and sellers have complete information, no market participant can \ncheat another, and prices result from supply and demand, not \nmanipulation.\n  That is why we need to prevent manipulation, fraud, and a lack of \ntransparency.\n  Senator Snowe and I introduce this legislation today so that we will \nnot have to learn the lessons taught by recent unregulated over-the-\ncounter derivatives markets one more time.\n  We propose to establish mature and effective regulation for this \nmarket before it booms, busts, and threatens our economic wellbeing.\n  Our legislation would establish a transparent carbon market governed \nby proven regulatory principles and practices to maintain stable prices \nthat reflect supply and demand, including: transparency. We know that \ntransparency can be provided by requiring reporting, record keeping, \nand publication of trading information.\n  Position Limits. We know that speculation can be limited by imposing \ncomprehensive, aggregate position limits across multiple markets.\n  Monitoring. We know that fraud and manipulation can be prevented and \nidentified by active, electronic monitoring of trading.\n  Clearing. We know that systemic risk can be mitigated by requiring \nmargins and central counterparty clearing through a CFTC regulated \nclearing house.\n  Professional Standards. We know that trader and dealer abusive \nbehavior can be controlled and punished if traders and dealers are \ngoverned by a code of conduct.\n  Bottom line: this legislation is vital to protecting the market \nintegrity of greenhouse gas emissions markets, and it should be \nincluded as part of any cap and trade legislation approved by Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 207\n\n       Whereas the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the largest \n     spectator sporting facility in the world, with more than \n     250,000 permanent seats;\n       Whereas founders Carl G. Fisher, Arthur C. Newby, Frank H. \n     Wheeler, and James A. Allison pooled their resources in 1909 \n     to build the Indianapolis Motor Speedway 5 miles from \n     downtown Indianapolis as a testing ground to support the \n     growing automotive industry of Indiana;\n       Whereas, on August 14, 1909, the first motorized races, \n     using motorcycles, took place on the recently completed 2.5-\n     mile oval, which had a racing surface composed of crushed \n     stone and tar;\n       Whereas, on August 19, 1909, the first 4-wheeled automobile \n     races at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway took place;\n       Whereas, for 63 days in late 1909, 3,200,000 paving bricks, \n     each weighing 9.5 pounds, were laid on top of the crushed \n     stone and tar surface to upgrade the Indianapolis Motor \n     Speedway, leading the facility to be nicknamed ``The \n     Brickyard'';\n       Whereas a 3-foot horizontal strip of that original brick \n     remains exposed at the start and finish line, known as the \n     ``Yard of Bricks'';\n       Whereas, on May 30, 1911, the first Indianapolis 500-mile \n     race (in this preamble referred to as the ``Indianapolis \n     500'') took place and was won by Ray Harroun at an average \n     speed of 74.602 miles per hour;\n       Whereas the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was a pioneer in \n     introducing seating areas specifically for people with \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas the race car of Ray Harroun, the Marmon ``Wasp'', \n     was the first automobile to use a rearview mirror, one of \n     many innovations in automotive technology and safety devised \n     or developed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, including in \n     1911 the first use of a Pace Car, in 1921 the first use of 4-\n     wheel hydraulic brakes, in 1935 the first installation of \n     color warning lights, in 1935 the first mandatory use of \n     helmets, in 1993 the first use of crash-data recorders, and \n     in 2002 the steel and foam energy reduction\n\n[[Page S7150]]\n\n     (SAFER) barrier, an energy-absorbing barrier affixed to \n     concrete walls that has become the standard at all major oval \n     tracks in the United States;\n       Whereas the Indianapolis 500, the largest single-day \n     spectator sporting event in the world, has occurred on every \n     Memorial Day weekend since 1911, except during the \n     involvement of the United States in world wars from 1917 \n     through 1918 and 1942 through 1945;\n       Whereas, in 1977, Janet Guthrie became the first woman to \n     compete in the Indianapolis 500, making the competition the \n     first and only major sport in which men and women compete, \n     according to the same rules, against one another;\n       Whereas, in 1991, Willy T. Ribbs became the first of \n     several African-American drivers to compete in the \n     Indianapolis 500;\n       Whereas, in 2005, Danica Patrick became the first female \n     driver to lead the Indianapolis 500 when she took the lead \n     near the 140-mile mark;\n       Whereas, in 2009, Helio Castroneves became a 3-time winner \n     of the Indianapolis 500 and Danica Patrick finished in third \n     place, the best finish ever by a woman in the sport;\n       Whereas the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, by hosting the \n     IndyCar Series, the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, the MotoGP \n     Series, and the Formula One Series, is the only facility in \n     the world that has played host to 4 elite racing series;\n       Whereas nearly every international motorsport icon has \n     competed and won at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, \n     including A.J.
