Mr. President, following remarks of the leaders, the Senate \nwill be in a period of morning business for an hour, with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. The first half hour will \nbe controlled by the Democrats, the second by the Republicans.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to executive \nsession to resume postcloture debate on the nomination of Patricia \nSmith to be Solicitor for the Department of Labor. I would note this is \nanother one of the endless delays we have had to go through. We are in \npostcloture; 30 hours of doing nothing. We have had so many 30 hours of \ndoing nothing it is hard to comprehend the wasted time--all the staff, \nSenators' time that could be better put to use. People could be \ndrafting legislation, on and on, contemplating what could be done but \nfor this endless stalling we have seen.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly caucus \nmeetings. Following disposition of the Smith nomination, whenever that \nmight be, the Senate will proceed to vote on the nomination of Martha \nJohnson to be Administrator of the largest real estate organization in \nthe world, the General Services Administration. It is difficult to \ncomprehend, but that has been without a leader because of what has been \ngoing on and the stalls that have taken place, so we had to file \ncloture.\n  We will notify Senators when the votes are scheduled. I would like to \nfinish Patricia Smith at a reasonable hour today. That is immediately \nfollowing a simple majority vote for her. Then there is a 60-vote \nmargin on cloture on the future Administrator of the General Services \nAdministration and then there is 30 hours after that.\n  We will do tomorrow as we did for the Republicans when they had their \nretreat last Wednesday; we were not in session. We don't wish to be in \nsession tomorrow. We have the President coming to our retreat and a \nnumber of other special guests, but if we have to come in tomorrow, \neither before or after the retreat, we are going to have to do that to \nmeet the burdens of this endless stalling that is taking place in the \nSenate.\n  When a young Nigerian terrorist boarded an airplane bound for America \non Christmas Day, there was no permanent boss at the TSA, the agency \nresponsible for the safety of our airports. This agency was created \nafter 9/11 specifically to keep air travel safe. When he tried to blow \nup that plane, the top positions at both the intelligence agencies \nwithin the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security \nwere empty. Why? Because Republican Senators refused to let this body \nhold a vote on these highly capable people the President has asked to \nserve in these roles.\n  We all know Republicans have dedicated themselves to grinding the \nGovernment to a halt. They do so openly and proudly and boast about \ntheir aversion to compromise. That is why, time and time again, they \nexploit the rules of the Senate and abuse this body's procedural \ntraditions. That is why they have wasted countless hours and shattered \nremarkable records for stubbornness. That is why, when we\n\n[[Page S402]]\n\nhave faced questions of national security, they have answered with \npolitics.\n  Republicans have repeatedly asked fearful families to put their \nconcerns on hold while they score political points, they think, by \nplaying partisan games. This is not a game.\n  An embarrassingly high number of critical national security officials \nremain unable to go to work. For political reasons, a handful of \nRepublican Senators are standing between these experts and their \noffices. That means they are also standing between the American people \nand the American people's security.\n  Too many of the President's nominees for critical national security \njobs await Senate confirmation. Today, I wish to talk about four of \nthose positions Republicans refuse to fill; one, the Under Secretary of \nDefense for Personnel and Readiness, which is the No. 3 job at the \nPentagon. We have Secretary Gates, we have one other individual, and \nthen we have this Under Secretary of Defense--whose position is not \nfilled.\n  No. 2, Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, \nthe head of the State Department's Intelligence Department. Think about \nthat. When Secretary Clinton is called to go to Pakistan, Afghanistan \nor anyplace in the world, her arm, the intelligence arm, the security \ndepartment, must be able to give her information as to what is going \non, what has gone on, what is going to go on in the future. Not with \nthis State Department. The Republicans will not let this person be \nchosen.\n  Third, Under Secretary of Homeland Security, again, for Intelligence. \nThis person is head of the Department of Homeland Security's \nintelligence arm. Just like there is no one today at the State \nDepartment, there is no one at the Department of Homeland Security \ndealing with intelligence. It is hard to comprehend, but that is true.\n\n  Finally, the U.S. Representative for the Conference on Disarmament, \nwhose job is to work with other nations to keep our own people safe \nfrom nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The President has \nchosen exceptionally qualified men and women for these jobs, but \nwithout a Senate vote confirming them as our Constitution requires, \nthey cannot do those jobs.\n  Let's talk about the Pentagon. For the first job I mentioned, the No. \n3 job at the Pentagon, the President has nominated GEN Clifford \nStanley. For 33 years, Dr. Stanley, General Stanley has served our \ncountry in the Marine Corps and in communities where he and his family \nhave lived. After serving bravely as a marine infantry officer, he went \non to become quite an academic, served as a White House fellow. He was \nhead of the Nation's largest nonprofit sector scholarship organization. \nHe was asked to come back.\n  He is not a controversial nominee. The Senate Armed Services \nCommittee approved him unanimously but on the Senate floor, no, not \nGeneral Stanley. He would not only be a pivotal part of the Pentagon's \nsenior leadership, he would also be in charge of making sure \nservicemembers are prepared for war at a time we are waging two of them \nand as we plan to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, a surge I \nknow my Republican colleagues support.\n  Our military leaders have told me his absence is having a negative \nimpact on the Pentagon's operations. I have received phone calls: \nSenator Reid, what are you going to do to get this person approved?\n  I tell them I am doing my best. Now we wasted all week--that is what \nit will wind up being--on two nominees, one to be the Solicitor for the \nLabor Department and the other to be the head of the General Services \nAdministration. If people are serious about giving our troops the tools \nthey need to succeed in battle and at home--and I am confident the \nRepublicans must think that--we should be and they should be as \ncommitted to giving our military the leader who will be going to work \nevery day and making sure that happens.\n  Let's talk about intelligence, these agencies that try to find out \nwhat the enemy is doing. The second and third positions I mentioned \nearlier are the two intelligence roles at the Department of State and \nHomeland Security, as I mentioned. For the State Department position, \nPresident Obama has nominated Ambassador Phil Goldberg. Similar to \nGeneral Stanley, Ambassador Goldberg is not a controversial or partisan \nnominee. In fact, it was President Bush who gave him the title of \nAmbassador when he made Goldberg our top diplomat in Bolivia.\n  I traveled to Bolivia, the first Senate congressional delegation I \ncan ever remember going to Bolivia. Ambassador Goldberg was there--so \nimpressive. Ambassador Goldberg has also led law enforcement \nintelligence and nonproliferation efforts in countries such as Kosovo \nand North Korea. He is head of the State Department's intelligence \nbranch. He would work with our ambassadors around the world and be the \nSecretary of State's top intelligence adviser. But, no, he is going to \nhave to wait; this intelligence aspect of the Department of State can \nwait.\n  The assistant leader, my friend, Senator Durbin, was at the State \nDepartment today learning from the Secretary of State about some of the \nissues facing our country, meeting with Secretary Clinton. It is a \nshame Ambassador Goldberg cannot go to work, but he can't.\n  For the Homeland Security position, the President has nominated Caryn \nWagner. She, too, is highly qualified for this role, having held a \nnumber of senior positions in the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence and Officer of the Director of National Intelligence and \nthe National Intelligence Program. As Homeland Security's top \nintelligence official, Wagner would be responsible for ensuring the \nDepartment's partners at State, local and tribal levels--and private \nsector--have the information they need to keep us safe from the bad \nfolks around the world.\n  As far as disarmament, the fourth nominee I mentioned is Ambassador \nLaura Kennedy. President Obama asked her to serve as our Nation's \nrepresentative to the conference on disarmament. This group is \nresponsible for negotiating multilateral arms control and disarmament \nagreements such as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Biological \nWeapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons Convention--some big \nissues. Ambassador Kennedy is a member of the Senior Foreign Service \nand has worked with the State Department and Bureau of European and \nEurasian Affairs, the United Nations, the National War College, and as \nPresident Bush's Ambassador to Turkmenistan.\n  Of all the countries with nuclear weapons, the United States, our \ngreat country, is the only one that does not have a representative at \nthe negotiating table of the Conference on Disarmament. Why? Because \nthe Republicans are stalling everything. That is unacceptable. We need \nto confirm her. We need to have confirmed her a long time ago.\n  But it is not just those cases, it is many others. It is clear these \npositions are critical to our national security, as I talked about, and \nequally evident that these nominees are well-qualified, nonpartisan \npublic servants. What is not clear is why our Republican colleagues \nrefuse to bring them up for a vote. Senate Republicans are simply so \nopposed to everything, absolutely everything, they even opposed putting \npeople in some of the most important positions of our Government, \npeople who were originally appointed by President Bush to positions of \nhigh standing.\n  These are not isolated cases, they are part of an endless and \nreckless pattern. As with candidates for the President's Cabinet and \nother top administration posts and numerous Federal judges, Republicans \nhave decided the President does not deserve to have his nominees \nreviewed by the Senate, as the Constitution clearly States. Ignore him, \nis what they say.\n  This obstruction could not have come at a more dangerous time. I was \ncoming to work and was in an elevator. I looked and there was an \nextremely impressive woman, she had on a coat, and I could see she had \na uniform on. She said, ``I am Dr. Benjamin, the Surgeon General of the \nUnited States.'' I heard so much about this Alabama physician who \ndedicated her life to taking care of poor people. I was so happy to \nmeet her. Then I remembered how long we had to wait to get her \nconfirmed.\n  The obstruction could not come at a more dangerous time, given what \nis going on in the country. The Republicans blocked a vote on our \nSurgeon\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\nGeneral, Dr. Benjamin, as I just mentioned, even when the President \ndeclared H1N1 as a national emergency. They blocked a vote on the top \nHomeland Security official in science and technology, and that was even \nas the Nation braced for both a flu pandemic and bioterror threats.\n  The list seems endless. While our sons and daughters are fighting in \nIraq and rebuilding that nation, last year Republicans delayed the \nconfirmations of America's Ambassador to Iraq. And while our troops \nserve bravely in Afghanistan, Republicans delayed the confirmation of \nLTG Stanley McChrystal, our new commander in that difficult war.\n  This clearly is not the way the Senate is supposed to work. It is not \neven the way it typically works. As I have pointed out before, it took \nonly 4 months for President Obama to face as many filibusters of his \nnominees as President Bush faced in his entire first 4 years. This \nRepublican caucus over here proudly says: We blocked as many of \nPresident Obama's nominees in 4 months as you--over here on this side \nof the aisle--took 4 years to block. Democrats have no interest in \nplaying these games. That is why we did not do what they are doing. No \nother minority has ever done anything like this before. This is one of \na kind.\n  It would be one thing if Republicans, bound together in unified \nopposition to everything, as they have made their custom, voted against \nthese vital nominees. It would be one thing if they reviewed their \nresumes, brought the nominees before the appropriate committees, and \ndecided they were not fit to serve. But that is not what is happening. \nInstead, simply to waste time, Republicans are refusing to let the \nSenate vote at all. When these nominees do finally come before this \nbody, you would be surprised--many of them pass unanimously after they \nhave stalled for days and days. You shouldn't be surprised, but it is \nenough to make you feel uneasy in the stomach that these people who are \nconcerned with the security of our Nation are being stopped from being \nable to go to work by virtue of the Republican party of no.\n  These Senators are ignoring their responsibilities to confirm or \nreject the men and women our Commander in Chief has chosen to help lead \nthis Nation to safety. They are abdicating their responsibility to the \nAmerican people to keep us safe. They are certainly not putting country \nfirst as advertised.\n  Here is the bottom line: My Republican colleagues are basing their \njudgment on the political party doing the nominating rather than the \nperson being nominated. This irresponsible partisanship does not merely \npoison our political system, it endangers our national security.\n  I have no doubt our friends on the other side realize that when we \nkeep a critical office empty in the Pentagon, the State Department, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, we are not keeping the American people \nsafe. They know what they are doing, and they know what they are doing \nis dangerous. If they do not, they certainly should. That makes these \npartisan games all the more disgraceful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/02/senate-section/article/S403-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week at the State of the Union \nAddress, President Obama laid out the challenges facing America--they \nare many--and he called on us to rise above partisanship to try to find \ngood solutions for America. I think most Americans agree with that. Oh, \nthere are some Yellow Dog Democrats and some hard-shell Republicans who \nsay: Never compromise, never, but they do not represent the majority of \nAmerica. The majority of the American people could care less about \nDemocrats and Republicans. They worry about this Nation and its future. \nThey worry about their families, their neighborhoods, their schools, \nand they wonder why we squabble so much here and spend so much time \ntied up in knots over arguments that do not make any sense.\n  I just heard the majority leader describe four individuals who have \nstepped up when the President asked them to and said: We will serve. Do \nyou know what it means when you say you will serve? It means the FBI \nlooks through every aspect of your life. You fill out lengthy \nquestionnaires, you prepare yourself to go before a committee and be \nasked questions about every aspect of your life, personal and public. \nYou submit your name to the press to let them look through everything \nas well. And then you bring your name, of course, to the floor of the \nSenate, in this case, for final scrutiny. Is there any wonder that a \nlot of people say: Thanks, but no thanks. I am not interested in doing \nthat. I love my country, but, you know, I value my privacy, and I do \nnot want to go through that hassle. But some have the courage to step \nup and say: I will do it if the President asks. I am not going to say \nno. If my country needs me, I will contribute in any way I can.\n  Let me give you an example of one of them. His name is Clifford \nStanley. He has a 33-year career in the U.S. Marine Corps. He retired \nin 2002 with the rank of major general. He comes from a family devoted \nto military service. His father and his brother served in the Army. His \ndaughter is an officer in the Navy. He has a niece in the Air Force. \nDr. Clifford Stanley was the first African-American regimental \ncommander in the history of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  The President nominated him in October to serve as Under Secretary of \nDefense for Personnel and Readiness. The Armed Services Committee held \na hearing in November and reported his nomination to the full Senate on \nDecember 2. He came out of the committee without controversy. Is it any \nwonder? Thirty-three years in the Marine Corps, the first African-\nAmerican regimental commander in its history, a man who has served his \ncountry so well and risked his life for this great Nation, reported by \nthe Armed Services Committee to the full Senate floor in December. We \nare now in February.\n  This is a critical post he has been appointed to by the President. He \nwould be in charge of basically managing the readiness of the U.S. \nArmed Forces. Dr. Stanley would have the responsibility to oversee the \nNational Guard and Reserve. There are 143,000 Americans who are serving \nin that capacity today in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nHe would be responsible for the health of the men and women in uniform. \nThe budget the President submitted yesterday includes $30.9 billion for \nhealth care for the members of the military family who are covered by \nTRICARE. That would be one of Dr. Stanley's responsibilities.\n  Finally, he is a senior policy adviser on retirement, career \ndevelopment, pay, and benefits. It is a critically important role for \nour military and our families who really support these military people. \nAnd Dr. Stanley is clearly qualified to do it. He has gone through the \nprocess of scrutiny and investigation.\n  Yesterday on the floor of the Senate, when the majority leader asked \nfor permission so that he could go forward and serve our country again \nin the Department of Defense, the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, \nobjected. I would like to hear why. What is it about this man that he \nobjects to? Is there something we do not know about Dr. Stanley? Is \nthere something he knows about his 33 years of service in the Marine \nCorps? I bet there is not. I bet there is another reason for it. I do \nnot know if we will ever know that. But the fact is, he was objected \nto. But he was not the only one.\n\n  Laura Kennedy is the nominee of the President to serve as U.S. \nRepresentative to the Conference on Disarmament. That is the way we \nmeet together with the other nations around\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\nthe world to try to reduce the advance of nuclear arms and the threat \nof nuclear war. Her nomination is based on the fact that she is an \nexperienced diplomat with talent and skills that are desperately needed \nin this very involved, difficult, and important negotiation. She has \nalready served with distinction in several high-profile positions with \nthe Foreign Service. She was the Ambassador to Turkmenistan, the Deputy \nChief of Mission to the United Nations, and the Deputy Commandant at \nthe National War College.\n  She was reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 2 \nmonths ago. What is holding her up? Yesterday, the majority leader \nasked that Laura Kennedy, the nominee to be the Representative to the \nConference on Disarmament, be approved by the Senate, and the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Mr. Shelby, said: I object. Well, I think Senator Shelby \nowes it to all of us to come and tell us why. What is it he objects to \nabout Laura Kennedy? Does he feel she is not qualified? If he does, \nlet's hear why, and then let's bring it to a vote of the Senate. Is \nthat not fair?\n  Then there is Caryn Wagner, the nominee for Under Secretary for \nIntelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security. Do we \nneed someone to deal with intelligence in this time of the threat of \nterrorism? Do we need someone like that at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity? We need them yesterday; we do not need them tomorrow. The \nUnder Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis is considered the chief \nintelligence officer of the Department of Homeland Security. The Under \nSecretary has to bring together all of these different agencies and \nbranches of government to make sure they coordinate their efforts.\n  We know what happened last Christmas. There was not enough done. It \nwas not done in a timely way to deal with this man who threatened the \nlives of those who were on that airline destined for Detroit.\n  Caryn Wagner is highly qualified to meet the demands of this \nposition. She was the senior Defense Intelligence Agency representative \nto the U.S. European Command and to NATO. She is an instructor at the \nIntelligence and Security Academy. She retired from the House Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence in October of 2008, where she served \nas budget director and cyber-security coordinator. Before that, she \nserved as Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence. Her \nexperience also includes serving as a signals intelligence and \nelectronic warfare officer in the U.S. Army. That is a pretty strong \nresume, isn't it. She is a person you would want in this job \nimmediately. Why in the world would we risk an attack on the United \nStates by withholding critical personnel and critical leadership when \nit comes to gathering intelligence in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity?\n  Yesterday, the majority leader asked for consent to have the Senate \nmove her nomination forward. The Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, \nobjected. I would like to ask the Senator, what does he know about \nCaryn Wagner that would lead him to object to her serving the United \nStates of America and trying to keep us safe? If he knows something, \nthe next half hour on the floor of the Senate is available to the \nRepublican side. I invite him or the leadership to come forward and \ntell us what is wrong with this nominee. Why are you holding up this \nnominee?\n  Then, of course, there is Phillip Goldberg, the nominee for Assistant \nSecretary of State for Intelligence and Research. This man has served \nas our Ambassador to Bolivia, Chief of Mission in Kosovo, and Deputy \nChief of Mission in Chile, under Republican and Democratic Presidents \nas well. He is the coordinator of the U.N. Security Council resolution \nmonitoring the implementation of resolutions on North Korea.\n  He would be head of the Bureau of Intelligence Research at the \nDepartment of State. A big part of their responsibility is to make sure \nour foreign policy is based on good intelligence gathering around the \nworld to keep America safe and secure. For over 60 years, this branch \nof our government has led the State Department review of sensitive \ncounterintelligence and law enforcement activities. In 2004, the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence revealed that this agency was one of \nthe few dissenting votes 2 years earlier when the CIA and other \nintelligence shops overstated the threat of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. \nThis agency got it right. Although its primary customer is the State \nDepartment, this agency serves many other branches of government. The \nconfirmation of Philip Goldberg would provide essential leadership.\n  Yesterday, the majority leader came to the floor and asked unanimous \nconsent for Phillip Goldberg to serve in the Department of State to \ngather intelligence to keep America safe. He asked consent that we move \nto his nomination, a nomination with no controversy. The Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Shelby, objected. Please, I ask my colleagues on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, come to the floor and explain to us what \nis wrong with Philip Goldberg. What disqualifies him for this position \nin this administration? Make your best case, if you have one, against \nhim or any one of these nominees, and then, out of a sense of fairness \nand at least a sense of giving this country and this President the \npeople he needs on a team he needs to keep us safe, let's come to a \nvote immediately on these four nominees.\n  I do not hold out a lot of hope that any Republican will come to the \nfloor with objections against any one of those people because, you see, \nthese objections are sometimes based on some grudge, some project, \nsomething else. I do not assign that to the Senator from Alabama. I \nhave no idea why he objected. But if he has a substantive objection to \nany or all of these four people, he should come forward and tell us. He \nowes it to the Senate. He owes it to the American people. In fairness, \nhe owes it to these four people who have served our country well and \nwant to continue to do so. They should not be left in this uncertainty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/02/senate-section/article/S404-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S404-S405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAIR ELECTIONS NOW ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when I leave the Chamber, I will be headed \nto the Senate Rules Committee on which I serve for a hearing to discuss \nthe Supreme Court case that was decided a few days back that is going \nto make a dramatic difference in the way political campaigns are waged.\n  For 100 years, since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, we have agreed to \nkeep major businesses, big corporations out of our American political \nscene. They get involved, make no mistake. We saw that on health care \nreform. The major forces for and against it in the private sector \nbought ads. But when it comes to candidates, actual people running for \nFederal office, we have said: No corporate contributions to these \ncandidates; individuals, yes, who work for the corporations, but not \nthe corporations themselves that have millions of dollars they can \nfunnel into campaigns. That was the law for 100 years.\n  Then the Supreme Court took up this case and, as a result, it is all \ngoing to change. When I saw the final decision, I noticed that Chief \nJustice Roberts and Justice Alito had joined with Justice Kennedy and \nJustice Thomas and Justice Scalia for the five-vote majority on the \nCourt. I couldn't help but remember not that long ago when Chief \nJustice Roberts appeared before the Judiciary Committee. I was there. \nHe was asked: What is your role on the Supreme Court going to be as \nChief Justice? He said: I am just there to call the balls and strikes. \nThat is it. I am not there to make up the rules of the game. That is \nfor somebody else.\n  For 100 years, it was pretty clear that when major corporations \nwanted to participate in supporting directly the candidacies of Federal \ncandidates, the ball went right down the middle, and it was clearly a \nstrike. We said: You are out. But not this Supreme Court, not under \nthis Chief Justice. This is clear judicial activism.\n  I challenge any of Chief Justice Roberts' supporters on the other \nside of the aisle who preach to us over and over again about their \nloathing for judicial activism to explain what happened in this case, \nwhen this Supreme Court overturned that prohibition against \ncorporations being directly involved in candidates' campaigns.\n  Most people who haven't been in this world are probably scratching \ntheir heads and asking: What difference does it make? You folks spend \nmillions of dollars anyway. What is a couple million more going to do?\n  What it basically means is that when corporation X comes to the \noffice of a\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\nSenator and says: We have an important tax matter coming up here and \nfor our corporation; we would appreciate if you would vote against this \nnew tax on our business. Now Senators can take a look at it and say: \nWell, I may vote for it; I may vote against it. I know perhaps the \nofficers at the corporation, maybe its employees, may be upset if I \nvote for the tax. I have to make up my mind.\n  Now there is a new element. Because of this Supreme Court decision, \ncorporation X can say: We would appreciate if you would vote against \nthat tax. And you will know in the back of your mind they can literally \nspend $1 million to defeat you in the next election, thanks to the \nSupreme Court.\n  How do we fix this? This morning the Rules Committee will talk about \ndisclosure, making sure that corporations are well known when they buy \nthese ads so at least the American people know who is paying for them, \nand some other aspects to regulate the Supreme Court decision within \nthe bounds of what the Supreme Court said we can do. But I think it \ngoes to a larger question.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate have said all along that what I \nam about to describe is too far in the future, not within our grasp. I \nthink it is time for us to seriously consider public financing of \ncampaigns. I think we ought to start drawing a bright line between \nthose who will accept public financing and limited contributions from \nindividuals and those who are ready to go out into this wild west of \ncorporate politics, special-interest politics, big-money politics.\n  I introduced a bill a few years back, the Fair Elections Now Act. As \na matter of fact, the current President, when he was then Senator \nObama, was a cosponsor. What we are basically trying to do is to follow \nthe lead of major States that have voted for campaign finance reform. \nWhen States such as Arizona took this issue to the voters of their \nState and asked: Do you want to clean up elections; do you want to have \nfair elections, public-financed elections, the voters said: Yes. Get \nthe lobbyists and special interests out of this mess. Let's try to make \nthis directly candidates to the voters and take the special interest \ngroups out.\n  This bill would do that. What it basically says is that to qualify \nfor public financing, you go out and raise small contributions, $100 \nmaximum contributions, and put those together in a sufficient amount to \nshow you are a viable candidate, and then you qualify for public \nfinancing--in the primary, then again in the general--based on the \npopulation of your State. Will you have as much money as a big \ncorporation? No. But here is my theory. My theory is, if a candidate \ngoes for public financing, they will have enough money to get out their \nmessage, introduce themselves to the voters, make the issues, and \nclarify if some major corporation is going to come in and try to \nsteamroll them. That is the best we can hope for, but it may be all we \nneed.\n  My State of Illinois is, with one possible exception, notoriously \nsuspect of big-money candidates who come in and spend millions to get \nelected. They waste a lot of their personal wealth and they don't win, \nwith one possible exception. I think there is a skepticism to big \nmoney.\n  Public financing is a way to clean up our political campaigns, to \nhave candidates in the constituent business rather than the campaign \nfinancing business. If you could sit down with Members of the Senate \nand say a few words to them, they will know instantly what you are \ntalking about: Power hour, dialing for dollars, weekends on the road. \nWe all know what it is about. It is about the incessant money chase \nthat is necessary to raise money to finance campaigns under the current \nsystem.\n  It is time away from our States, away from our families. It is time \naway from meeting voters who don't happen to be rich, who deserve \nrepresentation and a voice in the process. That is unfortunate. It \nshould change. What we are trying to do now is to bring in public \nfinancing with the Fair Elections Now Act.\n  How would we pay for it? We would impose a tax on corporations doing \nbusiness with the Federal Government. It wouldn't be onerous, but it \nwould be enough to fund public financing of all campaigns for the House \nand the Senate. I don't think that is unreasonable.\n  We would also provide discounts on time that candidates would buy on \ntelevision and radio so they wouldn't have to pay as much as the most \nexpensive time that is sold.\n  What do people think of this idea? It turns out it is one of the few \nthings people agree with on a bipartisan basis: 69 percent of \nDemocrats, 72 percent of Republicans, and 60 percent of Independents \nsupport this proposal when we describe to it them. It is supported by a \nlot of government groups, many former Members of Congress, some \nbusiness leaders, and even some lobbyists. Recently a letter was sent \nto the Senate, a general letter from major corporations across America \nsaying: Please, leave us alone. We are sick and tired of being asked to \nfind excuses to give you money. Do it some other way. Clean up this \nmess in Washington.\n  The Fair Elections Now bill I have introduced will do that. I \nencourage my colleagues to take a look at it and to try to imagine a \nworld where we didn't have to go scrambling looking for money. Imagine \na world where you walked down the streets of your hometown and when you \nare in an election cycle, people don't rush to the other side of the \nstreet for fear you will ask for another check. Think about what life \nwould be like if we were talking about small contributions creating the \nbase of grassroots support for candidates, both challengers and \nincumbents. That is a reality of our future, if we have the courage to \nstep up and do it.\n  This decision by the Supreme Court should be the reason, should be \nthe catalyst for making this reform decision now. I urge my colleagues \nto consider cosponsorship of Fair Elections Now. We are anxious to get \nas many Senators on board as possible. We hope it can be moved in this \nsession of the Senate.\n  How much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 9 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, Chairman Schumer started \nhearings this morning in the Rules Committee on the Supreme Court \ndecision, Citizens United v. FEC. This Supreme Court decision \ncompletely changes the campaign finance landscape.\n  Fifty years ago when my father Stewart Udall and my Uncle Mo were in \noffice, money had minimal impact on the electoral and political system. \nIt was about connecting with people and the marketplace of ideas. Right \nnow it is just as much about the biggest checkbooks, if not more so, \nthan it is about the best ideas.\n  Unfortunately, we are about to see a lot more big checkbooks in the \nelection process. Last month's Supreme Court decision in Citizens \nUnited v. FEC was a victory for the special interests at the expense of \nthe average American. We have seen firsthand the impact special \ninterests such as big oil and big banks and health insurance companies \nhave had on the legislative process. Now, with this decision, already \npowerful corporations and labor unions will be able to further open \ntheir bank accounts, further drowning out the voices of everyday \nAmericans in the political process.\n\n  Members of both Chambers and the administration are working on \nlegislation to address the Citizens United decision. I commend their \nefforts, but I\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\nbelieve a comprehensive overhaul of the campaign finance system is \nnecessary in order to restore public faith in our elections. What we \nare seeing here today is large special interests supplanting the voices \nof everyday Americans in the political process.\n  The Supreme Court has shown its willingness to rule broadly and \nignore longstanding precedent when it is reviewing the \nconstitutionality of campaign finance laws. The best long-term solution \nis a constitutional amendment that would prevent the Court from \noverturning sensible campaign finance regulations. I would welcome the \nopportunity to join my colleagues in introducing such an amendment.\n  While I believe a constitutional amendment is the ideal solution, I \nalso think comprehensive reform legislation is a step in the right \ndirection. As a Member of the House for 10 years, I joined \nRepresentative Dave Obey as an original cosponsor of the Let the People \nDecide Clean Campaign Act, a bill that would fundamentally change how \nHouse elections are conducted. Mr. Obey reintroduced this bill in this \nCongress, and I intend to introduce a companion bill in the Senate in \nthe coming weeks. The act does not attempt to fine-tune the existing \ncongressional campaign finance system or tweak around the edges; \nrather, it makes fundamental, wholesale changes to fundraising by \ncandidates, regulations of outside groups, and the role of political \nparties. It contains a finding that America's faith in the election \nsystem has been fundamentally corrupted by big money from outside \ninterest groups. It establishes a system of voluntary contributions to \nprovide public financing in campaigns for House candidates in general \nelections. It provides more funds than the current system for the vast \nmajority of challengers to mount their campaigns. And it empowers \nvoters with the knowledge that their vote affects the outcome of the \ncurrent election and also affects the amount of funds distributed to \nnominees in future elections. It bans all independent expenditures so \nthat only the candidate is responsible for his or her message. It \nprovides for expedited consideration of a constitutional amendment \nallowing these changes if the Supreme Court rejects the plan, and it \nprovides a process by which third-party candidates can also participate \nin the system.\n  Money can have a corrosive effect on the political process. We have \nseen evidence of that in campaigns at all levels of government. We have \nlong needed substantive campaign finance reform, and it is my hope that \nthe High Court's disappointing decision will provide the push we need \nto put elections back in the hands of average Americans and not the \nspecial interests who can use their unlimited bank accounts to railroad \nthe process to their preferred conclusion.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of M. Patricia \nSmith, of New York, to be Solicitor for the Department of Labor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of those who are tuned in \non C-SPAN in their offices, what we are now in is what is called \npostcloture on the nomination of Patricia Smith to serve as Solicitor \nof Labor. This is a nominee who came before our committee almost a year \nago, in April. It has been held up and held up.\n  Yesterday, the Senate voted cloture because it was being \nfilibustered--yet another filibuster by our Republican friends. So we \nhad a vote last night, and cloture was invoked by 60 votes. Now we are \nin the period of what they call postcloture, 30 hours of postcloture. \nWe will have a final vote up or down for Patricia Smith to be Solicitor \nof Labor. If she got 60 votes last night on cloture, it is obvious she \ncertainly has more than 51 votes to take the position as Solicitor of \nLabor.\n  That is where we are. We are in this 30 hours. Again, it raises the \nquestion in my mind, why are we chewing up 30 hours? We know the votes \nare there. We voted on cloture last night. Yet our colleagues on the \nRepublican side are insisting that we just chew up time. For what \npurpose? We have the lights going, the heat is on, all our staffs are \nhere, and no one else is on the floor. So why do we run this 30 hours \nand waste taxpayers' money and waste all this time when we know what \nthe vote is going to be?\n  We have been through all this. Patricia Smith has had her hearings. I \nthought we had a pretty good debate yesterday. Republicans laid out \ntheir side, we laid out our side, we had the vote, and now it is time \nto move ahead, have the final vote, and get this person to work down at \nthe Department of Labor.\n  Again, I say for the benefit of those watching, here we are in \nanother one of these filibusters. We stopped the filibuster, and now we \nare in this 30 hours afterward which we do not really need. Everything \nto say about Patricia Smith has basically been said. The record has \nbeen made. She appeared before the committee. She answered questions. \nThe record is there. There is nothing you can do. It is going to come \nout. Everything is there, and all of our Senators know that.\n\n  But the rules are the rules, and the Republicans have the right to \ninvoke the rules. Evidently, they have invoked the rule to chew up 30 \nhours. It is a shame we have to waste our time like this. As long as we \nare chewing up the time and Republicans are insisting that we keep the \nlights on and the heat on and keep everybody around for 30 hours, I \nwould like to make some more remarks on behalf of Patricia Smith and \nwhere we find ourselves.\n  As I said, I am very grateful to our colleagues for the vote last \nnight to end debate and invoke cloture. We have devoted very ample time \nto our deliberations on Patricia Smith. It is now time to act.\n  There is no question, when you look at the record and the facts, that \nPatricia Smith is abundantly qualified to serve as Solicitor of Labor. \nShe has an impressive background in labor law and a demonstrated record \nof achievement in the State of New York. More important, she clearly \nhas a deep and passionate commitment to help American workers. I can \nthink of no better qualification for this critical position.\n  There is also no question that Commissioner Smith--and I use the \nwords ``Commissioner Smith'' because she is presently the commissioner \nof labor for the State of New York--there is no question that \nCommissioner Smith has undergone a very thorough vetting process. As I \nsaid, the nomination has been before us since last April. She has \ntestified in open hearing. She has answered more than 50 written \nquestions. She has met with any Senator who wanted to meet her. Her \nnomination was debated extensively in our committee, frankly. It has \nnow been debated on the Senate floor--a step that in previous \nCongresses was often reserved for judges who get lifetime appointments \nor for Cabinet-level nominees, not for someone who is going to be \nSolicitor in the Department of Labor. It is time to bring the \ndiscussion to an end and let Commissioner Smith get to the Department \nof Labor and start doing her job.\n  I listened very carefully to the arguments raised by my Republican \ncolleagues yesterday against Commissioner Smith's nomination. While I \nthink we could spend quite a while debating about which e-mails she was\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\ncopied, which staffers should have kept her in the loop and all that, I \ncan't help but conclude that this debate fundamentally comes down to a \ndisagreement about whether this Wage Watch program that was instituted \nby the New York Department of Labor as a pilot program was a good idea. \nIt kind of comes down to that. I will have more to say about what I \nthink it comes down to in a minute.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and I read the record--\nhave used some pretty scary words to describe this pilot program. They \ncalled it entrapment, vigilantism. They say it ``deputizes private \nactivist groups to intrude on small business.'' They have said the Wage \nWatch volunteers are like the private citizens, the Minute Men, who try \nto patrol our borders with guns.\n  If there was even one scintilla of evidence that is what this program \nis about, I would be alarmed, too. But it is not.\n  Again, let's look at the documents and get the facts. The agreement \nthat participating groups signed to join this Wage Watch is a good \ndescription of what Wage Watch volunteers did. Here is the agreement \nthat groups who agreed to get involved in that agreed to:\n\n       Conduct outreach to the public about labor laws (handing \n     out brochures, etc.) in formal and informal settings (e.g., \n     at organized festivals, neighborhood or group meetings, other \n     organized events . . . bus and subway stops, libraries, \n     supermarkets, or similar locations);\n       Provide seminars or informational sessions to the public;\n       Set up and staff tables at events for the purpose of \n     providing information to the public and answering questions \n     regarding the labor law;\n       Obtain information regarding potential labor law violations \n     from parties familiar with the violations;\n       Fill out basic complaint forms regarding potential labor \n     law violations and pass them on to the Department.\n\n  Nothing illegal. Nothing unethical. Informational. Certainly, don't \nwe want people--especially those at the lowest end of the economic \nladder--this is what we are talking about. These are people working at \nminimum wage jobs, barely maybe above minimum wage. They are the \nworkforce you go by when you go into the door of a restaurant or they \nare back in the kitchen or they are perhaps in the retail industry \ndoing other things. They are the janitors you don't see at night \ncleaning up business places--a number of people like that. Again, they \nare at minimum wage and probably don't belong to any organized labor \nunion. Many of them have limited language skills, and they are trying \nto get by and raise their families. So we are trying to get information \nto them about what their rights are.\n  Do my Republican colleagues believe it is wrong to inform people \nabout what their rights are under the law? Surely they don't want to \nsay if you find violations of law regarding safety or health or wages \nof people who are being skimmed on minimum wage and aren't being paid \nminimum wage and are working overtime and are not being paid overtime--\nare they saying nobody should report that and that we should keep hands \noff? Surely, that is not what my Republican colleagues are saying, is \nit?\n  Well, again, these are not radical actions we are talking about. They \nare educational and outreach activities designed to empower workers and \nprotect their rights and give them information. Everything on this \nchart can be done by any private citizen any day of the week.\n  While staff on the Department of Labor, in their e-mails that we saw, \nmay have called this an ``enforcers'' program in the early days, in \nJanuary and February when they were brainstorming about the project \nthat is really not what it was. Wage Watch participants were not \nconducting investigations. They had no enforcement authority. They \ncouldn't demand to see a business's books or access private property. \nCommissioner Smith made this very clear in her own descriptions of the \nprogram.\n  There has been a lot of talk about e-mails and such. I saw some of \nthe charts put up by my friend from Wyoming yesterday. They were all \nfrom people other than Commissioner Smith. You can see what \nCommissioner Smith said on January 15, 2009--not what somebody else \nsaid:\n\n       The Wage Watch groups will conduct activities which promote \n     labor law compliance . . . including handing out leaflets \n     about labor laws to workers at community events or \n     supermarkets; giving know-your-rights training to workers; \n     talking to workers at restaurants and other businesses open \n     to the public; and talking with employers about labor law \n     compliance.\n\n  This is important:\n\n       Please note that the groups and individuals who participate \n     as Wage Watchers will not be agents, employees, or official \n     representatives of the Labor Department. They are not \n     replacing staff and they are not going to be conducting \n     investigations of any kind. Their role is limited to doing \n     outreach and community education, and to reporting any \n     violations they encounter to the Division.\n\n  That is from Commissioner Smith. I didn't see anybody on the other \nside put up that chart yesterday. They had charts from other people but \nnot from Commissioner Smith.\n  Again, when it comes down to it, all these Wage Watch people could do \nwas talk to workers who were willing to chat with them and hand out \nfliers. Is this vigilantism running amok? Hardly. It is simply \nvolunteers who are willing to take time out of their day because they \ncare about low-wage workers and they want to help them. I can't imagine \nhow this harmless, generous form of outreach could possibly be \nobjectionable.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the Republican side have used this \nprogram to try to tarnish Commissioner Smith's impressive and \nimpeccable reputation. They claim she's antibusiness. They claim she is \ntrying to close companies and put workers out of a job.\n  These charges are totally unfounded. There is no basis for those \ncharges at all--not a scintilla of evidence about those charges. In \nfact, they are exactly the opposite of what her record at the New York \nDepartment of Labor shows. Patricia Smith has dedicated the last \nseveral years of her life to helping workers find jobs and keep jobs. \nSince taking over as commissioner, Ms. Smith has spearheaded a $4.25 \nmillion initiative to prepare New Yorkers for jobs in emerging and \ngreen industries; revamped the State's unemployment insurance training \nprograms to allow more workers to get approved for training dollars at \nthe same time they are collecting unemployment benefits; promoted the \nState's Shared Work Program, which gives businesses an alternative to \nlayoffs as they face a temporary decline in business, increased the \nnumber of businesses participating in the program from 293 in 2007 to \n1,620 in 2009.\n  These are just a few of her many impressive accomplishments in the \narea of job training and workforce development.\n  Where Commissioner Smith really gained her reputation as one of the \nfinest labor lawyers in the country is in the area of enforcement. She \nis committed to protecting workers' rights.\n  In 2008, the New York Department of Labor collected $24.6 million in \nback wages for 17,000 workers across the State. This was a 37-percent \nincrease in collections from previous years, and it significantly \nincreased the compliance rate among employers.\n  Now, would someone on the other side say we should have allowed these \npeople to be cheated out of $24.6 million in back wages and sort of \nwashed our hands of it and moved on? That is not only unfair to the \nworkers, it is unfair to the thousands of businesses in the State of \nNew York that comply with the law, that pay fair wages, that pay \novertime pay. There is more of them than the others. The vast majority \nof businesses comply with the law. There are always a few trying to \nskim it, cutting corners, figuring out how they will never be caught. \nIt usually affects the lowest wage workers.\n  It is unfair to the legitimate businesses in New York. That is why so \nmany business groups support Patricia Smith. We have letters of \nrecommendation from business groups in New York talking about how she \nlistens and works with them, how fair she is in enforcing the laws. So \nif someone over there says she should not be doing that, should not be \nthat aggressive in going after bad wages, I don't think legitimate \nbusinesses would say that is unfair. They would say: Yes, go after the \npeople giving us a bad name and, frankly, unfairly competing against \nus.\n  Those are impressive achievements. Maybe that is the reason some of \nour colleagues are afraid of her being Solicitor. There is no question \nshe will be a\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\nSolicitor who will enforce the law. She will do it fairly and \nreasonably but also make sure there are real penalties for taking money \nout of workers' pockets or putting workers' lives at risk. I guess that \nis what it comes down to: Do we want a Solicitor who is willing to go \nthe extra mile and try new approaches and new ideas if it will help \nprotect workers' rights? I believe we do. That is what we need in these \ntough economic times.\n  I have looked at this Wage Watch pilot program. Quite frankly, I \ndon't know what the results are yet. There is a pilot program now being \nassessed. Quite frankly, I would be an energetic supporter of that kind \nof an approach, where people in the community who speak the same \nlanguage, who live in the same neighborhood, who go to the same \nchurches, whose families interconnect but who are on the lowest rung of \nthe economic ladder--I would be in favor of giving them information \nabout what their rights are when they go to work every day and about \nwhat it means to work overtime and how much they should be paid for \novertime, what the minimum wage is and how they should be paid the \nminimum wage, and, yes, also what safety is.\n\n  Are they working around hazardous materials and not being adequately \nprotected? Is their health being endangered? They ought to know those \nthings. So many people don't.\n  Again, as I said yesterday, we are not talking about people working \non Wall Street on hedge funds or CPAs, accountants, lawyers, and \ninvestment bankers. We are not talking about Senators and our staffs \nand people who have all this knowledge. We are talking about people who \ndon't understand what their rights are. They are happy to be here. They \nare happy to have a minimum wage job. They are happy to be able to keep \ntheir families together and hope and dream that their kids will have a \nbetter life than they have had.\n  So, again, this Wage Watch, to me--I hope that it is proved out that \nit was successful. Quite frankly, I think this is something we should \nemulate. My colleagues on the Republican side seem to want to denigrate \nit and say this is vigilantism and like Minutemen. Someone said in the \nNeighborhood Watch program, people cannot go into people's homes. None \nof these people who were on the Wage Watch could go into a private \nbusiness unless they were allowed to. They couldn't ask for the books \nor see the ledgers or anything like that. They could go into a store \nthat was open to the public--a Walmart or supermarket or places where \nthe general public can go. They could not go into a private business \nwhere people were working, if the general public wasn't allowed to go \nin there.\n  Again, all the comparisons to vigilantism and what I have heard from \nthe other side--these are words that are intended to put fear into \npeople. Let's be frank about it. Fear. It is to make them afraid. Well, \nif they can just show an example of that, maybe we can look at it. \nThere are no examples of this anywhere.\n  My friends on the other side also raised questions about certain \nmisrepresentations that Commissioner Smith gave to the committee. I \nwould never minimize that. When people testify before committees, they \nshould do so honestly and openly. I also know human beings make \nmistakes. I can't tell you how many times I have been at a committee \nhearing when I heard a question and the person being requested heard it \ndifferently than I heard it. We don't always hear things the same. So \nwhat you do is you are able to correct the record and, guess what. We \ndo that every day here, don't we?\n  I am standing here speaking, and the reporter is taking it down--\ndoing a great job, I am sure of that. But guess what. Sometimes \nmistakes are made. I may say a word, and the reporter might say: That \nguy Harkin speaks with that Iowa lingo, and I didn't understand that \nMidwest lingo. And they may put it down wrong. That is why we have a \nrecord. Our staffs go back to the record, or I go to the record, and we \ncorrect the record. We all do that every day around here. It is simply \nbecause people are human and they make mistakes.\n  When we have a hearing in front of a committee and somebody asks a \nquestion and the witness answers it and we find out the answer wasn't \ncorrect, we can go back to the witness and say: What is this all about? \nHere was a question and here was your answer, but we have different \ninformation.\n  The witness will be able to look at that and correct the record, and \nthat is what Patricia Smith did. Obviously, she heard the question one \nway, the questioner thought he had questioned her in a different way. \nBut she corrected the record.\n  Again, keep in mind, no one on this side of the aisle is alleging she \ndid this to cover up an illegal activity or to cover up something \nnefarious, to cover up something that was unethical. No. There is no \nallegation about that on that side because it is simply not true. She \nmade a simple mistake. She corrected it.\n  There were two times when that happened. One was simply because, at \nthat point in time, she did not have all the information she should \nhave had. When she went back to her staff in New York, she found a \ndifferent thing and corrected the record at that point.\n  As I said, we do that all the time around here and we do not think \nanything about it. Republicans do it. Democrats do it. We correct the \nrecord all the time simply because human beings are human beings and \npeople make mistakes.\n  There has been a lot made of whether this idea came from within her \nstaff or came from the outside. Well, that was one of the debates about \nthis. She had testified in the hearing that this was something that \ncame up from within her department. Well, unbeknownst to her, some of \nher staff lower down had talked to outside groups and discussed this \nWage Watch program and then presented it to Commissioner Smith.\n  Well, my response on that is, what is the big deal? So what? So what \nif some outside groups were involved in this? Again, was it illegal? \nWas it unethical? Was it underhanded? No. Perfectly legal. I daresay, \nall of us Senators meet with outside groups all the time. They come to \nsee us, talk about programs, talk about how we should be doing things. \nThat is one of our functions, to listen to outside people to get better \nideas.\n  This would be a sorry place if all we did was talk to one another. It \nis a good thing we are talking to people on the outside. So whether the \nprogram was suggested by one of her staff or by an outside group, I \nsay: So what? She happened to think it came from within her department \nand later found out her department people had been talking to someone \non the outside. OK. She corrected the record. So what is the big deal?\n  Then there was a question about expanding the program. Well, I would \nsay honestly, did Commissioner Smith want to expand the program? Sure, \nas long as it proved to be successful. That is what a pilot program is \nfor. Obviously, she thought it was a good idea to put the pilot program \nin. The whole point of a pilot project is to expand it, if it is \nsuccessful. Again, it had to do with conversations about a question \nabout had she had conversations about expanding the program.\n  There was another little problem. What she thought they were talking \nabout was, did she have conversations about expanding, authorizing and \nexpanding the program and she had not authorized any expansions of the \nprogram whatsoever. But, of course, she talked about: Well, if it is \nsuccessful, sure, I would like to expand it.\n  In fact, I would point out, to this day, she has never authorized an \nexpansion of the program. Why? Because they do not have all the data, \nand they have not thoroughly ever evaluated the success of the pilot \nprogram. I think that is what a responsible leader does.\n  Lastly, there is some allegation that the Wage Watch program was used \nby unions as an organizing tool. Well, again, is anyone on this side \nalleging that is illegal, unethical, nefarious in some way or \nunderhanded? I do not hear those allegations because they are not so.\n  Quite frankly, I do not think there would be anything wrong with \nthat. But Commissioner Smith took all appropriate steps to make sure \nunions separated their organizing activities from their volunteer work \nwith Wage Watch.\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\n  As far as I know, and I have seen no evidence to the contrary, her \ninstructions were followed. They were separated. I have seen no \nevidence to the contrary. So I hope our debate and what I have been \nable to say and put in the record will put to rest any concerns \ncolleagues may have about Mrs. Smith's honesty and her integrity.\n  Her honesty and her integrity are unassailable. Is she infallible? \nNever makes a mistake? Well, I do not know of any living human being \nwho can say that. But does she recognize and correct it? Absolutely--as \nwe all do. Well, again, honesty and integrity, unassailable in her \nperformance as commissioner of labor in the State of New York.\n  Again, I will point out, this pilot project was a $6,000 pilot \nproject. She was in charge of running an agency with an $11 billion, \nthat is spelled with a B, $11 billion budget; 4,000 employees across \nthe State of New York. This was a $6,000 pilot project. We have to kind \nof keep that in perspective as to how high it was on her viewing \nscreen.\n  Well, quite frankly, I think this whole delay from last April would \nhave been avoided if more of my colleagues on the other side had taken \nthe time to sit down with Patricia Smith, talk with her, and hear her \nside of the story.\n  I also think it would have been avoided if you read all the letters \nof support from business groups in New York, from the attorneys, the \ndistrict attorneys in New York representing all different political \nparties and ideologies. All these attorneys are saying she does a great \njob--if they had just looked at her record.\n  Well, I did. I looked at her record. I have spoken with her. I have \nread the transcripts. I have looked at the background of all this. I \ncan say, with confidence, never did she have any intention of \nmisleading the committee. Why? This was a perfectly legal, above-the-\nboard project. Why would you want to mislead anybody about it? She had \nevery intention of dedicating her life to be the best and most \neffective Solicitor of Labor she can possibly be.\n  Our Nation is very fortunate to have public servants of this caliber. \nI mean, you look at this. I have no doubt Patricia Smith, with her \nlegal skills, managerial skills in the private sector, can be making a \nlot of money. I have no doubt. But she has chosen a different career \npath--to be a public servant, a public servant, dedicating her life to \nhelping people for whom there is not a lot of government help. No one \nis sticking up for them, people at the bottom end of the ladder.\n  To me, this is one of the highest callings I think anyone can do in \nour society, is to be that kind of a public servant. So I think our \nNation is very fortunate to have this kind of a person in Patricia \nSmith for this critical position. I look forward to her swift \nconfirmation.\n  I would hope we would not have to drag out 30 hours, but it seems the \nRepublicans are intent on wasting time. There is nothing happening \nhere. Anyone can see that. Anybody watching on C-SPAN can see nothing \nis happening here and we just waste time. We can have the vote now. We \ncould have the vote in 20 minutes. Nothing would change. But we have \nthe 30 hours. I guess we have to waste it. But I wanted to take this \ntime, again, to set the record straight one more time on Patricia \nSmith, her integrity, her honesty, her exemplary background, and the \nfact that she is going to be an outstanding Solicitor for the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized as in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Northern Uganda\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, last week I came to the floor to talk \nabout an issue that has kind of been drowned out by a lot of other \nthings that are going on, other conflicts and disasters around the \nworld. This is having to do with northern Uganda. It is something I \nhave been on the floor talking about for several years now, and I have \nhad occasion to be there several times.\n  For over two decades, a guy named Joseph Kony has led what they call \nthe LRA, the Lord's Resistance Army, in violence all throughout \nnorthern Uganda, in that whole Great Lakes Region of east and central \nAfrica. They have killed tens of thousands--little kids--displacing \nover 1 million, and terrorizing and kidnapping over 30,000 little kids, \nforcing them to fight. It is this child soldier thing a lot of people \nare aware of, but not nearly enough people are aware of it.\n  With all the problems there are in Africa--people are more concerned \nabout Zimbabwe. They hear about that. They have heard about Somalia, \nSudan. Everyone knows about that. But nobody says anything about the \nLord's Resistance Army and what they have been doing in that area of \nAfrica for 25 years.\n  I have been there. I have been all the way up there to Gulu in \nnorthern Uganda. Let me share the problem that exists up there.\n  This madman, kind of a spiritual leader, by the name of Joseph Kony \nhas taken advantage of all the unrest and the disasters by going into \nvillages and kidnapping, taking young people and training them to be \nsoldiers. We are talking about little kids, little boys. They are from \n11 to 14 years old. Once they train them to be soldiers, they actually \ngive them AK-47s. I do not have my chart now, but I have pictures of \nthat. They train them to be soldiers, and then they have to go back to \ntheir villages and murder their parents and their siblings. If they do \nnot do that, then they will dismember them. They will cut their noses \noff, cut their ears off, cut their lips off.\n  This has been going on for a long period of time. Quite frankly, I \nhave gotten to know President Museveni in Uganda quite well, President \nKagame in Rwanda, and President Kabila in Congo, and all of them agree \nthat we need do something about this monster Joseph Kony. It happens \nthat two of the three Presidents I mentioned--President Museveni from \nUganda and President Kagame from Rwanda--are Presidents who have really \ncome to power in the bush. They are warriors. These are people who \nreally are reluctant to admit they cannot go after one guy and get him. \nWell, they have finally all gotten together.\n  What we are trying to do--well, we have already introduced it; the \nauthor of the bill is Senator Feingold of Wisconsin--is to go after \nthese people, and this bill provides about $35 million to help these \nkids who have been brutalized, as well as to give whatever assistance \nwe have to give to these different countries in order to bring this guy \nto justice.\n  During one of the trips I made up to northern Uganda, to Gulu, I ran \ninto three young men. They are college-age types--Bobby Bailey, Lauren \nPoole, and Jason Russell. They have started a documentary on Joseph \nKony. They have gone around to universities, and we now have \nthousands--tens of thousands--of young people who are rallying around \nthis thing, trying to get us to do something as a nation. These young \npeople have become very effective.\n  This week, this Senate has an opportunity to act in unison to shine \nthe light on this forgotten place and to begin to bring relief to these \nchildren.\n  The Great Lakes Region in Africa has suffered from years of \ndevastating fighting between tribes, and as a result the area is home \nto massive numbers of displaced people who are vulnerable to this type \nof treatment. So those are\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\nthe conditions that allow Joseph Kony and his LRA rebels to thrive. \nKony preys on the weak. He gets little kids who cannot defend \nthemselves. He gets young girls. He sells them to be sex slaves and \nthese kids to become murderers.\n  In December of 2008, the Government of Uganda, Southern Sudan, and \nthe DRC--that is the Democratic Republic of the Congo--launched a \ncoordinated offensive against the LRA. It was called Operation \nLightning Thunder. During the operation, over 300 rebels were killed, \nover 40 were captured, and more than 500 kids who were abducted were \nrescued. So we are making some headway in doing this.\n  According to estimates by the U.N., between September of 2008 and \nJune of 2009, the LRA killed over 1,300 civilians, abducted 1,400 more \nboys and girls, and displaced nearly 300,000 others.\n  I know something about this because I took the time to go to--you \nhear a lot about western Congo--Kinshasa and the problems there. This \nis eastern Congo that butts up against Rwanda and then, further north, \nUganda.\n  In going to Goma, we thought that was where Joseph Kony was at the \ntime. We thought we had an effort that could get him, but we barely \nmissed him. He went north on a tirade, after that, going up toward \nSudan and murdered thousands of people during that short period of \ntime. It averages out, he murders or mutilates about three kids a day. \nThat is why this is important. We can get this guy. We cannot do it if \nwe just try the way we have tried it before because it has not worked \nand it is not going to work.\n  Well, anyway, we have watched this take place. It is spreading now to \nother areas. I would anticipate before too long, if left unchecked, it \nwould go not just to the Central African Republic but also maybe back \ninto Sudan and maybe even Ethiopia. So it is very serious.\n  In 2009, a total of 186 people were killed by the LRA just in \nSouthern Sudan. One survivor describes his experience and the murders \nof his family at the hands of the LRA. This is a quote. This is \nactually what this person said:\n\n       We were eating dinner outside of our hut when several LRA--\n\n  That is the Lord's Resistance Army--\n\n     rebels appeared and told us in broken Lingala--\n\n  This is their local language--\n\n     to get inside of our hut. They looted our food, locked us \n     inside our hut and burned it. There were 10 of us; my whole \n     family was inside. When I realized they were burning us \n     alive, I started to push against the door, forcing it open. \n     One rebel standing outside of the door tried to hit me with a \n     heavy club but I dodged it and ran in the bush. They shot \n     after me but missed. Apparently they shot or hit everyone \n     else in my family who tried to come out. Except for one other \n     person, everyone else was burned alive.\n\n  This is the type of thing we have documented that has been happening \nfor a long period of time.\n  What we are trying to do with this--as I mentioned before, the cost \nis not great. This, by the way, is not any appropriation. This is an \nauthorization bill, to authorize probably what the CBO says is about \n$28 million to get this done. It is not offset. When the bill first \ncame out, it was offset by a reduction in certain types of military \nexpenditures. I disagreed with that, so it is not offset at this time. \nBut of all the efforts out there right now, this is something that \nabsolutely has to happen.\n  Just by contrast, we had a bill, the other African bill, just a \ncouple years ago, called the PEPFAR bill. That was one that actually \nhad about $35 billion--much larger than this--and it sailed right \nthrough. So I would say, if we were willing to do that, we ought to be \nwilling to do this.\n  By the way, we have a lot of cosponsors now. I do believe we are \ngoing to be successful in getting this bill passed, and I will be \nbringing this up, I am guessing, probably either Wednesday or Thursday.\n  So with that, I will yield the floor and hope that any of the other \nMembers of this body who are not already a cosponsor to this bill--it \nis S. 1067--we would like to get a few more cosponsors on here if at \nall possible.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination \nof Patricia Smith for Solicitor of the Department of Labor. \nCommissioner Smith is a dynamic and effective leader with over 30 years \nof experience in labor law, and I am very proud to support her \nnomination.\n  She has exhibited exceptional leadership during her 10 years as New \nYork's Labor Commissioner. In this capacity, she managed 3,700 \nemployees in 80 offices and oversaw an annual budget of $11 billion.\n  In response to the current economic climate, Ms. Smith executed \ncritical programs to reduce the impact of layoffs. She also implemented \ncareer training to assist individuals in entering high demand fields. \nAdditionally, she has enhanced labor law enforcement in order to \nsafeguard workers and reward responsible employers.\n  Commissioner Smith fully embodies the integrity and the diligence \nthis position demands and has a wealth of experience, making her well \nqualified to enforce critical issues such as workplace safety and \nhealth, fair wages, equal employment opportunity, veterans protection, \nand retirement and health benefits.\n  Prior to her term as labor commissioner, she served as Chief of the \nLabor Bureau in the New York Attorney General's Office for 8 years. In \nthat capacity, she established a method of labor law enforcement that \nother attorneys general and enforcement agencies have used as a model. \nShe was an innovative leader here, increasing efficiency and \neffectiveness of the bureau by developing ethics standards, targeting \nenforcement efforts on an industrywide basis, and strategically \nfocusing on workers.\n  Commissioner Smith's nomination, which has been pending since April, \nwas reported with the unanimous support of all committee Democrats. \nAdditionally, she has the enthusiastic support of labor groups, women's \ngroups, and worker advocates. A number of prominent business \norganizations have also endorsed Commissioner Smith, including the \nBusiness Council of New York State, the Manufacturing Association of \nCentral New York, the Partnership for New York, the Long Island Forum \nfor Technology, and the Plattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce.\n  Commissioner Smith has endured a rigorous vetting process and has \nmade herself available to answer over 50 questions from our friends \nfrom the other side of the aisle and met with all interested Senators.\n  I urge my colleagues to move quickly to confirm Patricia Smith for \nSolicitor for the Department of Labor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Continental Connection Flight 3407\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we are approaching the 1-year \nanniversary of the fatal crash of Continental Connection flight 3407 in \nBuffalo, NY, and today the National Transportation Safety Board is \nactually holding a public meeting to consider the final report they are \nmaking on that crash.\n  I think almost everyone has heard the tragic story of that crash last \nFebruary 12. Two pilots, two flight attendants, 45 passengers on that \nairplane, and 1 person on the ground lost their lives. This flight was \noperated by Colgan Air. The plane was a Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 operated \nby a captain and a copilot, both of whom had commuted long distances to \nget to work to make that flight, both of whom had been found to have \nvery little rest before that flight.\n  The copilot revealed her inexperience in the cockpit recording that I \nlistened\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\nto--inexperience in flying in icy conditions--in the transcript of the \nvoice recordings. The captain failed a number of tests in his career as \na pilot. The NTSB is now considering 45 findings and conclusions at a \npublic meeting as I speak.\n  This morning the NTSB members said the plane and the flight crew were \nproperly certified, and the plane was in good condition before takeoff. \nThey also said the ice buildup that night flying into Buffalo was \ntypical and did not affect the ability of the flight crew to fly the \nairplane. So while we are waiting for the final conclusions of the \nNational Transportation Safety Board, the members of that board spoke \nabout crew training, pilot fatigue, and pilot error as reasons for the \ncrash.\n  These are the issues I have been holding some hearings on this past \nyear. The NTSB is going to make recommendations to the FAA. We already \nknow that when they make recommendations, the appropriate agencies \ndon't always pay attention to those recommendations. For example, pilot \nfatigue has continually been on the National Transportation Safety \nBoard's most wanted list for 19 years; that is, most wanted list of \nsafety recommendations. Let me say that again. For 19 straight years, \nthe National Transportation Safety Board has said ``pilot fatigue'' is \non the most wanted safety recommendations list. Yet no one has been \nlistening. Nobody seemed to ring the bell on those issues.\n  I have held seven hearings on safety in the aviation subcommittee \nthat I chair in this Congress. We have heard from the FAA, the NTSB, \npilots, regional airlines, major carriers, and safety experts. We have \nheard especially from the families who lost their loved ones in that \nfatal crash, that tragic crash in Buffalo, NY.\n  Let me be quick to say, we have had, fortunately, reasonably few \nairline crashes in this country in recent years. It is, generally, a \nvery safe way to travel. But there isn't room for error with respect to \nthese commercially airplane flights. I am going to be holding followup \nhearings with Senator Rockefeller and others in the Commerce Committee \nwith respect to the NTSB recommendations. We are supposed to have what \nis called ``one level of safety.'' The NTSB said, in the middle of the \n1990s, there is one level of safety for commercial airplane flights in \nthis country. The big, major trunk carriers that are national and \ninternational and the regional carriers shall have one level of safety. \nBut it is the case that regional airlines often employ pilots with much \nless experience, much lower pay, which forces difficult conditions.\n  In many cases, when you get on a small airplane for a regional \nflight, you see a crew with obviously much less experience. There are \nquestions, from time to time, raised about the training--questions \nraised in this investigation, as a matter of fact. We know there are a \nlot of factors that play into this one level of safety. But I think \nmost people believe that one level of safety standard, at this point, \ndoesn't quite measure up. That is the reason we will examine the \nrecommendations from the NTSB as a result of this crash.\n  At the time of the crash outside Buffalo, NY, Colgan Air didn't have \na remedial training program for pilots. The captain of the flight had \nfailed numerous performance checks over the course of his career and \nwould have made an excellent candidate for remedial training. I know \nthe FAA has been working on the industry to try to get them to do this \nfor a long while. If the traveling public ever begins to have very \nsignificant concerns about safety on a commercial airline flight, it \nwill be devastating to that industry. So safety must not just be a \nperception. Safety on commercial airlines, whether they be the major \ntrunk carriers or regional airlines, has to be something everybody \ntakes seriously and that the American people believe is taken \nseriously.\n  I wish to show you a chart that shows something that common sense \nwould tell you doesn't work. This chart shows where Colgan Air pilots \nwere commuting to. You will see they were commuting to Newark, their \nbase of operations. On that fateful flight going into Buffalo, NY, the \ncopilot flew all night long from her home in Seattle, WA, I believe \ndeadheaded on a FedEx plane, stopped in Memphis, TN, changed planes, \nand got to Newark Airport. After flying all night long, she is now \nready to take an airplane on its flight. There is no record of evidence \nof that copilot having a crash pad or someplace to find a bed and \nsleep. That is the copilot.\n  The pilot, on the other hand, came from Florida to Newark Airport. \nThere is no evidence, outside of being in the crew lounge at the \nairport, that the pilot had a bed in which to sleep or that he had \nrest. So you have a pilot and a copilot who get on that airplane to \ntake, in this case, those 45 passengers on that airplane on its flight \nto Buffalo, NY. On that flight, ice built up on the wings, and there is \nwhat is called a stick shaker on that airplane. There was rapid shaking \nof the control stick, which would have said to the pilot you must put \nthe nose down in order to gain additional speed. The pilot didn't put \nthe nose down but pulled the nose up, as I understand it, which is \napparently a training issue as well. So you have a pilot and copilot \ntraveling across the country all night long just to get to their duty \nstation, and things happened in the cockpit. In the transcript, the \ncopilot said she had very little experience flying in icing. Both the \npilot and copilot lost their lives.\n  I take no joy in reciting what happened in that cockpit. Their loss \nof life was a tragedy for their families as well. My point is simply \nthis: What happened here--by the way, I believe five out of the most \nrecent seven airline crashes in our country have been on commuter \ncarriers. This, it seems to me, raises a series of questions that must \nbe addressed--and now I believe will be addressed in recommendations \nfrom the NTSB by the FAA, dealing with the issue of fatigue. Who is \nflying the planes? Are they getting proper rest? It deals with the \nissue of compensation. Is it the case that you get on a small jet and \nknow that the copilot is making $18,000 a year or $20,000 a year, doing \ntwo jobs and flying across the country at night in order to get into an \nairplane cockpit? Does that give you confidence? The fact is, all these \nissues are now coming to the forefront--not just of this crash but \nother circumstances as well--and that requires the FAA to take a hard \nlook at what happened.\n  At one of my hearings, I showed a Wall Street Journal article, in \nwhich Mr. Wychor, an 18-year veteran pilot described the routine \ncommuter flights with short layovers in the middle of the night. He \nsaid:\n\n       Take a shower, brush your teeth, and pretend you slept.\n\n  That is not what you want in the cockpit of an airplane.\n  A 737 pilot flying to Denver said this, and this is an NBC News \nquote:\n\n       I have been doing everything in my power to stay awake--\n     coffee, gum, candy. But as we entered one of the most \n     critical phases of the flight, I had been up for 20 straight \n     hours.\n\n  That is an issue with me. It is one we have to address. I think all \nthoughtful people in that industry--and I have great admiration for \npeople in the airplane industry. They do a great job. They understand \nwe have to address these issues of fatigue, training, and compensation. \nThat is just the fact.\n  All I wished to do today was to say the National Transportation \nSafety Board, I think, does a great job investigating accidents. The \nfamily members of the victims of that flight that crashed in Buffalo, \nNY, have been extraordinary. They have come to every single hearing \nheld on Capitol Hill. They are witnessing, on behalf of their brothers \nand sisters and wives and children, saying: I don't want Congress or \nthe FAA to let up. We want you to address these issues. That crash \ndidn't have to happen. Our loved ones did not have to die. That is \ntheir message.\n  I say to them: You are doing exactly the right thing. What you are \ndoing--showing up here at all these hearings and keeping the pressure \non the Congress and, yes, on the FAA--will save lives. You will not \nknow their names, but you are saving lives. Good for you.\n\n\n                            Cloture Motions\n\n  Madam President, the issue of cloture motions sounds like a foreign \nlanguage to a lot of people. If you are back home someplace and are \ngetting up in the morning and struggling to get to work and putting in \na full day and trying to make enough money to raise your family and \nget along in life, you\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\ndon't know about cloture motions or the 2-day ripening or 30 hours \npostcloture. That sounds foreign to almost everybody.\n\n  This is a graph of cloture motions in Congress. In the 1950s, there \nwere two cloture motions filed in the entire decade. What does cloture \nmean? If you decide in this body--and you are the most junior Member of \nthis body, you are the last one elected, you are the 100th in seniority \nand you sit back by the candy door because that is the last desk--I \nguess we should not talk about a candy drawer, perhaps, but you sit way \nback in the corner and you are No. 100 in the Senate. Once you are on \nyour feet and recognized by the Presiding Officer, nobody else can take \nthe floor from you--not the majority leader, not the most senior Member \nof the Senate. The floor is yours and you can speak until you are \nphysically and mentally exhausted. That is the way the rules are; it is \nthe way the Senate works. Washington described the Senate as a saucer \nthat cools the coffee. You pour the coffee into the saucer and it \ncools. The Senate isn't supposed to work quickly or efficiently. It is \nsupposed to slow things down, take a better look at it, and have more \nevaluation and ask: Does this make sense for the country?\n  That is the way the Senate was created. It is hard to get things \ndone. But it is near impossible to get things done these days because \nof something called a filibuster and cloture motions.\n  I wish to provide some interesting statistics. This could not happen \nand wouldn't happen in any city council in America. There is no city \ncouncil in America where this sort of thing could happen, no matter \nwhat the rules were, because they would be laughed out of town. We have \npeople blocking bills they support. Can you imagine that? If you were \non the city council and your business was to block things you support \nand your neighbor said: What are you doing, are you nuts? No, I am \nblocking things I support because it has a strategy attached to it. \nWhat is the strategy, they would say.\n  Here is the situation: In 2009 and 2010, it is projected we will have \n146 cloture motions to shut off debate in this Congress. Let me \ndescribe what we are involved with next. We are on one now, by the way. \nWe are now in what is called 30 hours postcloture. We had a nomination \nthat should have been approved in 5 minutes. Those who want to vote \nagainst the nomination should vote no. But we could not do that. \nInstead, those who oppose the nomination for the Solicitor for the \nDepartment of Labor, a nomination--instead of having an up-or-down \nvote, during which those who don't like this nominee should vote no, \nthey said you cannot even have a vote. You have to file a cloture \nmotion and then wait for 2 days and then have a vote and see if you get \n60. If you get 60, after you get the 60, we are going to insist you \nbleed off 30 more hours because the rules allow us to do that. Only \nthen can you have a vote. That is where we are now. We had a cloture \nvote. It prevailed. Now we are waiting for 30 hours to elapse so \nnothing can be done during the 30 hours. It is just stalling. So then \nthe 30 hours is done, and we will vote on this. Then we will go to the \nnext nomination. So this week we will do two nominations, both of which \nshould have taken 5 minutes, if people of goodwill worked together and \ndecided: Here is the agenda; let's bring up these candidates for a \nvote. And if you like the candidate vote yes; if you don't, vote no.\n\n  So the next one is going to be Martha Johnson, GSA Administrator. By \nthe way, this one has been objected to, and it has waited for 7 months. \nSo 7 months ago this President nominated Martha Johnson to be GSA \nAdministrator. April 3, 2009, was her nomination. June 8, the \nnomination passed through the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee unanimously. So this nomination was voted on \nunanimously and approved by the committee, and that was June 8. Here it \nis February of the year following, and we now are going to get to vote \non this nomination that passed the committee unanimously, but not until \nwe are able to shut off a filibuster and then have 30 hours \npostcloture. It is the most unbelievable thing in the world.\n  Is this person qualified? Yes, absolutely. She served as the head of \nGSA during the Clinton administration and is hailed by former and \ncurrent GSA employees as the ``golden heir of GSA.'' She was the chief \nof staff back during the Clinton administration. She would be a vast \nimprovement, by the way, over the previous head of the GSA, the \nprevious head of the GSA--and I spoke about her on the floor of the \nSenate--Lurita Doan.\n  On April 29, 2008, the Office of Special Counsel for the United \nStates asked that she be disciplined to the full extent for the most \npernicious of political activity prohibited by the Hatch Act. She then \nsubmitted her resignation, in accordance with that request by the White \nHouse. She had been accused of providing no-bid contracts to friends \nwith whom she had extensive personal and business relationships. She \nand a deputy in Karl Rove's office at the White House had joined in a \nvideo conference with 40 regional GSA Administrators after a PowerPoint \non polling about the 2006 election, and she said: ``How can we help our \ncandidates?'' This is a nonpolitical office--heading the GSA--in our \ncountry.\n  This person got drummed out of office--and should have gotten drummed \nout of office--and resigned under pressure. So here is someone who is \nfully qualified and it is 7, 8 months later and we are finally going to \nget to have a vote, but only if we go through the motion of filing a \ncloture petition to end a filibuster. That is unbelievable to me.\n  Let me give some other examples of what is happening. Here is a bill \nthat was filibustered--the credit card holders bill of rights. There is \na filibuster against that by the other side, the Republicans. They \nfilibuster everything--everything. So the credit card holders bill of \nrights, they went through a filibuster, delayed, and after the delay it \npassed 90 to 5. Obviously, we had a bunch of folks who said: I am going \nto lay down on the track until it is inconvenient for everybody, and \nthen I will get up and vote for it.\n  We have people blocking things they support. You would get laughed \nout of town in any town in this country if you tried that on the city \ncouncil.\n  The Department of Defense appropriations--filibuster. Had to go \nthrough the motion of filing--2 days, 30 hours--and then it passed 88 \nto 10. So, obviously, we had a bunch of folks on the other side who \ndecided they were going to block something they supported, kind of a \ncurious strategy.\n  The Energy and Water appropriations bill--that was my bill that I \nchaired--went through filibuster, cloture, and in the end 80 people \nvoted yes. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act was filibustered by \nthe Republicans. Then when it was finally voted upon, after they had \ndelayed it, 92 of them voted yes. Again, we see people blocking things \nthey support. Only in the United States Congress, I guess.\n  Unemployment compensation extension was the subject of a filibuster, \nand then 98 people voted yes. People blocking things they support. What \na curious thing.\n  I mean, what do you tell your children if they ask: What was your \nrole, Dad or Mom?\n  My role was to slow things down. I just wanted to sort of spread glue \naround the Senate. Not that we don't think it is slow enough the way it \nis, we want to slow it down even further.\n  The fact is, people send men and women of goodwill to this Chamber. \nOne of the things I have learned in many years in this Chamber is that \nalmost every desk is occupied by someone who has pretty unique and \ninteresting and special skills to get here. In almost every case, there \nare people here with very substantial skills. But they are not sent \nhere with an agenda that says: You know what I would like you to do? I \nwould like you to block everything and then vote for it in the end. \nThat is not a message that comes from any State that I am aware of. \nThey are sent here to try to do good things for this country. All of us \nare. We might have a disagreement about what that means and how to do \nit, but there shouldn't be any disagreement about these kinds of \nthings.\n  In the middle of the deepest recession since the Great Depression, \nseven of this President's high-level nominees for the Treasury \nDepartment are not yet confirmed--seven of them. How do you justify \nthat? How do you justify deciding, in the middle of the deepest \nrecession since the 1930s, that you are\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\ngoing to prevent the U.S. Treasury Department from having a full \ncomplement of people who can think through and work through trying to \nput this country back on track; who can restart the economic engine and \nput people back to work again? How do you justify deciding we shouldn't \nhave a full complement of people to do that?\n  We had a fully qualified Surgeon General who was nominated, and that \nSurgeon General nominee was blocked. And this was after the H1N1 flu \nhad been declared a major health threat. Think of that. That nominee \nwas blocked even after we had a major health threat. We had the \nAmbassador of Iraq--obviously an important position--blocked during a \ntime of war just when we most needed to resolve some political issues \nthere.\n  One single Senator on the other side held up the nomination of the \nDeputy U.S. Trade Representative for 9 months--9 months that was held \nup--to try to force that U.S. Trade Representative's Office to file a \ncomplaint against Canada on some issue. I don't have the foggiest idea \nwhat that issue was, but I will tell you this: I would never, and have \nnever, held up a nomination for 9 months in order to try to force \nsomething that I insist should happen. That is not the way the Senate \nis supposed to work.\n  One Senator on the other side blocked a highly qualified nominee to \nbe Assistant Under Secretary for the Western Hemisphere at the State \nDepartment, and it had to do with our relationship with Hugo Chavez, \nwhich left us without the person who was supposed to be responsible for \ncoordinating our response to the difficulty in Honduras last year. One \nSenator held up that nomination on and on and on.\n  Again, the fact is, as I said, this is called the great debating \nbody, the most exclusive club in the world, and all of those \ndescriptions. But this is not the way it is supposed to work. We have \nsome models of how it is supposed to work. In the old days--and when I \nsay the old days, I mean some decades ago--people would get together \nand decide what is the major challenge facing our country and how do we \nwork together to find a way to resolve it; not who gets the credit or \nwho gets the blame, but what is needed to be done to fix what is wrong \nin America. That is the way the Senate used to work. Regrettably, these \ndays, it does not.\n  Our country rests on the precipice of a very significant cliff. We \nare still not out of this financial and economic crisis, although I \nthink there has been some stability and we have, hopefully, found some \nfoundation. But at a time when we most need cooperation, we see almost \nnone--almost none. It doesn't. Just read the record: An estimated 146 \ncloture petitions are filed to shut off filibusters, and on issue after \nissue after issue we have the minority in this Chamber blocking things \nthey ultimately vote for. How do you explain that--I was against it \nbefore I was for it?\n  Madam President, this country deserves and expects a whole lot \nbetter. This country is going through tough times. While I speak here, \nand while my colleagues are objecting to proceeding on anything--while \nwe are in a 30-hour period where nothing is happening on the floor of \nthe Senate--nothing--a whole lot of people are out looking for work. \nThey are stopping by business after business with their resume, and \nthinking: Can I find a way? Can I please find a way to get on a payroll \nand get a job to help my family?\n  There are a whole lot of folks who need a job, need some hope, need \nto keep their house, who are struggling. They deserve a lot better from \nthis Congress. The last thing they deserve is a Congress that decides \nits mission in life is to stop things from happening. The mission for \nevery Senator ought to be to get up in the morning and reach out and \nsee how we can work together to get the best ideas of what both parties \nhave to offer this country. That is happening far too seldom in this \nChamber.\n  It is not my habit to come to the Senate floor to be critical of the \nRepublican side of the Senate. I don't do that often, but I see what is \nhappening. We are sitting here today--and this is a good example of \nit--for 30 hours doing nothing. Why? Is it because there is nothing to \ndo? No. It is because the other side insists on cloture, insists on the \n2 days, then insists on the 30 hours. So what they will have done this \nweek is insist that we will only be able to confirm two Presidential \nnominees--one is a Solicitor General in the Labor Department and the \nsecond is to head the GSA. That is what we will get done this week. \nThat should have been done in 5 minutes, having a vote on those \nnominations. If you don't like the nominee, vote no; if you like the \nnominee, vote yes. Dispose of the nominations.\n  In my judgment, this system is broken, and it can't be 1 person or 10 \npeople who fix it. It has to be 100 people with reasonably goodwill who \nwant to make good things happen for the future of this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Tax Code\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, on Wednesday of last week the President \ngave his State of the Union Address and talked about a lot of issues. \nOne of the issues he mentioned that is especially important to me is \none I have worked on for some long while here in the Senate, and that \nis changing the Tax Code to begin cutting out and getting rid of the \ntax break that is offered to companies that shut their American \nfactories and move their jobs overseas. It is strange to most people to \nhear, but we actually have in the American Tax Code a reward for \ncompanies that would say: You know what I should do? What I want to do \nis shut down my American factory, I want to fire my American workers, I \nwant to move those jobs to China and hire somebody for 50 cents an \nhour. By the way, if they do that, they actually get a tax break in \nthis country. They get rewarded by the American tax system for moving \nAmerican jobs to other countries.\n  That is an unbelievably ignorant and pernicious part of our Tax Code \nand needs to be changed. I have offered amendment after amendment here \non the floor of the Senate on it, and the President in his State of the \nUnion Address last week indicated he believed we needed to do this and \ndo it soon. I could not agree more.\n  We are talking about jobs a lot in this Congress. We have had some \ndiscussions today about jobs again. Senator Durbin and I have worked to \nput together a jobs package that would try to stimulate and incentivize \nmore jobs, especially small and medium-size businesses to be able to \nhire people and have the incentive to put people on payrolls. We are \nworking on all of that.\n  Senator Baucus and certainly Senator Reid and others have been \nworking together with us to put together a jobs initiative. Even as we \ntry to find a way to create more jobs in our country, we still have \nthis backdoor approach in the Tax Code that rewards people for moving \njobs outside of our country. Most of us believe what we want to do is \nsee more of those signs that say ``Made in the USA.'' Made in the USA \nmeans there is a job someplace here, particularly in a factory that is \nproducing something, that is putting somebody to work to be able to \nmake a living, to provide for their family. No special program is as \nimportant as a good job that pays well.\n  I have both written a book about this issue of moving jobs overseas \nand I have spoken on the floor so many times people have either nearly \nor completely gotten tired of it. But the stories are legend of what \nhas happened in recent years. All of the little things we know and have \nexpected to be American made--almost all of those things are gone. \nRadio Flyer Little Red Wagon--we have all ridden in it. It was a 110-\nyear-old company in this country. They made those wagons for kids in \nAmerica, made in Illinois. Not anymore. All those Radio Flyer Little \nRed Wagons are made in China.\n  Huffy Bicycles--all those people in Ohio lost their jobs. They were \nall fired and all those bicycles are now made in China. In the book I \nwrote I told the story about the last day at work at Huffy Bicycles in \nOhio and those workers. As they left their parking lot, they left an \nempty pair of shoes in the space where their car was parked. It was a\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\nway for them to say to that company, the Huffy Bicycle Company: You can \nmove our jobs if you want, but you are not going to be able to \neffectively replace us. Those shoes, in an empty parking space in a big \nparking lot in Ohio when all those people lost their jobs, were a \nsymbol of what is wrong.\n  A little company made something called Etch A Sketch. Every kid used \nan Etch A Sketch. It was also made in Ohio. Not anymore. It is now made \nin China. The list goes on and on, those American products that are \ngone in search of 50-cent labor and higher profits.\n  The people who make these products--Radio Flyer Little Red Wagons or \nHuffy Bicycles or Etch A Sketch or, yes, even airplanes--the people who \nmake these products ask the question, What is wrong with my work? The \nanswer is nothing is wrong with your work. You just can't compete with \nsomebody who makes 50 cents an hour.\n  The second question is, Should I have to compete with somebody who \nmakes 50 cents an hour? The answer to that is no, you should not. This \ncountry needs a vibrant manufacturing base and it needs to fix this \nunbelievable tax provision that says if you move your jobs overseas, we \nwill give you a tax break.\n  In order to remain with a manufacturing base in this country, we need \nto reward the production of things in this country. ``Made in the USA'' \nshould not be a distant memory. ``Made in the USA'' ought to be \nsomething applied to things made here that we are proud of.\n  The Senator from Washington State is here. She is going to speak in a \nmoment. I will not be long.\n  But in every circumstance in this area of trade and the movement of \njobs, other countries take advantage of us because we allow them to. \nFor example, airplanes--Washington State makes some great airplanes in \nthe Boeing Company manufacturing plants. A country such as China that \nhas an unbelievable trade deficit with us, over $200 billion a year, \nsays to us: If you want China to buy your planes you have to build most \nof it in China. It doesn't make any sense to me. If we are buying all \nthose products from China in this country when we have something they \nneed, they ought to buy American products to be shipped to China, not \nsay to us you must move your product to be produced in China.\n  It is going on all the time and this country doesn't have the \nbackbone or nerve or will to deal with it. What we ought to say to \nother countries is we are going to hold up a mirror and you treat us as \nwe treat you.\n  If I might make one additional comment on automobile trade. Our \nautomobile industry has been in a very serious problem. We came close \nto losing our automobile industry in this country, which is so \nimportant for our manufacturing capability. This country has a trade \nagreement with China, with whom we have a $200-plus billion a year \ndeficit in trade. We have a trade agreement with China that says to the \nChinese--who are, by the way, ramping up a very large automobile export \nindustry and you will see Chinese cars on the streets of America very \nsoon--we say to China: If you ship Chinese cars to the United States of \nAmerica you will have a 2.5-percent tariff attached to those cars. But \nthe agreement also says if we ship American cars to be sold in China, \nthey may impose a 25-percent tariff. We have an agreement with the \nChinese that says we will give you a 10-to-1 advantage on tariffs in \nbilateral automobile trade. That is a recipe for undermining America's \nmanufacturing and economic strength and it goes on all the time. \nFrankly, I am sick and tired of it. One piece of it is something the \nPresident talked about last week and that is let's at least cut out \nthis unbelievably ignorant and pernicious provision that says: You move \nyour jobs overseas and we will give you a big tax reward. We will cut \nyour taxes if you move your jobs overseas.\n  I say to the President: Good for you. Help us shut that provision \ndown. Let's have ``Made in America'' be something we see more and more \nfrequently these days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his passion on this issue. I would add one other issue within this, \nwhich is that we have to be training our workforce for the coming years \nwith those skills to make those things in America--whether it is \nairplanes in my State or cars in the Midwest or South, or whether it is \nthe widgets he talked about. We are losing people today in this country \nwho have those basic skills--welding, electricians, those kinds of \nskills that are basic to these industries. As we move into this coming \nyear and look into our budget and look at our education policy--and we \nwill be talking about the President's education policy on the committee \non which I sit--we have to make sure we are going down into our middle \nschools and high schools and making sure our kids have career pathways \nthat help fill these skilled manufacturing jobs we want to have here in \nthis country. I thank the Senator for his words.\n  I am here this afternoon to rise again in support of President \nObama's nominee to serve as Solicitor of Labor, Patricia Smith. I have \nto tell everyone I am very confident she is the right person for this \ncritical job. The work she is going to do to protect our workers is \nmore important than ever before.\n  American workers are facing an incredible challenge today. We all \nknow that. They are struggling with record unemployment, a devastating \neconomic crisis. Today more than ever they need and they deserve strong \nleaders in the Department of Labor who are passionate about public \nservice and committed to being there to fight for them. The Department \nof Labor is this agency with a name that sounds bureaucratic, but it is \nimportant because that agency is charged with a very critical mission \nin our Nation's government. Its role is to foster and promote the \nwelfare of America's workers by improving their working conditions, by \nadvancing their opportunities for profitable employment, by protecting \nworkers' retirement and health care benefits and helping employers find \nworkers who are skilled in the jobs provided and strengthen free \ncollective bargaining.\n  I believe during these challenging economic times it is absolutely \ncritical that the Department has leadership within that Department to \nmake those goals a reality. I was very pleased when I heard President \nObama nominate such a strong candidate for the position of Solicitor of \nLabor.\n  Ms. Patricia Smith, as the Presiding Officer knows, is Commissioner \nof the New York State Department of Labor. She has been there since \n2007. She is cochair of the New York State Economic Security sub-\ncabinet and she oversees today 3,700 employees in 80 offices with an \nannual budget of $4 billion.\n  For the previous 20 years, Tricia worked in the Labor Bureau of the \nNew York Attorney General's Office and she served on the Obama \nadministration's transition review team for the Department of Labor.\n  I have received many letters of support for Patricia Smith from \npeople who admire her work, from people she has worked with, and from \nworkers she has helped. I want to take a couple of minutes this \nafternoon to read some excerpts from those letters because I believe \nthey demonstrate Patricia's broad support and why she should be \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  One letter I received was a letter of support from the CEO of the \nPlattsburgh, NY, Chamber of Commerce, who knows Tricia well. He said:\n\n       Patricia Smith has been an outstanding partner as \n     Commissioner of the New York State Labor Department and will \n     be an outstanding Solicitor for the U.S. Labor Department. We \n     strongly encourage her earliest possible confirmation by the \n     Senate.\n\n  I heard from the United States Women's Chamber of Commerce. They \nwrote to me and said:\n\n       After learning of Ms. Smith's qualifications, her expertise \n     and the laws she has worked to uphold, I can clearly see that \n     she is someone who would work with conviction to enforce the \n     laws of the United States of America. Additionally, I am \n     impressed with her out-of-the-box thinking in creating \n     programs that will keep jobs. We especially need these \n     attributes in these times of economic challenge.\n\n  That is from the United States Women's Chamber of Commerce.\n  I also received a letter from a group of professors and scholars of \nlabor and employment law and labor relations, from over 50 scholars of \nhighly respected institutions, institutions such as Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center, Columbia Law, Thomas Jefferson\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\nSchool of Law, Yale Law, and Cornell University School of Industrial \nand Labor Relations. They wrote to me and urged speedy confirmation \nsaying that Tricia has:\n\n     consistently demonstrated the highest integrity and \n     commitment to ethical standards. She is experienced, \n     intelligent, thoughtful and energetic. We believe this is \n     exactly what the U.S. Department of Labor needs in a \n     Solicitor. Once confirmed, she will be among the best \n     Solicitors of Labor the Department has known.\n\n  I would tell my colleagues that her support transcends party lines. \nFormer New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco, who is a Republican, had \nthis to say about his former employee:\n\n       Patricia Smith has proven herself as one of the foremost \n     experts in the nation in the realm of labor law, which is why \n     President Obama saw fit to nominate her. . . . She was an \n     asset to the New York Attorney General's office and I am \n     confident . . . she will be an asset to the Department of \n     Labor.\n\n  Tricia Smith has bipartisan support. As Chair of the Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Workplace Safety, I know the challenges American workers \nare facing today. I know they deserve a Solicitor of Labor such as \nTricia who is going to fight every single day to protect them. When she \nis confirmed as the Department's top legal counsel, she is going to \nhave the profound responsibility of enforcing more than 180 Federal \nlaws and managing more than 450 attorneys nationwide. She is going to \nbe responsible for defending the Department in litigation, as well as \nproviding legal advice and guidance on nearly every policy, \nlegislative, regulatory, and enforcement initiative of the Department. \nBut, most importantly, she is going to be responsible for defending the \nrights of workers when they are not able to speak for themselves. \nTricia has a big job ahead of her, but we need to act now to allow her \nto get started. We owe it to our country's workers to have a confirmed \nSolicitor of Labor in place.\n  I have had a number of conversations with Tricia myself, and I am \nconfident she is highly qualified, and she is eager to get to work. So \nI will be voting, hopefully later this afternoon or soon thereafter, to \nconfirm Tricia Smith. I come to the floor this afternoon to urge my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for \nup to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n      IN PRAISE OF JEREMY TEELA, SHAUNA ROHBOCK, AND HEATH CALHOUN\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak once more about \nAmerica's great Federal employees.\n  Next week, in Vancouver, the 21st Olympic winter games will begin \namid great fanfare and high hopes. Every four years, the world's top \nathletes in skiing, skating, hockey, and several other winter sports \ncompete to win medals and to win hearts.\n  Olympic athletes push themselves to their limits not only to win \npersonal or team glory but also to represent their nations on the world \nstage. A ticket to the Olympics is purchased with years of arduous \ntraining and a commitment to personal integrity and athletic fairness.\n  The values of Olympians are those of perseverance, integrity, \nteamwork, and national service.\n  If this list of values sounds so familiar to many Americans, this is \nbecause they are the same values that motivate those Federal employees \nwho serve our Nation in civilian roles and in the military branches.\n  This week, in honor of the upcoming winter games, I have chosen to \nhighlight three incredible American Olympians. They share these values, \nand all three of them chose to serve our Nation in the U.S. Army.\n  Jeremy Teela is an infantry sergeant. Originally from Anchorage, AK, \nJeremy joined the Army in 1997. In addition to serving in the infantry, \nhe participates in the Army's World Class Athlete Program. Jeremy is \none of America's best in the sport of biathlon.\n  Biathlon is a grueling race that begins with cross-country skiing and \nends with precision rifle shooting. Jeremy is a seven-time national \nchampion, and he was a member of the U.S. Olympic team in the 2002 Salt \nLake games and the 2006 games in Torino. Jeremy will once again be \ncompeting in the biathlon at this year's games in Vancouver. Last year, \nat the 2009 Whistler World Cup, which took place at the same venue, he \nwon a bronze medal--the first American to medal in biathlon in 17 \nyears.\n  Joining Jeremy in Vancouver will be SGT Shauna Rohbock of the Army \nNational Guard. She is one of America's champion bobsled drivers. A \nnative of Orem, UT, Shauna enlisted in 2000. Around that time, she \nbegan training in bobsled in the hopes of making it to the Olympics in \nSalt Lake City, just 40 miles from her hometown. While she didn't make \nit to those games, Shauna made it to Torino 4 years later. There, she \nwon the silver medal in Women's bobsled.\n  Comparing the teamwork required to succeed in the Army to the kind \nnecessary in Olympic bobsledding, Shauna said recently: ``Just like any \nteam or platoon, you're only as good as your weakest person. It takes \ntwo people to push the sled in a race. Bobsled drivers can't do this \nalone.'' This month Shauna will return to compete with Team USA in \nVancouver.\n  The Olympics are not the only games taking place in Vancouver this \nseason. Following the Olympics will be the 2010 Paralympic winter \ngames. There, the world's best athletes with physical disabilities will \ncompete in several winter sports.\n  Among those vying for a medal is retired Army SSG Heath Calhoun. \nHeath grew up in Bristol, TN, and joined the Army in 1999. In doing so, \nhe followed a family tradition--his grandfather fought in World War II, \nand his father served in Vietnam. Heath trained at Fort Benning, GA, \nand was deployed to Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division.\n  While on patrol in Iraq, his convoy was fired upon with a rocket-\npropelled grenade, and Heath lost both legs above the knee. After \nmonths of recovery at Walter Reed, he was losing hope that he would \never walk again. But with the help of the Wounded Warrior Project, \nHeath became an advocate for other soldier-amputees.\n  Determined to regain his mobility, Heath began training with special \nprosthetic legs and computerized knees. Soon he was able not only to \nwalk but also to run, golf, and drive an unmodified car.\n  In 2008, Heath began training for the Vancouver Paralympic Games in \nthe sport of adaptive skiing. He has been training in Aspen, CO, and \nwon gold in last year's Super-G National Champions in Men's sit-ski. He \nwill be headed to Vancouver in a few weeks to compete for medals there \nas well.\n  All three of these inspirational soldiers are not only Army strong \nthey are Olympic strong. The values that called them to the Army \nteamwork, perseverance, integrity, and service are the same ones that \ndrive them toward Olympic glory. It is the same set of values that \ncalls other Americans to serve in the Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast \nGuard, and civilian careers in Federal Government.\n  We have such talented citizens who are Federal employees, and whether \nthey are Nobel laureates or Army sergeants, whether they work behind a \ndesk or a spacesuit, they all share the common bond of having chosen--\nlet me repeat that--chosen to give back to the country we all love.\n  This is the case with all of the great Federal employees I have \nhonored from this desk so far and for those whose stories I have not \nyet shared or will not be able to during my brief term.\n  Shauna Rohbock put it best when she said: ``I feel it's a great honor \nto be able to represent my country as a soldier and an athlete.''\n  All Federal employees, military and civilian, athletes and non-\nathletes alike, represent us well.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting Jeremy Teela, Shauna \nRohbock, and Heath Calhoun and offering them and their fellow American \nOlympians our support in the pursuit of victory in Vancouver.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Nomination of Judge Joseph Greenaway\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think it is important we respond to \nthe public discourse and concern about what it is we do here to \naccomplish what is in the public interest. We know that for some time \nnow there has been obstructionism to moving ahead with the people's \nbusiness, that the price obtained for obstructionism is political gain. \nBut, like any other transaction, when you do that--when we take the \ntime and the energy devoted toward trying to move ahead and do not move \nahead--the price that is paid for this by the American public. It is \napparent that our friends on the other side have decided they would \nrather sacrifice the people's need for action on critical issues for \ntheir party's political gain.\n  We have seen delay, diversion, parliamentary gimmicks, wasted time, \nand a throwaway of huge resources to distort and distract us from \naccomplishing better lives for American families. Republicans have used \nstalling tactics such as the filibuster over 100 times since the start \nof this Congress just over 1 year ago. The problem is, the victims of \nthese delay-and-destroy tactics are people who need to get back to \nwork, have affordable health care, better education, and other \nessentials for decent living.\n  The victims are also well-qualified nominees for high government \npositions who seek to serve in order to carry America forward--nominees \nto fill an appeals court position, such as Judge Joseph Greenaway from \nmy State of New Jersey.\n  Joseph Greenaway is a well-qualified judge who has served on the \nFederal bench in New Jersey for over a decade. He has been nominated by \nPresident Obama for a seat on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. He \nbrings exceptional credentials and experience that are second to none. \nBut his nomination has been blocked without any criticism of his \neducation, experience, or merit.\n  This wonderful example of America at its best came from a modest-\nincome family. He has great academic credentials, excelling at Columbia \nUniversity and Harvard Law School. He brings a rare blend of \nexperience, clerking for a Federal judge, serving as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in Newark in 1985, and then working in private practice. He \ndistinguished himself prosecuting bank fraud and white-collar criminals \nbefore rising through the ranks to become chief of the Narcotics \nDivision. He moved on to serve as a U.S. district court judge in New \nJersey. In that position, he has built up a wealth of experience, \npresiding over more than 4,000 cases in his courtroom.\n  He has received numerous honors and awards recognizing his work, \namong them, the Earl Warren Legal Scholar, Thurgood Marshall College \nFund Award of Excellence, Garden State Bar Association Distinguished \nJurist Award--the list goes on--Columbia University Medal of \nExcellence, chair emeritus of the Columbia College Black Alumni \nCouncil.\n\n  Judge Greenaway has spent his career protecting the people of the \nState of New Jersey. Despite his critical bench responsibilities, he \nhas always found time to give back to the community. He teaches \ncriminal trial practice classes at Cardozo Law School and courses about \nthe Supreme Court there and at Columbia University.\n  Judge Greenaway will be an outstanding addition to the bench. The \nAmerican Bar Association rated him ``unanimously well qualified'' for \nthis position. That is why he was passed unanimously out of the \nJudiciary Committee. Not one Republican on that committee dissented. \nThere was not one vote against him. Yet Judge Greenaway has been \nsidelined for over 4 months, waiting for a vote on the Senate floor, \ndespite the need to fill that position. Every time we try to schedule a \nvote, Republicans have objected.\n  I am pleased to note there has been consent to go to a vote on Monday \nevening. The wait has been long. It has been tortuous. There can't be \nany understanding of why. With all the wonderful accolades Judge \nGreenaway has had for his work, his experiences, his climb to the \nposition he has had, what could be objected to? I say, if he is not \nacceptable in our colleagues' eyes, speak up. Vote against him. Show \nthe American people why this educated, brilliant legal scholar is not \nfit to serve.\n  Obstructionism last year led to the lowest number of judicial \nconfirmations in more than 50 years. It is time for this to end, and it \ndoesn't end with a vote on Judge Greenaway. There are lots of positions \nthat have yet to be filled. I wish to say to those who hear this or \nunderstand otherwise what is going on, this man, people like him, and \nour country deserve better.\n  When a confirmation is blocked, it is not just one judge who suffers. \nThe whole system suffers under the weight of vacancies in the \njudiciary. The American people suffer with longer waits for justice in \noverburdened courts.\n  The Third Circuit Court has a vacancy that needs to be filled. It is \ntime for our friends--Republican Senators who I know love their \ncountry--to stop obstructing things, when we have well-qualified \nnominees, and allow the Senate to confirm them without further delay.\n  When we have objections that are purposeful, come to the floor, \nexplain why, and explain it honestly and frankly in front of the \nAmerican people. But to hide behind objections reminds me of what we \nused to call people who refused to serve: conscientious objectors. That \nsays something in that phrase. I heard it often in America when I was \nin uniform as a soldier. Conscientious objectors, people who objected \nbecause they have a conscience. If that is the case, and if we relate \nthat to the current condition here, then let people who want to object \ncome up and explain why exactly it is they don't want to vote. But, \nagain, I am pleased our Republican colleagues have seen there was no \nlonger any purpose in delay.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from New \nJersey and speak for just a few minutes about Judge Greenaway. I had \ncome to the floor in hope and expectation that we could actually go to \nhis nomination this afternoon. I am pleased we will get a vote on \nMonday but, even still, this process has taken much too long.\n  This is a nominee for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals who has \nabout as good as it gets in terms of bipartisan support. At the age of \n40, he became a U.S. district court judge. Then, he passed by unanimous \nconsent of this Chamber--Republicans and Democrats alike, unanimous \nconsent. Now he passes out of the Judiciary Committee by, again, a \nunanimous agreement. Yet he has been held up for months on the Senate \nfloor. Why? Simply because you can?\n  That is not acceptable. It is not acceptable, when I have heard my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle for years talk about an up-\nor-down vote: Give us an up-or-down vote on a nominee, particularly a \nnominee who is eminently qualified, who is noncontroversial by virtue \nof the fact that he has achieved the ability to be agreed to in terms \nof his nominations, both past and present, as it relates to the \nJudiciary Committee without qualification, without objection.\n  So it is clear that up to this point the obstruction of this nominee \nis not about what is right for the Nation; it is not about acting in \nthe best interests of an overburdened judicial system; it is not about \nideology; it is not even about Judge Greenaway. It is about the \npolitics of obstruction. That is consequential to the judicial system \nand to our citizens who depend on that system for the administration \nand delivery of justice. This is more than a nominee; it is everyone \nwho is waiting for their cases on appeal.\n  I will point out to my friends on the other side that, hopefully, \nwhen we go to Monday's vote, we will understand that on countless \noccasions, they argued for an up-or-down vote, demanding that a simple \nmajority vote on the President's nominees is all that is necessary, a \nposition diametrically opposed to their position today. I recall they \nwent so far as to proclaim that filibusters of the President's \nnominations, particularly for the court, were\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\nunconstitutional, and they threatened what we call the nuclear option. \nI ask, again, which is it? Do my friends on the other side believe it \nis right that filibustering the President's nominees is \nunconstitutional or is the question what do they believe will work for \nthem at any given moment?\n  So we are looking for this up-or-down vote. I don't hear arguments of \nthe unconstitutionality of filibusters now, and I submit to my friends \nyou can't have it both ways. I urge my colleagues to--I know there will \nbe a unanimous consent request offered. I suspect it will be approved. \nIf not, I will return to the floor and have more extensive remarks on \nthis issue.\n  It is time for this nominee to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals to \nget a vote, up or down. This is an eminently qualified nominee. My \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, talked a lot about his \nhistory. There is even more. This is a superb nominee. If this nominee \ncan be held up for months, I can only imagine what we are in for as we \nmove forward. At least when it comes to nominees of New Jersey or the \ndistrict in which New Jersey is involved, I intend to come to the floor \neach and every time. But I look forward to some success here, at least \ntoday, and being able to make our system of justice actually work for \nour citizens and for that we need judges and justices in place.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, are we in a period of morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are not.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Chambliss pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2977 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, since we are technically under 30 hours of \ndebate on the nomination of Patricia Smith to be Solicitor of Labor, I \nwill rise in opposition to that nomination, as I did yesterday. I will \nelaborate a little on my concerns about the personal privacy violations \nin a program she created in 2009 called the Wage and Hour Watch.\n  The Wage and Hour Watch program recruits and trains union organizers \nand public interest groups to go into businesses with compliance \nliterature and interview employees to discover violations of wage-and-\nhour law. The State of New York gives participants materials to \ndisseminate and official cards identifying them and their group as \nbeing part of the program for when they enter businesses and speak with \nemployers and employees.\n  As part of this process, union and community organizers were directed \nto gather personal telephone numbers, vehicle license plates, and home \naddresses of business owners, as well as details about the employees \nworking there. These are people with 1 day's training and a special \ncard from the government. Labor organizers and community activists were \nallowed to use this information for their own organizing activities.\n  State identification cards were provided to individuals from various \nunions and community organizing groups to investigate businesses--but \nthe State conducted no background checks on those they trained and \nprovided identification cards to. Is this the kind of program we could \nexpect Ms. Smith to federalize if she is confirmed as Solicitor?\n  Another deep concern to me is how Ms. Smith described the decision \nnot to conduct any vetting or background checks for Wage and Hour \nparticipants who could collect this personal information. When Ms. \nSmith was questioned about this by the HELP Committee last year, she \nexplained that ``there is no formal vetting process for the New York \nState Department of Labor to partner with any entity. . . . The \nDepartment did consider the possibility of background checks on the \ngroups but ultimately rejected that idea after inquiring as to whether \nNeighborhood Watch groups are subjected to background checks. The \nDepartment was informed that the groups participating in this more \nsensitive crime prevention partnership were not subject to a check.''\n  Ms. Smith explains the lack of a background check because the program \nis modeled after the National Sheriff Association's Neighborhood Watch \nprogram. However, unlike Wage and Hour Watch, Neighborhood Watch is \npurely an observe-and-report program. Calling the police about \nsuspicious activity in a public area is different than investigating \nthe wages and hours of individual employees and recording their \npersonal contact information and investigating OSHA violations.\n  For all of these reasons, I have grave concerns about Ms. Smith's \ndecision to allow those who may have criminal records or may not be \nlegal residents of the United States to be trained and gather \ninformation under the auspices of New York State authority.\n  These instances reinforce the serious reservations I hold regarding \nMs. Smith's judgment, competency, and ability to lead the Solicitor's \nOffice. I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination for those \nreasons.\n  I want to also elaborate on my concerns about her agency's treatment \nof small businesses.\n  Ms. Smith's Wage and Hour Watch program specifically targets small- \nand medium-size businesses, including, for example, supermarkets, \nlaundromats, nail salons, for State-authorized investigations by unions \nand community groups. Five trade associations representing small- and \nmedium-size businesses wrote to Ms. Smith to question her agency's \ndecision to target them and launch her program without any input from \nthem. To quote them:\n\n       The image painted by the Department of Labor in its January \n     26 release is of a posse of activists, duly deputized by the \n     weighty imprimatur of the Department, demanding access to any \n     employer in the state whom they have chosen either at random, \n     or by prejudice.\n\n  Notably, the program had been launched and in existence for 2 months \nbefore she met with the trade associations. The New York Post \ncharacterized the program as ``vigilante labor justice'' targeting \nsmall business.\n  In documents produced to the committee, we also find that there is a \nculture in the New York State Department of Labor where bureaucrats \noften feel little responsibility for treating business fairly. For \nexample, when a reporter misquoted Ms. Smith's Deputy and protege, \nTerri Gerstein, she responded in an e-mail:\n\n       I never have said that any part of our job is to protect \n     employers against employees who abuse their rights. I have \n     been in this field for 15 years, and I have never said \n     anything like that. Employers have attorneys who can play \n     that role. All the workers have is us.\n\n  Small business doesn't just run out and hire attorneys, and they are \nnot used to having people come in at random and flash cards and take a \nlook at their business.\n  In announcing the Wage and Hour Watch program, Ms. Smith stated her \nopinion of the business community as follows:\n\n       And as the economy continues to reel, businesses find any \n     way they can to cut corners. Unfortunately, this is often at \n     the expense of the workers who keep them going. . . . The \n     future is now, it's here, and today the Labor Department \n     expands its field of battle.\n\n  I have found that whether it is employees or employers, there is \nprobably about 1 to 1.5 percent that will do the wrong thing no matter \nwhat the law is. We have to set up mechanisms to make sure that doesn't \nhappen and that people are properly treated. But to assume they are all \ngoing to cut corners and harm employees is the wrong approach. \nMoreover, according to internal e-mail, the program was designed for \n``community enforcement'' and created by organized labor, allied public \ninterest groups, and her Deputy without any consideration of small \nbusiness.\n  There are also questions whether the State honors its commitments to \nbusiness. Ms. Smith met with the trade associations concerned about \nWage and Hour Watch in March 2009--2 months after it started--and \npersonally committed to banning the pilot participants from promoting \ntheir individual organizations simultaneously with Wage and Hour Watch \nactivities. The official documents received from New York, however, do \nnot show this agreement was implemented and, in fact, appear to show \nthe Department allowing the groups to continue these activities.\n  These instances reinforce the serious reservations I hold regarding \nMs.\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\nSmith's judgment, competency, and ability to lead the Solicitor's \nOffice--more reasons I oppose her nomination.\n  Leaving aside the clear inaccuracies of her testimony to the Senate, \nyou will recall that I spoke extensively on that yesterday, where she \ngave us testimony and then we gave her a chance in written questions to \ncorrect her testimony. She did not. So there are also concerns with \nCommissioner Smith's ability to be a fair arbitrator and enforcer of \nour Nation's labor laws. In every instance I am aware of, Ms. Smith has \nshown herself to be a trusted ally of organized labor and even allows \nthem to participate heavily in the formulation of her agency's \ninitiatives.\n  Indeed, the State of New York's official records show that two of the \npilot groups for Wage and Hour Watch, a senior union organizer and a \npublic interest entity financed in part by unions, were heavily \ninvolved in developing all aspects of the Wage and Hour Watch program, \nincluding participant eligibility, program documents, training, and \npress strategies.\n  One of the union's written work plans stated they were going to use \nWage and Hour Watch in ``all of our organizing campaigns,'' including \nthose outside their designated area.\n  Also, a food and commercial worker union's newsletter states plans to \nspecifically investigate ``nonunion'' groceries as part of the Wage and \nHour Watch.\n  The cochairman of the State's Wage and Hour Watch program is the \npresident of a union.\n  Several program expansion applicants have as their sole purpose union \norganizing.\n  State officials also planned to ensure upstate trade unions would be \neligible.\n  Documents also show the New York Labor Department allows unions to \nparticipate in the wage-and-hour law investigations, including \ninterviews of workers with potential claims.\n  Ms. Smith's interaction with some of the organized labor allied \ngroups goes back to when she headed the labor bureau for then-New York \nState Attorney General Elliott Spitzer. Records show these same groups \nteaming up to coerce neutrality agreements and organize business.\n  With the Wage and Hour Watch program, union organizers now had \nofficial State identification cards they could use to enter any \nbusiness in New York--possibly allowing them to avoid nonsolicitation \nlaws or policies--to gather information on employers and employees. The \nunions were allowed to contact employees or employers at their homes or \nat the business as part of ``community organizing.''\n  Ms. Smith twice also attempted to alter a longstanding legal position \nto restrict charter schools for the benefit of organized labor--once \nwhile in the Attorney General's Office in 2007 and again when she \nbecame Commissioner of Labor. In both instances she was reversed by a \ncourt.\n  Commissioner Smith also maintains a senior executive for outreach \nsolely to organized labor--currently staffed by someone who worked for \n23 years for the AFL-CIO in organizing and with the SEIU. Notably, \nthere is no such equivalent role for outreach to small business or \nnonunion employees.\n  While I appreciate that organized labor is an important stakeholder \nin New York, this record of favoritism, including allowing union \norganizers to participate in State labor law enforcement, strikes me as \nclearly inappropriate. Indeed, I cannot imagine how my colleagues would \nreact if a Republican nominee in a future administration deputized \ntrade associations to investigate or enforce laws with regard to \nunions.\n  As you can tell, I have grave concerns about this nominee because of \nthese actions. But having also learned that she misled the Senate, and \nthen didn't correct her answers when she got the chance, I cannot \nsupport her. I urge my colleagues to oppose Ms. Smith.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Build America Bonds\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, after holding 20 townhall meetings in my \nhome State of Oregon over the past month, I can certainly report that \npeople are hungry for good economic news, particularly news about job \ncreation growing our economy. Our people want fresh ideas that work, \nand clearly they are saying, and saying passionately, that it is time \nto set aside government that doesn't work for them.\n  That is why I am proud to come to the floor this afternoon and talk \nabout a positive economic development--a development that has far \nexceeded the projections and the hopes of those who advocated for it--\nand that is the Build America Bonds program. Build America Bonds works, \nand it works because it puts our people to work at good-paying, family-\nwage jobs.\n  Mr. President, when I started working on Build America Bonds about 6 \nyears ago with a number of colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nit was because I believed there was bipartisan support for shoring up \nour Nation's crumbling infrastructure and, at the same time, getting \nour economy back to work. It is a fact that investing in \ninfrastructure, dollar for dollar, is one of the best economic \nmultipliers we have in our country, and it is a way to jump-start \neconomic growth.\n  As communities deal with the recession, I and my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle want to give our communities new tools to \nfinance essential construction projects. What Build America Bonds has \nalways been about is not taking any of the tools out of the toolbox we \nhave today, but putting in some additional ones for our communities. \nBuild America Bonds is certainly not a replacement for direct Federal \nspending on infrastructure, but I think all people who have looked at \nthis subject understand the need is so great for roads and bridges and \nwater systems and schools that we ought to be looking for all cost-\neffective, efficient ways to fund this essential infrastructure that \ndoes have bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  To report, we thought that maybe getting the Build America Bonds \nProgram off the ground would result in somewhere in the vicinity of $5 \nto $10 billion worth of additional investment in infrastructure. The \nprogram was authorized as part of the stimulus legislation. It did not \nget off the ground until the middle of the next year, and my colleagues \nand I thought perhaps the $5 to $10 billion of Build America Bonds that \nwere authorized would allow us to make the case that when the program \nexpires at the end of this year we could call for its renewal.\n  When the year wrapped up, the figures showed that almost $64 billion \nworth of Build America Bonds had been issued. In fact, a number of \nindependent experts say that Build America Bonds are now the hottest, \nmost attractive vehicle in the municipal bond market.\n  In my home State of Oregon, it has been proven time and time again \nthat private money follows public investment. People get back to work \nbuilding a bridge, for example, and all the businesses near the \nconstruction site get more activity from the people who need their \nservices. Once the project is finished, private investment follows the \npublic investment. That bridge makes it easier for folks to get to work \nor take their kids to school, and communities grow.\n  As I mentioned, this bill has a long bipartisan lineage. Then-Senator \nTalent joined with me about 6 years ago for this program. The program \nwould have created a Federal tax credit bonding program to fund \ninvestment in transportation infrastructure. Since then, our colleague \nSenator Thune and four others on both sides of the aisle have joined us \nto make sure the Senate was on record as saying we can find sensible, \ncommonsense, nonpartisan solutions that address the basic needs this \ncountry has to a great extent overlooked.\n  I have mentioned to date more than $60 billion worth of these \ninnovative bonds have funded hundreds of projects in 39 States--fixing \nour roads and bridges, rebuilding our schools, upgrading our utilities. \nThese are projects that have been funded, I advise my\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\ngood friend from Delaware, because we had a lot of discussion about \nexactly what works in infrastructure and what does not.\n  On top of this $60 billion of Build America Bonds infrastructure \ninvestment, we have seen $80 billion of direct Federal infrastructure \nspending that was included in the Recovery Act. So you have a one-two \npunch now for the first time to mobilize all possible resources to fund \ninfrastructure. You have a significant investment in what is called \ndirect spending. I particularly appreciate what a number of my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee have done in this area, \nparticularly Senator Murray, who has championed our cause in the \nPacific Northwest with respect to infrastructure. Senator Harkin, the \nchairman of the Pensions and Labor Committee, also has done a great job \nin school construction.\n  I want it understood that those of us who support Build America Bonds \nsee the bonds as a complement to the outstanding work a number of my \ncolleagues whom I have mentioned are doing. This is not to supplant \nthat kind of direct spending effort but to shore it up, to offer \nadditional assistance, particularly additional assistance when the need \nis so great.\n  As our proposal was developed, we had an opportunity to work with \nChairman Baucus and Senator Grassley, the chair and ranking minority \nmember on the Finance Committee, because we wanted to make sure this \neffort continued to be bipartisan at every step of the way. I am very \ngrateful that Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley in effect gave us a \nchance to jump-start this idea, to get it off the ground.\n  The reality is, I suggest to my colleague from Delaware, the Federal \nGovernment has never bonded in the transportation area. A lot of States \nand communities wonder if they would even exist without bonds, but the \nFederal Government had never bonded in the transportation area. We, our \nbipartisan coalition, believed a tax credit bond could be especially \neffective. But because Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley were \nwilling to bet on our bipartisan coalition, our coalition that said \nBuild America Bonds are going to be an efficient tool, we saw all the \npredictions for the success of this program exceeded. The reality of \nBuild America Bonds blew past the predictions like a bullet train. \nBuild America Bonds sold like hotcakes, getting desperately needed \nfunding going into local communities, creating jobs, and helping to \nstrengthen our infrastructure.\n  As I have suggested, anyone concerned that in some way this bond \nprogram would displace current assistance on infrastructure ought to \nlook at the numbers I have cited. Under the Recovery Act, there was $80 \nbillion for direct Federal infrastructure spending. It has been spent \non infrastructure or will be spent within the next year. And Build \nAmerica Bonds were sold on top of that assistance.\n  Here are some examples of Build America Bonds quickly putting folks \nto work. In Oregon's Dayton school district, they used Build America \nBonds to employ up to 150 people building and remodeling classrooms. By \nusing Build America Bonds, the school district saved an estimated $1.2 \nmillion in interest costs. It is a small school district. Those kinds \nof savings make a difference.\n  Communities in Wisconsin have also used Build America Bonds. One \nsmall community used them to lower their financing costs by 2.3 \npercent, allowing them to turn plans to upgrade roads, sewers, and \nbuildings into reality. One of their leaders told Business Week \nmagazine that without Build America Bonds, ``some projects might not be \ndone'' and ``there would be less employment.''\n  Recently a CBO/Joint Tax Committee report highlighted a number of \nother benefits from Build America Bonds. CBO and the Joint Tax \nCommittee found that tax credit bonds, like our Build America Bonds, \nare more cost effective than tax-exempt bonds. The report also \nconcludes that because the bonds are more attractive to investors, they \nare more efficient at raising capital. This saves municipalities time \nand money and effort that can be spent on other priorities. Aside from \nthe fact that the funds are raised efficiently, what I have heard again \nand again--and I think this is what colleagues are going to be looking \nat when it comes to infrastructure investment--Build America Bonds get \nthe job done quickly. Because they have to adhere to Federal spending \nguidelines, all of the bond funds have to be spent within 2 years of \nthe date the bond is issued. This means that money is not just flowing \ninto projects, it is being spent in the short term, paying to build \nroads and bridges and other infrastructure and putting folks back to \nwork quickly. That is the kind of bang for our buck that Americans are \nhungry for right now. That is what Build America Bonds deliver.\n  Back in the days before Build America Bonds were issued, the market \nfor normal municipal bonds was almost frozen. It was very hard to sell \nmunicipal bonds. It certainly didn't mean the need for financing \ninfrastructure was not there, it was just very hard to get them through \nthe traditional bond market. Build America Bonds have changed that. The \nprivate sector, folks who represent the country's largest businesses--\nthe Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers--have \nbeen strong supporters of it. Many of the labor groups, the trades in \nparticular, have been supportive of it because clearly business and \nworking families need a working infrastructure to give businesses the \nsecurity they need to think long term about their future.\n  But it is not just businesses that buy Build America Bonds. \nNonprofits, like pension funds, have also found Build America Bonds an \nattractive investment. Although nonprofits cannot benefit from the tax \ncredits, bond issuers can pass on the value of the tax credits in the \nform of a higher interest rate for Build America Bonds than other types \nof bonds. By contrast, traditional tax-exempt municipal bonds are not a \ngood investment for pension funds and other institutional investors \nthat do not pay taxes. So Build America Bonds are especially attractive \nas a way for nonprofits to invest in American infrastructure that \ntraditional tax-exempt bonds do not provide.\n  I am not surprised, and I think the judgment I have made would be \nshared by colleagues on the other side of the aisle because a lot of \nthem have been involved over these last 6 years--we are not surprised \nthat Build America Bonds are reinventing the municipal bond market. \nThey have been a good deal for our communities and for all types of \ninvestors. They have freed up financing for badly needed infrastructure \nconstruction and ensured long-term economic growth. In some cases these \nbonds, according to people in communities across this country, make the \ndifference between whether infrastructure projects are actually going \nto get done. In other cases they lower the cost of the projects and \nallow communities to reinvestment those savings in other projects.\n\n  By any scenario you look at with respect to this program, this is one \nthat helps local governments, local businesses, and the people who rely \non infrastructure for jobs and economic security. My view is that is \nexactly the kind of solution folks are asking for from the Congress at \nthis time. It is fine to speculate about programs you wish to have \nconsidered and you will look at down the road to see if they actually \nproduce. The Obama administration now wants to make Build America Bonds \npermanent because they have seen the extraordinary response our country \nis demonstrating. Build America Bonds have produced, and they have \nproduced exactly what was intended: a prompt infrastructure investment \nin an efficient fashion.\n  I express my appreciation to Chairman Baucus. Under his leadership \nthe Finance Committee, on which I am honored to serve, is currently \nlooking at expanding and improving Build America Bonds in the upcoming \njobs bill. I told Secretary Geithner this morning that I had \nappreciated his leadership and the administration's leadership on this \nissue.\n  We have some questions about how to proceed--for example, whether, as \nI would like, Build America Bonds should be devoted to new job creation \nas opposed to assistance for operating expenses and other areas. But \nthe bottom line is those are the kinds of issues that Democrats and \nRepublicans here in the Senate can take on in a bipartisan way. What we \nknow is we have something that is working, that is making a difference \nin this critical infrastructure area, and that literally\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\nhas 6 years worth of bipartisan history where Democrats and Republicans \nhave come together on an issue that is extraordinarily important to our \nNation.\n  If we keep working together on good ideas such as Build America \nBonds, by the time the current economic storm passes our country's \ninfrastructure will be finally ready to support a strong, healthy \neconomy that lies ahead for our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor as the chairman of \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence to speak on two nominations that \nhave been before our committee. Both of these nominees have been \nunanimously passed out by our committee.\n  The first is the top person for intelligence and analysis at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Her name is Ms. Caryn Wagner. Second, \nAmbassador Phil Goldberg, who is nominated to be Assistant Secretary \nfor Intelligence and Research at the Department of State.\n  These nominations are critically important to the safety and security \nof this Nation. These are the top intelligence officials in two \ndifferent departments. There has been an objection to a unanimous \nrequest from the other side on the question to confirm these nominees. \nThe majority leader of the Senate has come to the floor twice to \nimplore, to request, to ask that these two nominees be approved because \nthese are top intelligence people for the respective departments.\n  We just had a national threat hearing, a world threat hearing in the \nIntelligence Committee, open to the public and press, this afternoon. I \nasked the question: What is the possibility of an attack against the \nhomeland in the next 3 to 6 months? Is it high? Is it low? Director \nBlair; Director Panetta; Director Mueller of the FBI; the head of the \nDefense Intelligence Agency, General Burgess; the acting head of the \nINR, the intelligence agency of the State Department, Ambassador \nDinger--every one of them said that there will be an attempt at an \nattack. The threat is high. Yet we cannot get confirmed two top people \nwhose job it is to see that the analysis of this intelligence is \ncorrect.\n  Let me speak for a moment about Caryn Wagner. She has had a \ndistinguished career in public and private service that has prepared \nher to be the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and \nAnalysis.\n  We just had an attempted Christmas attack on the homeland. Ms. Wagner \nis the top person of that Department to deal with the intelligence \nrelated to exactly this--protection of the homeland.\n  You might think, well, is there a problem with the nominee? And the \nanswer to that is no. She is currently an instructor in intelligence \nresource management for the Intelligence and Security Academy. She was \nhired from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Prior \nto that, she served as the Assistant Deputy Director of National \nIntelligence for Management and as the first Chief Financial Officer \nfor the National Intelligence Program. She assumed this position after \nserving as Executive Director for Intelligence Community Affairs.\n  She also previously served as the senior Defense Intelligence Agency \nrepresentative to the U.S. European Command and the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization, as well as Deputy Director for Analysis and \nProduction at the Defense Intelligence Agency. She was also formerly \nstaff director of the Subcommittee on Tactical and Technical \nIntelligence on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \nand a signals intelligence and electronic warfare officer in the U.S. \nArmy.\n  She has been an intelligence official all of her professional life. \nShe is serious. She is capable. She is a good candidate for the \nposition of Under Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  We held a confirmation hearing on Ms. Wagner's nomination on December \n1. Given the overlapping interest of the Homeland Security Committee, \nthe Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee held a hearing \non her confirmation on December 3. There were no issues with her \nnomination in that committee.\n  The position to which she is nominated is the top intelligence \nposition in the Department of Homeland Security. The main \nresponsibilities of this office are to ensure that information related \nto homeland security threats are collected, analyzed, and disseminated \nto homeland security customers in the department at the State, local, \nand tribal levels.\n  So this is an important job. There is no one in it. We have just had \nan attack, and the chances of another attempted attack in the next 6 \nmonths are high. Yet somebody on the other side--I suspect for \npolitical reasons--is holding her up. It makes no sense, if you want to \nprotect this Nation, to hold up this position. I hope whoever it is \nwill come to the floor and explain why they are holding up this \nnominee, a woman who has had a lifetime dedicated to intelligence, who \nwould be the top intelligence person in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. One person holding her up, vetted by two committees, \nIntelligence and Homeland Security, without a negative vote at \nIntelligence. Why would someone hold her up? For their own agenda? Is \nit appropriate to hold her up for someone's own personal agenda, when \nyou have the top person in that department responsible for \nintelligence, at a time when we have just had an attempted attack? I \nthink not.\n  The Under Secretary of the office leads efforts to collect and \nanalyze intelligence, to see that it is shared appropriately and \nprovided to other intelligence community agencies. The Under Secretary \nprovides homeland security intelligence and advice to the Secretary, as \nwell as to other senior officials in the Department, and serves as the \nDepartment's senior interagency intelligence representative. They have \nno one right now. It makes no sense to me.\n  In short, this individual, the Under Secretary for Intelligence of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for ensuring that \nintelligence relating to a threat to the United States is acted upon. \nThat spot is vacant. From an intelligence point of view, this is quite \nterrible. It is deleterious. It is not right for this body to hold up \nthis nominee.\n  Unfortunately, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis has \nexperienced numerous problems in its short tenure. Let me note some: \nThe office's ill-defined planning, programming, and budgeting \nprocesses; a gross overreliance on contractors, to the point that 63 \npercent of the workforce was contracted out as of this summer; and a \nlack of a strategic plan. These are three major problems for which the \nUnder Secretary needs to get on board. The Under Secretary needs to \nsolve these problems.\n  On a number of occasions, the office has produced and disseminated \nfinished intelligence that has been based on noncredible, open-source \nmaterials or focused intelligence resources on the first amendment-\nprotected activities of American citizens.\n  So what is my bottom line? The office is in need of strong leadership \nfrom an Under Secretary with an extensive background in management of \nintelligence. The Intelligence Committee is confident Ms. Wagner is \nsuch a person. She is up to the challenge. She testified that, if \nconfirmed, among her first tasks will be to review a draft plan to \nrestructure and refine the office's mission, which will be a good first \nindication of how Ms. Wagner will manage the organization. We should \nget cracking. We should get it done. We should get this spot filled.\n  I, respectfully, ask that if there is something we do not know, that \nthe Homeland Security Committee does not know, that the Intelligence \nCommittee does not know, that the person holding her up come to the \nfloor and tell us what it is. It is a significant deficit not to have \nthis position filled.\n  Let me turn to the nomination of Ambassador Philip Goldberg to be \nAssistant Secretary for Intelligence and Research at the State \nDepartment. Again, the Intelligence Committee had a hearing. We \nunanimously approved\n\n[[Page S421]]\n\nAmbassador Goldberg's nomination on December 10, the same day we \nreported out Ms. Wagner's nomination.\n  Ambassador Goldberg has a distinguished 20-year career in the Foreign \nService, where he has served as the charge d'affairs and deputy chief \nof mission in Santiago, Chile; the chief of mission in Pristina, \nKosovo; and in the U.S. Embassies in Bogota, Colombia, and Pretoria, \nSouth Africa. Ambassador Goldberg is a graduate of Boston University \nand, before joining the Foreign Service, he worked for the city of New \nYork.\n  From 2006 to 2008, he served as Ambassador to Bolivia, during a \nperiod of heightened tensions between our two countries.\n  In mid-September 2008, President Evo Morales accused Ambassador \nGoldberg of supporting opposition forces, declaring him persona non \ngrata, and expelled him from the country.\n  The Intelligence Committee carefully reviewed Ambassador Goldberg's \nconduct in Bolivia. We have found he acted appropriately during his \ntenure and carried out the policies of the U.S. Government. In fact, an \ninspector general report on the Embassy, published in September of \n2008, gave Ambassador Goldberg and his deputy high marks, stating:\n\n       The Ambassador and the deputy chief of mission (DCM) \n     provide clear policy guidance and leadership . . . [They \n     gather] input and the advice from their staff, forging an \n     excellent working relationship among all agencies and \n     sections at post.\n\n  After Ambassador Goldberg's expulsion from Bolivia, the State \nDepartment strongly defended the Ambassador, both in the public press \nas well as in internal memoranda. In short, the Intelligence Committee \nbelieves Ambassador Goldberg acted professionally and bears no blame \nfor the Bolivian decision to expel him.\n  Since June of 2009, Ambassador Goldberg has served as the coordinator \nfor the implementation of United Nations resolution 1874, which imposed \neconomic and commercial sanctions on North Korea. In this position, he \nhas relied on sensitive intelligence reporting to build a diplomatic \nconsensus to search North Korean cargo.\n  Ambassador Goldberg appeared before the Intelligence Committee for a \nconfirmation hearing on December 1, 2009. Given its jurisdiction over \nthe State Department, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee also held \na hearing on Ambassador Goldberg's nomination on November 19, 2009. No \nproblems with the nomination were identified.\n  The unanimous view is, Ambassador Goldberg is an experienced \nprofessional who is very capable and ready to assume his new duties.\n  The position of Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Research is \na unique one in the intelligence community. The bureau, which we refer \nto simply as INR, produces all source intelligence analysis to advise \nthe Secretary of State and other senior policy officials and presents \nan important viewpoint in the internal deliberations of the \nintelligence analytic community. INR analysts are highly expert in \ntheir fields and often improve the quality of coordinated intelligence \nassessments by challenging the views of other agencies and, if \nnecessary, dissenting from consensus judgments, if they believe them to \nbe incorrect or unsubstantiated.\n  I first came to appreciate INR's independent-minded approach in 2002, \nwhen its analysts dissented from the official judgment of the \nintelligence community regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. \nINR analysts expressed less certainty regarding the claim that Iraq was \nreconstituting nuclear weapons, believing that Saddam Hussein's pursuit \nof aluminum tubing was not for nuclear purposes.\n  History, of course, proved the INR analysts to be correct, as Iraq \nwas not reconstituting a nuclear weapons program.\n  Bottom line: Ambassador Goldberg is well qualified, and the position \nfor which he has been nominated to fill is an important one within the \nintelligence community. There has been no reason put forward why he \nshould not be confirmed. Two committees have held hearings. The \nIntelligence Committee recommended his confirmation unanimously. We did \nfor both these nominees. Yet there is a hold on the other side of the \naisle.\n\n  As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I believe it places our \nNation at a security disadvantage. I urge that change. I urge that \nwhoever has the hold, if they have something that is consequential \nagainst either one of these nominees, do the honorable thing. Come to \nthe floor of the Senate, express your objections. Have the debate and \ndialog on the ability, the experience, the doings of these two people. \nThey are superbly qualified. Neither one of these was plucked out of \nsome political community and thrust into these positions. They have \nboth been dedicated professionals. That is one of the reasons why this \nhold is so difficult to understand.\n  I wish the Senate to know that the Intelligence Committee, which I am \nproud to chair, takes its responsibility to review the President's \nnominees to positions requiring Senate confirmation very seriously. Our \nprocess is thorough and bipartisan. The staff does an investigation. \nThe documents are reviewed. The hearing is held. Written questions are \nsent. Written questions are answered. The questions and their answers \nare read. The committee discusses it and votes. In this case, three \ncommittees have reviewed these two nominees. The Intelligence Committee \nhas found them qualified for their positions. Yet they are held up.\n  Consider that on Christmas Day we had someone who tried to explode a \ndevice, a device which will be perfected, which will be used again, \nwhich is basically impossible to find by a magnetometer in an airport, \nwhich will be used again, and that intelligence professionals assess \nwith confidence that we face another attack. We ought to get these \npositions filled.\n  Unless there is some reason why these two nominees are faulty, if \nthey are not qualified, if they have done something wrong, then I say \ncome to the floor and oppose them openly. But ``time's awastin'.'' \nThese positions have to be staffed. This country has to be protected. \nOur intelligence professionals need to be in place. In two departments, \nwe have two high-level positions relating to intelligence that are not \nfilled and should be filled and these nominees are waiting.\n  So I hope someone is listening. I hope, somehow, someway, this will \nmake a difference. And I very much hope we will be able to confirm both \nof these nominees--reviewed by the Foreign Relations Committee, one; by \nthe Homeland Security Committee, the other; and reviewed and approved \nby the Intelligence Committee, both.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, Mr. President, here we are. It is about 5 minutes \nto 6 p.m. We have been here all day today postcloture on Patricia \nSmith. Again, to recap why we are here--I am not certain why we are \nhere but to recap the fact that we are here--Patricia Smith was \nreported out of our committee last year, was held up to be the \nSolicitor for the Department of Labor, and finally we had to file \ncloture because she was being filibustered. That cloture motion ripened \nlast night and we had a cloture vote last night. Sixty people voted to \nend debate and bring her up for a vote. Well, under the rules of the \nSenate, there is then 30 hours of debate. So we have been here. It has \nbeen nearly 30 hours.\n  We have been here all day today, and, as I understand, only one \nperson showed up today to talk against her nomination. That was my \ncolleague and good friend, Senator Enzi from Wyoming, the ranking \nmember of our committee. I looked at the transcript of what he said, \nand basically it was just about what was said yesterday. Nothing new \ncame out today. I know Mr. Enzi opposes her nomination. That is no \nsecret. It is his right to do that. But here we are using 30 hours and \nonly one person today has come over to speak against her.\n  So, again, I just say this to inform the public that here we are, the \nlights are on, the electricity is running, the bills are going up, and \nwe are here for\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\nno good reason whatsoever. We could have voted on the nominee last \nnight. We could have voted this morning and moved on to other business. \nThere is other business before the Senate that needs to be attended to. \nBut the Republicans have decided under their leadership to slow \neverything down.\n  I have heard it said by the leadership on the Republican side that \nthe public wants them to stop bad legislation. That is why they use the \nfilibuster. Well, this is not legislation. This is a person to be the \nSolicitor for the Department of Labor, and obviously she has more than \nenough votes to get confirmed. She is eminently well qualified. She has \na broad swath of support. Again, they can filibuster, but we had the \nvote on that last night to end the filibuster. But, again, it is their \nright under the rules--I am not denying that--it is their right to drag \nit out for 30 more hours. But to what end? To what purpose? Has more \ninformation come out about Ms. Smith that might change somebody's mind \non how they are going to vote, whether she should take this position? \nNo, nothing more has come out, no new information. So here we are \nwasting time, slowing everything down. The public has to know this. \nPeople out there are frustrated because we are not getting anything \ndone. This is a perfect example of how the Senate has become \ndysfunctional--dysfunctional. Here we are for 30 hours doing absolutely \nnothing, to no end whatsoever.\n  Usually, as to the 30 hours after a cloture vote has been had, people \nwill say: Well, there is new information. We have to bring out \nsomething new. We can maybe change some votes.\n  Nothing new has come out and nothing new will come out. She has been \nthoroughly vetted since last April, almost a year. She has responded to \nevery written question. She has responded to any personal request to \nmeet with her. So everything is out there in the open. Yet the \nRepublicans insist on dragging it out for 30 hours. Again, the public \nhas a right to ask why. Again, to what end? To what end are we dragging \nout the 30 hours? Well, I guess the end is to try to keep us from doing \nanything else.\n  As President Obama said in his State of the Union Address, just \nsaying no is not leadership. Just saying no is not leadership. That is \nall we are hearing from the Republican side--no to everything. Well, it \nis all right if they want to say no, but at least let's vote. Let's \nvote.\n  It is very frustrating--very frustrating. I know they can use the \nrules, but you can also abuse the rules. The filibuster is being \nabused. It used to be used only for weighty measures in which there was \na true disagreement and for which, perhaps, some could be swayed one \nway or the other through the debate and arguments that came forward on \nthe floor--not for nominations. So everything is slowed down.\n  I also wish to say a few more words on behalf of Patricia Smith. \nAgain, we have not heard anything new during these 30 hours. There was \none thing my colleague and friend Senator Enzi said today that I do \nwant to respond to. Again, it was nothing new, but it was just said \nagain today about this Wage Watch that was instituted in New York as a \npilot program, about how they were going to investigate and go into \nbusinesses and all that kind of stuff. Again, I do not want to repeat \nwhat somebody lower down has said. I want to know what Ms. Smith \nherself said about it.\n  Here, as shown on this chart, is an e-mail from Commissioner Smith--\nright now from her--dated January 15, 2009, when they were starting up \nthis program. Here is her e-mail--not some underling's, not some staff \nperson's, but Ms. Smith's, who is the subject of the nomination--\n\n       Wage Watch groups will be conducting activities which \n     promote labor law compliance . . . including handing out \n     leaflets about labor laws to workers at community events or \n     supermarkets; giving know-your-rights training to workers; \n     talking to workers at restaurants and other businesses open \n     to the public; and talking with employers about labor law \n     compliance.\n       Please note that the groups and individuals who participate \n     as Wage Watchers will not be agency employees or official \n     representatives of the Labor Department. They are not \n     replacing staff and they are not going to be conducting \n     investigations of any kind. Their role is limited to doing \n     outreach and community education, and to reporting any \n     violations they encounter to the division.\n\n  So that is what the Wage Watch was set up to be. But, again, we keep \nhearing all of these accusations about vigilantes and all that kind of \nstuff. They are not empowered to enter any place of business unless the \nemployer lets them or unless it is a place of business where the \ngeneral public can go such as a restaurant, a Wal-Mart, whatever--\nstores. Wherever the public can go, they can go, but they cannot enter \na business that is not generally accessible to the public. I wanted to \nset the record straight one more time.\n  Again, if Ms. Smith were so bad, I would daresay you couldn't find a \nbusiness group that would support her. I have here a whole bunch of \nletters from business groups in the State of New York where she is \npresently the labor commissioner extolling her virtues and her ability \nto work with the business community. Here is the Business Council of \nNew York State. I won't read it all, but it says:\n\n       As the president and CEO of a statewide business trade \n     organization, I believe Ms. Smith is superbly qualified to \n     assume the responsibilities of Solicitor General and urge the \n     Committee's favorable disposition of her nomination.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Ms. Smith's long tenure as an Assistant Attorney General of \n     New York leading its Labor Bureau showed her to be thorough, \n     fair, and judicious in the use of the tools at her disposal \n     to ensure compliance with New York's labor law.\n\n  Then he goes on further:\n\n       What is important to note is that under Ms. Smith's \n     leadership, she made an extra effort to communicate directly \n     with the business community, to elicit feedback, to provide \n     us with a heads-up, and to balance our comments as she framed \n     policy and practice within her Department. Her outreach to us \n     and communication with us was open, honest, candid, and \n     frequent.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Kenneth Adams, president \nand CEO of the Business Council of New York, be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The Business Council\n\n\n                                      of New York State, Inc.,\n\n                                      Albany, NY, August 14, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of M. Patricia Smith, U.S. Department of Labor \n         Solicitor General.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC \n         20510.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the 3,000 members of The \n     Business Council of New York State, I write in support of \n     President Obama's nomination of Ms. Patricia Smith for the \n     position of Solicitor General at the United States Department \n     of Labor. As the president and CEO of a statewide business \n     trade organization, I believe Ms. Smith is superbly qualified \n     to assume the responsibilities of Solicitor General and urge \n     the Committee's favorable disposition of her nomination.\n       As the Committee has the broadest access to Ms. Smith's \n     resume and credentials, I write to add a perspective which \n     often does not translate well from written documents or \n     background checks. Ms. Smith's long tenure as an Assistant \n     Attorney General of New York leading its Labor Bureau showed \n     her to be thorough, fair and judicious in the use of the \n     tools at her disposal to ensure compliance with New York's \n     Labor Law. She carefully balanced the disparate issues before \n     her and sought resolution as opposed to prosecution, when \n     that result would serve the best interests of New York's \n     citizens. And where blatant fraud, abuse and disregard for \n     New York's Labor Law was evident, she did not rush for \n     headlines and photo opportunities, but rather worked closely \n     with appropriate officials to build a legal case which would \n     withstand scrutiny and higher level appeals.\n       In her tenure as New York's Commissioner of Labor, Ms. \n     Smith continued her vigilance and diligence on behalf of New \n     York's citizens, again balancing the many different roles the \n     Department of Labor serves in New York State. To those not \n     familiar with the responsibilities of that Department, they \n     may not understand the challenge it can be to manage an \n     agency which issues unemployment benefits; must be vigilant \n     about fraud in that $2.5 billion unemployment system; engages \n     with businesses and individuals to help put people back to \n     work; manages a workforce development system designed to \n     improve skills of our workforce; and, enforces rigorous \n     minimum wage, safety and health, and various labor standards' \n     statutes. At times, a Commissioner is asked to decide between \n     what may seem to be conflicting goals and objectives; Ms. \n     Smith always demonstrated to the business community a \n     willingness to listen, to reflect and to respond.\n       To be sure, our organization did not always agree with the \n     policy direction taken under Ms. Smith's tenure. But there \n     are well-established processes through which we can pursue \n     changes to policies with which we disagree. What is important \n     to note is that\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\n     under Ms. Smith's leadership, she made an extra effort to \n     communicate directly with the business community, to elicit \n     feedback, to provide us with a heads-up, and to balance our \n     comments as she framed policy and practice within her \n     Department. Her outreach to us and communication with us was \n     open, honest, candid and frequent. While some may view her \n     tenure as one of strict enforcement, with little regard to \n     practical day-to-day business realities, our membership would \n     disagree, as we believe she offered an opportunity to the \n     business community to be a part of the solution, rather than \n     just reacting to the problems.\n       New York's Labor Laws date back a century and reflect the \n     seriousness with which policymakers then and now feel the law \n     should protect workers and be responsive to their needs. That \n     is the statutory and regulatory environment within which New \n     York employers must operate. Where employers engage in fraud \n     and abuse of employees, enforcement of the law is a duty, not \n     an option. Ms. Smith has shown a clear ability to balance her \n     duty as a public official to enforce the law and her \n     obligation as a public official to ensure that the law \n     provides for reasonable application and reasonable solutions.\n       It is those critical skills--listening, interpreting, and \n     balancing--that make Ms. Smith an ideal candidate to serve as \n     the United States Department of Labor's Solicitor General and \n     I would ask that the Committee move on her nomination upon \n     its return in September.\n       Should any Committee members benefit from further \n     discussion on her nomination to which I can contribute, \n     please feel free to contact me at your convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Kenneth Adams,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here is a letter from the Partnership for \nNew York City. Again, I won't read it all, but it says:\n\n       As an advocate for businesses and economic development in \n     New York for more than twenty-five years, I have had the \n     opportunity to interact with many public officials. Ms. Smith \n     stands out as one of the most dedicated and effective of our \n     state commissioners and I consider her to be an excellent \n     choice for the post that the President has selected her for.\n\n  That is from the president and CEO of the Partnership for New York \nCity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 1, 2009.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: I am writing in support of President \n     Obama's nomination of M. Patricia Smith for Solicitor General \n     of the United States Department of Labor.\n       The Partnership for New York City is an organization whose \n     members include many of the nation's most prominent business \n     leaders. Our mission is to work with government, organized \n     labor and the not-for-profit sector to build a stronger city \n     and state, with a focus on education, infrastructure and the \n     economy.\n       During the past year, we have been particularly concerned \n     about the threat that the global financial crisis and \n     recession have had on the financial services industry, which \n     is a key source of jobs and tax revenues for New York. \n     Thousands of city businesses and workers, either directly or \n     indirectly, have been casualties of this crisis. As New York \n     State Labor Commissioner, Patricia Smith has been a strong \n     voice and essential partner in addressing the issues arising \n     from this crisis and helping to insure that New York remains \n     the financial capital of the country and the world.\n       Ms. Smith acted decisively to mobilize New York, \n     Connecticut and New Jersey to collaborate as a region with a \n     shared interest in the recovery of the financial services \n     industry and keeping top talent here. She led efforts to \n     secure a $20 million National Emergency Grant that is \n     currently helping thousands who have been laid off to train \n     for new careers. She established a New York Early Alert/\n     Retention Team to respond to small businesses in danger of \n     closure, relocation, or financial crisis that would result in \n     mass layoffs.\n       She has aggressively promoted programs that help employers \n     retain productive workers during downturns and fund employer-\n     sponsored worker training initiatives. She increased employer \n     participation in the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit \n     (WOTC), which provides incentives to employers to hire people \n     who are hard to employ. The Partnership strongly supports \n     these programs, and every one of them has seen unprecedented \n     success in New York City under Commissioner Smith's \n     leadership.\n       As an advocate for businesses and economic development in \n     New York for more than 25 years, I have had the opportunity \n     to interact with many public officials. Ms. Smith stands out \n     as one of the most dedicated and effective of our state \n     commissioners and I consider her to be an excellent choice \n     for the post that the President has selected her for.\n       We hope you will support her nomination and would be happy \n     to answer any questions you might have about her work with \n     the New York business community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kathryn S. Wylde,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Here is a letter from the Manufacturers Association of \nCentral New York:\n\n       The Department of Labor under the leadership of \n     Commissioner Smith has been fully supportive in our mission \n     to enhance and improve our sector's workforce. Commissioner \n     Smith and her team have been informative, helpful, and \n     involved every step of the way, ensuring our membership has \n     the tools, education and skills they need in order to \n     succeed.\n\n  It is signed by Randy Wolken, president of the Manufacturers \nAssociation of New York.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Manufacturers Association\n\n\n                                          of Central New York,\n\n                                 Syracuse, NY, September 11, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of M. Patricia Smith as Solicitor General, \n         United States Department of Labor.\n\n     Hon. Jeff Merkley,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n        Dear Mr. Merkley: On behalf of MACNY, the Manufacturers \n     Association and its members, I fully give my support to the \n     nomination of Patricia Smith as Solicitor General of the \n     United States Department of Labor.\n       MACNY is a trade association representing over 330 member \n     companies with over 55,000 employees within a 19-county \n     region, and we serve and advocate for the growth and \n     development of the manufacturing sector of New York State. \n     Founded in 1913, we pride ourselves on not only being the \n     largest association of manufacturers in New York, but also \n     one of the oldest and most widely recognized associations in \n     the nation.\n       For Central and Upstate New York to retain its \n     manufacturing base, manufacturers must be able to compete in \n     the global economy. Manufacturing strength is contingent upon \n     the quality of the region's workforce. Manufacturers often \n     cite the quality of the workforce as a key reason for \n     business expansion and the lack of it as a reason for closing \n     and/or relocating. Expanding the trained and educated \n     manufacturing workforce is therefore crucial to the Upstate \n     New York economy. As such, one of MACNY's core mission areas \n     remains workforce development. Training programs help \n     manufacturers educate workers and remain in Central and \n     Upstate New York.\n       The Department of Labor under the leadership of \n     Commissioner Smith has been fully supportive in our mission \n     to enhance and improve our sector's workforce. Commissioner \n     Smith and her team have been informative, helpful, and \n     involved every step of the way, ensuring our membership has \n     the tools, education and skills they need in order to \n     succeed.\n       One such example is the partnership between MACNY and DOL \n     on the successful Shared Work Program. Since its inception, \n     MACNY has lent its support and continued to promote this \n     beneficial DOL program. Through this unique and successful \n     partnership, over 34 member companies have utilized and \n     benefited from the Shared Work program, including Revere \n     Copper Products, Endicott Interconnect and Manth Brownell, \n     Inc.\n       In another similar partnership, in May of 2009, MACNY \n     hosted a Workforce Development partnership meeting for the \n     planning of reemployment services on behalf of Magna Power \n     train, a longtime MACNY member and major market manufacturing \n     employer located in Dewitt, New York. The meeting, in \n     partnership with the Department of Labor, focused on the \n     company's employees and the anticipated downsizings and \n     possible future plant closure. Since economic and labor pool \n     questions are regular inquiries from our membership, MACNY \n     holds a vested interest in the related progress. As a result \n     of this meeting, and with thanks to the expertise and hard \n     work of the Department of Labor, MACNY remains readily \n     available to promote an applicant pool and highly qualified \n     resumes to their membership.\n       Commissioner Smith has also spent her tenure advocating on \n     the federal level for funding in workforce development \n     initiatives and continued Federal workforce training dollars, \n     a cause that has greatly benefited MACNY's membership. \n     Meeting with editorial boards and local officials, New York's \n     Congressional delegation, as well as key Congressional \n     committee members and staff, Commissioner Smith was able to \n     draw attention to and oppose the 50% cut in New York's \n     Workforce Investment Act (WIA) dollars since 2000. In recent \n     years, MACNY has been grateful in securing federal funding \n     for workforce and training initiatives, allowing members to \n     receive discounted advanced skills training as a way to keep \n     their costs down and advance their workforce. Without \n     Commissioner Smith's tireless efforts in this capacity, this \n     critical program would not be possible.\n       As earlier stated, for over 95 years MACNY has been \n     tirelessly working to ensure we have the most up-to-date \n     services and information needed to allow our manufacturing\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\n     community to grow and prosper. In examples as cited above, \n     plus many more, our collaborative partnership with the \n     Department of Labor allows us to learn and educate our \n     membership on how the state's workforce development programs \n     can best help them. The continued leadership of Commissioner \n     Pat Smith in such instances has been exemplary, and our \n     collective membership is grateful for both her and the \n     Department of Labor's years of dedication to the state's \n     manufacturing community.\n       It is Commissioner Smith's dedication, leadership, and \n     innovative thinking that make her an exceptional candidate \n     for Solicitor for the United States Department of Labor, and \n     on behalf of MACNY, I fully support her nomination for this \n     position.\n       If you have any other questions in this capacity, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Randy Wolken,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Here is a letter from the Plattsburgh North Country \nChamber of Commerce. They said:\n\n       Since she assumed leadership of the New York State Labor \n     Department in 2007, we have enjoyed not only attention and \n     engagement from Patricia Smith but a genuine working \n     partnership.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       I could cite additional examples, but the bottom line is \n     this. Patricia Smith has been an outstanding partner as \n     Commissioner of the New York State Labor Dept., and will be \n     an outstanding solicitor for the U.S. Labor Department. We \n     strongly encourage her earliest possible confirmation by the \n     Senate.\n\n  This letter is signed by Garry F. Douglas, president and CEO of the \nPlattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Plattsburgh North Country\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                 Plattsburgh, NY, August 10, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of Patricia Smith to be DOL Solicitor.\n\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: Our Chamber is the largest business and \n     economic development alliance in northern New York and one of \n     the five largest in our state, representing more than 3,250 \n     companies. I have had the pleasure of serving as President \n     and CEO since 1993, having previously served as Executive \n     Assistant to former Congressman Gerald Solomon (R-NY 23) for \n     fourteen years.\n       During my sixteen years of engagement in business and \n     workforce development in this region, I have had many \n     occasions to work with our New York State Labor Department in \n     various efforts to assist employers and to design and \n     implement meaningful workforce training programs. I am \n     writing to tell you firsthand that until Patricia Smith was \n     named Commissioner, we enjoyed an excellent working \n     relationship with our local State Labor Dept. officials but \n     enjoyed little leadership, engagement or even interest from \n     the Commissioner's office.\n       Since she assumed leadership of the New York State Labor \n     Dept. in 2007, we have enjoyed not only attention and \n     engagement from Patricia Smith but a genuine working \n     partnership.\n       This includes the design, funding and implementation of a \n     three-year Aerospace, Transportation Equipment & Green Tech \n     Workforce Strategy for our region, our first multifaceted \n     approach to the creation of a capacity in our region to \n     attract and support employers in these targeted sectors. The \n     creative approach features everything from support for the \n     start-up of Plattsburgh Aeronautical Institute, an FAA-\n     certified A mechanics' school, to further development of a \n     new Global Supply Chain Management school at our local \n     university, to the launch of new electronics and alternative \n     energy technology programs at our community college, and \n     more.\n       And although we are just beginning the second year of \n     implementation under the three-year plan, the results are \n     already tangible. Plattsburgh Aeronautical Institute is set \n     to fully open its doors next month, and is already putting us \n     in play in terms of marketing the former Plattsburgh Air \n     Force Base for future aerospace activities. And Volvo/Nova \n     Bus has just opened a new plant in our community with 300 \n     employees for the production of transit buses in the U.S., a \n     venture that would not have been feasible without the \n     programs she helped us get up and running.\n       In these and other ways, Patricia Smith has worked with us \n     to give true life to the notion of wedding economic and \n     workforce development. But at the same time, she has also \n     been a partner in serving the current needs of our employers.\n       A prime example is a major workplace safety training \n     program administered through our Chamber under contract with \n     the State Labor Dept., bringing meaningful safety training to \n     hundreds of small employers who could never access it \n     otherwise.\n       Even in current tough situations, in which some of our \n     manufacturers have needed to reduce production, she and her \n     team have been there with creative solutions. This includes a \n     Shared Work program now being used by a major railcar \n     assembly plant. Rather than fully lay off a percentage of \n     their workers, they are using this program to reduce their \n     hours, with NYSDOL allowing them to access unemployment \n     insurance benefits for the percentage of hours they are not \n     working while being paid by the company for the remainder. \n     The obvious result is a better economic interim for the \n     employees, and the ability for the company to hold onto \n     skilled employees they want to bring back to fulltime when \n     orders pick up.\n       I could cite additional examples, but the bottom line is \n     this. Patricia Smith has been an outstanding partner as \n     Commissioner of the New York State Labor Dept., and will be \n     an outstanding Solicitor for the U.S. Labor Department. We \n     strongly encourage her earliest possible confirmation by the \n     Senate.\n       Please let me know if there are any questions we might be \n     able to answer, and thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gerry F. Douglas,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Here is a letter from the Long Island Forum for \nTechnology. It says:\n\n       With a strong record of achievement and leadership, \n     Patricia Smith has been an outstanding Commissioner of the \n     NYS Department of Labor. With her vision and her energy, we \n     believe she will make an outstanding addition to the U.S. \n     Department of Labor's leadership team and we urge her \n     earliest confirmation.\n\n  It is signed by the president of the Long Island Forum for \nTechnology.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Long Island Forum for Technology,\n\n                                   Bay Shore, NY, August 21, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of M. Patricia Smith, U.S. Department of Labor \n         Solicitor.\n\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: As the President of the Long Island \n     Forum for Technology I am writing in support of the \n     nomination of Ms, Patricia Smith for the position of \n     Solicitor General at the United States Department of Labor.\n       Founded in the 1970's, LIFT is a not-for-profit \n     organization whose focus is on technology-driven economic \n     development throughout the Long Island region. Our success is \n     evidenced by the recognition and responsibilities conferred \n     on us by our partners in the State and Federal Government \n     including:\n       LIFT serves as the U.S. Department of Commerce \n     Manufacturing Extension Partner (MEP), one of nearly 350 MEP \n     locations across the country;\n       LIFT serves as the NYS Foundation for Science, Technology \n     and Innovation (NYSTAR) designated Regional Technology \n     Development Center (RIDC) for the region;\n       LIFT serves as the NYS DOL Sector Intermediary in the \n     Advanced Manufacturing Sector and on the National Governors \n     Association (NGA) Sector Policy Academy.\n       It was in the last role that we have come into contact and \n     worked with NYS Department of Labor Commissioner Smith and \n     the programs she sponsored on work force transformation in \n     the Manufacturing and Healthcare sectors.\n       Under Commissioner Smith's able and visionary leadership, \n     the New York State Department of Labor conceived, launched \n     and funded a program known as Regional Workforce \n     Transformation (13N). This program broke new ground in the \n     connectivity between industry and education. With its \n     industry-driven initiative structure it created an \n     environment for innovation, and increasing skill growth, \n     focused on creating Long Island's future workforce.\n       This program is now entering its 2nd year, with over 600 \n     individuals having gained a wide variety of new and upgraded \n     skills training. This has led to the transformation of many \n     individual lives with the results borne out in job placements \n     and position upgrades.\n       With a strong record of achievement and leadership, \n     Patricia Smith has been and outstanding Commissioner of the \n     NYS Department of Labor. With her vision and her energy, we \n     believe she will make an outstanding addition to the U.S. \n     Department of Labor's Leadership team and we urge her \n     earliest confirmation by the United States Senate.\n           Yours truly,\n                                               C. Kenneth Morrell,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Lastly, here is one from the U.S. Women's Chamber of \nCommerce:\n\n       After learning of Ms. Smith's qualifications, expertise and \n     the law she has worked to uphold, I can clearly see that she \n     is someone who would work with conviction to enforce the laws \n     of the United States of America. Additionally, I am impressed \n     with her out-of-the-box thinking in creating programs that \n     will keep jobs. We especially need these attributes in this \n     time of economic challenge.\n       Please accept Ms. Patricia Smith's nomination, and confirm \n     Ms. Smith as Solicitor General of the United States \n     Department of Labor.\n\n\n[[Page S425]]\n\n\n  It is signed by Margot Dorfman, CEO of the U.S. Women's Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 25, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of M. Patricia Smith, U.S. Department of Labor \n         Solicitor General.\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the U.S. Women's Chamber \n     of Commerce, our 500,000 members and the millions of women \n     nationwide, I am writing to send our strong support for \n     President Obama's nomination of Ms. Patricia Smith, and I \n     urge the Committee to confirm Ms. Smith as Solicitor General \n     at the United States Department of Labor. Ms. Smith has \n     demonstrated that she is well prepared and qualified for the \n     position, and will act on behalf of those who are facing \n     unfair labor practices.\n       The U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce represents both \n     working women and women businesses owners. While one would \n     think that these two constituents would be contradictory in \n     viewpoint, they are not.\n       From 1997-2006, the number of women-owned firms grew by \n     42.3% largely due to women leaving Corporate America in \n     droves in search of equal pay, opportunities for promotions \n     and a family friendly work environment. What they found \n     instead was more barriers to opportunity. In fact, during \n     this same time period, the revenues for all women-owned small \n     businesses grew only 4.4%--representing a 38% overall \n     decrease in revenues.\n       Clearly, women found that business ownership came with a \n     whole new set of challenges including the inability to fairly \n     access federal contracts, capital and affordable health care. \n     And, most profoundly, they are faced by the growing challenge \n     of competing with businesses that undercut their \n     competitiveness by engaging in unfair labor practices.\n       Those that pay fairly and play fairly do not fear Ms. \n     Smith's no-nonsense approach to labor law enforcement. They, \n     in fact, see that they are being protected.\n       After learning of Ms. Smith's qualifications, expertise and \n     the laws she has worked to uphold, I can clearly see that she \n     is someone who would work with conviction to enforce the laws \n     of the United States of America. Additionally, I am impressed \n     with her out-of-the-box thinking in creating programs that \n     will keep jobs. We especially need these attributes in this \n     time of economic challenge.\n       Please accept Ms. Patricia Smith nomination, and confirm \n     Ms. Smith as Solicitor General at the United States \n     Department of Labor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Margot Dorfman, CEO.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is clear that Patricia Smith is \neminently well qualified. She has been thoroughly vetted. We need a \nSolicitor at the Department of Labor. This nomination has been hanging \nhere since last April. It is time to move on. But, again, the \nRepublicans are exercising their right--although I think it is an abuse \nof that right--to drag it out for 30 more hours, to keep the Senate in \nsession, for no purpose whatsoever other than to slow things down in \nthis Chamber. To me, that is not a good enough excuse, when only one \nperson came here today to speak against her, and that person spoke \nagainst her yesterday. I read the transcript. Nothing new; same stuff.\n  I would hope we could collapse this timeframe and vote on it, but \nevidently the Republicans are intent on stretching this out to the \nmaximum 30 hours. As I said, it may be their right, but I think it is \nan abuse of that right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Sanctions Against Iran\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my \nviews on the issue of sanctions against Iran. The Senate, on the \nunanimous consent calendar last Thursday, passed legislation calling \nfor sanctions against Iran. This was the first opportunity I have had \nto address the subject. I wish to do so now.\n  The threat posed by Iran armed with nuclear weapons is obvious and \nvery serious. It is a threat which applies for the region, for the \nworld. It is a vital national security interest of the United States \nthat Iran not be armed with nuclear weapons. It is obviously of great \nimportance to Israel that Iran not have nuclear weapons in light of the \nhistory--the fact that the Iranian President has called for wiping \nIsrael off the face of the Earth.\n  I have prepared a comprehensive statement of my views on this subject \nin anticipation of the matter coming to the Senate floor. I will ask \nunanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  I have been reluctant to call for sanctions because I am a firm \nbeliever in diplomacy and have undertaken a number of steps to try to \nencourage a parliamentary exchange between Iranian Parliamentarians and \nMembers of Congress. I have been working on that for the better part of \na decade. The extensive written statement summarizes in some detail \nthose efforts.\n  I have met with the last three Iranian Ambassadors to the United \nNations. I found them all to be highly intelligent, to be articulate, \nto be cordial, and to be interested in a dialog and in conversations. I \nbelieve if their views were reflected by the Iranian Government, it \nwould be a very different picture than it is at the present time.\n  One year I got permission from the State Department to have the \nIranian Ambassador to the U.N. come to Washington at my so-called \nhideaway office a few feet away from the floor and have dinner with \nMembers of Congress and the Iranian Ambassador to talk about these \nissues. At one time, there was a meeting set between Iranian \nParliamentarians and Members of Congress in Geneva that was canceled by \nthe Iranian Government. My detailed statement specifies the efforts I \nhave made over that period of time. But I think we have come to a point \nnow where we have to get candidly tough, and we have to impose \nsanctions.\n  President Obama said he would give Iran until the end of the year--\nreferring to the year 2009--to come to the table. There were some \nindications that Iran would do so. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown \nhas made a similar statement and, in a sense, they have drawn a line in \nthe sand.\n  My own personal assessment is that we are approaching the point of \nclear and present danger that Iran poses as a threat to the region, \nespecially to Israel, to the national security interests of the United \nStates, and to the world. So I think it is time that firm action be \ntaken.\n  We have seen it evolve that gradually Russia has moved to join the \nUnited States, Great Britain, France, Germany, and other nations in \nmoving toward sanctions. China, regrettably, has not done so.\n  Comments by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton just last week are \nimportant on this subject. The Secretary of State said:\n\n       China will be under a lot of pressure to recognize the \n     destabilizing effect that a nuclear-armed Iran would have in \n     the Persian Gulf from which they receive a significant \n     percentage of their oil.\n\n  Secretary of State Clinton further remarked that a nuclear-armed Iran \nwould risk setting off an arms race in the Persian Gulf and that it \ncould provoke a military strike from Israel which she said she would \nregard a nuclear Iran as an existential threat.\n  It has long been articulated that the military option is on the \ntable. Israel has demonstrated its resoluteness--a small nation \nsurrounded by, vastly outnumbered by the Arab population, still \ntechnically at war with many of the Arab countries, peace treaties only \nwith Egypt and Jordan. Israel demonstrated its capability and \nwillingness to take out the Iraq reactor in June of 1981 and more \nrecently the Syrian installation which is believed to have been working \non nuclear weapons.\n  Secretary of State Clinton is blunt in the grave threat posed by the \nsituation that Israel is concerned about with Iran becoming a nuclear \nforce.\n  I think the time has come to act. In the course of my statement, I \nhave gone into some detail as to the sanctions and how effective they \ncould be. But I think there is no doubt that if China joined the United \nStates, Russia, Great Britain, France, Germany, India, and other \nnations in imposing tight sanctions, financial sanctions on the \nfinancial institutions, on trade, on supplying gasoline, on supplying \nIranian needs that the world could make its\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\npoint. I think Iran would have to capitulate. How much better it is to \nuse economic sanctions than to take the military option off the table.\n  I do believe if the United Nations, with China's concurrence, showed \nits determination to impose sanctions that it would have the potential \nto bring compliance by Iran. Russia has made a proposal that it would \nenrich Iran's uranium. If Iran is sincere that it does not want \nenriched uranium for military purposes, for a bomb, but only wants it \nfor civilian purposes, well, take up Russia's offer to have the uranium \nenriched by Russia. At one point, Iran appeared to be willing to do \nthat. Then they revoked the indication of willingness. That is still a \npossibility.\n\n  I had occasion to visit Vienna on two occasions--met with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency head, Mohamed ElBaradei--to discuss \nthe activities he has undertaken. He is a very able, skilled \ninternational diplomat who recently left that position, which he held \nfor years. But Mr. ElBaradei was very pessimistic as to what Iran was \nprepared to do and resisted efforts to have the kind of inspections \nwhich would give assurance.\n  I was very reluctant to see sanctions imposed on Syria, in the hope \nthat diplomacy might work there, but did join in those efforts a few \nyears back when the matter came up for a vote.\n  I had been trying to visit Iran personally since 1989, at the end of \nthe Iran-Iraq war, and in 1989 made my first trip to Iraq. In 1990, \nSenator Shelby and I had a talk with Saddam Hussein, and it was a very \nprofessional conversation. Iraq, at that time, had just launched a \nthree-power rocket system, and I led the conversation by asking \nPresident Saddam Hussein if he would be willing to negotiate with \nIsrael because they would take out his new weapons, just as they had \ntaken out his reactor in June of 1981. He dismissed it, saying: No, he \nwouldn't negotiate with Israel; they weren't a border state. Then he \nasked me a question. He wanted to know why all the Russian Jews were \ngoing to Israel. I saw him shuffling some papers, and I knew he knew I \nwas Jewish. I wanted him to know I knew that he knew that I knew, and \nso I said: My father was a Russian Jew who immigrated to the United \nStates, and I believe the Russian Jews ought to go wherever they want \nto go. There was a 50,000 limit at the time on Russian Jews who could \ncome into the United States.\n  In the course of an hour-and-a-quarter discussion, it was a \nsubstantive talk, and I came back and told a number of my colleagues \nthat I thought we ought to have more discussions with Saddam Hussein. I \ndon't know if anything could have deterred him from his aggression \nagainst Kuwait or his later activities, but I have long been a believer \nin the maxim that you make peace with your enemies and not with your \nfriends.\n  In my work as chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the 104th \nCongress and work on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I have had \nthe privilege of traveling extensively in foreign countries and sought \nout the people who might be categorized as our enemies. I had a useful \ntalk a few years back with Chavez in Venezuela; several visits to Fidel \nCastro in Cuba; conversations with Arafat, both in Ramallah, Gaza, and \nwhen he came to Washington, to my office downstairs, looking for money \nfrom the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. I have made many trips to \nSyria, gotten to know Hafez al-Assad and Bashar al-Assad; had cordial \nconversations, as one of six Senators who visited Syria about a month \nago to talk to Bashar al-Assad about the possibility of a peace treaty.\n  I believe Syria could hold the key to a peace in the Mideast. Only \nIsrael could decide if Israel wants to give up the Golan, and they \nought to make that decision without any pressure from the United States \nor anyone. But if Israel should make that decision, there could be a \ngreat deal gained in terms of having Syria stopping the destabilization \nof Lebanon, stopping the support of Hamas, stopping the support of \nHezbollah. It is a different world today than it was in 1967, when \nIsrael took the Golan. It is an era of rockets. It is not the same \nstrategic importance.\n  But the point I make is, I think diplomacy is the way out. But \nsometimes there has to be a carrot and a stick, and I think we have \ncome to the point where sanctions do need to be imposed, and that is \nwhy I have joined the effort. I think the President has given fair \nnotice to Iran that they come to the table by the end of the year, and \nwe are a little past that.\n  We, obviously, have problems with China on a number of fronts. We \nhave problems on the Taiwan issue and our sale of arms to Taiwan. We \nhave problems with them with respect to Tibet and our issue of human \nrights. We have very serious problems on trade, and we have broader \nissues on human rights. China is emerging as a tremendous world power, \nand we are challenged at every line, but I do believe the logic of the \nsituation is, it is in China's interest not to have a nuclear Iran.\n  Our CODEL, after visiting in Syria, went on to India and talked to \nPrime Minister Singh, who was emphatic in agreement that it is not in \nIndia's interest or the world's interest to have an Iran which is armed \nwith nuclear weapons. So it is my hope the action by the Senate, in \nvoting for sanctions, will increase the momentum for sanctions from the \nUnited Nations. It can only be done in an effective way if China is \npersuaded to go along.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmy full written statement and ask that the Congressional Record recite \nthe language I am using now.\n  Usually, when summary is concluded and the formal statement is put in \nthe Record, it is changed. If anybody reads the Congressional Record--\nand I think there is a chance somebody does--they wonder why Senator \nSpecter is making this repetitious statement; that he has made this \nstatement, and here is all this repetition. If you put this explanation \nin, as I have said, the reader will know I have summarized and \namplified, to some extent, and that what follows now is not a \nrepetition as such but the formal statement which was prepared in \nadvance.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of Senator Arlen Specter: Enhancement of Sanctions Against \n                                  Iran\n\n       Mr. President: There is no question that a nuclear armed \n     Iran poses a direct threat to the security of the U.S. and \n     its allies, particularly Israel. It is for this reason that \n     preventing such a situation remains a principal focus of \n     mine. Although Iran claims that its nuclear program is \n     directed solely toward peaceful energy production, the fact \n     that this program has been conducted in secret and that Iran \n     is a known supporter of certain terrorist organizations \n     betrays that assertion.\n       I have long been an advocate of the proposal, currently \n     offered to Iran, to have Russia enrich Iran's uranium. If \n     Iran's interests with enrichment are benign, as it claims, \n     then it should have no problem with Russia enriching the \n     uranium to the low levels required for civilian nuclear power \n     and medical uses. Iran's refusal suggests otherwise. At an \n     Appropriations Committee hearing on April 9, 2008, I \n     questioned Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on this \n     proposal:\n\n       Sen. Specter: ``Let me move to . . . President Putin's \n     proposal to have the Russians enrich [Iran's] uranium. That \n     apparently would provide an answer. . . . To what extent has \n     the Putin proposal been pressed? In a sense, if we join Putin \n     and they refuse what is really a good offer to have somebody \n     else enrich their uranium so that they have it for peaceful \n     purposes, but there is a check on using it for military \n     purposes--why hasn't that worked?''\n       Sec. Rice: ``Well, we are fully supportive of it, and the \n     president just told President Putin that again at Shchuchye, \n     that he is fully supportive of the Russian proposal. And in \n     fact, not only did President Putin himself put that proposal \n     to the Iranians when he was in Tehran, his foreign minister \n     went back within a few days and put the same proposition to \n     the Iranians, which makes people suspicious, Senator, that \n     this is not about civil nuclear power but rather about the \n     development of the capabilities for a nuclear weapon. . . . \n     So I think this really speaks to the intentions of the \n     Iranians.''\n       Sen. Specter: ``Well, we agree on that. My suggestion would \n     be to try to elevate it. It's been in the media and the press \n     a little, but not very much. So if we could elevate that, I \n     think you'd really put Iran on the spot that they deserve to \n     be on.''\n\n       Then, in a May 20, 2009 Appropriations Committee hearing, I \n     questioned Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the \n     proposal:\n\n       Sen. Specter: ``Let me come to a question with respect to \n     Iran. Prime Minister Netanyahu was very pleased with the \n     meeting with President Obama, and the timetable which the \n     president has set, looking to the Iranian elections as the \n     potential for dialogue and holding out the possibility of \n     bilateral dialogue, and I hope you will pursue that, and \n     putting a timetable for the first time on not waiting \n     indefinitely with all the options on the table. And I speak \n     in generalities not to beat a tom-tom unnecessarily.\n\n[[Page S427]]\n\n       ``The offer that the Russians made some time ago to enrich \n     the uranium, I think, has never been pursued or publicized. \n     Perhaps it has been pursued, but not known and not \n     publicized. But that seems to me to be a perfect line. When \n     Iran insists that they're developing--enriching uranium for \n     peaceful purposes and the Russians can provide for them, what \n     conceivable excuse? When they resist something so obvious as \n     that, it seems that that would be a good wedge to get more \n     cooperation from China, Russia and other countries. What can \n     be done to pursue Russian enrichment of their uranium?''\n       Sec. Clinton: ``Well, Senator Specter, that is an option \n     that is being considered within the P-5 plus one as well as \n     within our own deliberations. We have a broad range of issues \n     to discuss with the Iranians if they respond affirmatively to \n     the president's invitation to do so. And obviously they are \n     in the midst of election season. We know what that means. So \n     it's unlikely that we'll get a response or a dialogue going \n     until there is some settling of the political scene. But your \n     reference to the enrichment potential is one that we are \n     exploring.''\n\n       Finally, on June 9, 2009, I raised the issue with Secretary \n     of Defense Robert Gates at an Appropriations Committee \n     hearing:\n\n       Sen. Specter: ``Mr. Secretary, I was intrigued with one of \n     the points you made in testifying before the Appropriations \n     Committee on the war supplemental, where you said that it \n     would be useful in our dealings with Iran to have a missile \n     defense that is aimed only at Iran.\n       ``And that played into the relationship that we have with \n     Russia, and it is generally recognized that if we're to be \n     successful in dealing with Iran, we're going to have to have \n     cooperation with other countries, perhaps mostly Russia. \n     We've talked before about the issue of having Russia enrich \n     Iran's uranium, which Russia has offered to do and Iran has \n     declined, as a way of being sure that Iran is not moving \n     toward the use of enriched uranium for military purposes.\n       ``A two-part question. Number one, is any progress being \n     made on publicizing Russia's offer, which I think has gotten \n     scant--little attention? And the Iranian refusal really \n     shows--raises the inference of potential bad faith.\n       ``And secondly, where do we stand on efforts to pick up \n     your suggestion that missile defense be aimed only at Iran \n     and not at Russia, which has given so many political \n     problems?''\n       Sec. Gates: ``First, I think that although it's certainly \n     not been a secret, it has not been, I think, widely enough \n     publicized--Russia's offer and Iran's turn-down of it. And I \n     think equally not publicized was the fact that the United \n     States indicated that we thought that was a pretty good idea \n     and would be supportive.\n       ``With respect to the missile defense, I think that the \n     Russian--I still have hope that we can get the Russians to \n     partner with us on missile defense directed against Iran.''\n\n       But, in remarks reported by the New York Times on November \n     18, 2009, Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said \n     ``We will definitely not send our 3.5-percent-enriched \n     uranium out of the country.'' Then, on December 2, 2009, the \n     New York Times reported that Iran's president, Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad, said on December 1, ``Friendly relations with \n     the [International Atomic Energy Agency] are over,'' and that \n     Iran has no duty to report to the United Nations about its \n     recently announced plan to build 10 new nuclear sites.\n       To this point I have resisted calling for increased \n     sanctions because I did not think it constructive given the \n     diplomatic climate; however, considering Iran's growing \n     avowals that it will not cooperate with the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency or allow foreign countries to process \n     its uranium, I think it is time to enhance sanctions. The \n     international community has offered Iran a deal which is more \n     than fair; Iran refuses to consent. We cannot make ourselves \n     a toothless tiger.\n       I did not come to my decision to support the Comprehensive \n     Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2009 \n     (S. 2799) lightly. During my tenure in the Senate, I have \n     been among Congress' most ardent advocates for aggressive \n     diplomacy, believing it holds the key to resolving \n     international disputes. As I noted in my December 2006 \n     article in The Washington Quarterly titled ``Dialogue with \n     Adversaries'':\n\n       ``My Senate assignments on the Intelligence Committee and \n     Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations have \n     provided me the opportunity to meet with Syrian President \n     Hafiz al-Asad, Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat, Iraqi \n     President Saddam Hussein, Cuban President Fidel Castro, \n     Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, and others.\n       ``Those meetings have shown me that people are people, even \n     at the highest levels of government. They are interested in a \n     candid dialogue. They accept differences and disagreements as \n     long as the tone is courteous. . . .\n       ``Sun-tzu's advice to `keep your friends close and your \n     enemies closer' is a good admonition to keep in mind as we \n     approach our relationships in the world. . . . It may not \n     work, but it is certainly worth a try when the stakes are so \n     high and our other strenuous efforts are not bearing fruit'' \n     (p. 9).\n\n       Diplomacy has produced some results many thought \n     impossible. Negotiations with North Korea have reduced that \n     nation's nuclear threat although that situation remains \n     volatile and uncertain. Negotiations have moved Libya's \n     Muammar Qaddafi, with whom I met in August 2006, from \n     horrendous acts of terrorism, including the bombing of Pan Am \n     103 and a Berlin discotheque, resulting in the murder of US \n     military personnel, to a willingness to negotiate and reform. \n     Libya made reparations in excess of $1,000,000,000 and \n     abandoned plans to design nuclear weapons in order to be \n     admitted to the family of nations.\n       This is not the first time I have supported sanctions in \n     the region. On November 11, 2003, I voted for a the Syria \n     Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act, a \n     bill to impose sanctions on Syria to hold Damascus \n     accountable for its support for terrorism, its occupation of \n     Lebanon, its illegal shipment of arms to Iraq, and its \n     efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction. The bill \n     became law in December 2003. Regarding my vote, I said on the \n     Senate floor on November 11, 2003:\n\n       ``Sanctions are imposed by Congress with some frequency. At \n     first blush, this appears to be a straightforward affirmative \n     vote, but I believe the matter is more complicated than that, \n     and I have come to the view after having traveled to Syria \n     almost every year since 1984, and after having had \n     considerable contact with the Syrian Government. After \n     considering the matter at some length, I have decided that I \n     will vote in favor of the Syrian Accountability Act because \n     the problems of terrorism are so serious and because I \n     believe that Syria needs to do more'' (p. S14403).\n\n       Prior to my vote on the Syrian Accountability Act, I wrote \n     to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on September 17, 2003:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                               September 17, 2003.\n     His Excellency Bashar al-Assad,\n     President, Syrian Arab Republic,\n     Damascus, Syria.\n       Dear President Assad: I write to inform you of growing \n     concern in the United States Senate about Syria and the fact \n     that the Syrian Accountability Act now has 76 co-sponsors. I \n     had discussed this proposed legislation some time ago with \n     your Ambassador to the United States. I had refrained from \n     co-sponsoring the Syrian Accountability Act on the premise \n     that we should try to work out the problems without resorting \n     to legislation calling for sanctions.\n       Yesterday, Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton submitted \n     testimony to the House of Representatives' International \n     Relations Committee that Syria is permitting ``volunteers'' \n     to pass over your border into Iraq where those so-called \n     volunteers are intent on killing U.S. troops. This follows \n     Administrator L. Paul Bremer's statement on August 20th that \n     Syria is allowing ``foreign terrorists'' to cross Syria's \n     borders into Iraq.\n       When you met with Secretary of State Powell last May, there \n     was an understanding that Syria would shut Damascus offices \n     of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups. In June, \n     Secretary Powell stated that Syria's efforts to shut these \n     offices were ``totally inadequate''. The Bush Administration \n     which had opposed the Syrian Accountability Act now is \n     neutral, taking no position.\n       After extensive dealings with your father, President Hafez \n     al-Assad, since the 1980s and with you on our meetings in the \n     past several years, I have tried to assist in finding answers \n     to these difficult problems. With the Syrian Accountability \n     Act gaining so much support, it is my hope that your \n     Government will respond to the concerns outlined in this \n     letter before the U.S. Government resorts to sanctions.\n       I call these matters to your personal attention with the \n     hope that prompt action can be taken by Syria to resolve \n     these problems. The United States greatly appreciated the \n     help that Syria provided to our intelligence services after \n     September 11, 2001 in our fight against al-Qaeda.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n       It is my hope that Congress' passage of the Comprehensive \n     Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act would \n     effect change in Tehran before the implementation of \n     additional sanctions would be necessary, as sanctions \n     invariably impact more people than just the leaders \n     responsible for shaping a country's policy.\n       During my time in the Senate, I have pushed hard to engage \n     Iran diplomatically. I have tried to visit Iran since the \n     Iran-Iraq War ended in 1988, with my first attempts coming \n     during my visits to Iraq in January 1989 and January 1990, \n     but I have not yet succeeded. Going back to 2000, I have met \n     repeatedly with Iranian officials in an effort to foster an \n     exchange of visits by members of Congress to Iran and Iranian \n     parliamentarians to the United States to try to open dialogue \n     between our two countries. On May 11, 2000, I joined nine \n     other senators in writing to Iranian Ambassador Hadi Nejad \n     Hosseinian proposing such an exchange (attached). I followed \n     this with a meeting with Ambassador Hosseinian on May 31, \n     2000. On October 17, 2001, I hosted Ambassador Hosseinian in \n     my Senate hideaway with Senator Mike DeWine, former \n     Representative Lee Hamilton, Ambassador William Miller, and \n     Representative Bob Ney. On November 18, 2002, I had lunch \n     with Ambassador Zarif at the Wilson Center at an event hosted \n     by former Representative Lee Hamilton.\n\n[[Page S428]]\n\n       As I wrote in the Washington Quarterly in December 2006, \n     ``I thought my efforts finally came to fruition in January \n     2004 when plans were made for U.S. members of Congress to \n     meet with Iranian parliamentarians in Geneva. Unfortunately, \n     Tehran later rescinded the invitation, declaring it was `not \n     on their agenda' '' (p. 10). I met in New York City with \n     Ambassador Hosseinian's successor, Ambassador Javad Zarif, in \n     October 2006 and February 2007. On May 3, 2007, I joined \n     eight colleagues in Congress writing to Gholam Ali Haddad \n     Adel, then the speaker of Iran's parliament, to propose again \n     ``a diplomatic exchange between members of the United States \n     Congress and Parliamentarians from the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran'' (attached). I followed this with a personal letter to \n     Ayatollah Khamenei on October 16, 2007 (attached). Again, the \n     offer was rebuffed (attached). My efforts to facilitate \n     engagement continued with meetings with the current Iranian \n     ambassador to the UN, Mohammed Khazaee, in February and \n     December 2008.\n       On January 2, 2008, I traveled to the headquarters of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna with IAEA \n     Director General Mohamad ElBaradei to discuss the Iranian \n     issue. On January 22, 2008 I discussed my meeting with Mr. \n     ElBaradei on the Senate floor:\n\n       ``When solicited about his views on President Putin's idea \n     to have Russia handle Iran's nuclear material, he stated that \n     Iran did not reject it but that they wanted their own \n     capability. He suggested that an acceptable security \n     structure must be negotiated with Iran to deter them. The \n     [Director General] agreed that it is not acceptable for Iran \n     to have nuclear weapons and that his job was to verify that \n     the program is clean and under IAEA inspections.\n       ``I pressed him on Iran's devious behavior in the past to \n     conceal nuclear efforts and asked if we can ever be 100 \n     percent sure. He stated that you can never be 100 positive \n     but that he thinks Iran has things to tell him and that he \n     has told them they should come clean.\n       ``The Director General suggested that direct U.S.-Iranian \n     negotiations should begin immediately to resolve the impasse. \n     The U.S. and international community need to understand what \n     the nuclear issue means to Iran with respect to its position \n     in the region and the world, that there needs to be an \n     understanding of the repercussions and that it must be done \n     in a manner that allows all sides to save face.\n       ``We discussed Secretary Rice's precondition that the U.S. \n     would only meet with Iran if they halt enrichment. He said \n     there must be middle ground to bring the parties together on \n     this issue. He emphasized that sanctions alone won't resolve \n     the situation and only makes people more hawkish. Iran's \n     concealment of its [research and development] program, \n     according to the Director, led to a confidence deficit in the \n     international community.\n       ``I asked about the capabilities of an inspection regime \n     given Iran's substantial size. He confirmed the need to have \n     a robust verification system on the ground. [El]Baradei \n     stated that the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was helpful but that Iran stopped \n     implementing it. The Additional Protocol was the result of an \n     IAEA initiative to better constrain NPT member-states' \n     ability to illicitly pursue nuclear weapons after secret \n     nuclear weapons programs in Iraq and North Korea exposed \n     weaknesses in existing agency safeguards. That effort \n     eventually produced a voluntary Additional Protocol, designed \n     to strengthen and expand existing IAEA safeguards for \n     verifying that non-nuclear-weapon states-parties to the \n     nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) only use nuclear \n     materials and facilities only for peaceful purposes. He \n     stated that the Protocol gives him a good handle on Iran's \n     nuclear program in that it provides access to additional \n     facilities and information'' (p. S74).\n\n       Following up on this conversation, I spoke with Mr. \n     ElBaradei over the phone when I was in Vienna in January \n     2009, again following travels in the Middle East. On January \n     12, 2009, I said on the Senate floor:\n\n       ``A year ago, I had an opportunity to meet with IAEA \n     Director Mohamed ElBaradei. He was out of town when we were \n     there [in 2009]. I had a conversation with him by telephone \n     on the issue of the efforts by the IAEA to conduct the \n     inspections and that at the moment Iran is not cooperating \n     and, further, international action needs to be taken to be \n     sure Iran does meet its obligations under international \n     agreements and that there are adequate safeguards to prevent \n     Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.''\n\n       On November 26, 2009, shortly before stepping down from his \n     position at the IAEA, Mr. ElBaradei said, ``I am disappointed \n     that Iran so far has not agreed'' to proposals to ship \n     nuclear material out of Iran, ``[W]hich I believe are \n     balanced and fair and would greatly alleviate the concerns \n     relating to Iran's nuclear program'' (Reuters, 11/26/09).\n       Our offers of diplomatic engagement, and the limited United \n     Nations sanctions enacted to date, have not ended Iran's \n     nuclear ambitions. I voted on September 26, 2007 in favor of \n     an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense \n     Authorization Bill to encourage the U.S. State Department to \n     place the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on its list of \n     foreign terrorist organizations, as well as to expedite the \n     enforcement of U.N. Sanctions mandated by December 2006 and \n     March 2007 United Sanctions Security Council Resolutions, in \n     the hope that this could bring about positive change. \n     Unfortunately these efforts have not done enough, and for \n     that reason, with the desire to avoid greater military \n     conflict in the Middle East, I think more comprehensive \n     sanctions are necessary.\n       If any sanctions are to be effective, they will need to be \n     supported by the other permanent members of the UN Security \n     Council, particularly Russia and China. While ``Neither \n     [Russia nor China] thinks Iran's missiles are aimed at \n     them,'' as the Economist noted in a December 5, 2009 \n     editorial, both would suffer from the instability that a \n     nuclear armed Iran would bring about. The Economist editorial \n     concluded, ``Do nothing to give Iran pause and one way or \n     another its illicit ambitions will eventually destabilize the \n     entire Middle East.''\n       It is important that the next round of sanctions be \n     measured. As RAND scholar Alireza Nader noted in a September \n     30, 2009 paper, ``Additional sanctions may create popular \n     resentment against the government, and may even increase \n     protests and opposition stemming from Iran's disputed \n     presidential election.'' The New York Times highlighted this \n     dissent on December 8, 2009 when it ran a headline stating, \n     ``Thousands Defy Iranian Authorities in Protests and Clashes \n     at Campuses.'' Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on \n     Foreign Relations, told Politico on September 29, 2009:\n\n       ``A coordinated sanctions effort by the U.S. and Europe \n     could put tremendous pressure on Iran. After 9/11, the \n     Treasury developed new tools that forced banks and other \n     financial companies around the world to cut ties to charities \n     that were deemed to be supporting terrorist groups. Those \n     same tools were turned against North Korea in 2005, \n     effectively cutting off what little capability the regime had \n     to engage in foreign commercial transactions. For a country \n     like Iran that depends so heavily on oil exports, similar \n     actions against the companies that insure outgoing shipments \n     from Iran could have a devastating economic impact.''\n\n       On July 22, 2009, Patrick Clawson of the Washington \n     Institute for Near East Policy told the House Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs:\n\n       ``For several years, Iran's economy was cushioned from \n     foreign pressure by the high price of oil. That has changed \n     as oil prices have declined and Tehran's poor policies have \n     exacerbated serious structural weaknesses. The most likely \n     prospect is that during the next few years, Iran's economy \n     will face serious problems. Foreign economic pressure could \n     add to those problems. Furthermore, Iranian public opinion is \n     likely to exaggerate the impact of the foreign pressure and \n     to blame the Ahmadinejad government's hardline stance for the \n     country's economic difficulties'' (1).\n       ``[T]here is every reason to expect public opinion to lay \n     the blame for the economic problems on the Ahmadinejad \n     government. Already, reform politicians blame that government \n     for isolating Iran from the world. If Iran is forced to \n     reduce imports substantially, the most likely popular \n     reaction will be to blame hardliners for the problems.'' (6).\n       ``Foreign pressure cannot cause Iran's economy to collapse, \n     nor should that be our goal. But such pressure may well be \n     able to contribute to what is becoming an intense debate \n     inside Iran about the wisdom of a confrontational and \n     isolationist policy towards the international community. That \n     debate offers the best prospect for a fruitful resolution of \n     the nuclear impasse, because those who want Iran to join the \n     world are not willing to pay a high price for a nuclear \n     program which they increasingly see as part of the \n     Ahmadinejad agenda, not part of a national project'' (6).\n\n       We must be careful with sanctions so as to not play into \n     the hands of the Iranian leadership, who would very much like \n     to blame Iran's current economic struggles on the West. As \n     the Economist noted on December 5, 2009, `` . . . Mr. \n     Ahmadinejad is just now having to contemplate ending ruinous \n     petrol subsidies to balance his books and would be delighted \n     to blame the pain on foreigners . . . [A] UN-backed embargo \n     on investment in Iran's oil and gas industries would hurt \n     badly, and signal resolve. So would a ban on weapons imports. \n     And Iran's repeated breach of nuclear safeguards is surely \n     justification for ending nuclear trade with its regime.''\n       Time to find a diplomatic solution is running out. On \n     September 25, 2009, United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon \n     Brown said, ``Confronted by the serial deception of many \n     years, the international community has no choice today but to \n     draw a line in the sand.'' On the same day, President Barack \n     Obama said, ``We weren't going to duplicate what has happened \n     in North Korea, in which talks just continue forever without \n     any actual resolution to the issue.'' ``[T]he Iranian \n     government,'' President Obama said, ``must now demonstrate \n     through deeds its peaceful intentions or be held accountable \n     to international standards and international law.''\n       On November 30, 2009, United States Ambassador to the \n     United Nations, Susan Rice, told reporters:\n\n       ``There has been an engagement track which we have been \n     very actively engaged in, but there is also a pressure track. \n     And as Iran makes choices that seem to indicate that it is \n     not at this stage ready and willing to take up the offers on \n     the engagement track then we will put greater emphasis on the \n     pressure track. Time is short, and we are\n\n[[Page S429]]\n\n     serious about implementing to the fullest extent that dual \n     track policy.''\n       ``We will continue . . . to consult with our P5 + 1 \n     colleagues both in capitals and elsewhere. I think the \n     President and other leaders have been quite clear that we \n     would take stock at the end of the year and see where we are. \n     And I think as the indications mount that Iran is not yet in \n     a position to take up the very concrete and constructive \n     offers that have been put to it by the P5+1 and by the IAEA, \n     it seems more likely that we will be on the pressure track, \n     even as the door remains open to Iran to accept those \n     offers.''\n\n       On December 7, 2009, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin \n     Netanyahu told members of the Knesset, ``In the last year, \n     two things have happened: Iran has advanced its military \n     nuclear program, and Iran has lost its legitimacy in the eyes \n     of the international community,'' adding that preventing Iran \n     from securing a nuclear arsenal was Israel's ``central \n     problem,'' according to a December 8, 2009 article in the \n     Jerusalem Post.\n       Israel did not agree with the 2007 US National Intelligence \n     Estimate on Iran's nuclear program which concluded that Iran \n     halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003. The New York \n     Times noted on December 5, 2007 that then Israeli Defense \n     Minister Ehud Barak rejected the American assessment of \n     ``moderate confidence'' that Tehran had not restarted its \n     nuclear weapons program by mid-2007 and that the end of the \n     program ``represents a halt to Iran's entire nuclear weapons \n     program.'' Defense Minister Barak said, ``It is our \n     responsibility to ensure that the right steps are taken \n     against the Iranian regime.'' ``As is well known, words don't \n     stop missiles,'' he continued. Assessments may differ, Mr. \n     Barak said, ``but we cannot allow ourselves to rest just \n     because of an intelligence report from the other side of the \n     Earth, even if it is from our greatest friend.'' According to \n     a December 11, 2007 New York Times article, ``Israeli \n     intelligence estimates say Iran stopped all its nuclear \n     weapons activities for a time in 2003, nervous after the \n     American invasion of Iraq, but then resumed those activities \n     in 2005, accelerating enrichment and ballistic missile \n     development and constructing a 40-megawatt heavy-water \n     reactor in Arak that could produce plutonium.''\n       According to a December 5, 2009 article in the Economist, \n     ``Last year Israel carried out a long-distance military air \n     exercise over Greece that looked like a rehearsal for action \n     in Iran. In June [2009] a missile-carrying Israeli submarine \n     ostentatiously sailed through the Suez Canal.'' These \n     military exercises, coupled with Israel's public disagreement \n     with the US over intelligence estimates on Iran's nuclear \n     program and Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent public \n     comments, show that Israel's security calculus differs from \n     our own. Time to find a diplomatic solution is running short; \n     Israel--like every other nation--will act in defense of what \n     it sees to be its own best interests.\n       Iran's continued nuclear program is a ticking time bomb. \n     All parties--Iran included--will benefit from its end. On \n     this state of the record, enhanced sanctions, with the goal \n     of ending Iran's nuclear program and preventing wider \n     conflict in the Middle East, are our best option.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

We went a long period of time, when at least as a \npercentage of those who were out of work, we were fortunately in the \nbottom tier or in the middle. At least we didn't have double-digit \nunemployment. That is changing, to a large extent. We are not in the 10 \npercent number that most of the country is, but we are at about 8.9 \npercent right now. We got some regional numbers today.

The Philadelphia metropolitan region--\nthe city of Philadelphia--and the suburban counties have done well \neconomically, but that number is going up. The total number of \nunemployed is over 164,000 Pennsylvanians in that corner of the State. \nThat is about 5 counties--164,000 people.\n  Just above that and north of that in the Lehigh Valley--the \nAllentown, Bethlehem region--they are at 9.8 percent, with some 40,700 \npeople out of work. In my home area of northeastern Pennsylvania--north \nof the Lehigh Valley--we received reports today of the job market going \nup to 9.7 percent unemployment, the highest in 17 years. You could go \nacross the State and hear the same story.\n  So the numbers are going higher. Of course, that means the \nchallenges, the misery, and the heartache for those who have lost their \njobs are only rising.\n  We have to meet that challenge. Part of meeting that challenge is not \njust addressing it in terms of policy--I will talk about that tonight \nfor a couple of minutes--but also to try to understand as best we can \nfrom the distance of Washington, but even when you are, as I was, \nsitting in the same room more than a week ago with eight of our \nunemployed Pennsylvanians. I will just give two examples.\n  One individual sitting right across from me, his name was Ron. He was \nlaid off last April. He is 61 years old. His was one of the most \ncompelling stories in terms of where he was with a job and where he is \ntoday. Before he was laid off, he managed a staff of 12 people. Over \nthe course of his long and successful career, he worked in various\n\n[[Page S430]]\n\nmanagement positions, at international trade groups, manufacturing \nfacilities, and rental companies.\n  During my conversation with Ron, he talked about his fear that his \nwide experience seemed to be working against him in this labor market. \nRon was earning more than $100,000 before he was laid off. Today he and \nhis wife are currently getting by with her earnings in a clerical job \nand his unemployment compensation, which amounts to just $40,000. In \nhis life it is a $100,000 income versus now a $40,000 income.\n  I also met Annetta. She was just on my right as we were talking to \nthese eight individuals. She had a lot of energy and vigor. You could \ntell she was a very good employee. She worked for a retirement home \nuntil she was laid off. Annetta has been using her time to study to be \na CNA, certified nurses aide, through the Yorktown School of \nTechnology. In order to obtain her certification, Annetta had to pay \nfor a final exam and a physical. She didn't have the money to up-front \nthe costs of those tests and thus could not obtain her certified nurses \nassistant certification.\n  According to Annetta, the most frustrating part of her situation is \nthat she has the experience of a certified nurse from a previous \nemployer who did not require formal certification. But I was \nparticularly touched by her comments that, as a single person, Annetta \nfears having no one to fall back on in these tough times. Also, her \nembarrassment. We would always say to her or anyone in this situation: \nYou shouldn't be embarrassed. You are in a very difficult situation. \nYou have lost a job through no fault of your own.\n  But, of course, that is not the way she sees it in terms of what she \nfeels in her heart. She does feel a sense of embarrassment over having \nto turn to churches for food. That is why we have an increase in food \nstamps. We legislate to do that because it is not only good for that \nindividual, taxpayers have an added economic benefit from an increase \nin food stamps and an increase in unemployment insurance, just to name \ntwo examples.\n  What strikes me most about the stories that each of these individuals \ntold, but in particular as I cite them tonight, Ron and Annetta, they \nare looking for work in the worst job market in modern times, but they \nspeak very candidly about their fears. But mostly they talk about the \nincredible efforts they have made to get back to work.\n  I know the Presiding Officer would remember the presentation that \nPresident Obama made to us in December, on a Sunday. We were meeting in \na caucus about health care and he came over to talk to us. He talked \nabout meeting individuals who were out of work in another part of \nPennsylvania, in Allentown, at a job site. What he said in early \nDecember was very similar to what I heard in late January, and that is \nthese are individuals who are out of work through no fault of their \nown. They are working and struggling, leading lives of tremendous \nstruggle and sacrifice and heartache, but they are not complaining. \nThey are determined to get a job. They are filling out scores and \nscores of applications--sometimes being rejected formally and sometimes \nhearing nothing at all. That is the life they are leading.\n  I think the President's visit and other visits by some of us in the \nSenate are confirming that sense of determination, that sense of \ngratitude they have that there are programs to help them while they are \nunemployed, but also a tremendous resilience and ability to live and \nwork through this struggle.\n  What do we do? We could cite their cases and say how much we hope \ntheir prospects will improve. We could continue to enlarge and expand, \nas we must and we should, a safety net. We could pass other \nlegislation. But I think one of the best ways to jump-start job \ncreation is to provide significant tax incentives to employers, lots of \nemployers out there who want to hire, who want to invest in their \nbusiness, who want to maybe move people up who have done a good job and \nincrease their payroll in that way--but especially to hire more people, \nto hire folks who are out of work.\n  I believe the best way to do that, not the only way but the best way, \nis to pass legislation like the bill I introduced yesterday, the Small \nBusiness Job Creation Tax Credit Act. It is rather simple, but I think \nthe impact of it could be substantial--a very substantial number of \njobs created. What this act does is provide a nonrefundable quarterly \npayroll tax credit based upon an increase in the employer's wages that \nare paid. It would be a 1-year bill. It would be in effect for 1 year \nso it is very targeted in terms of the time. The credit would apply to \nan employee's wages up to the Social Security base of $106,800--that \nwould be the limit of what you could count for the tax credit. If you \nhad fewer than 100 employees, you would get a 20-percent credit; more \nthan 100 employees, 15 percent.\n  We know as we have heard today and on so many other occasions that \nthe driver of our economy tends to be almost overwhelmingly small \nbusiness. In Pennsylvania, if you look at a 3-year period from 2003 to \n2006, small businesses accounted for more than 91 percent of the job \ncreation. So we know that by giving small businesses a 20-percent tax \ncredit for those with under 100 employees, that can have a substantial \nbenefit for those employers, obviously, for those who can obtain work, \nand I think in a larger way our economy. We put a limit on the credit. \nOne company could not have more than $\\1/2\\ million by way of a credit. \nYou would basically compare one quarter in 2010, for example, versus \nthat corresponding quarter in 2009.\n  We know one of the referees around here is the Congressional Budget \nOffice, maybe the main referee, in terms of how legislation is given a \nprice or a score or a number, so to speak. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has said that a tax credit based upon an increase in payroll \nwould have the greatest positive impact on America's gross domestic \nproduct and employment, when compared to other job creation strategies.\n  I believe Congress should pass a job creation tax credit to reduce \nup-front labor costs. This credit could provide for one small business, \njust one business alone, a 20-percent job creation tax credit.\n  Other economists across the board, the Economic Policy Institute as \nwell as others, have estimated that a job creation tax credit would \ncreate approximately 40 percent more jobs than other proposals.\n  Finally, I would make a point about how it works. Sometimes we pass \nlegislation around here and we do not often think about how it works in \nthe real world--the real world of being an employer, the real world of \nhiring people and making ends meet, meeting your bottom line, getting \nyour product out the door, all of the real-world challenges our \nemployers face.\n  The way this would work is, every employer is familiar with what the \nIRS calls form 941. It is just one of many forms we hear about. But all \nwe would need to do, if we pass this tax credit, is to have a line or \ntwo added to that form. The employer would fill it out quarterly and \nsee it right in front of him. He wouldn't have to hire a team of \nlawyers or tax accountants or other experts, he would just fill that in \nand be eligible and receive the credit.\n  It is vitally important that we take these steps for people such as \nRon, whom I spoke of before, and others as well, such as Annetta and \nthose individuals I have met. I know the Presiding Officer has met \nindividuals in the State of Colorado and across our country who are \nfacing similar challenges.\n  Especially when we see more and more the rise in these job loss \nindicators, to have headline after headline say: Highest job loss in 17 \nYears, highest job loss in 20, in 23, in 25 years--these are just \nheadlines I have seen over the last couple of weeks in Pennsylvania. To \nsee that, it is not enough to say we will weather the storm and we will \ntry to provide a safety net. We have to have a safety net, but I \nbelieve we have to have very targeted and focused strategies that are \nnot theoretical.\n  We know this will work. We have prior evidence and experience with \nit. We need to pass the Job Creation Tax Credit to jump-start the \ncreation of jobs this year, in 2010, in the next couple of months and \nthroughout the year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to a \ndisease that is devastating to women nationwide. In 2009, the National \nCancer Institute at NIH reported that cervical cancer was diagnosed in \n11,250 women, and more than 4,000 women died from the disease. The U.S. \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimates that $2 \nbillion per year is spent on treatment of cervical cancer. Access to \nregular screening would not only prevent the disease in most cases, but \nwould be a mere fraction of the cost of treatment.\n  Cervical cancer is mainly caused by HPV, a virus that currently \ninfects about 20 million Americans. Another 6 million people become \nnewly infected each year. By educating women and making regular Pap \ntests, HPV tests and the HPV vaccine affordable and accessible, we can \nsignificantly decrease the number of cases of cervical cancer in this \nNation.\n  This message was brought to me last week by one of my constituents, \nMs. Tamika Felder, and her ``friends,'' a remarkable group of women who \nvisited Capitol Hill to promote awareness of cervical cancer. Tamika \nwas a successful young television producer in Washington, DC. At the \nage of 25, Tamika went to the doctor for a routine Pap test. She hadn't \nbeen to the doctor for a few years, partly due to a lack of health \ninsurance. Her results came back, and the diagnosis was what she calls \n``the shock of her life''--advanced cervical cancer. As Tamika \nstruggled to come to terms with her diagnosis, she became depressed and \nretreated from most of her friends. She could only think about the end \nof her life, and the dreams that would go unfulfilled.\n  Doctors recommended a radical hysterectomy, which left Tamika \nheartbroken, knowing that she would never be able to give birth to \nchildren. Rounds of chemotherapy and radiation followed, and Tamika \nstruggled to stay positive. She credits amazing family, friends, and \ncoworkers with helping her through this difficult time. She emerged \ncancer-free, and is a 5-year survivor.\n  As Tamika was undergoing treatment, she spent a lot of time educating \nherself about HPV and cervical cancer, and her friends did the same. \nThey learned that the disease was preventable, and they needed to get \nthat message out to women around the country. Thus, the nonprofit \norganization Tamika and Friends was born. Tamika and Friends is based \nin Upper Marlboro, MD, and is dedicated to raising awareness about \ncervical cancer and its links to HPV.\n  Using the network of survivors and friends that they have \nestablished, they spread the essential message that through education, \nprevention, and treatment, cervical cancer can be entirely eliminated. \nThey share their message in creative ways, including house parties that \ncreate a comfortable environment for women to have open discussions \nabout HPV and cervical cancer and its causes. Their Web site has many \nsurvivors' stories to encourage other women that share their diagnosis.\n  When I learned that one of the reasons that Tamika did not have a \nregular Pap test was that she lacked health insurance, my conviction \nthat we must achieve universal health coverage was strengthened. Her \nstory is one of many that we have heard over the past year that \nemphasizes the critical need to cover the uninsured. If Tamika had had \naccess to proper preventive testing, then her cancer might have been \ncaught at an earlier stage. She may not have needed a radical \nhysterectomy, and her ability to have children, which she held so dear, \nmight have been preserved.\n  The health care reform legislation passed by the Senate would ensure \nthat women can afford a yearly Pap test. In the bill, preventive \nservices for women, including a yearly exam and cervical cancer \nscreenings are covered at no cost to patients. In addition, as part of \nthe managers' amendment, the provision that I introduced as part of a \nPatients' Bill of Rights will allow women to designate an OB-GYN as \ntheir primary care physician. This will enable women to receive care \nfrom a physician that specializes in women's health and can reinforce \nefforts to educate women about the causes of cervical cancer and the \nimportance of getting regular Pap and HPV tests.\n  To successfully eradicate cervical cancer, we must acknowledge and \naddress that racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately \naffected. Cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage more often in \nWhites than in Blacks, and Black women have higher rates of mortality \nfrom cervical cancer than White women. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, Hispanic women were twice as likely as \nWhite women to be diagnosed with cervical cancer, and the rates of \ncervical cancer among Vietnamese American women are higher than those \nfor any other ethnicity--more than five times higher than White women. \nThese statistics highlight why it is so important to codify the Offices \nof Minority Health within HHS and its agencies. I advocated for this to \nbe part of the managers' amendment to the Senate health care bill, and \nI will continue to push for it to be included in the health care reform \nlegislation that is signed by President Obama.\n  I come to the floor today to raise awareness about cervical cancer \nand the need to cover preventive services for women, and to commend and \nthank Tamika and her friends for their efforts to educate all women \nabout what they can do to remain healthy. Tamika's story could have \nbeen one of tragedy, but instead, she has turned it into a story of \ninspiration, strength, and hope.\n  In one of the informational brochures that Tamika and Friends hands \nout to women is a message from Tamika herself. It says ``No matter how \nbusy or broke you think you are--whether you have insurance or not--you \nmust never, ever skip your Pap test and HPV test.'' As Members of the \nU.S. Senate, it is within our power to help women like Tamika and make \nsure that a lack of health insurance is not a barrier for women's \nhealth. We can all do our part to prevent cervical cancer and other \ndiseases that can be caught early with proper preventive care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/02/senate-section/article/S433-4", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S433-S434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING REVITALIZATION ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to discuss the \nSmall Business Contracting Revitalization Act of 2010. This critical \npiece of legislation is the direct result of consensus-building and \ncompromise, and continues the bipartisan tradition of the Small \nBusiness Committee. I also wish to thank Chair Landrieu for her \npartnership with me in forging this truly crucial measure as we work \ntoward contracting parity for small business, and for her tireless \nleadership on all concerns confronting small businesses today.\n  The Small Business Revitalization Act of 2010 retains critical \nprocurement provisions that originate in the comprehensive contracting \nbills I introduced or cosponsored in the 109th and 110th Congresses \nwhich were unanimously voted out of the Small Business Committee. This \nparticular legislation\n\n[[Page S434]]\n\nwill serve to minimize the use of contract bundling and consolidation \nof contracts by the Federal Government, and increase the ability of \nsmall businesses to fairly compete for such contracts through a host of \nkey improvements, including allowing small businesses to join together \nin teams to bid on certain procurement opportunities. Additional \nrequirements will help to ensure prompt payment from prime contractors \nto subcontractors, and make it easier for the Federal government to \nprosecute businesses who fraudulently identify themselves as small \ncompanies.\n  Since the mid-1990s, with the enactment of acquisition streamlining \nreforms and the downsizing of the Federal procurement workforce, small \nbusinesses have faced a litany of hurdles that have deprived them of \nFederal contracting dollars. One such impediment is contract bundling \nwhich takes contracting opportunities out of the hands of deserving \nsmall businesses by grouping numerous small contracts and bundling them \ninto one large award. Ill-equipped to manage the demands of these \nconsolidated awards due to a lack of resources, small business owners \nagain find themselves crowded out of the Federal contracting process. \nConsequently, the bipartisan measure we are introducing reflects the \nrecommendations made by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to \nimpose stricter reviews and more comprehensive reporting of bundled \ncontracts, encourages small business teaming to bid on larger \ncontracts, and promotes Federal agency publishing and use of best \npractices. Additional obstacles to successful small business \ncontracting include ``bait and switch'' tactics used by prime \ncontractors who use small firms in developing bids but do not \nsubcontract with them once a contract has been awarded. Our bill will \naddress this concern as well as other ongoing problems such as large \nbusinesses posing as small businesses, flawed reporting data, and \nagencies who fail to meet their small business contracting goals.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am further dismayed by the myriad ways that \ngovernment agencies have time and again egregiously failed to meet the \nvast majority of their small business statutory ``goaling'' \nrequirements. It is unconscionable that the statutory goal for only one \ncategory of small business--small disadvantaged businesses--has been \nmet, and that goals for the three other programs HUBZones, women-owned \nsmall businesses, and service-disabled veterans-owned businesses--have \nnever been achieved.\n  Consider that, in 2007, small businesses were eligible for $378 \nbillion in Federal contracting awards, yet received only $83 billion. \nThis blatant failure to utilize small businesses, thus preventing them \nto secure their fair share of Federal contracting dollars, has resulted \nin firms losing billions of dollars in contracting opportunities. But \n23 percent is only a base goal. We must strive to exceed it, not just \nmeet it.\n  In the last 2 years alone, the Small Business Committee has held \nnumerous hearings and roundtables to identify and explain small \nbusiness' contracting concerns. In addition, the GAO and the Small \nBusiness Administration's, SBA, inspector general have issued multiple \nreports addressing small business Federal contracting deficiencies. Our \nlegislation builds on the contracting provisions of previous Small \nBusiness Committee contracting bills by endowing the SBA with \nadditional tools to meet the demands of an ever-changing 21st century \ncontracting environment.\n  That said, I am greatly encouraged by the latest statistics relating \nto Federal contracting dollars awarded to small businesses from the \nfunds appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, \nARRA. Preliminary reports show that as of February 1, 2010, small \nbusinesses have received over 29 percent of the ARRA Federal \ncontracting dollars, well exceeding the imposed 23 percent statutory \ngoal. This begs the question, if the Federal Government can not only \nmeet but exceed these requirements for the Recovery Act, why can't \nthese goals be met year in and year out? The simple answer is they can. \nI am hopeful this administration will make a conscious effort to \nreverse the government-wide failure to meet small business goals on a \nconsistent basis.\n  I am confident that this legislation will result in the changes \nnecessary to reduce fraud and waste while paving the way for the \nFederal Government to maximize the use of America's innovative small \nbusinesses in the contracting arena. Again, I want to recognize Senator \nLandrieu for her leadership in this matter and for her continuing \ncommitment to the small business community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/02/senate-section/article/S434-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE ALBANY AREA YMCA\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nAlbany Area YMCA on the occasion of its 100th anniversary.\n  On October 25, 1909, 100 businessmen met at the New Albany Hotel for \nthe purpose of establishing and building a YMCA in Albany. Five days \nlater, the campaign, led by Judge F.F. Putney, was successful in \nraising $30,000.\n  Just 1 year later, the vision became a reality, and the first YMCA \nbuilding in Albany opened its doors at the corner of Pine and \nJefferson.\n  Since its inception in 1910, the Albany Area YMCA has been an \nimportant part of life for residents of southwest Georgia.\n  Just last year, more than 30,000 people were involved in the YMCA, \nwhether it was coaching baseball, participating in the 5K runs or \nvolunteering at the food drives.\n  I have been to the Albany Area YMCA several times and I am always \nimpressed by the new community initiatives and programs taking place \nthere.\n  The YMCA has always been committed to challenging boys and girls to \nthink beyond themselves and to set goals--and it is this focus on \ncharacter development that has helped strengthen the community.\n  As a former volunteer and past president of the Moultrie YMCA, I have \na special appreciation for the great work the volunteers are doing. And \nthey ought to be commended for their tremendous efforts.\n  For 100 years, YMCA volunteers have helped children develop \nthemselves as honest, respectful, caring and responsible individuals.\n  Additionally, I would be remiss if I did not mention Dave Wallace, \nwho has made a tremendous impact on the Albany Area YMCA while serving \nas the executive director.\n  I have had the good fortune of knowing Dave for several years. The \nYMCA has flourished under his leadership--and I have no doubt he has \ntouched many lives throughout his tenure there.\n  Over the years, the Albany Area YMCA has relocated, expanded and \nchanged in many aspects, but it has never steered away from its mission \n``to put Christian principles into practice through programs that build \na healthy spirit, mind and body for all.''\n  Once again, I would like to offer my congratulations and appreciation \nto the Albany Area YMCA on this very special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/02/senate-section/article/S434-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S434-S435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE NORRIS STEVENS FAMILY\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Sherrie \nis a current city alderman and Shay is a former alderman.\n  According to those who know her best, Sherrie is quick to open up her \nhome to the youth in her church and community, using her personal \nfinances to help feed senior citizens and provide clothing for the \nneedy.

Mr. President, on December 2, 2009, retired Air \nForce COL Jack Pitchford died at the age of 82 after a long battle with \na brain tumor. The Natchez, MS, native was a decorated fighter pilot, a \nsurvivor of the Hanoi Hilton, and a true hero. Our country will miss \nhim.\n  John Joseph Pitchford was born in 1926 in Natchez. The second of 12 \nchildren and the eldest boy, Pitchford enlisted in the Army Air Corps \nafter graduating from high school in 1944. He served as an aircraft and \nengine mechanic through the end of World War II.\n  He then attended Louisiana State University from 1949 to 1952, \ngraduating with a bachelor of science degree in forestry and receiving \na Reserve Officer Training Corps commission in the Air Force. After \nentering pilot training in August 1952 at Bartow Air Force Base, \nPitchford went on to receive his wings in September 1953.\n  As the war in Vietnam escalated, Pitchford volunteered for the Wild \nWeasel program, tasked with flying low-altitude missions to hunt and \ndestroy surface-to-air missiles. On December 20, 1965, during his third \ncombat mission of the war, Colonel Pitchford's F-100F Super Sabre \naircraft was hit by a North Vietnamese missile. He suffered a \ndislocated right shoulder during his ejection from the aircraft and \nthree gunshot wounds to his right arm when his captors opened fire. \nColonel Pitchford was the first Wild Weasel to be taken prisoner in \nVietnam. He spent the next 7 years in various North Vietnamese \nprisoner-of-war camps, including the infamous Hanoi Hilton. After 373 \nweeks of hellish captivity and torture, Colonel Pitchford was finally \nreleased on February 12, 1973.\n  In recognition of his tremendous service and sacrifice, Colonel \nPitchford was awarded the Purple Heart, the Silver Star, and Legion of \nMerit. Upon retirement from the Air Force, he returned to Natchez where \nhe became an active member of the community. In discussing his time as \na POW, Colonel Pitchford once said:\n\n       The one thing I would like to convey to the American people \n     is that no matter what happens in one's lifetime, one must \n     never lose faith in the United States of America. Ours is a \n     great country indeed. We must continue to rededicate \n     ourselves to the principles that have made it great. I, as a \n     POW, was maintained by my faith in God, country and by the \n     hardships much worse than my own that were endured by many of \n     my fellow POWs.\n\n  I recently returned from Afghanistan. Many of the qualities Jack \nPitchford exhibited in his life can be seen in our men and women who \nare serving our country there today. Their service and sacrifice \nensures that Jack Pitchford's legacy will live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/02/senate-section/article/S435-5", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/02/senate-section/article/S435-6", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/02/senate-section/article/S435-7", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S435-S436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n   IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13396 ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006, WITH RESPECT TO THE \n          SITUATION IN OR IN RELATION TO COTE D'IVOIRE--PM 44\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message\n\n[[Page S436]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States which was referred to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency, unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Mr. President, today I am introducing with Senator \nStabenow the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and \nRecreation Act, which would permanently protect 32,557 acres within the \nextraordinarily beautiful Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore \nlocated in the Michigan counties of Leelanau and Benzie. This \nlegislation reflects the 2008 National Park Service wilderness \nproposal, which was the result of a lengthy public process beginning in \n2006, and culminating in broad public support for the proposal. The \nwilderness designation improves upon a 1981 recommendation by ensuring \nthat access to recreational areas is provided while protecting lands in \ntheir natural condition.\n  While there currently are no areas in the Lakeshore formally \ndesignated as wilderness, the National Park Service has been managing \n30,903 acres as wilderness since 1982, when an amendment to the park's \nenabling legislation required the Park Service to manage land \nrecommended as wilderness in 1981 in this manner ``until Congress \ndetermines otherwise.'' The legislation I am introducing today would \nmodify somewhat which areas would be managed as wilderness to ensure \nvisitors continue to have access to these lands. The bill specifically \nexcludes developed county roads and State highways from the wilderness \narea such that access is not impeded for recreation and other purposes. \nSeveral areas for boat launching and historic structures have also been \nexcluded from the wilderness designation. Even with these exclusions, \nthe overall acreage that would be designated as wilderness is slightly \nmore than the area currently managed as wilderness because Sleeping \nBear Plateau would be protected. Importantly, the wilderness \ndesignation would still allow hunting and fishing, trail-use, and \ncamping at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Also, motor boats \nwould still be allowed in Lake Michigan, and boaters would be allowed \nto beach their craft on beaches adjacent to the wilderness area.\n  The bill was carefully crafted to ensure that the wilderness \ndesignation would apply only to areas currently undeveloped and \npossessing natural characteristics and values. There are five areas \nthat would be designated as wilderness by this legislation. Most of \nNorth and South Manitou Islands would be designated as wilderness, with \nsome exclusions for boat launching, roads, and historic structures. \nWilderness would also be designated in the north, central, and southern \nparts of the Lakeshore on the mainland. In the mainland areas there are \nalso exclusions for roads and recreational and historic features.\n  The dramatic dunes, sandy beaches, steep bluffs, forests, inland \nlakes, agricultural lands, and historic structures of Sleeping Bear \nDunes National Lakeshore embody the rich natural and cultural history \nof Michigan. This wilderness designation would ensure that current and \nfuture generations will be able to enjoy solitude and recreation in \nthese treasured areas. Even as the Sleeping Bear dunes are ever-\nchanging as they are sculpted by the wind, it is critical that we \nprotect these and other natural assets from being altered by \ndevelopment. I hope we can have prompt consideration of this bill by \nthe Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Webb, Mr. McCain, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Chambliss, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Corker, \n        Mr. Kyl, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Johanns, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 2977. A bill to prohibit the use of Department of Justice for the \nprosecution in Article III courts of the United States of individuals \ninvolved in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about this \nadministration's decision to try the 9/11 conspirators and the \nChristmas bomber in our civilian criminal justice system.\n  Prosecuting the five 9/11 conspirators currently detained at the \nGuantanamo Bay detention facility, as well as the Christmas bomber, \nUmar Farouk Abdulmutallab, in article III criminal court indicates a \ndisturbing tendency by this administration to make terrorism a law \nenforcement priority rather than an intelligence priority. It a mistake \nto treat terrorism as a law enforcement problem alone, a mistake that \nis only compounded by the fact that the intelligence community was not \neven consulted before they were prevented from gathering any \nintelligence from Abdulmutallab, a member of a terrorist organization \nsworn to be at war with America. As the 9/11 Commission found:\n\n       An unfortunate consequence of this superb investigative and \n     prosecutorial effort was that it created an impression that \n     the law enforcement system was well equipped to cope with \n     terrorism.\n\n  As we know from an examination of events before 9/11, law enforcement \nmeans alone cannot eliminate the threat from al-Qaida.\n  After Abdulmutallab failed to detonate an explosive device on \nNorthwest flight 253, he was taken into custody by law enforcement. \nOther than the Federal Bureau of Investigation, no member of the \nintelligence community--in particular, the Central Intelligence \nAgency--had the opportunity to question Abdulmutallab and gather \nintelligence. The Department of Justice should have foreseen that a \ndedicated terrorist, intent on committing suicide and harming \nAmericans, would not be willing to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement, \nespecially after being informed of his rights under our criminal code, \nincluding the right to remain silent. Without consulting the \nintelligence community, the Department of Justice limited the tools \nused to gather intelligence and potentially prevent future terrorist \nattacks.\n  The administration is returning to the idea that terrorism can be \ninvestigated by the FBI and prosecuted rather than relying on our \nintelligence community and military to disrupt attacks. The United \nStates should not revert to the days where we waited for an attack to \noccur, then investigated it and prosecuted it. We must work actively to \ndisrupt terrorist attacks before they take the lives of Americans. We \nmust work actively to deny terrorist safe havens and financing. The \nmost successful way to disrupt and deny terrorist activity is through \nthe intelligence we gather on individuals prior to a criminal or \nterrorist act occurring or from those individuals after they have made \nsuch an attempt.\n  Treating these terrorists as common criminals will put our \ncommunities in danger, toll the taxpayers, and cause the government to \nmiss valuable intelligence collection opportunities. For example, \nbringing the five 9/11 conspirators to New York City is estimated to \ncost over $200 million per year just in enhanced security. This does \nnot include the cost to millions of New Yorkers and businesses who will \nhave to adjust their way of life to accommodate these trials. \nMeanwhile, this will allow terrorists to mock our justice system and \nuse it as a stage to espouse their jihadist beliefs and expose our \nintelligence sources and methods. We have already seen Zacarias \nMoussaoui use his trial in Virginia to spout al-Qaida propaganda and to \ntry to portray himself as a martyr. Meanwhile, terrorism trials during \nthe 1990s in our criminal courts exposed sensitive and classified \ninformation to, among others, Osama bin Laden, including the fact that \nthe U.S. intelligence community was targeting his communications.\n  Let me be clear. These are not common criminals, and they should not \nbe treated as such. The five terrorists responsible for planning and \norganizing the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks--including self-\nproclaimed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed--should not be \nentitled to receive the same legal treatment as our Constitution gives \nto common criminals in this country. These terrorists committed an act \nof war, an act that led us to an armed conflict in Afghanistan, where, \ntoday, more than 8 years later, our troops are still battling al-Qaida. \nThese terrorists should face justice through the military commission \nprocess for the atrocities they committed--the same process that had \nalready charged these five terrorists and began over a year ago; the \nsame process that KSM already pleaded guilty under but that the \nPresident abolished as soon as he took office.\n\n[[Page S442]]\n\n  For these reasons, I joined a bipartisan group of Senators, today, in \nintroducing legislation that would prohibit funding for the prosecuting \nof the 9/11 conspirators in our U.S. criminal article III courts.\n  Under his Constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, along with \nthe Congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force, the \nPresident has the authority--and the responsibility--to detain the 9/11 \nconspirators and Abdulmutallab because of their actions on behalf of \nal-Qaida, and to pursue trial by military commission--an option the \nPresident determined appropriate for other terrorits, such as Abd al-\nRahim al-Nashiri, who was responsible for the USS Cole bombing. \nInstead, by prosecuting Abdulmutallab and the 9/11 conspirators in \ncriminal court, and Nashiri and others by military commission, it \ncreates the impression that terrorists are rewarded with the full \ncomplement of rights and privileges of an American if they attack \ndefenseless civilians at home, but not if they attack our government or \nmilitary interests abroad. This will only further incentivize \nterrorists to attack our homeland.\n  As the attempted terrorists attack on Christmas Day illustrates, al-\nQaida does not need further incentive to attack America. They are \nfocused on and engaged in harming Americans here and abroad. As such, \nit is critical that our intelligence community have every opportunity \nto gain information so we can stay one step ahead of any related \nterrorists threats. Obtaining intelligence first rather than affording \nconstitutional rights to a foreign terrorist is an obvious solution. \nTreating members of al-Qaida the same as we treat others captured on \nthe battlefield is another.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 2978. A bill to extend the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, \nto extend the trade preferences made available to Haiti under that Act, \nto encourage foreign investment in Haiti, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation \nto help encourage Haitian economic development, by promoting U.S.-\nHaitian trade and investment. The legislation, the Renewing Hope for \nHaitian Trade and Investment Act of 2010, would in part renew \nprovisions of U.S. trade law that are currently scheduled to expire and \nwhich have been critical to the growth of the Haitian apparel sector, \nwhich sustains tens of thousands of jobs in Haiti.\n  Apparel is a core industry sector in Haiti, accounting for an \nestimated 25,000 jobs and 75-80 percent of Haiti's export earnings.\n  The devastating January 12 earthquake in Haiti caused widespread \ndamage to the industry. The damage has caused transportation and \nassembly production bottlenecks, and compounded existing challenges \nsuch as lack of industrial space, poor road and port conditions, \nunreliable electricity, and the high cost of capital.\n  As of January 2010, Haiti's apparel industry is reportedly running at \n50 percent of capacity as a result of the earthquake. Producers hope to \nincrease production to 70 percent of capacity in the next 4-6 weeks, \ndepending on improvements to electricity and water supplies.\n  Most apparel imports from Haiti come into the U.S. free of duties, \nbecause of provisions in the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, \nCBTPA. Unfortunately, these provisions expire in September of this \nyear. This expiration is dampening interest in placing additional \napparel orders, so it is critical that Congress extend this important \nprogram, and do so expeditiously. The Renewing Hope for Haitian Trade \nand Investment Act of 2010 would extend CBTPA for an additional 3 \nyears.\n  Increasingly, producers are using a new program called the \nHemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement, HOPE, \nprogram to send Haitian apparel to the U.S. free of duty. While \nutilization of this program, which began in 2006, is growing, it faced \nearly challenges and has since been amended. The amendments have been \nhelpful, but extending this program would help send a signal to \npotential investors to go into Haiti and build the factories that will \nemploy hundreds or thousands more Haitian workers. The Renewing Hope \nfor Haitian Trade and Investment Act would ``restart the clock'' on the \nHOPE program and extend it through 2022.\n  Furthermore, a challenging investment climate and cumbersome Customs \nprocedures for moving goods in and out of Haiti are imposing \nsignificant challenges to private-sector Haitian producers. The \nRenewing Hope for Haitian Trade and Investment Act would help in these \nareas, too.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have reached out to a broad group of \nstakeholders in order to identify the near-term challenges that face \nHaiti's apparel production industry. We focused on identifying short-\nterm constraints that exist because of the January earthquake. I look \nforward to continuing to work with these stakeholders going forward in \norder to ensure quick passage of a bill that has a maximum amount of \nconsensus between U.S. and Haitian producers, non-governmental \norganizations, and others.\n  I would particularly like to acknowledge the leadership of Senator \nBill Nelson on this proposal. His keen understanding of Haiti and how \nU.S. trade laws work to help Haitian economic development was critical \nto constructing this legislation. I look forward to working with \nSenators Nelson, Baucus, Grassley, and Chairmen Rangel and Levin on \nthis proposal and other ideas to spur Haiti's economy. Each of these \nmembers is a vociferous champion of Haitian economic development, \npromoted in part by thoughtful trade and investment policies.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to join in supporting this critical \nlegislation to help Haitians who were flattened both economically and \nliterally by last month's earthquake get back on their feet.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Kaufman):\n  S. 2979. A bill to amend title 18, United States Cose, to provide \naccountability for the criminal acts of Federal contractors and \nemployees outside the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the past year, President Obama has \nbeen working hard to restore America's credibility in the world and our \nreputation for justice and our commitment to the rule of law. A key \ncomponent of that important mission is ensuring accountability for \nAmerican contractors and employees overseas. Accountability is crucial, \nnot just for our image abroad and our diplomatic relations, but for \nensuring our national security.\n  To restore accountability, Congress must make sure that our criminal \nlaws reach serious misconduct by American government employees and \ncontractors wherever they act. Today, I join with Senator Kaufman to \nintroduce the Civilian Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, CEJA, to \naccomplish this important and common sense goal.\n  Tragic events in Iraq in 2007 made clear the need to strengthen the \nlaws providing for jurisdiction over American government employees and \ncontractors working abroad. In September 2007, Blackwater security \ncontractors working for the State Department shot more than 20 unarmed \ncivilians on the streets of Baghdad, killing at least 14 of them, and \ncausing an international incident with the Iraqi government.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, conducted a full-scale \ncriminal investigation of the Blackwater shootings, and prosecutors \nbrought indictments against five contractors. Last month, a Federal \ndistrict judge dismissed all the charges because of an order from the \npast administration immunizing Blackwater contractors under Iraqi law \nand immunity commitments by the prior administration to obtain the \ntestimony of some. Although the Justice Department is expected to \nappeal the dismissals, this could mean that those who perpetrated this \nact will not be held accountable. I believe that, had jurisdiction for \nthese offenses been clear, FBI agents would have been on the scene \nimmediately, which could well have prevented the problems that have \nplagued the case.\n  Other incidents have made all too clear that the Blackwater case was \nnot an isolated incident of contractor misconduct, and accountability \nfor U.S. Government contractors and employees is essential. Private \nsecurity contractors have been involved in violent\n\n[[Page S443]]\n\nincidents in Iraq, including other shooting incidents in which \ncivilians have been seriously injured or killed. In these cases too, \nthere have not been prosecutions.\n  Last fall, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from Jamie \nLeigh Jones, a young woman from Texas who took a job with Halliburton \nin 2005 when she was 20 years old. In her first week on the job, she \nwas drugged and gang-raped by co-workers. When she reported this \nassault, her employers moved her to a locked trailer, where she was \nkept by armed guards and denied even access to a phone.\n  Only after pleading with her captors was she eventually given use of \na phone. She called her father, who contacted her Congressman, who in \nturn contacted the State Department. State Department officials were \nable to free her. Ms. Jones testified about the arbitration clause in \nher contract that prevented her from suing Halliburton for this \noutrageous conduct, and Congress has moved to change the civil law to \nprevent that kind of injustice. Today we seek to fix the outdated \ncriminal laws that have also contributed to the failure to bring those \nwho perpetrated this heinous crime to justice.\n  Unfortunately, many other women have encountered similar abuse and \nhave similarly seen their attackers escape any accountability. Also \nlast year, we learned that contractors hired to secure the American \nEmbassy in Afghanistan engaged in various forms of outrageous conduct \nbut there, too, there have been no prosecutions. It is time to correct \nthis injustice.\n  I worked with Senator Sessions and others in 2000 to pass the \nMilitary Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, MEJA, and then again to \namend it in 2004, so that U.S. criminal laws would extend to all \nmembers of the U.S. military, to those who accompany the military, and \nto all contractors who support the Defense Department mission overseas. \nWe wanted to make sure that all contractors working alongside the U.S. \nmilitary or protecting U.S. interests overseas were held to the same \nstandard that they would be at home. We pay these contractors with \ntaxpayers' money, they represent the U.S. overseas, and they should be \nheld to the same standards as our military.\n  In 2007, I worked with then-Senator Obama and with Senators Sessions \nand Specter on further legislation which would have amended MEJA to \nmake sure that all security contractors, not just those supporting the \nDefense Department, are accountable under U.S. law.\n  Today, we introduce a bill that would finally address this issue in a \ncomprehensive way, establishing clearly that all U.S. Government \nemployees and contractors who commit crimes while working abroad can be \ncharged and tried in the United States under U.S. law. The State \nDepartment, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and numerous \nother Government agencies have employees, and in recent years, more and \nmore private contractors, working abroad. There must be accountability \nfor all of these people who represent our Government overseas. In those \ninstances where the local justice system may be less fair, this \nexplicit jurisdiction will also protect Americans by providing the \noption of prosecuting them in the U.S., rather than leaving them \nsubject to hostile and unpredictable local courts.\n  Not only will this bill help to provide justice in cases where there \nhas been none, it will improve our national security by allowing \nprosecution of those who undermine our efforts to create stability and \nimprove foreign relations. By ensuring accountability in cases of \nwrongdoing against citizens of the host country, as in the Blackwater \ncase, we will increase international trust and cooperation, including \nfrom those countries most essential to our counter-terrorism and \nnational security efforts. The current lack of accountability reduces \ninternational confidence in our military and our Government, which \nundermines our national defense. Moreover, the talented men and women \nwe need to advance our national security efforts will be more likely to \nstep forward and serve if we stamp out the lawless atmosphere in places \nlike Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The legislation we introduce today would further increase \naccountability by providing additional resources and creating new units \nto investigate wrongdoing by contractors and employees abroad and by \ncalling on the Attorney General and the Justice Department's Inspector \nGeneral to report to Congress on investigations under this bill.\n  In the past, legislation in this area has been bipartisan. I hope it \nwill be again. Senator Kaufman and I are willing to work to address any \nconcerns with this legislation and to ensure that it promises justice \nin a way that strengthens, rather than weakens, our national security. \nCongressman Price is introducing a companion bill in the House. I hope \nthat we will be able to rapidly pass this important reform into law.\n  As we seek to restore our Nation's historic role as one of \nresponsible leadership in the world, we must ensure that the values \nthat brought us to that leadership are firmly in place. One of those \ngreat American values is the rule of law. No one should be above the \nlaw, certainly not American employees and contractors representing this \ngreat nation throughout the world. This common sense bill would promote \nthe rule of law throughout the world and make us stronger in the \nprocess. I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle will join us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2979\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       For each of the fiscal years 2010 through 2015, there are \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Attorney General such \n     sums as are necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 2981. A bill to reevaluate and redirect the stimulus; to the \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague \nSenator Thune to introduce the Reevaluate and Redirect the Stimulus Act \nof 2010 that would require the Obama Administration's Office of \nManagement and Budget, OMB, to make proposals to redirect stimulus \nfunds approved in last year's $787 billion American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act. Although I supported the stimulus and favor the \ncontinuation of pro-growth policies, given that the federal deficit for \nFiscal Year 2009 was a staggering $1.4 trillion and that the \nCongressional Budget Office announced on January 26 that it is \nprojecting a baseline deficit of $6.047 trillion over the next 10 \nyears, Congress must do more to pair the resources targeted for job \ncreation with reductions in other areas.\n  Before I describe the provisions of the legislation I am introducing \ntoday, I must say that it is regrettable that I feel compelled to offer \na bill at all. The fact is, I wrote a letter last December 11 to OMB \nDirector Peter Orszag urging him to analyze unobligated funds in the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act to determine whether they should \nbe reprogrammed to offset the cost of future stimulus legislation. \nAlthough my letter requested a response by January 1, the \nadministration, who is solely responsible for distributing stimulus \nspending, has declined to do so. The Administration also opted against \nincluding any related proposals in its just-released Fiscal Year 2011 \nBudget. I find it inconceivable that there are no funds that should be \nredirected, and thus the Administration has concluded that every dollar \nwe approved last February is working precisely as intended. \nAdditionally, I am particularly concerned by proposals to pay for \nadditional stimulus by reducing the authorization level for the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, as the House did last December. \nThe fact is that further stimulus spending claimed to be offset by \nreducing TARP's authorization level would still increase the deficit \nrelative to simply not using additional TARP funds at all.\n  Despite OMB's inattention to my request, the administration and \nCongress both remain accountable to ensure that each dollar we spend on \nstimulus either creates jobs at a greater rate or protects displaced \nindividuals at a lower cost than competing policies on the table. To \nthe degree that either the tax or spending proposals President Obama \nhas or that members of Congress want to pursue are more beneficial than \nproceeding to obligate funds still available in the American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act, the administration and Congress should assess the \npossibility of redirecting those resources. We simply cannot afford to \nbe poor fiscal stewards and engage in wasteful spending that will rob \nfuture generations of prosperity.\n  To fulfill this fundamental obligation, the legislation I am offering \ntoday would make it a statutory requirement for OMB, within the next 15 \ndays, to provide Congress with a list of provisions from the stimulus \nfor which there remain funds that have not yet been obligated. Second, \nOMB would be required to provide Congress with a list of programs \nincluded in the stimulus with remaining unobligated funds that it \nrecommends be redirected toward more effective programs to either \nassist the displaced, or spur job creation. Once Congress receives the \nadministration's proposals, all Members, as well as the appropriate \nCongressional committees, can evaluate their suitability with an eye \ntoward using them as offsets for forthcoming legislation.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation \nand help to swiftly make it law. The administration and Congress must \nwork together to address our tremendous budget deficit and insist that \nevery dollar we spend promotes its objective. Given that it oversees \nstimulus spending and has the capacity to evaluate whether programs are \nworking as intended, it is only appropriate that the administration \ncomplete the first step of this process and provide Congress with a \nlist of spending that could be redirected. Once it does so, I will \ncertainly insist that Congress discharge its responsibility of \ncarefully evaluating the administration's proposals. Individuals \nseeking relief from the recession that has so ravaged our economy \nexpect nothing less as it is unfair to waste dollars that could be more \nbeneficial elsewhere, and future generations who will have to repay \ntoday's deficits will thank us as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2981\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 405\n\n       Whereas Google announced on January 12, 2010, the mid-\n     December 2009 discovery that it had been victimized by a \n     highly sophisticated and targeted cyber attack on its \n     corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted \n     in the theft of its intellectual property;\n       Whereas Google also announced it had evidence to suggest \n     that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail \n     accounts of Chinese human rights activists, and that the \n     evidence revealed separate attempts to penetrate Gmail \n     accounts of Chinese human rights activists, journalists, and \n     dissidents in the United States, Europe, and China;\n       Whereas the targeting of Google is believed to be part of a \n     larger effort to access the computer networks of at least 34 \n     companies, including major financial, defense, media, and \n     technology firms and research institutions in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas this attack was one in a series of attempts to \n     exploit security flaws and illegally access computer networks \n     of individuals and institutions through the clandestine \n     installation of phishing and malware technology;\n       Whereas the 2009 ``Report to Congress of the US-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission'' stated that ``a \n     significant and increasing body of circumstantial and \n     forensic evidence strongly indicates the involvement of \n     Chinese state and state-supported entities'' in malicious \n     computer activities against the United States;\n       Whereas approximately 338,000,000 Internet users in China \n     represent the largest population of Internet users worldwide, \n     and the Government of China employs a sophisticated, multi-\n     layered, and wide-ranging apparatus to curtail Internet \n     freedom, as detailed in the 2009 ``Freedom on the Net'' \n     report by the Freedom House organization;\n       Whereas Article 35 of the constitution of the People's \n     Republic of China guarantees freedom of speech, assembly, \n     association, and publication;\n       Whereas authorities in China employ legal and economic \n     means to coerce Internet service providers, web hosting \n     firms, and mobile phone companies to delete and censor online \n     content and discussions created by Chinese users;\n       Whereas the Government of China requires domestic Chinese \n     and foreign companies with subsidiaries in China, including \n     Google, to adjust their business practices to allow increased \n     filtering and supervision by the Government of China, \n     restricting content allowed by technology-based products, and \n     censoring data available on search engines;\n       Whereas, in 2003, the Government of China implemented the \n     Golden Shield Project to control access and information on \n     the Internet on grounds of public safety, including through \n     protocol address blocking, domain name system filtering and \n     redirection, uniform resource locator filtering, packet \n     filtering, connection resets, and other online methods that \n     could amount to censorship of high-value speech;\n       Whereas the Government of China frequently blocks United \n     States international broadcasting by Radio Free Asia (RFA) \n     and Voice of America (VOA), despite the unimpeded broadcast \n     in the United States of state-run media outlets in China, \n     China Central Television, and China Radio International;\n       Whereas, as of December 1, 2009, China had imprisoned 24 \n     traditional and online journalists, accounting for nearly 20 \n     percent of all imprisoned journalists worldwide at that time, \n     according to the annual prison census of the Committee to \n     Protect Journalists;\n       Whereas, following riots in the Xinjiang region of China in \n     July 2009, more than 50 Uighur-language Internet forums were \n     closed and communications were cut in Urumqi, China, and \n     foreign journalists visiting the area were closely monitored \n     by the authorities;\n       Whereas, during the Summer 2008 Olympics in Beijing, limits \n     were placed on freedom of expression and media coverage, \n     contrary to\n\n[[Page S448]]\n\n     previous commitments made by the Government of China to the \n     International Olympic Committee;\n       Whereas ill-defined charges such as ``subversion of the \n     government'' and ``disseminating rumors'' serve as the legal \n     basis to sentence journalists, bloggers, and others who \n     express or disseminate views critical of the Government of \n     China; and\n       Whereas, on January 21, 2010, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton pledged enhanced United States support for Internet \n     freedom, saying, ``We stand for a single internet where all \n     of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas . . . \n     countries that restrict free access to information or violate \n     the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves \n     off from the progress of the next century.'': Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms the centrality of freedom of expression and \n     press freedom as cornerstones of United States foreign policy \n     and United States efforts to promote individual rights;\n       (2) expresses serious concern over ongoing official efforts \n     in many countries to restrict speech and expression, \n     including attempts to censor, restrict, and monitor access to \n     the Internet;\n       (3) welcomes the diplomatic initiative announced by \n     Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on January 21, 2010, to \n     encourage Internet freedom globally by ``supporting the \n     development of new tools that enable citizens to exercise \n     their rights of free expression by circumventing politically \n     motivated censorship . . . with a focus on implementing these \n     programs as efficiently and effectively as possible'';\n       (4) condemns the far-reaching cyber attacks allegedly \n     launched from China against Google, at least 34 other \n     companies, and numerous individuals discovered in December \n     2009;\n       (5) calls on the Government of China to conduct a thorough \n     review of these cyber intrusions, and to make the \n     investigation and its results transparent;\n       (6) pays tribute to the professional and citizen \n     journalists who persevere in their dedication to report in \n     China;\n       (7) urges companies to engage in responsible business \n     practices in the face of efforts by foreign governments to \n     restrict the free flow of information by refusing to aid in \n     the curtailment of free expression; and\n       (8) calls on the President and the Secretary of State to \n     develop means by which the United States Government can more \n     rapidly identify, publicize, and respond to threats against \n     freedom of press and freedom of expression around the world, \n     including through support of new and existing censorship \n     circumvention technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/02/senate-section/article/S448-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE GOALS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC \n                                SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. CASEY.
