Parliamentary inquiry: How much time would I be \nrecognized for now?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa will be \nrecognized for 13 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today and every day an estimated 14,000 \nAmericans will lose their health insurance coverage. The historic \nlegislation before us takes unprecedented steps to expand this coverage \nto the great majority of Americans, while cracking down on the abusive \npractices of the health insurance industry. However, expanding coverage \nalone is not going to solve our problem. The additional 31 million \nAmericans who will gain coverage thanks to this bill are going to need \nhealth care providers, mainly primary health care providers--the \ndoctors, the nurses, the many other health professionals whose skills \nand hard work provide patients with the high-quality health care they \nneed. We are going to need public health professionals who can provide \nassistance during times of emergency such as the current H1N1 pandemic. \nThey will need places to go when they become sick, including doctors' \noffices, community health centers, and nurse-managed health clinics.\n  Today, many communities are facing shortages of primary care \npractitioners and other health care providers. This map gives an \nindication of the lack of primary health care providers in America. The \ndarker area is where we have the lowest number of primary health care \npractitioners. We can see it is mostly rural America. That is not \nentirely true, but it is mostly in rural America in which we lack that \nkind of care.\n  Currently, 65 million Americans live in areas suffering from a \nshortage of these health care professionals. The Department of Health \nand Human Services estimates it would take more than 16,000 additional \npractitioners to meet our need. Many of my constituents--and I am sure \nthose of the occupant of the chair--don't have the primary care \npractitioners they need.\n  I must say, I was up this morning; I was working out; I was watching \nCNN news. Along came a little blurb: Shortage of primary care health \ncare people in America. That is going to put a crunch on us in terms of \nmeeting our health care needs. People are now beginning to pick up on \nthis all over the country.\n  What are we doing about it? First, we have to recognize some of the \nroot causes. One of the root causes is debt. It is the amount of money \nhealth care students pay to go to school. Here is the debt of graduates \nof medical school: 44 percent have over $175,000 of debt; the vast \nmajority have over $125,000; and some, almost half, have $175,000 of \ndebt. What happens is that with this huge debt, they can't afford to \nwork in rural areas or areas where they don't get recompensed.\n  Qualified applicants are not admitted because of a shortage of \nfaculty members. In 2008, an estimated 50,000 applicants were turned \naway from baccalaureate and graduate schools of nursing. This is \nunacceptable. Again, not only do we have to have more primary care \npractitioners, we need the faculty.\n  It is a growing problem. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates \nthat by 2016, we will have a shortage of over 1 million direct care \nworkers, including home health aides, nursing aides, and others who \ncare for our aging population. That is why expanding access to primary \nand preventative care has been a key focus throughout our health reform \nefforts.\n  With Senator Murray's leadership of the workforce group, the HELP \nCommittee has focused on expanding resources to increase the supply of \nqualified health care providers. In the Finance Committee, Senator \nBaucus also made expanding access to primary care a priority, as well \nas expanding residency and training initiatives for primary care \npractitioners. Under Majority Leader Reid's guidance, the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, the health reform bill before us, \ncombined both HELP Committee and Finance Committee provisions to expand \nthe health care workforce, especially the primary care workforce.\n  Let's see what this does.\n  First, the bill will train an additional 24,000 primary care \nphysicians via the National Health Services Corps. It provides loan \nrepayment, scholarships, and higher reimbursement for primary care \nproviders in underserved areas. It also increases the supply of public \nhealth workers at the Federal, State, and local level, and tribal \nhealth agencies. We provide new resources for more community health \ncenters and nurse-managed health centers. We expand primary care \nresidency and training initiatives and hospitals and community health \ncenters.\n  Our bill will improve health care providers' ability to serve our \nincreasingly diverse population by providing training in cultural \ncompetency, in working with individuals with disabilities, in providing \ncare within the medical home model. Because innovative health care \ndelivery models such as the medical home emphasize team-based care, we \ninvest in a range of health care professionals, from physicians, to \nnurses, to dentists, to home health aides, to allied health \nprofessionals.\n  In addition, to increase the capacity of health professionals schools \nand faculty to train new providers, we offer loan repayment programs to \ndoctors, nurses, and dentists who agree to serve as faculty members at \nmedical, nursing, and dental schools.\n  Finally, our bill creates an independent national health care \nworkforce commission to examine and provide recommendations to Congress \non how Federal workforce programs can be improved and how Federal \ndollars can be most effectively spent.\n  It is critical that we act on this historic legislation for many \nreasons. Most of the debate has been about expanding coverage, cracking \ndown on health insurance abuses, and expanding preventative care to \nkeep people healthy in the first place.\n  But there is also one other aspect of this bill that has not been \ntalked about; that is, what we are doing to increase the number of \npeople whom we are going to have to have for primary care, for our \ncommunity health centers, for faculty members in the future. This is \nsomething we have ignored for\n\n[[Page S13127]]\n\nfar too long at our own peril. We can't forget that while we are \nexpanding coverage--and we are going to cover 94 percent of the \nAmerican people with this health care bill--while we will make it more \naffordable, while we are going to protect Medicare, while we are going \nto do all the things to really make our health system more affordable, \nmore quality-conscious, cover more people, make sure people can get in \nto their primary care first rather than go to an emergency room, we \ncan't forget that we need the faculty. We need teachers, and we need to \nhelp in debt repayment, loan repayments, by giving more scholarships to \nthese young people, the nurses, the nurses aides, the physical \ntherapists, the people who work with people with disabilities, doctors, \ndentists--the whole panoply of people involved in primary care. We have \nto help them get through school so they don't have a mountain of debt \non their heads, so they can practice medicine where they want, not \nwhere they are forced to go in order to pay back their debts.\n  Again, I thank Senator Murray on the HELP Committee, who did so much \nto put all of this into our bill. This is a major provision of the \nhealth care legislation we are not hearing debated about here on the \nfloor very much, but it is one of the most critical parts of the bill.\n  I thank Senator Baucus and all the work they did on the Finance \nCommittee to put in the tax provisions and others to help us, first, \ninvest in and grow the primary care workforce and also to make it \npossible for people to become faculty members and teachers by helping \nthem pay back their loans and their debts.\n  I wanted to take this time to highlight this part of the bill. It is \nnot talked about much, but I believe it is one of the most important \nparts of the health reform bill before us.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority has 13 minutes, and \nthe majority has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I am here to speak about this omnibus \nspending bill we will vote on today. It is more proof that Washington \nis out of control in its spending and that the leadership on the other \nside of the aisle is wanting to spend our children's money.\n  This is a $445 billion bill. I know my colleague from Arizona will \ntalk about the 5,000 earmarks in this bill costing $3.9 billion. It is \na 12-percent spending increase over last year, $46.7 billion more than \nthe bloated budget we passed in 2009, a 33-percent increase in State-\nForeign Operations, a 24-percent increase in Transportation and HUD. \nThese are unsustainable. We have a $12 trillion debt, a debt our \nchildren and our grandchildren will have to pay.\n  Here we are again with a 12-percent increase, and in a bill that is \nfull of earmarks--earmarks such as $700,000 for a shrimp fishing \nproject in Maryland, $30,000 for the Woodstock Film Festival youth \ninitiative. I am sure these are great programs, but when we have \n$12.001 trillion in debt, we can't afford these programs.\n  Mr. President, 2009 has been a record-setting year for debt. We had a \n$1.4 trillion budget deficit. Now in 2010, even though we are new in \nthe year, we are already running a $296 billion budget deficit. In \nOctober and November, we took in $268 billion in tax revenues. That is \na hard number to find around here because most people don't look at the \nmoney we take in. They can just spend whatever they want to. We took in \n$268 billion, but we spent $565 billion.\n  This is not how families make their decisions around their kitchen \ntables, where they have to make ends meet. This is not even how the \nStates do it, where they have balanced budget amendments. The spending \nin Washington is out of control, and the Members of this body should \nnot vote for this omnibus spending bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time to my colleague \nfrom Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand there will be debate until 2 \no'clock, and then a vote on the consolidated--consolidated--\nappropriations conference report. What does ``consolidated \nappropriations conference report'' mean? It means there are six bills, \nthree which were never considered on the floor of the Senate. That is \nwhat the Senate means by ``consolidated,'' my friends. So for three of \nthe bills, we were never allowed to debate, to amend, or accept, or \nreject.\n  They are now spending $450 billion, loaded up with 4,752 earmarks, \ntotaling $3.7 billion, 1,350 pages long, and of that 409 pages are \ndedicated to listing congressional porkbarrel spending.\n  I know most Americans are watching NFL football today and they \nprobably do not pay much attention to what we do on a Sunday afternoon \nhere on the floor of the Senate. But if they knew--if they knew what we \nare about to pass: a bill that has increased spending by 14 percent \nover last year's level, with the exception, of course, for our veterans \ncare, which is only increased by 5 percent.\n  Here we are with a $1.4 trillion--now a $1.5 trillion debt this year, \nan aggregate of over $12 trillion, unemployment at 10 percent, and \n900,000 families who lost their homes in 2008, and the numbers for 2009 \nwill be greater.\n  So what do we do here? We spend and spend and earmark and earmark. \nThe Consumer Price Index went down 1.3 percent, so we are going to \nincrease spending by 5 percent.\n  What could the American people do with the $3.7 billion in earmarks \nthat are in this bill? Let me tell you a few of them, and you will not \nbelieve it, and I am not making it up: $2.7 million to support surgical \noperations in outer space at the University of Nebraska.\n  I know Trekkies all over America will approve of that. I know Dr. \nLeonard McCoy--``Bones''--and even Dr. Spock and Captain Kirk will call \nthem all to the bridge and be happy to know that $2.7 million is going \nto go to Dr. Leonard McCoy and his friends to support surgical \noperations in outer space, while thousands of Americans are losing \ntheir homes.\n  Another one I have been unable to describe adequately without \nviolating the rules of the Senate: $655,000 for Cedars-Sinai Medical \nCenter, Los Angeles, CA, for equipment and supplies for the Institute \nfor Irritable Bowel Syndrome Research. The only thing I can say is, \nthat problem will not be reduced when people read this legislation, so \nthere may be a need for it.\n  So here we are. The list goes on and on. It is crazy stuff: $200,000 \nfor a visitors center in Bastrop, TX, population 5,340; $292,200 for \nelimination of slum and blight in Scranton, PA--the cast of ``The \nOffice'' is rejoicing--$200,000 for ``design and construction of the \nGarapan Public Market'' in the Northern Mariana Islands. The Woodstock \nFilm Festival Youth Initiative is going to get $30,000.\n  It is beyond imagination when you put it into the context that \nAmericans are suffering more than they have at anytime in their lives. \nThanks to the greed and avarice of Wall Street, Main Street is under \ntremendous duress. This is shameful.\n  I want to remind my colleagues, last March--not that long ago--the \nPresident of the United States signed another pork-laden omnibus bill. \nThe President of the United States said:\n\n       I am signing an imperfect omnibus bill because it is \n     necessary for the ongoing functions of government. But I also \n     view this as a departure point for more far-reaching change.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       The future demands that we operate in a different way than \n     we have in the past. So let there be no doubt: this piece of \n     legislation--\n\n  The one he was signing last March loaded with pork--\n\n     this piece of legislation must mark an end to the old way of \n     doing business, and the beginning of a new era of \n     responsibility and accountability that the American people \n     have every right to expect and to demand.\n\n  If the President of the United States is going to carry out those \nwords, he will veto this bill. He will veto this bill and send it back \nand tell them to get rid of this pork, tell them to get rid of it.\n\n[[Page S13128]]\n\n  So what is going to happen? In a few minutes--we all know what is \ngoing to happen in a few minutes--by a very large vote, the Senate of \nthe United States is going to vote in favor of this bill. There will \nbe, on this side of the aisle--the party of fiscal conservatives that \nlost the last two elections--one major reason being because we let \nspending get out of control--there will be Members on this side of the \naisle who will vote for this porkbarrel bill. On the other side of the \naisle, a majority over there--an overwhelming majority; all but maybe \none or two--will also vote for the bill. Then they will go home--if we \never get out of here--they will go home, and they will say: I am a \nfiscal conservative, and I am all for a commission to cut spending. \nLet's appoint a commission. Let's not take any responsibilities \nourselves. Let's appoint a commission, and that commission will \nrecommend how we can reduce spending.\n  If you want to reduce spending and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful \nspending, vote against this bill that increases spending over last year \nby some 14 percent. If you want to vote for it, fine, but isn't it a \nlittle hard, with a straight face, to go back and tell your \nconstituents you are for the elimination of this wasteful and \nporkbarrel and corrupting spending? It corrupts, my friends. It is a \ngateway drug to corruption. We have former Members of Congress in \nFederal prison because of this.\n  First, since it is going to be passed, I urge the President of the \nUnited States--I do not urge--I demand the President of the United \nStates to keep his word when he signed another porkbarrel-laden bill \nlast March, to veto this bill. I urge my colleagues--I urge my \ncolleagues--let's stand up against this for once: a bill that has $3.7 \nbillion in earmarks.\n  Immediately, colleagues remind us: Well, this is a legitimate \nearmark. This is important; that is important. The problem with it is, \nnobody ever saw it before. It never competed. Maybe we need to support \nsurgical operations in outer space. Do we need it at the University of \nNebraska? No. It is earmarked for the University of Nebraska.\n  By the way, I do not think, except for Trekkies, many Americans think \nwe need to spend $2.7 million to support surgical operations in outer \nspace.\n  All I can say is: Do not be surprised when the American people, less \nthan a year from now, next November, rise up and reject this kind of \nbehavior and practice of irresponsible spending, while they are hurting \nmore than they have ever been in their lives. They deserve better than \nwhat we are getting out of this legislative process, and they have \nevery right to demand something different.\n  Let's show some courage and vote against this bill, send it back to \nthe President, get rid of the porkbarrel spending, and send it back, \nand let us vote for it. We could do it immediately. I urge my \ncolleagues, look at this bill and vote against it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my top priority is jobs--to help those \nwho have one, keep it and to help those who don't have one, find one. \nThat is why I have always supported the automobile dealers in Maryland \nand across the country, which each employ on average about 50 people \nand are also economic pillars in large and small communities throughout \nthe United States. Dealers don't just provide jobs for people who sell \ncars they also provide them to people who service the cars and for \nmanagers and office workers who make dealerships run smoothly.\n  I have fought for the auto dealers in several ways over the past \nyear, first on the Recovery Act, where we passed tax incentives to help \nconsumers purchase new cars, and then again this summer when I worked \nwith my colleagues to pass cash for clunkers, which saved jobs in the \nauto industry, promoted energy efficiency, and helped the middle-class \nafford a car, which is most families' second largest purchase behind \ntheir home.\n  Dealers are not only critical to their local economies; they also \nmake the auto industry work by distributing, selling, and servicing the \ncars at practically no cost to the manufacturers. That is why I \ncosponsored S. 1304--to give car dealers a chance to contribute to our \neconomic recovery and to provide jobs as the domestic auto industry \nrestructures and retools.\n  Today, I am proud to support a provision in section 747 of the \nFinancial Services appropriations conference report that shows dealers \nthat Congress is on their side and on the side of creating and \nprotecting jobs as our economy struggles toward recovery.\n  This provision will give automobile dealers around the Nation a fair \nshot at getting back into business by setting up a neutral and fair \narbitration process. First, it requires that manufacturers make all \npertinent information available to dealers. I expect all parties to \nfully comply with this requirement and for all relevant information to \nbe made available in a transparent and easily understandable form to \ndealers and to the arbitrators.\n  Also, I support section 747 because it requires arbitrators to \nconsider all the relevant factors that affect whether a dealer is and \ncan be successful, and that demonstrate how dealers contribute to the \nviability of the manufacturing companies whose cars they sell. I also \nexpect and encourage arbitrators to consider the rights that dealers \nare guaranteed under all applicable Federal and State laws when making \ntheir decisions.\n  Our economy is struggling to recover because there aren't enough \njobs. Auto dealers are a major employer across the country, and they \nalso are essential to reviving a healthy American auto industry. As the \nAmerican auto industry looks to the future, we can't forget the \nessential role that dealers play, providing both thousands of jobs and \nalso the affordable cars and auto related services that American \nfamilies need.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for \nseveral of the initiatives in the State and Foreign Operations bill for \nfiscal year 2010, contained within the 2010 consolidated appropriations \nbill. Specifically, I want to highlight five specific areas that I view \nas critical to our national security: first, staffing resources for the \nForeign Services of the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, or USAID; second, the Civilian Stabilization \nInitiative and Complex Crises Fund; third, economic and security \nassistance to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq; fourth, public diplomacy \nand international broadcasting; and fifth, reducing carbon emission and \ncontributing to a global agreement on climate change. Our deepened \ninvestment and commitment to these issues are critical to maintaining \nAmerica's leadership and defending U.S. security interests globally.\n  As we face the reality of engaging in two wars in Afghanistan and \nIraq, it is essential that we recognize the civilian role in \ncounterinsurgency. A strong civilian presence is essential to building \ngovernance, promoting economic development, and providing essential \nservices to increase popular support for local governments facing \ninsurgencies. As Secretary Clinton has highlighted, U.S. national \nsecurity is about the three Ds--development, diplomacy, defense. If we \ninvest more in development, we may prevent future conflicts through the \ncritical work of civilians and avoid future burdens on our military.\n  Today, our Foreign Service officers at the Departments of State and \nUSAID are on the frontlines in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq and \naround the world in places like Lebanon, Indonesia, and Haiti. At the \nsame time, our military often ends up responding to crises because \ncivilian agencies do not have the staff or the funding to do so as \nquickly, robustly, or efficiently. This is a trend we must seek to \nreverse, ensuring that all U.S. personnel--military and civilian--have \nthe tools they need to succeed in increasingly difficult missions \nglobally.\n  Today, there are more musicians in our military bands than diplomats \nin the State Department, which total less than 7,000. A report last \nyear by the American Academy of Diplomacy documented the need for \nnearly 3,000 additional State Department and more than 1,000 additional \nUSAID foreign service officers by fiscal year 2014. And this assessment \nwas done before our increasing civilian needs in Afghanistan became \nclear.\n  I am encouraged that this bill begins to address this critical issue \nby providing for 745 new State Department\n\n[[Page S13129]]\n\nofficers and 300 new officers at USAID. And as the requirements \ncontinue to grow, we must continue to build the size of the Foreign \nService to meet increased needs globally. Finally, as more civilians \nserve in dangerous areas and warzones, they deserve our full support \nand gratitude for their service and sacrifice, especially the time \nthese posts require away from their families.\n  The second area of the bill I would like to highlight is the Civilian \nStabilization Initiative, which is led by the Office of the Coordinator \nfor Reconstruction and Stabilization, or S/CRS, at the Department of \nState, in close cooperation with USAID and with the contribution of \nseveral other Federal agencies. S/CRS's mission is to enhance our \ninstitutional capacity to respond to crises involving failing, failed, \nand postconflict states and complex emergencies. S/CRS it tasked with \nleading and coordinating U.S. civilian efforts across the interagency \nto help stabilize and reconstruct societies in transition from conflict \nso they can reach a sustainable path toward peace, democracy, and a \nmarket economy.\n  I also welcome the funding component of this mission with the \ncreation of a $50 million Complex Crises Fund for USAID to prevent and \nrespond quickly to emerging or unforeseen complex crises, in \ncoordination with the Departments of State and Defense. It is my hope \nthat we can continue to increase this funding through civilian \naccounts, especially as we phase out section 1207 funding in defense \nappropriations. The more robust our civilian agencies, the less burden \nwe will impose on our already overstretched military.\n  The third program I would like to address is our foreign assistance \nbudget in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. This funding will help \naddress some of our most critical foreign policy challenges and global \nsecurity priorities. More girls will be in school, more families will \nhave access to health care and other essential services, and more \ncommunities will thrive thanks to the more than $2.6 billion for \nAfghanistan, more than $1.4 billion in Pakistan, and $467 million in \nIraq. These are critical investments in the economic infrastructure and \ndevelopment of these countries and in the long-term security of the \nUnited States.\n  The fourth program I want to highlight is public diplomacy, \nspecifically, U.S. international broadcasting and the work of the \nBroadcasting Board of Governors, BBG, which provides credible news \nprograms and serves as an example of a free press worldwide. The bill \nwe will soon vote on contains just under $734 million allocated for \ninternational broadcasting operations. The more we can do to fund \nprograms like the BBG, the better we will be able to compete with the \nforces of disinformation.\n  U.S. international broadcasting began during the early years of World \nWar II, when Voice of America broadcast into areas formerly under Nazi \noccupation. The programs began by saying ``daily at this time, we shall \nspeak to you about America and the war. The news may be good or bad. We \nshall tell you the truth.''\n  This tradition of journalistic integrity has continued to this day, \nas the BBG's entities--consisting of Voice of America, Radio Free \nEurope/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Radio and TV Marti, and the \nMiddle East Broadcasting Network--broadcast in 60 languages to an \nestimated weekly audience of 175 million people globally.\n  In the Foreign Relations Committee this October, Senator Boxer was \ngracious in allowing me to chair a hearing in her subcommittee to \nexamine the BBG's work in Afghanistan and Iraq. In both countries, the \nBBG has created sources of credible news and information readily \naccessible to the local population, in some cases for the first time in \ntheir history. In this sense, the role of broadcasting in war zones is \nparticularly critical because it creates channels of communication with \nand among the population, which plays a role in winning hearts and \nminds. This is why it is critical to continue to fund objective, \nreliable broadcasting.\n  While U.S. international broadcasting is essential to make sure facts \nare available worldwide via television and radio, the Internet and \nmobile networks are the medium of the future. And in repressive \nsocieties where there is no access to a free press, populations use the \nInternet and cell phones to evade government censorship. This year, we \nsaw such examples dramatically played out--when the Uighurs of western \nChina began protesting a brutal government crackdown and when \ndemonstrators in Iran protested after the June presidential election.\n  In both cases, blogs, short-message services, and social networking \nsites were heavily utilized, and popular movements sought to evade \nstate censorship with proxy sites and other technology. That is why, in \nthe case of Iran, I introduced the Victims of Iranian Censorship, or \nVOICE Act with Senators McCain, Lieberman, Casey, and Graham. This \nbill, which was signed into law with the Defense authorization bill in \nOctober, authorized funds to continue the development online censorship \nevasion technology. I am pleased that $30 million in this omnibus has \nbeen appropriated for the Internet Access and Freedom Account, so that \nsuch programs can be expanded, with a particular focus on Iran and \nChina.\n  Finally, one of the most pressing issues we are facing is climate \nchange. As we speak, representatives from more than 190 countries have \ngathered in Copenhagen to find common ground on averting the worst \nconsequences of our changing climate and adapting to the changes we \nhave already inflicted on the globe.\n  This will be the subject of much discussion on this floor in the \ncoming months. Today, I want to acknowledge that this bill takes bold \nand tremendously important steps toward creating a better and safer \nclimate. More than $1.2 billion are intended to help us face the \nthreats of climate change, from contributions to multilateral funds \nthat will bend the curve toward clean development around the world to \nassistance to the people most vulnerable to rising sea levels and \nchanging rainfall patterns.\n  Mr. President, there are many provisions in this bill to be \napplauded, but I believe these five areas demonstrate significant \ninvestments in our national security. I look forward to casting my vote \nin favor of this bill, which I believe supports a stronger and better \nresourced American foreign policy.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I will cast my vote against H.R. \n3288, the six-bill appropriations omnibus. This bloated package \nincludes the following spending bills: Military Construction/Veterans \nAffairs, VA; State, Foreign Operations; Commerce, Justice and Science; \nFinancial Services; Transportation, Housing and Urban Development; and \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education.\n  I will vote against this $\\1/2\\ trillion package because it spends \n$50 billion more in taxpayer money than last year--a 12 percent \nincrease. When unemployment stands at 10 percent--and higher than that \nacross Kentucky--and families are struggling to make ends meet, the \nFederal Government should not be burdening its citizens with more debt. \nCongress must be a better steward of public funds. Moreover, the bill \nincludes a number of policy riders, such as spending taxpayer dollars \non abortions, that undercut the culture of life that our government \nshould be promoting.\n  My opposition to the omnibus as a whole comes despite the fact there \nare several portions of this sprawling package that I would like to \nvote for. For example, I support much of the Military Construction/VA \nbill. I voted for it as a freestanding measure when the Senate passed \nits version a few weeks ago. And the measure carries a number of \nprovisions that are important to Kentuckians, such as enhanced funding \nof chemical demilitarization efforts at the Blue Grass Army Depot, \nadded monies for the soldiers and their families at Fort Campbell, and \na provision honoring Kentucky veteran Robley Rex. The Military \nConstruction/VA bill also includes a number of important national \npriorities that I support such as modernizing troop housing, expanding \nmortgage relief for the men and women in uniform, enhancing rural \nhealth care for our veterans, improving family housing for our \nsoldiers, bolstering mental health care for returning combat veterans, \naiding homeless veterans, and strengthening the ability of the VA to \nprocess claims more quickly. Were the Military Construction/VA measure \na freestanding bill, I would vote for it.\n\n[[Page S13130]]\n\n  Aside from the Military Construction/VA portion of the omnibus, I \nalso regret I cannot register my support for certain parts of the \nState, Foreign Operations appropriations bill. I favor a number of \nprovisions in the latter bill including funding for Israel, support for \nour allies in the war on terror and monies for Burmese refugees.\n  Finally, there are segments of the other four bills in this package \nthat reflect Kentucky priorities that were included at my request and \nthat I am supportive of.\n  In closing, it is unfortunate that the majority continues to avoid \nregular order. I am hopeful that the majority's effort in this regard \ndoes not presage further legislative shortcuts on matters of national \nimportance.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Time will be charged equally.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be divided equally and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold that.\n  Mr. BENNET. I will.\n\n\n                          Arbitration Process\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the \nchairman of the Financial Services and General Government \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Durbin, as manager of the \nFinancial Services Subcommittee section of the bill before the Senate, \nlanguage included in the bill that creates a binding arbitration \nprocess for auto dealers associated with General Motors and Chrysler \nwhose contracts were terminated as part of the manufacturers' \nrestructuring efforts this year.\n  The difficult decisions made during the last year have highlighted \nthe interconnectedness of the industry and have shown the impact that \nthese companies have in every State in the country. I particularly \nunderstand how difficult this situation has been for Michigan auto \ndealers. My father and grandfather ran the Oldsmobile dealership in \nClare, MI, where I grew up. My very first job was washing cars on that \nlot.\n  Thousands of employees, either directly employed by the companies or \nthrough the thousands of dealerships and suppliers, depend on the \nviability of the auto manufacturers. Without the manufacturers, there \nis no dealer network, and small businesses across the country would \nclose, adding more devastating job losses as our economy is trying to \nrecover. What we do here must continue to ensure a healthy future for \nthe auto companies as they work towards a profitable future. When \nnegotiating an agreement for arbitration was it the Chairman's intent \nthat the dealers entitled to this arbitration process would only be the \ndealers that were terminated as a result of the bankruptcy?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, it is my understanding that the only dealerships \nentitled to arbitration are those dealerships that were terminated as a \nresult of the manufacturers' bankruptcy, rather than those that may \nhave closed for other business reasons.\n  Ms. STABENOW. The statutory language for the arbitration process \nprovides criteria that will be used to review each case. Is it the \nChairman's goal that by considering the economic interest of the public \nat large the arbitrator should focus on maximizing the return of \ntaxpayer dollars that have been invested in the company?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, the economic interest of the public at large must be \nconsidered to ensure that the investments will be recovered as quickly \nas possible.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Additionally, when reviewing the cases, does the \nstatutory language ensure arbitrators take into consideration the \nstability and protection of the existing dealer network?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, the statutory language will allow arbitrators to \nreview the potential impact of reinstating a dealership on the existing \ndealer network for the covered manufacturer, as well as on any dealer \nretained by the covered manufacturer in a given market territory.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chairman for these clarifications and for \nhis ongoing efforts to ensure a fair process for all stakeholders as \nthe auto industry continues to restructure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the chairman \nof the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Durbin, as manager of the Financial Services \nSubcommittee section of the bill before the Senate, two aspects of the \nprovision included in that bill that establishes an arbitration process \nfor review of decisions made by Chrysler and GM to terminate or wind \ndown auto dealerships earlier this year. Under the process laid out in \nthis provision, an arbitrator is to balance the economic interests of \nthe covered dealership, the covered manufacturer, and the public at \nlarge by considering a number of factors. Those factors include the \ncovered dealership's profitability, the covered manufacturer's overall \nbusiness plan, the covered dealership's satisfaction of the performance \nobjectives of the franchise agreement, and the covered dealership's \nperformance in relation to the criteria used to terminate the \ndealership.\n  Is it the chairman's understanding that in looking at these factors, \nand in particular in looking at the dealership's profitability and the \nmanufacturer's overall business plan, that the arbitrator will consider \nthe profitability of the dealership with respect to the new vehicles \nsales of the covered manufacturer?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, that is my understanding. In making decisions about \nthe makeup of the dealership network, profitability in terms of new \nvehicles sales for that manufacturer is what is critically important to \nthe long-term financial health of the manufacturer. That manufacturer's \nlong-term health is also vitally important to the Federal Government \nbecause of the significant taxpayer investment in these companies.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman for his assurances and his \nclarification.\n  I would also like to raise a question about the arbitration process \nestablished in this bill. The statutory language could be interpreted \nto allow for potentially as many as hundreds or thousands of \narbitrators each involved in individual reviews of dealership \ndecisions. I am concerned that a very large number of arbitrators would \nbe unduly burdensome and impractical to the point of being unworkable. \nThe statutory language requires that arbitrations be conducted in the \nState where the covered dealerships are located. It is my hope that the \narbitration process could be managed in a given State so that there \nwould be one arbitrator or a small manageable panel of arbitrators \nwithin any given State. Does the chairman believe that the statutory \nlanguage would allow for management of arbitration in this way?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, the statutory language would allow for that. The \nprimary intent of this provision is to ensure that covered dealerships \nhave a fair and impartial review of the termination decision. I agree \nwith the Senator from Michigan that we should try to avoid a situation \nwhere there would be hundreds or even thousands of individual \narbitrators.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to highlight several provisions of \nthe legislation now before us that I believe will provide important \nbenefits to Michigan and the Nation, and one that I think does not \nserve the Nation's interests.\n  The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010 contains provisions that \nwill improve our health care system, ensure that contracting dollars do \nnot flow to companies avoiding income taxes by incorporating overseas, \nimprove Federal oversight of our financial system, and improve \neducational opportunity for our citizens.\n  I am especially pleased to see an increase in funding for health \ninformation technology, HIT. This bill will provide $61 million to the \nOffice of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. \nThese funds will help increase administrative efficiency and move our \ncurrent system away from paper-based organization. This will help \nensure that doctors and patients have the necessary information easily \naccessible when working together to make important health care \ndecisions and ensure that health records of individuals remain \nconfidential. Improving the interoperability of our HIT systems will \nnot only enhance the quality of care, experts believe that improved HIT \nwill reduce health care costs for all Americans, streamlining\n\n[[Page S13131]]\n\nbilling practices and reducing administrative costs that waste so many \nbillions of dollars.\n  I strongly support the bill's language continuing the prohibition on \nFederal contracts with ``inverted'' corporations. Corporate \ninversions--the practice of incorporating some or all of a U.S.-based \ncompany's businesses overseas--are transparent tax-avoidance schemes. \nThere is no reason we should provide taxpayer dollars to firms that \ndodge their tax obligations, and I am pleased that we will continue to \nbar such companies from Federal contracting unless doing so would \ndamage national security.\n  The bill also includes an increase of $151 million in funding for the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission. This increased funding will support \nenhanced enforcement, capital market oversight, and investor protection \nactivities, including investigations of accounting fraud, market \nmanipulation, insider trading, and investment scams that target seniors \nand low-income communities. This is a wise investment in protecting our \ncitizens and our economy from those who seek to profit by fraud or from \ntaking excessive risks that endanger the financial system.\n  Also included are a number of important education provisions. The \nlegislation would increase the maximum Pell grant award by $200, to \n$5,500; provide funding for disadvantaged, disabled and first-\ngeneration college students; and restore $1.5 billion in title I \nfunding for disadvantaged public school students. Of particular \nimportance is $11.5 billion in funding for Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act programs, which marks a historic Federal \ncommitment to education of those with disabilities.\n  There are also important measures that will help boost Michigan's \neconomy and its future. I am pleased that this bill includes $1 million \nI requested for the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and \nUnderwater Preserve in Alpena. Part of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration's sanctuary system, the Thunder Bay \nSanctuary protects well-preserved shipwrecks that are a valuable piece \nof Michigan's history and our Nation's. The funding provided in this \nbill will allow for expansion of the Great Lakes Maritime Heritage \nCenter to include a Science Hall and other facilities that will allow \nmore people to explore and learn about Michigan's maritime history.\n  The bill also includes important language that will bring the \nWoodward Avenue Light Rail Project closer to reality, an important \neconomic development project in the heart of metropolitan Detroit. The \nconferees retained language regarding the Woodward Avenue project \nsimilar to language I authored for the Senate bill.\n  These all are important provisions worthy of support. But I am \ndisappointed that the legislation includes a provision requiring \nGeneral Motors and Chrysler to submit to binding, third-party \narbitration in disputes with auto dealerships closed as part of those \ncompanies' restructuring efforts.\n  There is widespread agreement among auto industry analysts that GM \nand Chrysler needed to consolidate their dealer structure in order to \ncompete. The Federal Government has made a substantial--and wise--\ninvestment in these companies, which are key components of our \nmanufacturing sector. Submitting to arbitration of decisions already \napproved in bankruptcy court risks hampering the recoveries these \ncompanies and their workers are fighting so hard to achieve. My vote in \nfavor of this act follows reassurances I received from the chairman of \nthe Financial Services and General Government Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Durbin, in response to my concerns about a number \nof provisions in the arbitration language.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be divided equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. \nDorgan), the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley), and the Senator from \nWashington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Bond), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. \nInhofe), and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICE.

Mr. President, we have been trying for days to get an \nagreement to have votes on the health care measure, which our friends \non the other side have said is so important to the American people and \nmust be acted upon before Christmas. Specifically, the pending Crapo \namendment has been there since last Tuesday. It now becomes clear to me \nthe majority simply does not want to have any more votes, presumably \npending these discussions that are going on behind closed doors on a \nbill that almost nobody in the Senate has seen.\n\n[[Page S13132]]\n\n  Therefore, I send a cloture motion to the desk on the Crapo \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I hope we can bring to fruition a \nconsent agreement to allow us to begin to vote. Yesterday, against \nconsiderable opposition on my own side, I basically backed down and \noffered the consent agreement the majority leader had offered a few \ndays ago, which would have allowed our Democratic friends to have a \nside-by-side with their own amendment on the issue of drug \nreimportation and a side-by-side with Senator Crapo's amendment on \ntaxes. The majority objected, essentially, to the consent that they had \npreviously offered a few days before.\n  I hope we can get back on track. The commitment was made by the \nmajority at the beginning of this debate that we would have plenty of \namendments. We had a process where we went from one side to the other, \nback and forth, smoothly. Either side was able to offer side-by-side \namendments if they chose to. I think it is not fair to the American \npeople--not fair to the American people to deny them the opportunity to \nhave votes on what has been called the most important issue of our era, \nso important it has to be done before Christmas.\n  In the meantime, they are in some secret meeting, trying to come up \nwith a bill that not only not all Senators have seen, not even \nDemocratic Senators, but the American people have not seen it. We know \nwhat the core of the bill is. There are amendments the American people \nwould like to see us debate and vote on and that is why I filed cloture \non the Crapo amendment. Hopefully, we will not have to have that \ncloture vote, we can get back on track, as we were until things began \nto bog down midweek.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois, the majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the majority side offered a unanimous \nconsent, I believe on three successive days, to the Republican side, \nwhich they did not accept. Then yesterday the minority leader offered a \nvariation on that, which is being considered at this moment by the \nmajority leader. We are not prepared--I am not prepared to make a \nstatement until the majority leader has made a final decision, having \ntalked over the new offer with our members. The time may come. I cannot \npredict whether it will.\n  I do believe we have to work on it some more. In the meantime, I \nthink the floor should be open for comments. I ask unanimous consent \nthe Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/13/senate-section/article/S13132-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, given the season, maybe we should spend a \nlittle time talking about what Americans are wishing for Christmas. I \ndon't think very many people in the Chamber have had much chance to go \ndo their Christmas shopping. At least maybe we can consider what folks \nare telling us they would like to have. We have certainly heard it. \nThey want jobs. They want the economy to improve. They want meaningful \nhealth care reform that will drive down costs and increase their access \nand avoid harming a full economic recovery. What they don't want is to \nbe burdened with a litany of new taxes. Unfortunately, the health care \nbill we have been debating is layered with new tax after new tax.\n  What I hope is that the majority will eventually agree to considering \nmore amendments, including, for example, amendments such as the \nHutchison-Thune amendment which will limit the taxes in this bill, \ntaxes that will hit families, seniors, the chronically ill, small \nbusinesses, those who use flexible spending accounts, and those, for \nexample, who use medical devices. In total, there are 12 new taxes in \nthis bill, many of which will take effect right after the bill passes, \nthough the other components will not go into effect until 2014. The \nInternal Revenue Service estimates it would need between $5 and $10 \nbillion over the next 10 years to oversee collection of these new \ntaxes.\n  Americans know their taxes are going up if this bill passes. In fact, \n85 percent believe that will happen, according to a new CNN poll. They \nare right. Surely that helps to account for the fact that a full 61 \npercent disapprove of the bill, according to that same poll, with just \n36 percent supporting it. Think of that, a CNN poll, brand new, 61 \npercent of the American people oppose the bill, only 36 percent support \nit. Every week, the numbers get worse.\n  I spoke recently about the adverse impact of a new payroll tax on job \ncreation, especially for small businesses. Today, I want to talk about \nhow three additional taxes would hurt Americans: one, the new tax on \nthe chronically ill; two, a new tax on flexible spending accounts; \nthree, a new tax on medical devices.\n  First, let's talk about the chronically ill. These are the sickest \nAmericans, the chronically ill and seniors who tend to have more \nmedical problems. These folks would be hurt by a change in the Tax Code \nthat actually raises the amount of money they owe the Federal \nGovernment every year.\n  Here is how it works. Currently, taxpayers can deduct the costs of \ntheir catastrophic medical expenses if those expenses exceed 7.5 \npercent of their income. The bill would raise that threshold to 10 \npercent. So people, especially seniors and the chronically ill, would \nhave to spend a lot more of their own money on these kinds of expenses \nbefore they could begin to take advantage of a tax deduction.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation says this change would cost taxpayers \nmore than $15 billion over the next 10 years. We are talking about a \nlot of money. It would raise taxes on 5.8 million taxpayers, 87 percent \nof whom earn under $100,000 a year. So we are not talking about, for \nthe most part, the wealthy. In fact, because of this problem, the \nNelson amendment was adopted in the Finance Committee that would at \nleast exempt seniors until the year 2016. Obviously, it isn't only \nseniors who pay the tax. Secondly, we don't want to impose it on them \nafter 2016 either.\n  According to the CRS:\n\n       The deduction can ease the financial burden imposed by \n     costly medical expenses. For the most part, the federal tax \n     code regards these expenses as involuntary expenses that \n     reduce a taxpayer's ability to pay taxes by absorbing a \n     substantial part of income.\n\n\n[[Page S13133]]\n\n\n  That is certainly true. Many people rely on this deduction to offset \nexpenses beyond their control.\n  Under the Democratic bill, 5.8 million of the sickest Americans would \nget a bigger tax bill from Uncle Sam. That is not reform.\n  The second new tax is on flexible spending accounts. Many Americans \nwith these flexible spending accounts would see a tax increase under \nthe bill. How does that work? Under current law, employees can make a \ntax-free contribution to a flexible spending account in order to pay \nout-of-pocket expenses for medically necessary goods and services, \nthings such as diabetes testing supplies, orthodontia bills for braces \nand tooth repair, to name a few. Right now, there is no limit on these \ncontributions to the FSA. Most employers who offer the FSA peg it at \nabout $5,000. The bill would cut that in half and limit by law the \namount the employers could contribute to $2,500. Why? That means \nfamilies would pay taxes on medical expenses in excess of that amount. \nThat is the reason. They need more revenue under the bill. This is a \nvery clever backdoor way to get it, limit the amount the employer can \ncontribute to your FSA, so you end up having to pay more taxes on \nthings that are important to your health care and that of your family.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this provision would cost \ntaxpayers $15 billion over 10 years or, to put it another way, it is \none of the ways they raise revenues in the bill to pay for the high \ncost of the legislation, another $15 billion.\n  Who would be affected by this increase? The Employers Council on \nFlexible Compensation estimates that the median income for the 35 \nmillion Americans holding FSAs is $55,000. That is the median income--\nhalf are above, half are below. Think about that. Half the people who \nwould be impacted by this make less than $55,000 a year. Many middle-\nincome families will lose money on medical expenses because of this \nprovision.\n  Finally, the medical device tax. The Democratic bill imposes an \nannual nondeductible tax on medical device makers that would cost $20 \nbillion over 10 years. The reason for this, again, is to generate \nrevenues to pay for the high cost of the bill; otherwise, why would you \ntax something that can be a lifesaver for people? I have said before \nthat I could see, I suppose, taxing liquor or tobacco, but why would \nyou tax this? This helps save lives. Thousands of products--\nwheelchairs, surgical equipment, contact lenses, stethoscopes, hospital \nbeds, artificial heart valves, diabetes testing equipment--all of these \nare the kinds of medical devices targeted by this tax. It will even hit \ncutting-edge technologies such as CT scanners. Why would we do this?\n  American taxpayers are the ones who will foot the bill for the tax \nbecause, according to the CBO, the medical device tax ``would increase \ncosts for the affected firms which would be passed on to purchasers and \nwould ultimately raise insurance premiums by a corresponding amount.''\n\n  Congress taxes a device manufacturer. They pass the tax on to the \ncost of the item that takes care of the individual. And since the \ninsurance companies usually have to pay for that, their premiums go up \nto reflect the increased costs--another reason why, under this bill, \ninsurance premiums don't go down, they go up. This tax means increased \ncosts for health insurers, which in turn pass it on to patients in the \nform of higher premiums. This would go into effect immediately, even \nthough subsidies for government-mandated insurance are not available \nuntil 2014. The net impact would be an $8 billion increase in patient \npremiums in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, before any of the subsidies in \nthe bill take effect. Is this really what we want--to drive up patient \npremiums with new taxes? We know those are not the kinds of reforms \nAmericans are asking for.\n  To reiterate, the taxes I have discussed include a tax increase on \nthe chronically ill and seniors, a tax increase on holders of flexible \nspending accounts, mainly middle-income families, and a tax on medical \ndevices that would drive up insurance premiums.\n  Many of the 12 total taxes would take effect immediately even though \nthe rest of the bill wouldn't take effect until the year 2014. That is \npart of the budget gimmickry used to pay for this Federal leviathan. \nYour taxes go up in 2010 but nothing to show for it until 2014. That is \nwhy the Democrats claim to have a budget-neutral bill that comes in at \nless than $1 trillion. Washington will be sitting on a pile of money 4 \nyears in advance of full implementation of the bill. But when you take \na look at the true 10-year cost beginning in 2014, the price tag is an \nastounding $2.5 trillion, a figure confirmed by the chairman of the \nFinance Committee.\n  Because I disapprove of these budget gimmicks and the imposition of \nthese taxes, I support the Hutchison-Thune amendment, an amendment \nwhich says that new taxes will not be enacted until the rest of the \nbill is.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues not to object to voting on the \npending amendments and to take up additional amendments such as the \nSnowe amendment, which will come later, and the Hutchison-Thune \namendment, which would at least address the problems I have discussed. \nThe American people don't want a slew of new taxes for Christmas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this would be the perfect moment for me to \nsay to those who are following this debate: That is the critique of the \nSenator from Arizona of the Democratic bill. I would like to offer a \ncritique of the Republican plan for health care reform, but I can't do \nthat. It is impossible because it doesn't exist.\n  This bill, 2,075 pages, has been worked on for a year. It is not \neasy. It is complex. We have prepared a bill and brought it before the \nSenate. The Republican side of the aisle has had the same year and has \nproduced nothing.\n  I am sorry, that is not true. They have produced press releases and \nspeeches and charts and a handful of bills which attack sections of \nthis bill. But they have not produced a bill that has been cleared by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, as this one has; that will reduce the \ndeficit; that will, in fact, reduce health care premiums for the vast \nmajority of Americans, at least the growth in premiums. They haven't \nproduced a bill that will mean 30 million more Americans will have \nhealth insurance. They haven't produced a bill that is going to finally \ngive consumers a fighting chance against health insurance companies. \nThey haven't done it. They have produced speeches and press releases. \nThat is where we are today, after 1 full year.\n  Obviously, the other side of the aisle is happy with the current \nsystem of health care and doesn't want to change it. If they did, they \nwould offer a comprehensive health care reform bill. They failed to do \nthat. They have come before us and said: We have a lot of our own \nbills. We call them Republican bills. Not any of those bills have been \nsubjected to the kind of scrutiny this bill has been subjected to by \nthe Congressional Budget Office. They may have good ideas. I can't say \nthat they do or don't. But by and large, they are just taking potshots \nat this bill because they don't have a bill.\n  You listen to the Senator from Arizona. He talks about taxes. He \nfails to mention one or two critically important things.\n  First, this bill has $441 billion in tax cuts in the first 10 years \nfor average people trying to pay their health insurance premiums. I \ndon't know if the Senator from Arizona thinks that is a good idea or \nnot. He has never spoken to that, at least that I have heard. I think \nit is a good idea. If you are making less than $80,000 a year, we want \nto make sure you have insurance, and this bill wants to make sure we \ngive you a helping hand. It is a tax cut.\n  Secondly, this bill provides tax relief for small businesses with \nfewer than 25 employees. Those are ``mom and pop'' small businesses, \nwhere they find it hard to buy insurance, and it is expensive when they \nfind it. This bill gives a tax break to those businesses. So when the \nSenator comes up and speaks about this little tax and that little tax, \nhe fails to step back and look at the big picture. The big picture is \nthis bill changes health care in a positive way. It keeps the good \nthings we have in America's health care system, but it changes some of \nthe things that need to be changed.\n\n  This bill makes health insurance more affordable, and that is \nsomething every American wants. I have yet to hear a proposal from the \nother side of\n\n[[Page S13134]]\n\nthe aisle which does that--certainly nothing that has been subject to \nthe scrutiny of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  This bill also expands health insurance to 94 percent of the American \npopulation. That is an all-time high. We have never had that many \npeople insured in America.\n  The Senator from Arizona just talked about a tax on medical devices. \nWhy would industries such as the hospital industry or the medical \ndevice industry or the pharmaceutical industry agree to pay more money \nto the government as part of this? For one very simple and fundamental \nreason: 30 million more Americans will have health insurance. They will \nbe using more medical devices and paying for them with their insurance \npolicies. They will be using more pharmaceuticals. More hospitals will \nget paid instead of relying on charity care.\n  So many of these providers have stepped up to us and said: If the \ngoal is to expand the base of people insured paying into the system, \nour industry, which provides medical services, medical devices, and \nthat sort of thing, is willing to participate, to come up with the \nmoney to make this work. That is the part the Senator from Arizona did \nnot make a note of, and he should have. It is a very critical and \nimportant part of this.\n  So I would say that although none of us like to see taxes increased, \nif at the end of the day we believe our health insurance premiums will \ncome down, that more Americans are going to have the peace of mind of \nhealth insurance; if they believe at the end of the day there will be \nmore people insured and paying for more services, you can understand \nwhy the health care industry is participating in this conversation \nabout this bill.\n  As for the tax cuts, for those making $80,000 a year or less, I think \nit is a good idea. It is one of the biggest tax cut packages we have \nhad, and we pay for it.\n  This bill will generate a surplus in the Treasury in the first 10 \nyears of $130 billion, in the second 10 years of another $650 billion. \nIt is the biggest deficit-reduction bill ever considered on the floor \nof the Senate, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and the \nRepublicans have nothing to offer which comes even close to that.\n  This is a rare Sunday session. The rest of the day will be spent with \nspeeches like this on the Senate floor about this issue. But I can tell \nyou, we have never considered one more important. This is an issue \nwhich touches every American, every American family, and every American \nbusiness. We have worked long and hard to bring this to the floor. I \nknow it is not perfect; no bill ever is. But it is a good-faith effort \nthat has gone through the scrutiny of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  For the critics on the other side--and there are many--my first \nquestion to each and every one of them is, Where is your comprehensive \nhealth care reform plan? Where is a plan that has gone through the \nscrutiny and review that this plan has gone through? The answer is, it \ndoes not exist.\n  So I welcome their critique, but I understand it is a critique \nwithout an alternative.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa be recognized for 20 minutes, and that \nI be recognized at the conclusion of his remarks for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is still on \nthe Senate floor. Last week, I pointed out the plans that Republicans \nhave introduced right here. The only way the Senator from Illinois can \nhave an out is he was cute--he was cute--in modifying it, that it has \nnot been scored by the Congressional Budget Office. But here is the \nfact on what the Congressional Budget Office can do and not do.\n  They were busy since May with the Senate health bill, getting it \nscored. They were busy working with us in the Group of 6 to try to get \na bipartisan bill scored. Since October 2 until now, they have been \nworking with the Senate leader full time to score everything they have \nhad a chance to put out.\n  So I do not want anybody listening around the country to think \nRepublicans do not have alternatives to what is being offered. But the \nonly thing he can say is: They do not have a plan that has been scored. \nBut we have plans, and if they went to hire more help in the \nCongressional Budget Office, we will get them scored.\n  Mr. President, I rise for the sake of the 50 States in the United \nStates today because in this 2,074-page bill is a massive budget burden \nfor every 1 of the 50 States--or maybe I better say for almost all of \nthe 50 States--because of the expansion of Medicaid. I am talking about \nMedicaid, a Federal-State program. I am not talking about Medicare, a \ntotally Federal program.\n  If this bill becomes law, the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nby the year 2019, 54 million nonelderly, nondisabled Americans will be \nlocked into Medicaid. Now, there is a very important word I want to \nemphasize--``locked''--because with these additional people in \nMedicaid, they will not have any choice. Medicaid is the only place to \nget their health care, where a lot of other people will have choices \nunder what we call the exchange.\n  So let me say it another way. I say they are locked in because this \nbill does not allow Americans with incomes below 133 percent of the \nFederal poverty level to get tax credits like most other Americans who \nare not below 133 percent of the Federal poverty level in a subsidy \nthat comes through the exchange.\n  Mr. President, 54 million Americans will be locked into a program--\nand this is where we get back to the States--that the 50 States cannot \nafford. We are not being honest with ourselves or our constituents or \nthe people who will depend on the safety net if we try to argue that \nStates can fund their share of this massive expansion.\n  Medicaid, as I said, is a Federal-State partnership, probably about \n43 years old. The Federal Government pays for, on average, 57 percent \nof the cost of Medicaid. So, on average, States pay about 43 percent of \nthe program, and the States administer the program.\n  In my State of Iowa, that division would be about 68 percent coming \nfrom the Federal Government, 32 percent the taxpayers of Iowa pay for.\n  To describe Medicaid's financial situation as fragile would be an \nunderstatement. Earlier this year, Congress voted to provide States an \nadditional $87 billion to prevent States from drastically cutting back \ntheir program. That is $87 billion out of the $787 billion stimulus \nbill.\n  When we were considering that bill, the Government Accountability \nOffice made it clear to us that States were in crisis. Every day you \nread about States being in crisis--budget crisis. The Government \nAccountability Office models predicted that State spending will grow \nfaster than State revenues for at least the next 10 years. So here is \nthe warning the Government Accountability Office has provided to those \nof us in Congress:\n\n       Since most state and local governments are required to \n     balance their operating budgets, the declining fiscal \n     conditions shown in our simulations suggest that, without \n     intervention, these governments would need to make \n     substantial policy changes to avoid growing fiscal \n     imbalances.\n\n  The State fiscal situation has not improved in the months since the \nGovernment Accountability Office report.\n  Now, let's go to the National Governors Association. They published a \nreport recently entitled, ``The State Fiscal Situation; The Lost \nDecade.'' In this report, the Nation's Governors portray a bleak \npicture of State finances. Their report highlights the situation with \nState revenues and the economic situation. Their report notes:\n\n       The recent economic downturn started in December 2007 and \n     likely ended in August or September 2009, making it one of \n     the deepest and longest since the Great Depression.\n\n  State revenues are not likely to rebound until the years 2014 or \n2015. States will continue to have to finance retiree pensions, as they \nwait for this rebound. The National Governors Association's conclusion \nis, obviously, a somber one. Their report goes on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S13135]]\n\n\n       The bottom line is that states will continue to struggle \n     over the next decade because of the combination of the length \n     and depth of this economic downturn and the projected slow \n     recovery. Even after states begin to see the light, they will \n     face the ``over-hang'' of unmet needs accumulated during the \n     downturn.\n\n  Meaning the recent recession.\n  The report continues:\n\n       The fact is that the biggest impact on states is the one to \n     two years after the recession is over. With states having \n     entered the recession in 2008, revenue shortfalls persisting \n     into 2014 and a need to backfill deferred investments into \n     core state functions, it will take states nearly a decade to \n     fully emerge from the current recession.\n\n  Here we have the National Association of State Budget Officers, from \na December 2009 fiscal report about the terrible position States are in \nright now, even without loading them down with the additional burden \nthat is going to come through Medicaid expansion in this 2,074-page \nbill. Quoting from the National Association of State Budget Officers:\n\n       States are currently facing one of the worst, if not the \n     worst, fiscal periods since the Great Depression.\n\n  You see that quote behind me, as shown on that chart.\n  Under current conditions, States will face significant challenges if \nthey are to meet their current Medicaid obligations--emphasis upon \n``current''--without the addition of these millions of people being put \non Medicaid because of the expansion in this 2,074-page bill.\n  States are also going to have to make substantial policy changes to \nmeet their budget obligations just currently the way the situation is.\n  Will States cut their Medicaid Programs to cut costs? Right now, as a \ncondition of the $87 billion in stimulus funds, States cannot cut \nbecause that is a requirement of the stimulus package. Under this bill, \nthey will not be able to touch their Medicaid Programs until 2014, the \nyear they are forced, then, to massively expand their programs.\n  So what will States do to make their budgets work? Will they cut \nroads and bridges? Will they cut education? Will they cut back on law \nenforcement and prisons? Will the States raise taxes?\n  I cannot say what 50 different States will do for certain. But States \nare going to have to make significant changes. Right now, in my State \nof Iowa, my Democratic Governor, Chet Culver, is trying the best he can \nto work out of a $565 million hole of which he has spending cuts in \nState government that is intended to address the shortfall in the \ncurrent budget year. A shortfall of more than $1 billion is forecast in \nmy State for the budget year that begins July 1 of next year. That is a \nmajor problem for our State legislators meeting in January. This isn't \njust Iowa. Forty-three States have been forced to cut spending in 2009. \nIt is not just about the raw numbers, it is about the people served by \nthe program.\n\n  A few days ago I had a group of constituents in my office asking for \nsupport for a children's mental health program. They told heart-\nwrenching stories about the challenges they face as parents in \nproviding care for their children. Their children bravely recounted the \nstruggles they have faced and are overcoming as they battle mental \nillness.\n  They benefit from a combined Federal-State program to provide them \ncritical support services that aren't covered in Medicaid. The State \ndollars that go into that program are going to be severely jeopardized \nwhen this bill takes effect and the States are going to have to assume \na larger share because of our forcing them to expand Medicare coverage.\n  It is going to hurt these children I referred to. Right now, Iowa is \nlooking at the possibility of closing two State mental health \nfacilities. In fact, the Des Moines Register recently editorialized \nthat out of four, we only ought to keep one open.\n  On December 4, Iowa State courts were closed as workers there were \nfurloughed without pay in an effort to close the budget gap. States are \nstruggling to keep up essential services. Senators here will add a \ngiant new unfunded mandate to States and hide behind the rhetoric of \nState responsibility.\n  It is very disappointing to have people who claim to be champions of \nthe poor and the needy turn a blind eye to the obvious impact of their \nactions in this bill on State budgets and on the people served by those \nStates. Yet, in the face of the evidence, the Democrats are proposing a \nbill that forces States to expand their Medicaid Programs.\n  This bill proposes that every State cover every American up to 133 \npercent of poverty. This is a massive expansion of the welfare state. \nIt is the largest expansion of Medicaid in the 43-year history of the \nprogram. It will add another 15 million people to the Medicaid rolls. \nIt will increase Federal Medicaid spending by $374 billion. It also \nwill increase State spending by $25 billion.\n  Which States will be affected? Every State here that is colored in \nred on this chart will be affected by this mandate. States are in their \nmost dire fiscal situation since the Great Depression and the Democrats \nwant to slap all of these States in red with a huge unfunded mandate.\n  The majority obviously believes Medicaid expansion is the right way \nto increase coverage. The majority is willfully ignoring facts. States \nalready can't afford the programs, and this bill requires States to \nexpand their programs and make them pay more for the privilege of doing \nso.\n  That is not the only cost being shifted to the States. The insurer \ntax in this bill hits Medicaid managed care plans. Those managed care \nplans run on an extremely narrow margin. The tax on them is simply \ngoing to be passed on to the States. The decision made in the back \nrooms of the majority leader's office to keep all of the additional \nMedicaid drug rebate dollars for the Federal Government will hurt \nStates.\n  I know some people will try to argue that you can't take something \nfrom the States they never had, but for years States have been \nnegotiating supplemental rebates with drug companies. Those will most \ncertainly go away. As more and more people get added to the fraying \nsafety net, that safety net will not be able to hold up. That safety \nnet is going to fall apart. This is a bill that will crash the safety \nnet. If this bill is signed into law, it is only a matter of time \nbefore Congress is forced to come back and restructure the policies in \nthis bill and spend tens of billions of dollars more to keep the safety \nnet from failing completely.\n  Providing extra dollars to the States is going to become an annual \nrite in the Congress. It will very quickly become the so-called doctors \nfix or the SGR problem of Medicaid. The Governors know this as well. I \nwish to quote some.\n  I will start with Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons:\n\n       Under the Reid plan, a mandatory expansion of the Nevada \n     Medicaid program would add more than 41,000 people to the \n     program's rolls in 2014, expanding Nevada's Medicaid \n     enrollment by nearly 60 percent by 2019. Overall, the Reid \n     plan will cost Nevada taxpayers more than $613 million in \n     State General Fund dollars between 2014 and 2019. In addition \n     to imposing this massive tax burden, the bill also removes \n     existing state options, essentially federalizing this \n     program.\n\n  Then a quote from North Dakota's Governor John Hoeven:\n\n       We, along with the National Governors Association, urge \n     extreme caution in moving forward with any plan that would \n     commit the states, without their express participation and \n     consent, to obligations that may financially bind them for \n     decades into the future.\n\n  I will close with two of my favorite Governor quotes, and both of \nthese are Democrats. The governor of Tennessee says this:\n\n       There won't be new prisons built during that period. There \n     won't be much in the way of capital improvements in the state \n     during that period. So it's very scary for governors to be \n     saying as soon as the revenues get back there, the federal \n     government is going to come in and say here's how you're \n     going to spend your new money.\n\n  Governor Brian Schweitzer of Montana, describing Medicaid, says:\n\n       One of the least effective programs in terms of health care \n     in the history of this country is something called Medicaid. \n     About 20 percent of America is on a Medicaid program and they \n     would like to shift it and grow it to somewhere around 25 or \n     30 percent.\n\n  A quote from Governor Schweitzer goes on:\n\n       Now Medicaid is a system that isn't working, almost \n     everyone agrees. But what Congress intends to do is increase \n     the number [of people] on Medicaid so they could do it on the \n     cheap. It is not working for anybody.\n\n  The Democrats in Congress are committing well more than $1 trillion \nof taxpayer dollars to health care reform.\n\n[[Page S13136]]\n\nIt is not our money, it is the taxpayers' money. It is our \nresponsibility to make sure it is spent wisely. In Medicaid, with a \nmassive expansion and a de facto tax increase on the States, this is \nclearly not the case. In other words, the money is not spent wisely.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In a minute and a half, I would simply bring to the \nattention of all of the Members of the Senate the fact that between now \nand December 30 of this year, besides working on this health care bill, \nwe have these things that have to be done:\n  The debt ceiling has to be increased.\n  We have to pass the Defense appropriations bill.\n  We have to decide what is going to happen with the death tax. The \nestate tax is going to end at the end of this year. Next year, there is \nnot going to be any estate tax. I don't think anybody wants that \nsituation to happen because it is only going to happen for 1 year, so \nwe need to do something on estate tax.\n  The highway bill needs to be reauthorized or extended.\n  The PATRIOT Act has to be extended because at least three parts of it \nexpire, and if they are not reinstituted, a lot of the work of the FBI \ntracking terrorists is going to be impossible.\n  We have several tax provisions--73, to be exact--that are extended \nfrom time to time. They need to be extended.\n  Doctors are going to take a 23-percent cut in their reimbursement \nunder Medicare if we don't do something about it.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration needs to be reauthorized, and \nmaybe the Satellite Home Viewers Act needs to be reauthorized, all \nbetween now and the end of the year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This bill doesn't take effect until 2014, so we ought \nto be getting off of this health care bill and get some of these things \ndone that need to be done before the end of the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it appears to be just the two of us \nhere, so if the Senator from Iowa wishes to take a few more minutes to \nconclude his remarks, I have no objection.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No, I am finished. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Very well. Mr. President, I have had the chance to \nsit yesterday where the Presiding Officer is sitting today and hear \nseveral hours of Republican criticism of the health care bill, much of \nit focusing on the recent report from the CMS Office of the Actuary and \nthe concern about cost. I wish to say a few words about that.\n  Clearly, the problem of cost is a very real and dramatic one. This is \nthe curve of our national health care spending, starting back in 1955, \nthe year I was born, at $12 billion and increasing at an accelerating \nrate until in 2009 we were at $2.5 trillion every single year. Of \ncourse, if we look at the curve, we are not going to level out next \nyear at that level; it is going to keep rocketing upward to the point \nwhere in my home State of Rhode Island, if we don't do anything, by \n2016--which is just over the horizon; it is not too far to look forward \nto, even in this building--$26,000 is what it will cost the average \nfamily of four for their health insurance. So the problem of cost is a \nvery real one and the numbers involved are staggering.\n  However, if you are going to look at the CMS report, I would suggest \nthere is not just one number to look at, there are several numbers. \nThen there is an alternative consideration that I think we need to \nconsider.\n  The Republicans have focused on page 4 of the CMS report where the \nActuary estimates that total national health expenditures under this \nbill would increase by an estimated total of $234 billion, or 0.7 \npercent during the calendar years 2010 to 2019, over those 10 years. \nThat is an important number, I will grant them that, but I think there \nis another number that is equally important--indeed, more important, \nand that is on the page before. On page 3 the CMS Actuary says that: \n``Under this legislation, an additional 33 million people would become \ninsured by 2019.''\n  An additional 33 million Americans would become insured by 2019. \nThink about that. We have over and over again come to the floor and \ntold of stories from our home States, heard our colleagues tell us \nstories from their home States about the terrible toll and tragedy that \nbefalls families when they are uninsured or underinsured. Just 30 years \nago when we were about here on the chart, only 8 percent of American \nfamilies filing for bankruptcy protection did so as a result of medical \nbills. Now it is 60 percent. Sixty percent of family bankruptcies \nrelate back to medical emergencies, unforeseen diagnoses, medical bills \nthat have broken the family. Thirty-three million people with adequate \nhealth insurance so they don't face that trauma and that catastrophe, \nthat is something real.\n  It has been estimated that because of a lack of insurance, 40,000 \npeople a year die prematurely. Forty thousand Americans dead as a \nconsequence of lack of insurance. So this bill would cover 33 million \npeople and lift that burden of worry, of anxiety, of financial \ncatastrophe, of illness, even of death, off of all of those families. \nThat is not something to shrug off. Yet, not once did I hear that \nnumber mentioned by the other side. Not once did they even mention that \nthis bill would cover 33 million Americans who would otherwise be \nwithout health insurance. They must hear the same stories at home. It \nis not that in Republican States there are no bankruptcies and no \ndeaths because people are uninsured and no misery, no tragedy. They \njust come to this floor and don't bother to count that side of the \nequation.\n  Another number out of the report is that if you took just the savings \nside, the net savings from the Medicare-Medicaid growth trend and class \nproposals in the bill are estimated to total about $564 billion--net \nsavings totaling $564 billion, before you get to those 33 million. When \nyou cover them, that is how it gets to that $224 billion. If you do \nrough math, and if you have 33 million Americans and they start getting \ncoverage, say, 5 years out--so that there is 5 years of coverage in \nthis for them--divide by $234 billion, it is about $1,500 per person \nper year to have those 33 million people insured.\n  Anybody who thinks for 1 minute about the human side of our health \ncare tragedy cannot help but think that that would be a wise \ninvestment--for $1,500, to give somebody the security of health \ninsurance. Of course, that assumes that this bill actually does, when \nit is implemented, raise costs by $234 billion.\n  As somebody used to say on the radio, that is not the end of the \nstory. The end of the story takes a little bit of development. I note \nthat the Actuary himself said that the actual future impacts of this \nact on health expenditures, insured status, and individual decisions, \nand employee behavior are ``very uncertain.''\n  Why? Because few precedents exist for use and estimation. \nConsequently, ``the estimates presented here are subject to a \nsubstantially greater degree of uncertainty than is usually the case \nwith more routine health care proposals.''\n  In the conclusion, the CMS Chief Actuary reiterates that, saying:\n\n       These findings are subject to much greater uncertainty than \n     normal. Many of the provisions are unprecedented or have been \n     implemented only on a smaller scale. Consequently, little \n     historical experience is available with which to estimate the \n     potential impact.\n\n  Where does that affect the bill? It doesn't affect it in new \ncoverage. We know how much it costs to cover people. It doesn't affect \nit with expanding access to health care. We know how much that costs. \nWhere it affects it is on the savings side.\n  It is not just the CMS Actuary who says that. As I will get to in a \nmoment, that is also the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office. \nThey agree on this. If we are going to get something done about this \nhealth care increase, we are going to have to do something about \nreforming the delivery system, about taking out waste and excess costs. \nThose things are, by definition, hard to predict. They don't lend \nthemselves to the actuarial prediction that the CMS Actuary does and \nthat CBO does. But there is a big target out there. Here is President \nObama's Council of Economic Advisers. They had a report out in July:\n\n\n[[Page S13137]]\n\n\n       Efficiency improvements in the U.S. health care system \n     potentially could free up resources equal to 5 percent of \n     U.S. GDP.\n       It should be possible to cut total health expenditures \n     about 30 percent without worsening outcomes . . . which would \n     again suggest that savings on the order of 5 percent of GDP \n     could be feasible.\n\n  Five percent of GDP is about $700 billion a year. So there is a big \nsaving target to do something about those national health expenditures. \nAnd some groups, such as the Lewin Group, have come up with pretty good \nideas of where those savings could be found. They, by the way, don't \nproject it as $700 billion a year in excess waste and costs. They \npredict that it is over $1 trillion a year that we now burn up in our \nsystem through excess services, waste, and excess costs. They actually \nhave broken out where you can find excess costs due to transactional \ninefficiencies, excess billing and paperwork, excess cost due to \ncompetition and regulatory factors. They don't compete. You get a \ncouple of big insurance companies in there that take over and they are \nnot subject to the antirust laws and make deals with each other and \nwith the hospitals--of course, the regular person is on the short end \nof that deal. Excess cost from poor care management and lifestyle \nfactors. We know care management is terrible. There is very poor \ncoordination of care and we are investing in wellness and prevention to \naddress lifestyle factors. Excess costs from incentives to overuse \nservices. When you pay doctors, that is what they do. When you pay for \nbetter health care outcomes, you will get them and get them cheaper. \nThis adds up to over $1 trillion in excess costs. It is our target. It \nis a real number. It is a big number.\n  There is a problem with how you get after the savings. A lot of \npeople actually agree on this. I will pull a couple of sources \ntogether. We heard from the CMS Actuary, who said some of this is \nunprecedented and there aren't historical records to exactly \nextrapolate how it is going to work. Here is what Doug Elmendorf, the \nhead of the CBO, said:\n\n       Changes in government policy have the potential to yield \n     large reductions in both national health expenditures and \n     Federal health care spending without harming health.\n       Many experts agree on some general direction in which the \n     Government's health policy should move. Many of the specific \n     changes that might ultimately prove most important cannot be \n     foreseen today and could be developed only over time through \n     experimentation and learning.\n\n  There is a potential for large reductions in costs. We agree on the \ngeneral direction that needs to be pursued to achieve large reductions. \nBut experimentation and learning are going to be necessary to do it.\n  There is a Professor Jonathan Gruber, probably the lead health \neconomist--one of the leading health economists in the world, who is at \nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He said this:\n\n       My summary is, it is really hard to figure out how to bend \n     the cost curve. But I can't think of a thing to try that they \n     didn't try--\n\n  That is in our bill.\n\n       They really make the best effort anyone has ever made. \n     Everything is in here. I can't think of anything I would do \n     that they are not doing in the bill. You couldn't have done \n     better than they are doing.\n\n  Seven hundred billion dollars to a trillion dollar target--hard to \nproject it whether you are CBO or CMS. But we know the general \ndirections that are required, and we have everything in this bill that \nwe can to explore it.\n  Somebody has actually taken a bit of a look at this, and they admit \ntheir findings aren't as solid as a full actuarial report. But the \nCommonwealth Fund does a lot of work in this area. They are very good \npeople. Here is what they conclude:\n\n       The effect of national reform on total national health \n     expenditures and the insurance premiums that families would \n     likely pay is this: We would save $683 billion, or more, in \n     national health spending over the 10-year period 2010 to \n     2019.\n\n  Where do they go for that? To things such as administrative expenses. \nRemember, I pointed out the problem of administrative expense and \ntransactional inefficiencies? Currently, nearly 13 percent of insurance \npremiums are accounted for by administrative costs. Things that we do \nin this bill can reduce that. They make a very modest estimate that \nadministrative costs will fall 10 percent of total premiums.\n  The reduction in health spending associated with reduced insurer \nadministration is $191 billion to $221 billion over 2010 to 2019. That \nis just making the paperwork more efficient. And it is around a $200 \nbillion savings.\n  CBO also estimates some reduction in premiums from exchanges. If you \ntake the CBO estimates, and they apply them here, they say those \nestimates from the exchanges yield 10-year savings of $29 billion to \n$34 billion. Then they look at the delivery system innovations--payment \ninnovations, so you are paying for outcomes, not procedures, and \nnegotiations in pharmaceutical prices. As you know, our friends across \nthe aisle made the pharmaceutical industry immune from negotiation by \nthe Federal Government in their last piece of legislation, Part D; \ncomparative effectiveness studies, so you know whether something works \nor not before you pay for it; financial incentives for low-quality and \nhigh-cost providers to get their act together; wellness and prevention \ninvestments; demonstration and pilot projects on Medicare to pull \nthings together, and the ongoing Medicare Commission that our colleague \nSenator Rockefeller is such a champion of, as well as the excise tax on \nthe high-cost insurance plans.\n  The exact amount to be saved from these provisions collectively is \nuncertain, the report admits. They look at scholarly estimates. One \nscholarly report estimates that significant health care reform could \nreduce cost increases by 1.5 percentage points annually, or more than \n$700 billion in the 10-year window. Another report estimates that a \nsavings of more than 10 percent is possible, largely from payment \nreforms such as bundled payment systems.\n  A Commonwealth Fund report indicates that similar provisions would \nslow the annual growth in national health expenditures from 6.5 percent \nto 5.6 percent over the period 2010 to 2020.\n  So cost reductions on the order of 1.0 percentage points are \nrealistic. To be conservative, they considered cost changes of a \nsmaller amount, .75 percent. They concluded that the public and private \nsavings from health system modernization are $530 billion over the 10 \nyears. Taking account of these different factors, they say, on net, the \nSenate bill should reduce health care spending by $683 billion over \n2010 to 2019.\n  Why is that? We have another very thoughtful observer of the health \ncare scene who has offered opinions on this, and that is Dr. Atul \nGawande, who has written several times in the New Yorker on this \nsubject. He notes that:\n\n       It appears the legislation has no master plan for dealing \n     with the problem of soaring medical costs. We crave sweeping \n     transformations. However, all the current bill offers is \n     those pilot programs, a battery of small-scale experiments. \n     The strategy seems hopelessly inadequate to solve a problem \n     of this magnitude. And yet--\n\n  He concludes, and here is the interesting thing--\n\n     history suggests otherwise.\n\n  And uses the example:\n\n       Another indispensable, but costly sector, that was \n     strangling the country at the beginning of the 20th century, \n     and that was agriculture.\n\n  He said:\n\n       The government never took over agriculture, but the \n     government didn't leave it alone either. It shaped a feedback \n     loop of experiments and learning and encouragement for \n     farmers across the country.\n\n  Experiments and learning. Does that sound like the CBO words?\n\n       The results were beyond what anyone could have imagined. \n     Productivity went way up, prices fell by half. Today, food is \n     produced on no more land than was devoted to it a century \n     ago, and with far greater variety and abundance than ever \n     before in history.\n       The strategy works because United States agencies were \n     allowed to proceed by trial and error, continually adjusting \n     policies over time, in response not to ideology but to hard \n     measurement of the results against social goals. The same \n     goes for reforming the health care system . . . Nobody has \n     found a master switch that you can flip to make the \n     [delivery system cost] problem go away. . . . we first \n     need to recognize that there is no technical solution.\n       Much like farming . . . hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, \n     home-health agencies, drug and device suppliers. . . . They \n     want to provide good care, but they also measure their \n     success by the amount of revenue they take in, and, as each \n     pursues its individual interests, the net result has been \n     disastrous.\n\n  The system, he says, ``rewards doing more over doing right, it \nincreases paperwork and the duplication of efforts,\n\n[[Page S13138]]\n\nand it discourages clinicians from working together for the best \npossible results.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I have an additional 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Dr. Gawande continues:\n\n       Pick up the Senate health-care bill--yes, all 2,074 pages--\n     and leaf through it. Almost half of it is devoted to programs \n     that would test various ways to curb costs and increase \n     quality.\n\n  Just like Professor Gruber said:\n\n     . . . I can't think of a thing to try that they didn't try. \n     They really make the best effort anyone has ever made. \n     Everything is in here. . . . I can't think of anything I'd do \n     that they are not doing in the bill. You couldn't have done \n     better than they are doing.\n\n  Dr. Gawande continues:\n\n       The bill is a hodgepodge. And it should be.\n       Which of these programs will work? We can't know. That's \n     why the Congressional Budget Office doesn't credit any of \n     them with substantial savings. . . . But we should not lose \n     faith.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n     . . . there's no piece of legislation that will have all the \n     answers. . . . But if we're willing to accept an arduous, \n     messy, and continuous process we can come to grips with a \n     problem even of this immensity. We've done it before.\n\n  So when the other side comes to the table and argues that this bill \nis a cost disaster, a nightmare, and all the things they are saying, I \nurge people to consider two things. First is that they have been pretty \nclear that they do not want a bill at all, ever, any bill, none. Their \ndesire to deny our new President this victory is an ulterior goal they \nhave declared. Senators have said they want it to be his Waterloo. They \nhave said: It is our goal to break him, to break his momentum.\n  So when they say start over, it is a little hard to believe it. If \nthey were candid, they would say: No, stop dead and leave things just \nthe way they are. Obviously, they could not say that because America \nwould not get behind that. So they have come up in the last few days \nwith this ``start over'' theory.\n  When you look at what their political purpose is, to break President \nObama, to break his momentum, to stop any health care bill from \nhappening, it is worth considering their protestations on the floor in \nthat light.\n  The other light in considering them is in this one: If we are going \nto save significant money by making the delivery system more efficient, \nall experts agree you cannot cost it out in advance. The actuaries \ncannot figure it out. But the tools we need to make it happen, the \nintent of the Obama administration to make it happen is in there.\n  The savings target is between $700 billion and over $1 trillion a \nyear. When we achieve those savings, we are improving the quality of \nhealth care. It is less duplicative, it is less wasteful, it is less \npaperwork, and the quality goes up.\n  A perfect example is the famous Keystone Project in Michigan where \nthey practically eliminated hospital-acquired infections in intensive \ncare units in a number of hospitals in Michigan. In 15 months, they \nsaved 1,500 lives and $150 million. When they started that project, \ncould an actuary have predicted that would happen? No, never. Never. \nAnd at the beginning of the agricultural revolution, when agricultural \nextension agents first went out and we modernized the American \nagricultural center, could they have predicted what Dr. Gawande \nreported? No, they could not. You cannot predict it, but this President \ncan direct it. He can make it happen. We will give him the tools.\n  For those who are concerned about cost, there is very significant \ngrounds for optimism about what happens in this bill. If we don't do it \nthis way with those delivery system reforms, we are going to be left \nwith a bloody toolbox, cutting people off, throwing them off, chopping \nthe benefits, paying providers less. It will be to health care reform \nwhat a Civil War surgeon's toolbox was to modern medicine--saws, \nknives, cauterizing irons, and the patients screaming. It does not have \nto be that way. There is a better way, and it is in the bill.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding me the extra time. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, as my colleague finished, he made the \nstatement, ``when the other side comes to the table.'' Let me just say \nat the beginning, we have been asking to be invited to the table since \nthe beginning of this debate. Unfortunately, we don't know where the \ntable is. We have never been invited, and we hope before this is over \nwe will have an opportunity to provide input into a health care bill \nthat affects 300 million Americans.\n  But on this rare session, as I have heard it described, of a Sunday \nsession of the Senate where I know the Presiding Officer of the Senate \nhas sat in the chair for quite a while now, I am reminded of one of our \ncolleagues, the Senator from Oklahoma, the doctor, Tom Coburn, whose \nmother passed away on Sunday. Sometime this weekend there is a service.\n  I know my colleagues join me in saying to Tom that our hearts and our \nprayers go out to him and to his family. My mother died in between the \ntime I was elected to the Senate but before I was actually sworn in. \nShe was able to see me win, but she didn't live to see me sworn in to \nthe Senate.\n  I know how traumatic the loss of a parent can be. I remember, in my \ncase, how quickly you focus on the fact that mothers have an incredible \ngift given to them by God--the gift of birthing children, of \nreplenishing the next generation. I remember my focus shifted from the \nloss of my mother to the responsibility of my children. I think as \nparents we had undervalued that. That was a shock to me to make me wake \nup and say: I have a responsibility now to make sure that I nurture, to \nmake sure that I raise, to make sure that I educate. It fell on my \nwife's and my shoulders because that is the next generation of \nbusiness. That is and will be the next generation of leaders locally, \nat the State level, and at the national level.\n  Parents are invaluable but so are the kids they produce and the \nopportunity from there on generationally to experience what is great \nabout this country, and that is unlimited opportunity. My \nresponsibility is not just to nurture and to raise two sons, in my \ncase, or in Tom's case great daughters, and one is a tremendous opera \nsinger--probably one of the most sought after in the world--but it is \nalso to make sure we protect the opportunities we were given, to make \nsure that what people have fought for in wars before are recognized to \npreserve the opportunity of success.\n  I feel as though, in our position today, that is part of our \nresponsibility. We are here to preserve the opportunity for \ngenerations--for pages, for children, for our own kids.\n  So it does hurt on a rare Sunday session to have come in during one \nof the most difficult economic crisis periods in our country's history \nand watch without much thought as the Senate passed a spending bill \nthat had a 12-percent increase from last year, something no family can \ndo right now, something that no individual can do.\n  We will borrow 43 cents of every dollar that we just spent in that \nbill. There is no family in the world who can go into a bank today and \nsay: I would like to borrow 43 cents on every dollar. I would like to \ngo out and buy this big-screen TV. I don't need it, but I want it.\n\n  There are some things in this bill we need. But there is a lot in \nthis bill we just want--over 5,000 earmarks. Members of Congress \nactually, at a time that we should be prioritizing our spending in this \ncountry, not only did we raise it 12 percent over last year, but we had \nthe audacity to stick 5,244 earmarks in this bill because we can do \nthat, because somebody asked us.\n  The truth is, families cannot, communities cannot, most States \ncannot. They have laws against it. They have to balance their budgets. \nFamilies have to balance their budgets or they file for bankruptcy. \nCommunities have to balance their budgets and try to meet the core \nresponsibilities of providing services to their communities. There is a \nchoice when they do it: Do we overtax a community through property \ntaxes or do we prioritize on what we spend our money?\n  We never prioritize in this institution anymore. We believe we can \nspend\n\n[[Page S13139]]\n\nas much as we possibly want to, and that is evidenced by 5,244 \nearmarks. The fact is, we just spent $3.9 billion that was not even in \nthe bill originally when the appropriators received their caps.\n  I am sure the community needed their park, and I am sure that the \ncommunity needed the study or the service that each one of those 5,244 \nearmarks represent. But let me ask this: If they need it that badly, \ncouldn't they fund it themselves? Let me say it again.\n  If they need it that badly, couldn't they fund it themselves?\n  Why were earmarks created? It is a way to get somebody else to pay \nfor something you want, not necessarily what you need.\n  Let me say to you, Mr. President, and my colleagues, to everybody \nlistening: We are broke. We borrow 43 cents of every dollar we spend in \nthe Federal Government right now. The 10-year projection says we are \ngoing to increase the debt in the next 10 years more than we did under \nthe previous 43 Presidents.\n  What else do we need to hear to stop spending? It just continues to \nroll on and on.\n  You know what. We are going to get another opportunity next week to \nspend money we don't have. We are going to get an opportunity to raise \nthe debt ceiling, something that for the 15 years I have been here was \na big debate: How much do we need? When do we do it? It was a tool that \nwe used to force us to prioritize. We are going to stick a $1.8 \ntrillion debt ceiling increase into a Defense appropriations bill so \nthat everybody feels guilty about voting against it if they do--and I \nwill, for the first time, because I believe it is wrong. I believe it \nis wrong, and it should not be done.\n  Let me just say this: Sometimes you have to say no. As my children \ngrew up, the toughest thing was to look at those kids and say no. I \nwant this. What do you want for Christmas? I want this. No.\n  When I started work, I was always told in sales: The toughest thing \nyou are ever going to have to do is say no.\n  I will buy it from you, but I will only pay this much. No.\n  We are at that point where the American people have said prioritize. \nWe have to look at communities, we have to look at States, and we have \nto have guts enough to say no.\n  Wealth is not created by government. Wealth is not created by States. \nBut government steals wealth when the opportunity is available.\n  Communities will grow, and they will be healthy, and States will grow \nand they will be healthy but only through local success. It does not \ncome through handouts from the Federal Government. All that does is \ngive us a false sense of security and a false sense of a bank account.\n  In the midst of all this, as we passed this huge spending bill, a 12-\npercent increase, we are debating health care. We are debating a $2.5 \ntrillion health care bill that steals $464 billion from Medicare.\n  I talked about the transition I went through from the loss of a \nparent to the focus of children, and now all of a sudden I am back to \nstealing from my parents. As an institution, we are getting ready to \nsteal $464 billion from Medicare, and people up here don't seem worried \nabout it. My dad and possibly your dad and your mother have been paying \ninto it their entire lives and were promised it would always be there.\n  I am going to tell you a little secret today: Medicare is underfunded \nby $34 trillion. That is trillion, with a ``t.'' You know the most \npopular bumper sticker around today is: Don't tell Congress what comes \nafter a trillion. So Medicare is underfunded by $34 trillion. That is \nnot a guess by an actuary, that is a real number. The Medicare board \nsays it is insolvent in 2017--8 years from now. What are we doing? We \nare stealing $464 billion out of it.\n  I have heard people come to the floor and say they will never miss \nit. It would not affect a benefit. It would not affect a service. It \nwould not affect a facility, a hospital. Now, all of a sudden over this \nweekend, we have been presented with news stories that suggest--because \nnobody has seen a bill, including many Democrats--there may be a deal \nthat expands Medicare to include the 55-to-64-year-old age group--\npotentially, 20-plus million people. I have heard other people say it \nis only going to be 2 million or so. I guess it will be crafted in a \nway that it will leave some out and put some in. I am not sure how you \ndo that. I thought the purpose of the Federal Government was to be fair \nand equitable to all. But maybe this will be crafted in a way that we \nlet 2 million 55-to-64-year-olds in and we leave the other 18 million-\nplus out.\n  Anyway, my good friend from Rhode Island talked about the CMS Actuary \nand what he had to say. I wasn't prepared to come today and read every \neditorial out of the Wall Street Journal, but had I done so, I think \nthey would have rebutted most of what my colleague said. But let me \njust read a couple quotes from the Actuary--the same one Senator \nWhitehouse talked about.\n  This report says:\n\n       The Reid bill is especially likely to result in providers \n     being unwilling to treat Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n\n  `` . . . unwilling to treat Medicare and Medicaid patients.'' In \nother words, not stealing the $464 billion--well, yes, stealing the \n$464 billion is going to generate less interest by providers to see \npatients. There is only 60 percent of the doctors today seeing Medicaid \npatients. There is about 74 percent seeing Medicare patients.\n  So if you like your health insurance, you can keep your doctor, you \ncan keep your plan. Well, that is out the window basically, based upon \nwhat the CMS Actuary said. The Actuary noted:\n\n       The Medicare cuts in the bill could jeopardize Medicare \n     beneficiaries' access to care.\n\n  Keep in mind, this is the President's person. Medicare cuts in the \nbill could jeopardize Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. He also \nfound that roughly 20 percent of all Part A providers, which are \nhospitals and nursing homes--two things additionally that we \nspecifically cut, hospitals and nursing homes--would become \nunprofitable within the next 10 years as a result of these cuts.\n  Well, my take as a businessman, not a lawyer, is that when an entity \nis unprofitable, they go out of business. When there is not enough \nrevenue to meet your expenses, you close your door. So in essence, what \nthe CMS Actuary noted in this was that hospitals and nursing homes \nwould shut their doors. They would close. That is why Senator Conrad \nand others and me, who represent rural parts of the country, have tried \nto say to my colleagues: Pass that bill, and you eliminate rural \nhospitals. You eliminate the ability to provide preventative care in \nrural America.\n  When a woman in rural America gets pregnant, there will not be \nprenatal care there. She will have to drive 60 miles to get the \nprenatal care she needs, and she will never do that. But she will drive \n60 miles to deliver that baby who will end up in the NIC unit, probably \nfor weeks, because she didn't have the proper prenatal care. We will \nspend hundreds of thousands of dollars to treat that baby when we could \nhave kept that local facility open to provide the level of preventative \ncare she needed. But, no, in this it says 20 percent--20 percent--of \nour country's hospitals and nursing homes will close if we pass the \nReid bill.\n  The Actuary also found that further reductions in Medicare growth \nrates through the actions of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board--\nnow, this is important, because this is what they always point to, that \nthe Medicare Advisory Board is going to do this. The Independent \nMedicare Advisory Board, which advocates have pointed to as an \nessential linchpin in reducing health care spending--may be difficult \nto achieve, in practice.\n  In laymen's terms: They ain't gonna do it. So the independent \nMedicare advisory board, the CMS Actuary says it is not going to \nhappen. Gees, how can we take the same Actuary's report and get such a \ndifferent view of what the results of this bill are between me and the \nlast speaker?\n  The Actuary says:\n\n       The Reid bill would cut payments to Medicare Advantage \n     plans by approximately $110 billion over 10 years, resulting \n     in less generous benefit packages and decreasing enrollment \n     in Medicare Advantage plans by 33 percent.\n\n  Like your insurance? You get to keep it. No. Like your doctor? You \nget to keep him. No. Like your hospital? You get to keep it. Not if it \ncloses. Like your nursing home? You get to keep it.\n\n[[Page S13140]]\n\nNo. The Actuary says 20 percent of them are going to go out of \nbusiness. They would not be in business.\n  As a matter of fact, the Reid bill funds $903 billion in new Federal \nspending by relying on Medicare cuts. As a result, the actuary says:\n\n       Providers could find it difficult to remain profitable, and \n     absent legislative intervention might end their participation \n     in the Medicare program, possibly jeopardizing access to care \n     for beneficiaries.\n\n  Well, now we have eliminated the hospital, we have eliminated the \nnursing home, we have eliminated Medicare Advantage, and now the \nActuary says the doctors, because of what we are doing, may opt out of \nthe system.\n  The majority whip came to the floor earlier, and he said the \nRepublicans will not offer a plan. For the record, and for the 100th \ntime, Tom Coburn and I introduced comprehensive health care legislation \nin May. We were the first Members of Congress, House or Senate, to \nintroduce comprehensive health care legislation. I am not sure how many \ntimes I can come to the floor and say that. Tom and I have come down \nand spoken hour after hour and given descriptions of what our plan \ndoes.\n  We don't expect it to be adopted. It has some good things in it. We \nwould love to have some input into whatever the legislation is going to \ndo. But make no mistake about it, just because you stick your head in a \nhole and do not see anything else out there doesn't mean it is not \nthere. To come to the floor and claim that no Republicans have offered \na legislative remedy to health care is to stick your head in a hole and \nsay: I am not going to look; therefore, nothing exists.\n  I know I am coming to the end, and I see the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee wants to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BURR. My good friend from Rhode Island said--I wrote it--\n``Actuaries can't cost it out.'' He said before he left the floor: \n``Actuaries can't cost it out.'' Well, he may or may not be right. I \ncan tell you this: The American people can cost it out, and the \nAmerican people have said no--no to passage of this Reid health care \nbill. We should listen to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we keep hearing about all the tax cuts \nthat are in this 2,074-page bill. Earlier today, I heard the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Illinois say this, after Senator Kyl \nwas done speaking, and I am reading from the transcript.\n\n       First, this bill has $441 billion in tax cuts in the first \n     10 years for average people trying to pay their health \n     insurance premiums. I don't know if the Senator from \n     Arizona--\n\n  There he means Senator Kyl--\n\n     thinks that is a good idea or not. He has never spoken to \n     that at least that I have heard. I think it is a good idea. \n     If you are making less than $80,000 a year, I want to make \n     sure you have insurance, and this bill wants to make sure we \n     give you a helping hand. It is a tax cut.\n\n  First of all, when you have a tax credit or subsidy for buying \ninsurance, the Joint Committee on Taxation describes 73 percent of that \nas outlays, 27 percent as tax reductions. So to call $441 billion a tax \ncut is completely contrary to the way scorekeepers for the Congress \nkeep track of things.\n  The second thing I noticed, in talking about helping people earning \n$80,000 a year or so--and I heard another Senator speak frankly about \ntax increases for people at $75,000--is that there seems to be an \neffort to define down what the middle class is, from the way the \nPresident of the United States described it during his campaign--\nindividuals under $200,000 and families under $250,000 being the middle \nclass.\n  Well, I wish to go into some detail about this because I have had an \nopportunity to speak on this point and I think other Members have as \nwell and somehow we don't seem to get through to our friends on the \nother side of the aisle who have consistently stated that the Reid \nbill, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, is a net tax cut--\nand emphasis upon the word ``net.''\n  Yesterday, this chart was used to illustrate this point--a chart the \nother side was using to illustrate that point. This chart I am \nreferring to has multiple bars with dollar figures. For example, in \n2019 we see here a figure of $40.8 billion net tax cut. My Democratic \nfriends said this number came from the Joint Committee on Taxation. \nUnfortunately, the chart my friends were using at that time is not \nentirely clear on how they came up with this net tax cut, so that is \nwhat I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues. It was quite \nnatural for most to wonder how that number came about, so they said: \nShow me the data.\n  To clear up any confusion, here is the Joint Committee on Taxation \ntable the Democrats relied on to claim that the Reid bill results in a \nnet tax cut. Do you see here this negative figure of $40,786 million? \nOf course, negative, that minus mark there. My friends on the other \nside, unfortunately, do not explain what is going on. Instead, it \nappears the other side simply made an assertion that they hope many of \nus, and those in the media, would believe. I am not going to let my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle get away with this because the \nentire story is not being told. So let me take a moment to explain.\n  First, in simplest terms, where you see the negative number on this \nchart, the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us there is some type \nof tax benefit going to the taxpayers. For example, families making \nbetween $50,000 and $75,000 you can see have a negative $10,489 number \nin their column. This means the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling \nus that this income category is receiving $10.4 billion in tax \nbenefits. But I need to have you listen more closely because when we \nsee a negative number on this chart, the Joint Committee tells us there \nis a tax benefit. So, conversely, where we see positive numbers, in \nthese areas here, where you see positive numbers, the Joint Committee \non Taxation is telling us these taxpayers are seeing a tax increase.\n  I have actually enlarged those numbers of tax returns and the dollar \namounts where there is a positive number for individuals and families--\nonce again, right in here. These positive numbers indicate a tax \nincrease.\n  My friends have said that all tax returns on this chart are receiving \na net tax cut. If this were so, why are there not negative numbers next \nto all the dollars on this chart? Because not everyone on this chart is \nreceiving a tax cut, despite what has been said, including just within \nthe last hour. Quite to the contrary, a number of taxpayers are clearly \nseeing a tax increase. This group of taxpayers is middle-income \ntaxpayers.\n  I didn't come down to the floor to say my friends on the other side \nare wrong. After all, you can see the negative numbers quite frequently \non the chart. After all, you see this negative number, $40,800 million. \nWhat I am doing is clarifying that my friends on the other side cannot \nspread this $40.8 billion tax cut across all of the affected taxpayers \non this chart and then say all have received a tax cut. Why? Because \nthis chart produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation shows that taxes \ngo up for individuals making more than $50,000 and families making more \nthan $75,000. It is right here on these yellow figures. Numbers do not \nlie.\n  Of course, people who inhabit the Joint Committee on Taxation are \nprofessional people who do not have a political agenda, and they tell \nit like it is. That is what they are hired for. That is why there are \nthe same people around whether you have a Democratic or Republican \nmajority in the Congress.\n  I would like to give you my read on what the Joint Committee on \nTaxation is saying here with these figures.\n  First, there is a group of low- and middle-income taxpayers who \nclearly benefit under the government subsidy for health insurance. This \ngroup, however, is relatively small.\n  There is another, much larger group of middle-income taxpayers who \nare seeing their taxes go up for one or a combination of the following \ntax increases: the high-cost plan tax, the medical expense deduction \nlimitation, and the Medicare payroll tax increase. In general, this \ngroup is not benefiting from the government subsidy. After all, how can \ntaxpayers see a tax cut if they are not even eligible for a subsidy?\n  Also, there is an additional group of taxpayers who would be affected \nby other tax increase provisions in the Reid bill that the Joint \nCommittee on\n\n[[Page S13141]]\n\nTaxation could not distribute as other things in the bill are \ndistributed on this chart. These undistributed tax increases include \nthings such as putting a cap on the flexible savings accounts. There \nhas never been a cap. So when you cap it at $2,500 and people cannot \nput in more than $2,500 under this 2074-page bill, that is a tax \nincrease for those people who had higher expenses and wanted to put \nthat money in a flexible savings account.\n  Then also there is a tax that is not accounted for here on cosmetic \nsurgery. My friend from Idaho, Senator Crapo, whose amendment is \npending before the Senate, recently received a letter from the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation stating that this additional group exists and \nmany in this group make less than $250,000 a year.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle cannot, No. 1, say that all \ntaxpayers receive a tax cut and, No. 2, say that middle-income \nAmericans will not see a tax increase under the Reid bill as promised \nby the President in the last campaign.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/13/senate-section/article/S13141-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3172\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brown, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. \n3172 intended to be proposed to H.R. 3590, a bill to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the \ncase of members of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal \nemployees, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/13/senate-section/article/S13141-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, DECEMBER 14, 2009\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.
