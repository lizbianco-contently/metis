On this \nlegislation, the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Murray, was \navailable Thursday afternoon, Friday, and Monday. There has been \nlittle, if any, interest in moving amendments to the floor. I would \nhope we could finish the bill today. We are not going to have any votes \nlate this afternoon, but I would hope that if people determine they are \nnot going to offer amendments, they at least let us finish the bill. \nThis will be only our fifth appropriations bill we will have done. We \nhave many more to do. I have trouble comprehending people not letting \nus finish these bills and then complaining that we have to do a \ncontinuing resolution to fund the government.\n  That is where we are. I hope we can have cooperation. I hope we do \nnot have to file cloture on this bill. It would seem to be so \nunnecessary. Remember, I repeat, she was here Thursday, Friday, and \nMonday. She will be here today in just a few minutes--``she'' meaning \nPatty Murray.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. today for the \nweekly caucus luncheons. There will be no rollcall votes after 3 p.m. \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I had a meeting with Senator McConnell. We try to get \ntogether personally every week. It is nice that we have a chance to \nvisit privately. But also we talked about what the schedule is going to \nbe. We have a lot to do. I went over that in some detail with the \nRepublican leader. We have now scheduled a work period at home on \nColumbus Day week. We have many times in the past taken that recess \nbecause there is so much work to do at home. But we cannot do that \nunless we complete our work here. I have explained that to the \nRepublican leader, and he knows that. We will see what progress we can \nmake in the next few weeks as to whether we can do that.\n  I will not go into detail about all the work we have to do, but we \nare on a fiscal year basis.

Mr. President, I wish to visit for just a few moments \ntoday the subject of energy policy.\n  Most of us spend all of our day having a better day because of energy \nand think very little about it. We get up in the morning, perhaps, and \nuse an electric razor or an electric toothbrush. We go to the kitchen \nand have some coffee that was made by plugging the coffee maker in or \nturning on a stove. Then we get in a car, put a key in an ignition, \nstart an engine, and off to work. We do all the while using all the \nenergy available to us all day long, never thinking much about it.\n  We have a serious energy problem in this country in that a \nsubstantial amount of energy we use, particularly oil which comes from \noutside our country, including from some countries that do not like us \nvery much. We are about 70 percent dependent on foreign countries for \nour oil, and, as I indicated, some of those countries are in some \ndifficulty and turmoil. Yet we are unbelievably dependent on them to \nhelp supply our oil.\n  One of the propositions is, should we not produce more American \nenergy? Should we not have more conservation in this country? Should we \nnot have a plan that makes us less vulnerable and less dependent and \nimproves our national security and our energy security? Of course, the \nanswer to these questions is yes.\n  This is a big-old planet of ours, and we stick straws in the planet \nand suck oil out. Today, Tuesday, we will take out from the drilling \nrigs where we produced about 85 million barrels of oil from \nunderground. One-fourth of it needs to be used in this country. The \nUnited States needs one-fourth of all the oil that is produced in the \nworld today. As I said, 70 percent of that oil comes from outside of \nour country, and about 70 percent of the oil we use in this country is \nused in our transportation system.\n  We have a very serious dependency on oil. It makes us less secure \nnationally, and it creates all kinds of other issues. So the question \nis, What do we do about that problem? That is what I want to talk about \nfor a few minutes, and I also want to talk about it in the context \nof some news reports that said recently that I and several others \nsomehow did not support climate change legislation. Let me make clear \nwhat my position is regarding acting on climate change legislation.\n\n  I have said on the floor of the Senate early this summer that I do \nnot support cap and ``trade.'' I do not have any interest in supporting \nlegislation that will establish a trillion-dollar carbon trading \nsecurities market. This could benefit Wall Street, speculators and big \ninvestment banks who would be trading carbon on a Monday so we can \ndetermine how much energy prices are going to be on a Tuesday depending \non how well that trading went on Monday. I have no interest in doing \nthat type of activity. Not very long ago we saw what has happened to \nthe price of gasoline and oil. For example, the price of oil went from \nabout $40 a barrel to $147 a barrel in day trading in a little more \nthan a year without any notion of supply or demand changes. How can you \njustify the runup on the price of oil from $40 to $147 a barrel over a \nnumber of months? I have already seen abuses of other markets. I have \nseen the markets with respect to derivatives and swaps and all of the \nexotic instruments that have been created in order to be traded on \nother markets. I have no interest in the carbon market ``trade'' \nportion of ``cap and trade'' and would not be intending to support \nthat. There are other ways for us to have a lower carbon future.\n  I do believe there is something happening to our climate to which we \nshould be very attentive to. I do believe a series of no-regret steps, \nat the very least, makes a lot of sense right now as we begin to \naddress reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Let me say that while I have said I do not intend to be supportive of \nthe cap-and-trade approach, especially with quotes around ``trade,'' I \nthink there are some things we can, will, and must do to address the \nissue of climate change and bring about a low carbon future. Having \nsaid that, my hope is that the legislation already passed through the \nSenate Energy Committee will be brought to the floor for a debate \nbecause it makes significant steps toward addressing energy and climate \nchange policy. It will also reduce our dependence on foreign oil and \nincrease our national and energy security. This is achieved for our \ncountry by producing more American energy and by incentivizing the \nkinds of things that can serve, save, and create other forms of energy \nas well.\n  Let me talk just for a bit about the bill passed by the Senate Energy \nCommittee. Some people have said that we have to bring an energy bill \nto the floor and combine it with a climate change bill. I do not \nbelieve that should be done at this time. In my judgment, it would be \nmuch smarter to bring an energy bill to the floor which has already \npassed out of the committee with a bipartisan vote. It is called the \nAmerican Clean Energy Leadership Act. We should bring that bill to the \nfloor, debate it, pass it, and get it to the President for his \nsignature. That would do something very significant for our country's \nenergy future. After that, we should then turn to address climate \nchange legislation and how we create a low carbon future.\n  Here is what is in that legislation that I hope we will bring to the \nfloor of the Senate first.\n  Renewable electricity standard. There is an old saying: If you don't \ncare where you are going, you are never going to be lost. That is \ncertainly true for a country and a congress. If you do not establish \nstandards and say: Here is what we aspire to achieve, then you will \nnever know whether you have met it. We should strive for a renewable \nelectricity standard of 20 percent. The current bill's standard has 15 \npercent. When we get an energy bill to the floor, my hope would be we \nwould have a 20-percent combined renewable electricity standard that \nsays that we aspire to achieve this level of renewable energy as part \nof our country's electricity mix by 2021.\n  This would be the first national standard in the history of this \ncountry. More than half the States have already taken action in this \narea, but we need a national standard that creates the goal of what we \naspire to achieve. A strong, national renewable electricity standard is \nwhat I support. There is currently a national standard in this energy \nbill which we can bring to the floor. Having a standard drives \nadditional production of renewable energy. It is one significant step \ntowards addressing climate change. Wind energy, solar energy, biomass \nare the types of renewable energy that this country needs to increase. \nThrough an RES, we can incentivize that additional production.\n  Turning to energy efficiency, the lowest hanging fruit by far in \nenergy is about taking steps to make our buildings more efficient. The \nMacKenzie study shows many ways to reduce emissions. By far the least \ncostly, most effective, way to address energy and greenhouse gas \nemissions is through efficiency improvements in our buildings, homes, \nequipment, appliances, and factories. All of these areas are dealt with \nin this energy legislation, promoting much greater movement toward \nachieving the conservation that comes from expanded energy efficiency \nprograms.\n  Another thing that is in this bill is building an interstate highway \nsystem of transmission capability. We can produce a lot of new \nrenewable energy, but if we do not move it from where it is produced to \nwhere it is needed. We need to move it to the load centers otherwise it \nwill not have done much good.\n  My home State, North Dakota, is No. 1 in wind production. The folks \nat the Department of Energy call North Dakota the Saudi Arabia of wind. \nWe are almost born leaning toward the northwest against that prevailing \nwind. We\n\n[[Page S9337]]\n\nhave a lot of wind. The fact is we don't need wind power in our State. \nWhat we need to do is maximize the production of wind power and move it \nto the load centers. In order to do that, you need a national \ninterstate highway of transmission capability. We are not able to build \nit now, but the energy legislation that passed the Senate Energy \nCommittee will give us the opportunity to do that.\n  We have built 11,000 miles of natural gas pipeline in the last 9 \nyears to send natural gas through pipes around this country. During the \nsame period of time, we have built less than 660 miles of high-voltage \ninterstate transmission lines. Why? Because with the current rules, it \nis very hard to build interstate transmission lines, you almost can't \nget it done.\n  So this legislation has a transmission piece I helped write that \ngives us the opportunity to say: We are going to maximize the \ndevelopment of renewable energy sources, such as wind energy from the \nheartland, and solar energy from the South and Southwest. This \nlegislation would allow us to move it from these areas where the energy \nis produced and then move it to the load centers where it is needed, by \nway of an interstate highway system of transmission capability, which \nwe do not now have. Building an interstate highway system of \ntransmission lines would be a huge boost to this country's energy \nfuture and also a significant step toward reducing our greenhouse gas \nemissions. It would accomplish this by allowing the development of \nclean energy sources, such as wind energy, solar energy, biomass, and \nothers.\n  The bill would also reduce our dependence on foreign oil by \ntransforming our transportation system. We are headed toward plug-in \nvehicles. Electrifying the short-haul transportation system is the best \nway to reduce the role foreign oil plays in our economy. By \nelectrifying our cars at the same time as we reduce the amount of \ncarbon produced by electric generation, which I will talk about in a \nminute, we not only cut our dependence on foreign oil but we also \nreduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Plug-in hybrid vehicles, I think, \nare a bridge to the electric future integrating the electric motor with \na gasoline engine. All this is trying to aspire a new direction for our \ncountry.\n  I wish to say the most abundant resource we have is coal, and the \nenergy legislation passed by the Senate Energy Committee also addresses \nthe use of coal. Some people have said: Well, it might not be used in \nthe future, I disagree completely. It is our most abundant resource. In \nthis bill, we facilitate a large-scale demonstration and deployment of \ncarbon-capturing storage technology which will allow us to continue to \nuse coal while also capturing the carbon and using it for other \nproducts or sequestering it. But we can continue to use our most \nabundant resource, and we facilitate those necessary demonstration \nprojects in this legislation.\n  This legislation will also be helpful to hydrogen and fuel cell \ntechnology in the future, which I am a strong supporter of. I believe \nhydrogen and fuel cell technology is another generation we need to work \non with respect to the research. Finally, let me say I offered an \namendment during the energy deliberations on this bill that opens the \neastern Gulf of Mexico, including the Destin Dome in the Gulf of \nMexico, for oil and gas development.\n  In other words, I believe we ought to do a lot of everything. We \nshould be developing more, producing more including oil and natural \ngas. We should also find a way to produce coal in a manner that \nprotects our environment, and we will. We should conserve more and save \nmore. We should do all those things. But in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, \nthere are about 3.8 billion barrels of oil and about 21 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas. It makes no sense that we are so unbelievably and \nexcessively dependent on foreign oil when we are not producing that \nwhich we have in our country. We should do all of that mindful of the \nenvironment; mindful of all the protections that are necessary. I \nunderstand that.\n  So I offered the amendment that opens the eastern gulf with a 45-mile \nbuffer zone. I did not offer this amendment, but I will when we get it \nto the floor. This amendment will allow our oil companies to compete \nfor production capability in the Cuban waters. The country of Cuba is \ninterested now in producing and leasing oil and gas. The Spanish are \nthere, the Canadians are there, India is there, and China is \ninterested, but our companies are prohibited because of an unbelievable \n50-year moratorium, against the country of Cuba. A 50-year embargo, \nwhich is almost farcical in terms of its failure.\n  We are told it is okay for everybody else to go there. We are told \nthere are a million barrels a day in those waters after the production. \nThere is no one in the world that is better at the kind of ultra or \nunconventional deepwater drilling than America. We have done the \nresearch. We have done the work to understand that we drill better than \nanybody else in the world. Yet we are told our companies are not able \nto compete for leasing in those Cuban waters. This embargo makes no \nsense at all.\n  As I said previously, I happen to think we should do a lot of \neverything and do it well. Whether it is conservation or other related \nissues--producing more, conserving more--and increasing the use of \nrenewable sources of energy, we will step, in a giant way, toward \naddressing climate change. It is exactly what we should do.\n  We are told: Well, you have to bring Waxman-Markey or you have to do \nthis or that. What we have to do, it seems to me, is to be smart. The \nsmart thing, in my judgment, would be to take the legislation the \nSenate Energy Committee has passed, which does all the things I have \ndescribed. It would contribute, in a very positive way towards reducing \nour greenhouse gas emissions and increasing our national and energy \nsecurity by making us less dependent on foreign oil and making us more \ndependent on American-produced energy.\n  I mean, why would we not want to have a much greater focus on \nAmerican energy produced in this country? Why would we not want to have \na much more significant focus on developing national aspirations for \nwhat we want to do with renewable energy? It is this old case of we \nkind of walk around and say: Well, whatever happens, happens. Well, the \nfact is we can't consign our future to that.\n  I have spoken about, I guess a dozen times on the floor, that my \nfirst car, as a very young boy, was one my father found in a grainery \nin an old abandoned farm in North Dakota. I bought it from the guy who \nput it in that grainery for $25. It was a 1924 Model T Ford, completely \nrusty, with no wires or seat covers. All it was was a bunch of metal \nand a bunch of rust. As a young boy, I lovingly restored that old Model \nT. What I discovered, when I got it all done and running, was that you \nput gasoline in that Model T the same way you do in 2009 cars. \nEverything else has changed except that. Cars are computerized today, \nbut you still pull up to a gas tank, take the cap off, and put gas in \nthat 1924 Model T, as you do with a brand spanking new Ford. That \nhasn't changed, but it must. It so describes how mired we are in our \nprevious energy policies. We can't get out of the rut.\n  The Energy bill we passed in the Energy Committee gets us out of this \nrut, it makes us more secure, it strengthens our country, and it makes \nus less dependent on others for our energy sources. Particularly those \nwho don't like us very much.\n  One final point. Several years ago, there was a blackout on the east \ncoast. Just like that, all the electricity was gone. At that moment, \nalmost everyone understood what energy meant to them, and we understood \nits connection to our daily lives. It is unbelievable. So the question \nof reliability of energy for our country. Where do we get it? How do we \nuse it? What does it cost? What does it mean for our climate? These are \nall important, interesting, and in some cases difficult questions. We \nhave addressed most of those questions in an energy bill Senator \nBingaman and I and many others had a role in writing.\n  I hope very much, after the debate on health care legislation, as \npeople start thinking and talking about energy and climate change, \nconsideration will exist for bringing a good energy bill to the floor \nthat is a significant step in the right direction toward climate change \nfirst. Then at some later point, bringing a climate change bill to the \nfloor. Because I think they are related but separate. I think it would \nbe much\n\n[[Page S9338]]\n\nsmarter to get the value and the success of an energy bill that has \nbeen passed by the committee and ready to be dealt with by the Senate \nat some point very soon.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I believe it is time for us in Congress \nto admit that we do not do ``comprehensive'' well, and that the era of \nthe 1,000-page bill is over.\n  Look at immigration in 2007. Some of the best Senators here worked \nday and night trying to deal with that issue--Senator Kennedy, Senator \nKyl, Senator McCain, Senator Martinez, and many others. They worked and \nthey got 34 votes at first, not the 60 they hoped. Then finally they \ngot 46 votes, 14 votes shy of the votes needed to pass a comprehensive \nimmigration bill.\n  Or look at the economy-wide cap and trade as a way of dealing with \nclimate change and clean energy. Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman \nworked on a bill 2 or 3 years ago. Last year the Warner-Lieberman \nversion of the bill got 48 votes and it needed 60 votes.\n  Earlier this year we had 66 or 67 Senators, including two dozen \nDemocrats, who voted to say don't put the economy-wide cap and trade \nthrough the so-called reconciliation process, the budget process which \nwould take only 50 votes to pass.\n  Then, add to that, health care is in the ditch. The President has \nsaid there can't be any deficit added by the health care bill, so that \nkills deader than a doornail the House health care bill which has been \nworked on by several committees over there. It kills deader than a \ndoornail the Senate health care bill because both add to the debt in \nthe next 10 years and, according to the Congressional Budget Office and \nothers who have reviewed it, add to the debt in the 10 years after \nthat. So the President said he won't sign a bill with any deficit, the \nHouse bill is deader than a doornail, the Senate bill is deader than a \ndoornail, and we still have unresolved problems even if you fix the \ndebt problem.\n  We have the President saying he is going to take the savings out of \nMedicare to pay for the bill. Many of us believe that any Medicare \nsavings ought to be spent on Medicare. We ought not take money from \nGrandma's Medicare and spend it on anybody other than Grandma, because \nthe program is about to go broke in 2017. The Democratic as well as the \nRepublican Governors are worried about what the Governor of Tennessee \ncalled ``the mother of unfunded mandates,'' when these bills say we are \ngoing to expand Medicaid and we might pay for it a few years in \nWashington but after that we are going to shift it to the States with \nhundreds of millions of dollars of new State taxes. Employers are \nworrying about raising taxes in a recession. Older Americans, seniors, \nare worried about whether some government official is going to say you \ncan't have your hip replaced because you are 70 years old. If debt \nhasn't killed the Senate and the House bills, all these other issues \nare still out there.\n  I propose we take a page from a famous little book which was widely \npassed out in Iowa and New Hampshire in 1995 and 1996. It is called \nLamar Alexander's ``Little Plaid Book.'' I used it when I ran for \nPresident of the United States. Obviously not enough people read it for \nme to be successful. It has lots of good instructions about rules, \nlessons, and reminders about running for office and making a \ndifference, whether you are President of the United States or president \nof your senior class. Here is rule 259:\n\n       Keep in mind that enough small steps in the right direction \n     will still get you where you want to go.\n\n  Mr. President:\n\n       Keep in mind that enough small steps in the right direction \n     will still get you where you want to go.\n\n  I think we should take that advice. I think it is plainly obvious \nthat we in Congress have been biting off more than we can chew--on \nimmigration, on health care, and on other issues. We have been \nproducing 1,000-page bills which, in truth, most Members of Congress \nhave not even read and in which voters have no confidence, and out of \nwhich will come unintended consequences and results that are bad for \nour country. The worst consequence is that the ambition of ours is so \nlarge, to solve these problems, that it inevitably adds to the debt--\nthe national debt, the Government's debt, our taxpayer debt--at a time \nwhen we are adding $9 trillion to the debt in just 10 years and \neveryone is worried about how we are going to pay that back; and at a \ntime, fairly or unfairly, when the American people are saying the new \nadministration, it seems, has a new Washington takeover every other \nday: taking over banks, taking over insurance companies, taking over \nstudent loans--nobody asked them to take over student loans, they are \njust going to take them all over, all 15 million student loans are \ngoing to be run out of the U.S. Department of Education--taking over \nyour farm ponds, maybe taking over health care, taking over car \ncompanies, maybe taking over climate change by having a czar in the \nEnvironmental Protection Administration wave a magic wand and impose it \non the country.\n  The American people see 32 so-called czars who are unaccountable and \nit looks like a runaway Federal Government with no checks and balances.\n  Senator Byrd, the senior Democrat, has warned about the consequences \nof these unaccountable czars. Senator Hutchison, Senator Collins--\nsenior Republicans--have warned about that as well.\n  Instead of thousand-page bills that do not succeed and in which the \npeople of this country have no confidence, I suggest we change course, \nwe follow rule 259 in the ``Little Plaid Book,'' and we begin to work \non major issues facing our country, step by step, to re-earn the trust \nof the American people, to begin to solve the big challenges of this \ncountry. We bite off what we can swallow. We make sure we get it right \nand after we have taken the first steps then we can take another series \nof steps until we eventually resolve the problem. A few steps in the \nright direction is a good way to get where you want to go.\n  How would this work in practice? Let's take health care. Instead of a \ntrillion-dollar thousand-page comprehensive health care government-run \nplan, as a first step we might allow small business pooling to reduce \nhealth care costs, increase accessibility for small business owners, \nunions, associations and their workers, members and families. This bill \nhas been here for 4 years. It is ready to pass. There are actually \ncompeting bills. But the estimates are it would add a million workers \nthat small businesses could afford to cover by insurance. That is a \ngood step in the right direction.\n  We might reform medical malpractice laws so runaway junk lawsuits \ndon't continue to drive up the cost of health care. In Tennessee, there \nare 60 counties where there are not any OB/GYN doctors. That means \nmothers in those 60 counties of Tennessee have to drive a long way, \nthey have to drive to Memphis, maybe 60 miles, to get the prenatal \nhealth care to have their babies. The President mentioned the other \nnight some steps about junk runaway lawsuits, so there is a second \nsmall step we could take that could make a big difference about cost.\n  Third, we could allow individual Americans the ability to purchase \nhealth care across State lines as they can with car insurance today. We \ncan probably agree on that here and it would probably make a \ndifference. I used to be a Governor so I have an aversion to not \nrespecting State lines, but in this case we may need to do this because \nthe cost of health insurance could come down if we did it and cost is \nwhat we are focused on.\n  No. 4, we could ensure that Americans who currently qualify for \nexisting programs such as Medicaid and the\n\n[[Page S9339]]\n\nChildren's Health Insurance Program but are not enrolled get signed up. \nThere are 11 million Americans, 20 percent of all the uninsured people \nin this country, who are eligible for current government programs \ncalled Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program but have not \nsigned up. Rather than wringing our hands about whether to pass some \nnew thousand-page bill to try to run up the debt and deal with \nuninsured people, why don't we sign up the uninsured people who are \nalready eligible for programs, and, No. 5, create health insurance \nexchanges so Americans can find affordable coverage. The President \nmentioned that the other night. It is in almost all the Republican \nbills. In other words, that is just a marketplace, a shopping center \nwhere you can go look for a variety of programs.\n  No. 6, we could enact meaningful insurance market reforms, meaning \nyou are guaranteed you can get a policy and that if you have a \npreexisting condition, you can get affordable coverage. If we did this, \nthis would probably raise the cost of insurance for some Americans. It \nwould mean that every American would either have to be automatically \nenrolled or have to be enrolled. But a lot of Americans are getting \ntired of paying an extra $1,000 on their health insurance just so you \ndo not have to buy any until you are on the way to the emergency room. \nSo maybe we can do that as well.\n\n  Those are just six steps. But six steps of that size in the right \ndirection are a good way to get where we want to go. Then, if we can \npass those, maybe we can pass six more.\n  Or take clean energy. What do we have facing us out of the House of \nRepresentatives? A massive contraption, spending hundreds of billions \nof dollars a year, causing us to lose millions of jobs under an \neconomy-wide cap-and-trade climate bill.\n  That climate bill that is proposed by the House would raise the \nelectric bill for every American and raise the price of your fuel at \nthe gasoline tank. It is a high-cost energy and climate change bill. \nWell, instead of a high-cost energy and climate change bill, how about \ntaking a few steps in the right direction toward a low-cost one?\n  One. What about building 100 new nuclear plants in 20 years? That \nwould double the amount of nuclear power we produce. Nuclear power is \n70 percent of our carbon-free electricity. Is not carbon-free \nelectricity supposed to be our goal? Did we not invent nuclear power in \nthe Atoms for Peace Program? Is not the rest of the world now way ahead \nof us? And have not our Navy submarines operated safely since the 1950s \nand effectively with nuclear power and does not Dr. Chu, the Energy \nSecretary for this administration, a Nobel Prize winner, say they \noperate safely in America and that we can safely store the waste for \nthe next 40 or 60 years while we decided how to reprocess it so it does \nnot produce plutonium? The answer to all that is yes. So why not build \n100 nuclear plants in 20 years? We have done it before, we can do it \nagain.\n  Two. We can make half the cars and trucks plug-in electric cars and \ntrucks in 20 years. I think we can agree on that on both sides of the \naisle. We can do that without building any new power plants because we \nhave so much unused electricity at night; if we plug in at night at a \ncheap rate, we can fuel our cars and reduce our imported foreign oil, \nkeep our fuel prices low, use less gas, clean the air, and deal with \nclimate change all at once.\n  Three. Offshore exploration for natural gas and oil. We need plenty \nof natural gas if we want our manufacturing companies to stay here with \ntheir jobs. We need plenty of natural gas. Every new big power plant \nbuilt in the last 20 years has been a natural gas plant because it has \nless carbon than coal. We do not want to be importing natural gas in \nthe same way we import oil. So let's do that.\n  Four. Then double clean energy research and development. Instead of \nsubsidizing entrepreneurs, let's have a mini Manhattan Project for the \nmost promising efforts to make solar costs competitive, to make \npossible the recapture of carbon from existing coal plants, to have \nbetter electric batteries, to have advanced biofuels from crops we do \nnot eat.\n  So there are four steps in the right direction on clean energy which \nwould actually lower our prices, instead of a 1,000-page bill, which \nwould begin to collect hundreds of billions of dollars a year and put \nmuch of it in a slush fund that Congress would spend and raise your \ntaxes, have all sorts of unforeseen consequences, send manufacturing \njobs fleeing overseas; that would be what we should not do.\n  Immigration. I mentioned immigration before and how the best Members \nof this body were trying hard on immigration, and it fell of its own \nweight. I do not think we can pass a comprehensive immigration bill. \nBut I think we can take several steps in the right direction, such as a \nsecure work card, a tamper-proof worker ID card, to make sure workers \nare legal.\n  Senator Schumer has talked about that. I join him in talking about \nit. Most of the people who are illegally here are here to work. If they \nhave to prove they are legally here, that will dry up the number of \npeople illegally here and then we can deal with that.\n  Second, we could achieve full operational control of our borders. \nPresident Bush and the Congress made a lot of progress on that, not \nalways recognized, but we need to finish it. And third, help legal \nAmerican immigrants and new Americans learn English and learn civics \nand learn American history and assimilate into our society and learn \nwhat it means to be an American.\n  We can take the first steps on debt and fiscal responsibility, \ninstead of more bailouts and doubling our debt, which is the route we \nare on. We can end government ownership of car companies, we can have a \nbipartisan commission to control spending. We call that the Gregg-\nConrad bill because it means the commission would decide how to control \nspending, recommend it to us, and we would vote up or down, or a \nsimilar BRAC-like Commission to do the same thing. There are other \nsteps we can take to reduce the debt. We might not be able to reduce it \nall in 1 day or all in one bill. But a few steps in the right direction \nto reduce the debt are a good way to get where we want to go.\n  The same on taxes. Instead of a complicated Tax Code that penalizes \nworking families, we probably would fail if we came in with a \ncomprehensive proposal to change the Tax Code. In fact, President Bush \nasked two respected former Members of the Senate, John Breaux and \nConnie Mack, and others to recommend a plan to us. They recommended a \npretty good plan, and it got lost in the dark. Nobody ever heard \nanother word of it, probably because it was a comprehensive plan.\n  Why do we not take a few steps in the right direction, such as an \noptional one-page flat tax, such as doubling the child tax credit to \nmake it easier for parents to be better parents, such as ending the \ndeath tax on families with assets of less than $5 million?\n  And then coming up soon: financial regulatory reform. We had a \nbipartisan breakfast this morning on this subject. Fifteen Senators \nattended, listened to Senator Dodd, a Democrat, and to Senator Shelby, \na Republican, talk about financial regulatory reform. After the near \ncollapse of the economy a year ago, we all know we need that. We would \nbe best off doing it in a bipartisan way. But, again, rather than come \nup with a 1,000- or a 2,000-page bill on financial regulatory reform, \nmaybe we can take a few steps in the right direction.\n  Bipartisanship helps, but it is not, as some might say, an \nopportunity to sing ``Kumbaya.'' The Senate is a place for differences \nof opinion vigorously expressed. If we do not have those, we would not \nbe here. The real value of bipartisanship is a better bill and a bill \nin which the people who elected us will have confidence.\n  Such bipartisanship is absolutely essential to any comprehensive bill \nand even to a few steps. We had it on the Energy bill of 2005, which \ngot 74 votes. We had it on the America Competes Act, an early version \nof which got 70 cosponsors. The Gang of 14 had it when we were dealing \nwith Supreme Court nominees. On the controversial TARP vote, we had \nbipartisan support with 74 votes.\n  How did we get it? We worked in the open with no secrets, everyone \ngets credit. I am afraid that even when we have that spirit, the \nproblems we have to tackle are so large we need to begin to solve them \nin pieces. These are problems we must solve. But we are not a\n\n[[Page S9340]]\n\ndebating society. In the end, we need to get a result. I have concluded \nthat the best way to get a result on health care, on immigration, on \nother major issues facing our country is to put aside the 1,000-page \nbills, and re-earn the trust of the American people by working step by \nstep to begin to solve the challenges facing our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today is an opportunity to honor an \nunassuming and too often unsung hero, a humanitarian credited with \nfeeding 1 billion people and saving the lives of hundreds of millions \nof people throughout the world.\n  There are few who have walked the Earth who have had the impact \nNorman Borlaug had; not only in his own country but in the areas of the \nEarth he referred to as the ``forgotten world.''\n  As an Iowa farm boy, Dr. Borlaug recognized there are no miracles in \nagricultural production, there is science. Norman Borlaug is the father \nof the green revolution. He warned that fear-mongering by environmental \nextremists against pesticides, fertilizers, and genetically improved \nfoods would again put millions at risk of starvation while damaging the \nvery biodiversity those extremists claimed to protect.\n  In fact, Dr. Borlaug's green movement does not provoke a war of man \nversus plant, it strengthens that relationship by using science to \nsupplement the Earth's natural resources and provide a stable food \nsource for a stronger and healthier world.\n  Biotechnology has breathtaking possibilities for improving human \nhealth, the environment, and enhancing agricultural production around \nthe world. Already, hundreds of millions of people worldwide have been \nhelped by biotechnology drugs and vaccines. There are many more drugs \nand vaccines currently being tested which will eventually help us wipe \nout other diseases as well.\n  For thousands of years, farmers have fought countless pests and \ndiseases that have destroyed crops and limited production. \nBiotechnology is bringing hope to those in the developing world by \nproviding crops that are more tolerant of drought and more resistant to \ninsects and weeds and more nutritious.\n  Biotechnology is also increasing the nutritional value of foods \nproduced by increasing the vitamin and mineral content of crops grown \nand reducing fat.\n  Bt, Bacillus thuringiensis, is a natural insecticide in the soil. It \nis being transplanted into corn, potatoes, cotton, and rice, allowing \nfarmers to produce more food with far fewer chemicals.\n  In the United States, use of transgenic seeds has reduced pesticide \napplication on our fields by tens of millions of pounds annually. Dr. \nBorlaug's work focused on the principle that wealthy nations have many \nproblems, hungry nations have only one. He stated that: ``Without food, \nmany can live at most but a few weak; without it, all other components \nof social justice are meaningless.''\n  Today, in the United States and in this Congress, we have the luxury \nof being concerned with so many other issues because our bellies are \nfull. In an excerpt from Dr. Borlaug's epilogue from his biography, \n``The Mild Mannered Maverick Who Fed a Billion People,'' he underscored \nthat ``Helping struggling subsistence farmers produce a food surplus is \nthe way to rid the world of much poverty and misery.''\n  Dr. Borlaug's work will be remembered as the catalyst in solving \nworld hunger and we, as world citizens, are forever indebted to his \nhumanitarianism and a reminder of what science can do and why it should \nbe defended and promoted.\n  Today, let's all give thanks for the life and honor the memory of one \nof the foremost humanitarians of our age, Dr. Norman Borlaug. His \npassing earlier this week is a cause for the celebration of his life \nand a dedication to continuing his work as the best tribute we can \nprovide to this truly great humanitarian.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we have heard a great deal about health \ncare reform over the past few months. It is an issue that excites \npassion in many people, from the White House to Wall Street, from the \nHalls of Congress to the streets of Middle America. Last week the \nPresident called this Congress to action. He drew a line in the sand: \nWe must improve the quality of health care in America and reduce cost, \nwe must stop insurance companies from dropping the coverage of those \nwho need it most, and we must make sure every single American can get \nquality, affordable care. We can all agree on these simple goals, but \nthere is wide disagreement about how to get there.\n  I recognize this issue may be easier for me than it is for many of my \ncolleagues. I will not be running for reelection next year, as many in \nthis Chamber will. Because of this, I am free to focus my attention on \npolicy rather than politics. I don't have to worry about political \nconcerns. I don't have to think about what the special interests will \nsay or what campaign donors will think about my latest vote or \nstatement on the Senate floor. When I evaluate an idea, I only have to \nask one question: What does this mean for the American people?\n  I believe health care reform is too important to be consumed by \npolitical concerns. I ask my colleagues to take a moment and ask the \nsame question. As we look at health care reform, what would a public \noption mean to the American people? The answer is clear. A public \noption would provide stability and security because it is easily \nportable. A public option will introduce accountability, choice, and \ncompetition to the national health insurance market. It will provide a \nsafety net for those who cannot afford private insurance. It will not \nbe a government takeover of health care. Let me repeat that: It will \nnot be a government takeover of health care. No other proposal would be \nas effective; no other plan can accomplish our goals.\n  I ask my colleagues to separate politics from policy. Let's take a \nlook at the facts. Critics have said a public plan will cost too much. \nTo back up this claim, they cite studies performed by the same \ncorporate insurance giants that posted record profits in a time of \nhardship for many Americans. These companies can increase profits by \ncharging higher premiums and denying coverage to the sick. They have an \ninterest in trying to prevent the kind of reform that will benefit \nAmerican families. That is why their numbers make the public option \nlook bad.\n  But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office conducted a study \nthat tells a very different story. Rather than costing us money, the \nCBO estimates that a health care insurance option will save taxpayers \n$150 billion over the next 10 years.\n  I believe we should not compromise on the public option because it \nwill be the key provision that can provide choice and cut costs. I \nbelieve the American people deserve $150 billion in savings. \nApparently, some of my Republican colleagues disagree because they \ncontinue to oppose a public option. That is bad policy, and it is pad \npolitics.\n  Critics have suggested we include a ``trigger'' mechanism in the \nhealth care bill. This would allow a public plan to compete with \nprivate companies only if other reforms failed to bring costs under \ncontrol. This sounds like a reasonable proposal, but we have already \nseen the mechanism at work.\n  In the early 1990s, when President Clinton and a Democratic Congress \ntried to pass health care reform, insurance companies brought costs \nunder control. Health care costs grew by only $38 billion every year \nthat Congress debated reform. Insurance corporations\n\n[[Page S9341]]\n\nmust have been afraid that reform would hurt their profits, so they \nself-regulated, keeping costs under control until the threat of reform \nhad passed. Then when Republicans claimed the majority and health care \nreform was dropped, costs began to skyrocket. Between 1996 and 2007, \nthe cost of health care increased by about $102 billion every single \nyear.\n  These numbers are clear. Fourteen years ago, we saw exactly what a \ntrigger provision would look like. It simply doesn't work. What we need \nis a public option, plain and simple. It is time to abandon half \nmeasures. It is time to abandon empty political gestures. The evidence \nis clear we must make a public option a central component of the health \ncare reform legislation. It will compete with private insurers, \nresulting in better coverage for everyone. It will improve health care \noutcomes and allow Americans to keep their current doctor. It will \nprovide stability and security, especially if someone loses their job \nand needs to buy their own coverage. It will save money and reduce the \nburden on American businesses and families. It will not lead to a \ngovernment takeover of the health care industry, as some critics have \nclaimed. These claims have no basis in fact, and we have heard them \nbefore.\n  Allow me to quote a Republican Senator on the floor of this Chamber \nwho said if a health care reform bill is enacted, ``it will be the \nbeginning of the end of private hospitals and medical insurance for \nindividuals over 65.'' That is a dire prediction. These words were \nspoken by Senator Carl T. Curtis of Nebraska. But he wasn't talking \nabout the current health care bill. Senator Curtis spoke these words \nmore than 40 years ago in opposition to the Medicare law that \nestablished one of the most successful programs in American history.\n  A public option would not destroy private insurance. It will merely \nhelp the American people hold them accountable. As President Obama \nreminded us in his recent address, there are many thriving private \nuniversities in this country, even though they compete directly with \npublic universities.\n  Over the weekend, I was speaking with a friend of mine who is a \nlawyer. He runs his own small practice, and he is proud of it. The \nsubject of health care reform came up, and he told me he was worried. \nCosts went up so much, so fast that he could no longer afford to \nprovide health care for all of his employees. He had no choice but to \ncut benefits or drop coverage for some of the people who worked for \nhim.\n  Sadly, my friend is not alone. Thousands of American small businesses \nare face to face with the same tough choices. But it doesn't have to be \nthis way. I told my friend about the public option. I explained how it \nwould compete with private companies and the insurance industry, \ndriving prices down, which will allow him to shop around and find the \nright plan for an affordable price. He loved the idea. He told me the \npublic option would save money and allow him to commit to the people \nwho worked for him.\n  I am convinced that a public option is the best and most effective \nway to address the health care crisis in America today, and we can make \nit happen. The majority of Senate Democrats has said they would \nconsider voting for such a measure. Only one has come out against it. \nSo let's seize the chance to enact reform. Let's give the American \npeople the health care choices they deserve. After all, if the public \noption is good enough for Members of Congress, it should be good enough \nfor the American people. Let's extend a high-quality congressional \nhealth care plan to everyone. Let's pass a public option that will \nreduce costs and increase accountability. That is good policy, and it \njust so happens it is also good politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9341-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2375\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2375 and ask \nthat it be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2375.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide that all amounts in the bill provided for \ncongressional earmarks shall be made available for NextGen and NextGen \n                               programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___. (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, amounts provided in this Act for a congressionally \n     directed spending item shall be made available to the \n     Department of Transportation for NextGen and NextGen \n     programs.\n        (b) In this section, the term ``congressionally directed \n     spending item'' shall have the same meaning given such term \n     in rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment would take $1.7 billion \nin earmarks and porkbarrel projects in this bill, 589 congressionally \ndirected spending projects known by most Americans as earmarks, and \ninstead redirect that money toward air traffic control modernization. \nModernizing our outdated air traffic control system will positively \nimpact all Americans, not just a favored few. It would decrease airport \ndelays, improve the flow of commerce, and advance our Nation's air \nquality by reducing aircraft carbon emissions, unlike earmarks that \nonly affect a small segment of our Nation's population and generally \nthose Americans who happen to live in a State represented by a Senator \nwho is a member of the Appropriations Committee.\n  For example, the distinguished manager of the bill had secured more \nearmarks than any other Member--50 earmarks--including $2 million for a \nbike trail in Spokane--a bike trail. Right now, with the American \npeople hurting all over America, we are going to spend an additional $2 \nmillion of their money for a bike trail, and $750,000 for a Freight \nTransportation Policy Institute. Madam President, $750,000 of my \ntaxpayers' dollars is going to be spent in the State of Washington for \na Freight Transportation Policy Institute.\n\n[[Page S9342]]\n\n  Other earmarks in this bill include $500,000 for construction of a \nbeach park promenade in Pascagoula, MS. According to Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste--an organization that has done incredible work on \nbehalf of the taxpayers of America for many years--\n\n       The population of Pascagoula in 2008 was 23,609; if each \n     resident of the town paid $21.18 toward the beach park \n     promenade, federal taxpayers, most of whom are unlikely ever \n     to visit, would be off the hook.\n\n  That is the point. Most Americans will never benefit from these \nearmark projects, except for those who happen to ride bikes in Spokane, \nWA, or walk the beach of Pascagoula, MS.\n  Alternatively, all Americans are impacted daily by our Nation's air \ntraffic control system. Every day Americans sit on a runway and miss \nmeetings, children's soccer games, family dinners, and other important \nevents due to air traffic control delays that could have been avoided \nif our Nation had a modernized air traffic control system.\n  Thousands of goods are delayed for delivery each day due to air \ntraffic delays, which results in more than $40 billion of costs each \nyear that are passed on to consumers, according to the Joint Economic \nCommittee. The Government Accountability Office estimates that one in \nevery four flights is delayed. In 2007, the aviation industry recorded \nthe second worst year for delays, with 27 percent of all flights that \nyear being delayed. When you look at places such as the Eastern \ncorridor, it is far worse. Although air traffic overall was down in \n2008, due in part to economic factors that led airlines to reduce \nservice, there was no significant reduction in traffic at the most \ncongested airports, such as those in the New York and New Jersey area. \nCongestion and delays at key airports cascade across the entire system. \nMoreover, according to the FAA, even if traffic is reduced, congestion \nat these key airports will not be significantly reduced without \nimplementing a modernized air traffic control system.\n  The airlines have called our air traffic control system ``an outdated \nWorld War II radar'' system. The FAA's Next Generation Air \nTransportation System, NextGen, will transform the current ground-based \nradar air traffic control system to one that uses precision satellites; \ndigital, networked communications; and an integrated weather system. \nMoving from a ground-based to a satellite-based system will enable more \nflights to occupy the same airspace, meaning the ontime performance \nimprovements would be a reality with triple the aircraft capacity, \naccording to the airlines.\n  However, the administration and Congress have not provided adequate \nfunding toward air traffic control modernization and instead continue \nto fund billions of dollars of earmarks. The FAA estimates it will cost \nup to $42 billion to implement a modern air traffic control system. \nCongress only appropriated $188 million for air traffic control \nmodernization in 2008 and $638 million in 2009. The bill before the \nSenate today only dedicates $358 million toward air traffic control \nmodernization, but it dedicates $1.7 billion toward earmarks. Get that: \n$358 million toward air traffic control modernization, which will \nbenefit all Americans; $1.7 billion in earmarks.\n  Instead of providing Americans with something they want, which is \nontime airline departures and arrivals, Congress spent close to $1 \ntrillion of taxpayers' hard-earned money on a stimulus bill that \nprovided $500,000 to build a skate park in Rhode Island, $14 million \nfor construction of an airport in an Alaskan town with only 167 \nresidents that is 10 miles away from an airport, and millions to New \nYork welfare recipients for the purchase of cell phones. Congress also \nspent close to $3 billion of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars on a \nCash for Clunkers Program.\n  At some point, at some point--and it is beginning out there, my \nfriends. I tell my colleagues, it is beginning. It is beginning with \nthe tea parties; it is beginning with marches on Washington; it is \nbeginning with the demonstrations and rallies all over America. It is \nout there. They are sick and tired of the corruption that exists in our \nNation's Capital.\n  I noticed the other day there was another individual who was caught \nup in the Abramoff scandal going on trial. That is now 22 people who \nhave either pled guilty or been found guilty over the Abramoff scandal \non which I am happy to say the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, \nand I worked. And guess what the scandal was all about. It was about \nearmarks. It was about porkbarrel projects. That is what that Abramoff \nscandal was about. That is why Duke Cunningham resides in Federal \nprison. That is why there are people under investigation, and there \nwill be more indictments.\n  The American people are sick and tired of it. They are sick and tired \nof it. So we have to stop it and at least spend money on worthy \nprojects that will impact all Americans.\n  Earlier this year, the President stated:\n\n       [E]armarks have been used as a vehicle for waste, and \n     fraud, and abuse. Projects have been inserted at the 11th \n     hour, without review, and sometimes without merit, in order \n     to satisfy the political or personal agendas of a given \n     legislator, rather than the public interest. There are times \n     where earmarks may be good on their own, but in the context \n     of a tight budget might not be our highest priority.\n\n  That is what the President of the United States says. Well, if the \nPresident of the United States is serious, he will veto this bill. He \nwill veto the $1.7 billion in earmarks and porkbarrel projects that are \nin it. And he is right; earmarks have been used as a vehicle for waste.\n  In 2001, the Senate passed the fiscal year 2002 Transportation \nappropriations bill conference report that included an earmark for the \nOdyssey Maritime Discovery Center. That Discovery Center happened to be \nin Seattle, WA. I have a picture of it in the Chamber. The Discovery \nCenter opened in 1998 but has seen decreased attendance year after year \ndespite continued Federal earmarks.\n  As the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote in 2003:\n\n       Container ships and fishing nets don't scream ``sex \n     appeal''. . . .\n\n  The Discovery Center procured $250,000 from an earmark sponsored by \nthe Senator from Washington in the fiscal year 1998 Commerce-Justice-\nState appropriations bill, $3 million in the fiscal year 2002 \nTransportation appropriations bill, and $475,000 in the fiscal year \n2006 Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill.\n  As a result of that earmark, the museum put out a press release. \nMadam President, I ask unanimous consent that press release be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [Business Wire, Dec. 4, 2001]\n\n   Odyssey Expresses Appreciation to Senator Murray for Securing $3 \n Million for New Transportation Educational Initiatives and Programming\n\n       Funding will address the development of new educational \n     initiatives, programs and interactive exhibits.\n       Michael Bittner, Ph.D., Executive Director of the Odyssey \n     Maritime Discovery Center, today expressed appreciation to \n     U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), for securing $3 million \n     for new transportation educational initiatives, programs and \n     exhibits for Odyssey.\n       ``The Puget Sound region handles the second largest amount \n     of shipping container traffic in North America, demonstrating \n     that transportation is not only about laying asphalt.

Barer, \n     Odyssey chairman and local transportation executive.\n       ``Odyssey's exhibits and teaching materials on how inter-\n     modal transportation works domestically and internationally \n     go to the heart of these issues. Our annual job fair, which \n     is attended by high school students throughout the State \n     exposes our children to important and well-paying jobs in our \n     transportation sector. Senator Murray has exceedingly well-\n     served transportation and particularly this region through \n     this appropriation. I congratulate her and thank her,'' said \n     Barer.\n       Bittner said the federal funding will address the \n     development of new educational initiatives, programs and \n     interactive exhibits that educate all ages, particularly P-12 \n     school aged children in King and neighboring counties and \n     throughout Washington State, about the role of maritime in \n     all daily life as well as in the regional and global \n     economies.\n\n[[Page S9343]]\n\n       About Odyssey, The Maritime Discovery Center (www.ody.org)\n\n       Odyssey is the nation's first discovery center to celebrate \n     the contemporary links to the Puget Sound and the North \n     Pacific--including shipping, trade, transportation, \n     commercial fishing, recreation, and marine protection. \n     Odyssey's vision is to be recognized worldwide as the Portal \n     to the Pacific Experience--a one-stop, must see passageway to \n     our waterfront; a high tech, high touch source of discovery \n     that educates and enriches understanding of the maritime \n     experience.

Located on Seattle's majestic waterfront at the \n     Bell Street Pier 66, Odyssey features 20,000 square feet of \n     interactive exhibits and meeting space.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The press release states:\n\n       Michael Bittner, Executive Director of the Odyssey Maritime \n     Discovery Center, today expressed appreciation to U.S. \n     Senator Patty Murray for securing $3 million for new \n     transportation educational initiatives, programs and exhibits \n     for Odyssey. ``Washington State is the most transportation \n     and trade dependent state in the nation.

Senator Murray has \n     exceedingly well-served transportation and particularly this \n     region through this appropriation. I congratulate her and \n     thank her.''\n\n  In 1997, while seeking an earmark of $250,000 for the center, Senator \nMurray said:\n\n       The Center will establish an educational link between the \n     everyday maritime, fishing, trade, and environmental \n     activities that occur in the waters of Puget Sound and \n     Alaska, and the lessons students learn in the classroom. \n     Through high-tech and interactive exhibits, over 300,000 \n     children and adults per year will discover that what happens \n     in our waters, on our coast lines, at our ports affects our \n     State's and Nation's economic livelihood.\n\n  Madam President, 300,000 people--children and adults--do not show up \nevery year; 100,000 people do not show up every year; 50,000 people do \nnot show up every year. Madam President, 30,000 people showed up in \nmost years.\n  In January 2008, the Seattle Times reported:\n\n       The Port of Seattle wants to stop subsidizing the money-\n     losing Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center Museum, which owes \n     the Port $1.5 million in back rent and has received millions \n     more in taxpayer assistance.\n\n  The article also stated:\n\n       Odyssey, which bills itself as the nation's only \n     contemporary interactive maritime museum, has never hit its \n     attendance targets. At its inception, the facility on \n     Seattle's Pier 66 hoped to attract 300,000 visitors a year to \n     pay its rent and operating costs. Instead, it has attracted \n     fewer than 30,000 visitors most years. According to Odyssey's \n     most recent available tax form, the museum received revenues \n     of $262,000 in 2005 and had expenses of $1.6 million.\n\n  In fact, according to a February 2002 article in the Seattle Times, \n``the Port authority agreed to help Odyssey by taking 30,000 free \ntickets a year in lieu of $21,000 in monthly payments'' for rent.\n  However, the article continued:\n\n       Fewer than 10,000 of the visitors used the free tickets \n     from the port.\n\n  The Discovery Center was not even able to attract visitors when the \ntickets were free. When the Port Commission terminated the museum's \nlease, a port spokeswoman stated:\n\n       It is finally acknowledging this museum isn't ever going to \n     succeed as currently structured.\n\n  So what did Americans' hard-earned dollars get for the $3 million \nearmark for ``educational initiatives, programs, and exhibits''? \nAccording to a 2003 article in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer:\n\n       Spinner's Riddle, an informational scavenger hunt . . . At \n     each station [participants] had to answer exhibit-based \n     questions such as, ``In the Quiet Bay, what kind of worm is \n     listed?'' The answers helped solve the riddle: ``What time do \n     sharks like to go to the dentist?''\n\n  Also available due to taxpayer dollars:\n\n       A rack of orange survival suits kids can try on, a \n     simulator that lets you ``steer'' an 850-foot-long virtual \n     container ship. . . .\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n  So despite $3 million of taxpayer money spent on these interactive \nexhibits, attendance continued to fall, and this past year the museum \nclosed its doors except to host private parties such as in December \nwhen it hosted a fashion show. The invitation read:\n\n       This December, treat yourself to the Best of the Best . . . \n     the Mother of all Fashion Events. . . .\n\n  It went on to say that the museum was ``re-transformed with a massive \nstage and runway lighting and concert-quality sound you will feel the \nGlitz and Glamour of a Los Angeles Red Carpet Event.''\n  However, that was not the only earmark in the fiscal year 2002 \nappropriations bill that failed to perform.\n  Let me point out, at the time--at the time--I took to the floor and \nobjected strenuously to this $3 million earmark. I objected strenuously \nto it on the grounds--I did not know it would fail--I am not surprised \nit would fail, but I was not surprised. Why in the world, why in the \nworld--should my constituents in Arizona give $3 million to a museum \nthat is going to fail?\n  It is supposed to be for much needed transportation projects. Drive \naround America and see whether we need to spend transportation money on \na failed museum, or do we want to spend it on the things we need?\n  So that was not the only earmark in the fiscal year 2002 \nappropriations bill that failed to perform. Also tucked in--and I \nobjected to it at the time--was ``$4.5 million for a boat that nobody \nwanted,'' according to the headline of an October 14, 2007, article in \nthe Seattle Times. The article continued:\n\n       The Navy paid $4.5 million to build the boat. But months \n     before the hull ever touched the water, the Navy gave the \n     boat to the University of Washington.\n\n  If we want to give money directly to the University of Washington, my \nfriends, let's give it to the University of Washington. But this was \nsupposed to be for the U.S. Navy. And why did the Navy do that? Because \nthe Navy strongly stated they did not want the boat to start with. Yet \nthe Senator from Washington, in her wisdom, decided that the Navy \nneeded that boat. It did not need the boat.\n\n       But months before the hull ever touched the water, the Navy \n     gave the boat to the University of Washington. The school \n     never found a use for it either. Why would the Navy waste \n     taxpayer dollars on a boat nobody wanted?\n\n  Earmarks were inserted into different bills to force the Navy and the \nCoast Guard to buy boats they didn't ask for--$17.65 million in all, \n$17.65 million in all for two boats that neither the Navy nor the Coast \nGuard wanted, and now one belongs to the University of Washington and \nthe other belongs to a sheriff.\n  In fact, some of the boats were never even used, period. One boat was \ngiven to the University of Washington, which sold it to the Federal \nGovernment's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's National \nMarine Sanctuaries Program for a regional sanctuaries research program \ndoing research all along the west coast. However, NOAA e-mailed my \nstaff today and stated that this boat has been out of service since \nJanuary, since there is no funding available to support a project on \nthis boat.\n  According to a story that aired on PBS's ``Frontline,'' one of the \nCoast Guard boats was sold to the Alameda County Sheriff's Department \nand, according to a sheriff's deputy, ``We paid $1 for this boat, and I \ndon't think we actually paid a dollar, but it was turned over to us.'' \nThis is a $4.5 million boat that the Navy and Coast Guard did not want. \nThese boats were constructed--$4.5 million for each--and neither one \nwas ever used by the Coast Guard or the U.S. Navy.\n  These are just two examples of wasted taxpayer money spent on \nearmarks that were not necessary and not beneficial. Instead, Congress \nand the administration should refocus their efforts and priorities \ntoward improving all Americans' lives by modernizing our air traffic \ncontrol system.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment to take the $1.7 billion \nin earmarked funding toward the implementation of air traffic control \nmodernization that will improve the lives of all Americans.\n  There are a lot more stories out there of these earmarks and \nporkbarrel projects that were inserted, such as the museum and these \nboats the Navy and Coast Guard never wanted, and we wasted $17.5 \nmillion.\n  The American people are rising. They did it over the weekend here in \nour Nation's Capital when tens of thousands\n\n[[Page S9344]]\n\nof them said: No more mortgaging our children's futures and no more of \nthis earmarking, porkbarrel spending, which has spread corruption.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for \nbringing this amendment to the floor. I was hoping to have the chance \nto discuss some points with him. But first, let me share some \nclarifications with my colleagues.\n  If I remember correctly, cash for clunkers was an executive branch \ndecision, using money they had at their discretion. When you talk about \nmoney at discretion, huge amounts of money are going to bureaucrats in \nthe administration, and when you look at some of the spending, I think \nmany of us have wondered why it is being spent in that way. \nRegrettably, I think Congress has given the previous administration and \nthis administration far too much money without any congressional \nguidelines. If one should look at article I, sections 8 and 9 of the \nConstitution, you would see that we in the Congress have a \nresponsibility to make sure taxpayer money is spent in ways that are \nmost productive. It is our responsibility. When we make a mistake, we \ncan be held responsible. But who has ever held a bureaucrat responsible \nfor wasting billions and billions of dollars? If my colleague from \nArizona doesn't like cash for clunkers, maybe he ought to go after the \npeople in the administration who made that decision.\n  He mentions a couple of instances of abuse of the earmark process. As \nhe pointed out, those were punished criminally with criminal sanctions \nagainst the people who committed criminal activities. That is the way \nit should be.\n  We need to be able to have open and free discussions on the floor \nabout how money is spent. That is why I welcome this opportunity to \ndiscuss the points raised by my colleague from Arizona.\n  He has rightfully pointed out the importance of NextGen, the new \naviation traffic safety scheme and administration for the FAA. Well, we \nhave been supporting that--the chair, Senator Murray, and I--for years. \nWe put as much money into that program as can reasonably be spent this \nyear. That is why it is such a shock to see that he would propose to \nthrow a billion-plus dollars more into that program when it cannot be \nproperly spent. It will then be subject to use as the administration, \nin its unfettered discretion, wants to use it.\n  We believe we must continue to monitor the NextGen progress, and when \nwe have major programs like this, they require not only oversight by \nthe administration but by the Congress. That is our job. We are proud \nto do it, and we will continue to do it. We will ask the tough \nquestions that, apparently, too infrequently are asked by people in the \nexecutive branch. I assure you, we have been, we are, and we will \ncontinue to be supportive of all reasonable progress and all the work \nthat can be done on NextGen.\n  Let's just take one small example of what the Senator's language \nwould eliminate. The chair and I added money for flight safety \nofficers--people who examine airlines to make sure that those who are \nflying are flying safely.\n  Everybody heard about it and everybody still remembers, if you think \nabout it, last winter's tragic air crash in northern New York State. \nThere were so many things wrong. It was unbelievable: the black marks \non the pilot's record, the failure to have a properly trained and \ndisciplined copilot. The list of mistakes was unbelievable.\n  I had the pleasure, as I stated earlier, of going to a civic club \nluncheon in my home State in Mexico, MO, and a regional official for \nthe FAA was talking about those problems. My colleagues in the civic \nclub were astounded, and they said: Aren't you supposed to be \nregulating that? Isn't the FAA supposed to be regulating that?\n  He said: Yes, we are, but the problem is that there are not enough \nFDSOs--safety officers--to inspect the airplanes.\n  So we added money for that because all of us who fly want to see \nNextGen work. We know we need it. But in the meantime, while they are \ndoing everything they can to get NextGen working, we need to have \nflight safety officers now because almost everyone in this Chamber and \na huge number of the people we serve back in our States depend upon the \nFAA to ensure flight safety.\n  Why do we want to have oversight of NextGen? Unfortunately, the FAA \nhas a horrendous record of program management. In fact, the FAA's air \ntraffic modernization effort has been on the GAO's high-risk list since \n1995--high risk. Our Government Accountability Office says it is high \nrisk. Fortunately, though, through strict budgetary controls and \nincreased congressional oversight, this program graduated from the list \nin 2009.\n  This is not the time to give the FAA hundreds of millions, or \nbillions, of dollars with no oversight or strings attached. NextGen is \na complex effort to modernize the air traffic system. Like many big \nissues and challenges facing the government, simply providing bundles \nof funding--more than they can use--is not the answer. The FAA has \nliterally wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on similar efforts in the \npast. I would like to hear my colleagues who object to congressional \noversight explain what they are doing to ensure that those in the \nadministration who handle these dollars do the job better.\n  Some billions of dollars have been wasted and some efforts, such as \nLORAN-C, did not even produce a usable product after millions and \nmillions of taxpayer dollars were spent. Currently, 6 of the 18 major \nFAA modernization programs have experienced unacceptable cost growth \nand schedule delays. To reduce delays, increase safety, and reduce \ncongestion, the FAA needs further oversight, not resources.\n  I ask my colleagues to join us in exercising, in those committees \nwhere there is jurisdiction, proper oversight of the FAA.\n  Madam President, I will have much more to say about the importance of \ncongressional responsibility for the dollars we spend in this body. Far \ntoo much money now is being spent without congressional oversight. \nLater on, I will cite an example. When I asked a high-ranking \nadministration official when we would have a chance to oversee a \nprogram spending billions and billions of dollars in the stimulus \nprogram, I was told: You gave us this money; it is none of your \nbusiness; we are going to make those decisions. That is a recipe for \ndisaster. We have to exercise our responsibility thoughtfully and take \nresponsibility for what we do.\n  With that, I yield to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nexplaining very clearly why this amendment should be defeated by this \nbody.\n  Senator McCain has come out and offered an amendment that would take \naway funding from every earmark in the bill and put it into the Federal \nAviation Administration's NextGen program. That is our effort to \nmodernize the air traffic control system--a very important effort. I \nwill speak to that in a minute.\n  Let me speak to the earmarks. This is not a new debate. I have stood \non this floor many times, as well as other Senators, to defend the \nright of every Senator here to identify priorities for their home \nStates and to advocate for them. This bill includes earmarks because \nthe Members of the Senate have gone home and identified needs in their \ncommunities and brought them to our committee, which we have put into \nconsideration.\n  It is important to note that there was abuse in the earmark system. \nWe have now reduced earmark spending in this bill to 50 percent of what \nwe had in 2006. In fact, the earmark spending in the bill is less than \n1 percent of the total funding. But that funding is as a result of \nSenators who have gone home, worked with their constituents, identified \nprojects, brought them to the committee, and we scrutinized them. Very \nfew made it into the final bill because of the high caps we have. But \nthey were brought to us by Senators with legitimate needs in their home \nStates.\n  My concern over this amendment isn't just limited to the investments \nSenators have asked us to make in their States. I am greatly concerned,\n\n[[Page S9345]]\n\nas the Senator from Missouri pointed out, about what this amendment \nwould actually do to the FAA's NextGen program, and I am a strong \nsupporter of that. There is a need to modernize our air traffic control \nsystem. For that very reason, this bill now before us provides $865 \nmillion for programs that are essential to the NextGen effort. But in \norder for NextGen to succeed, the FAA has to do more than just put \nmoney into it. It needs, as my colleague from Missouri said, strong \noversight. If we hand that agency a blank check now for well over a \nbillion dollars, which this amendment asks for, that is not the right \nway for this body to do oversight or ensure the responsible use of the \nFederal dollars over which we have oversight.\n  The FAA has had a long history of budget overruns and schedule \nincreases in its capital programs. Our subcommittee has held numerous \nhearings on the FAA's need to manage its capital programs more \nresponsibly.\n  We have heard testimony from the Inspector General of the Department \nof Transportation on this very issue, and until only recently, the \nGovernment Accountability Office has identified this NextGen program as \na high-risk management area.\n  I encourage our colleagues to oppose this amendment. It is not the \nresponsible way to fund the FAA or the Department of Transportation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to spend a little bit of time \ntalking about the problems before us in terms of transportation, and \nthen I will go back to these amendments based on whatever the chairman \nwishes and however she wishes to handle the debate on these amendments.\n  What I think about is that right now our transportation trust fund is \nnot growing at the rate at which our needs are growing. I do not think \nanybody--neither the chairman of the Appropriations Committee nor the \ncommittee that is responsible for the transportation authorization \nprogram--would disagree with that. I do not think anybody else would \ndisagree that in a year when we are going to have a true, not an Enron \naccounting, but a true budget deficit of $1.8 trillion by the time you \ncount the money we are going to steal from Social Security and other \ntrust funds, that we are going to have $1.8 trillion we are going to \nborrow from our grandchildren, and at a time when we have, at a \nminimum, 130,000 bridges in disrepair in this country. And that is the \nDepartment of Transportation's own numbers. Out of 600,000-plus, \n130,000 either have to have lesser loads or fewer number of vehicles \ngoing across them or do not meet the designs needed for the loads they \nare carrying or are crumbling and are not expected to collapse but are \nfalling apart, that at this time we ought not to be spending our money \non anything except roads and bridges.\n  The debate Senator McCain put out here is just one way of getting at \nthe problem. Inside the Transportation bill is a requirement that if a \nState gets money and they want to fix a bridge, 10 percent of the money \nto fix that bridge has to go to make things look nice around it. That \nis great if we are running a great surplus or we are not borrowing the \nmoney from our kids. But right now the fact that we mandated that \nobligated moneys to State highway and transportation departments, that \nthey have to spend 10 percent of the money that is obligated on \naesthetics makes no common sense. It does if we have an excess of \nfunds. It is something to which we would all agree. But when we have \nthe problems where we have 13,000 people a year dying because of the \nquality of the roads in this country--not quality of vehicles, not \ndriver error, but the quality of roads--and we have this large number \nof bridges that are truly in the long run not safe, why would we be \nspending money on anything other than roads and bridges in a \ntransportation project, as far as surface transportation?\n  I am not talking about trains and inner-city buses. I know we have to \ndo that as well. But for the proportion that goes out, why would we not \nspend that money on the real needs that are out there?\n  Madam President, 13,000 lives is a lot of lives. Actually, it is one \nof those benchmarks on which you can measure Congress. We would rather \nhave $5 billion worth of earmarks that make us look good at home than \nmake sure that $5 billion goes toward saving somebody's life by \nrepairing a road that needs to be fixed right now--right now--not next \nyear, not 2 years from now, right now.\n  Why are we going to have these things that make us look good and may \nbe a need but may not necessarily be a priority? How many of them are a \npriority over the fallen-down bridges in this country?\n  The families who lose members because of road quality in this country \ndo not think those are priorities. They think fixing the roads and \nbridges are priorities. But you see, we have a disease in the Senate \nand in the Congress: We think we know better. We do not want to make \nthe tough priorities that might not sell well in a particular area in \nour home State that would, in fact, solve some of the major problems \nwith transportation in this country because we will not look as good. \nAnd yet we can spend money on taxiways for airports that have six \nflights a day and have very few people through it and subsidize every \npassenger to the tune of $130 when if they could drive an hour and find \nan airport, we would not have to spend any of that money on it.\n  Most of us drive an hour to get to the airport. But yet we do \nearmarks. We decide, the wisdom of us--it is pretty interesting. I \nheard the ranking member talk about oversight. There is not any \nsignificant oversight going on in this Congress. I almost laughed out \nloud. For every hearing we have, we ought to have 10 oversight \nhearings. We talk about we are going to say where the money goes, and \nthen we don't follow where the money goes. We don't do our job of \noversight.\n  The NextGen, I understand that is an important priority. I am not \nquestioning that. But the point of Senator McCain's amendment is not \nNextGen, it is earmarks. It is the fact that at least here is something \nwe know is going to buy safety in aviation, whereas the rest of the \nearmarks are not. We have an earmarked museum in the bill. Tell me, at \na time when we have 9.7 percent unemployment, we have a trust fund for \ntransportation that is belly up, that we are stealing the money from \nour kids every 6 months to keep it viable rather than from the taxes of \nconsumption of gasoline and diesel, tell me that is a priority right \nnow when we have run a $1.8 trillion deficit.\n  The fact is we refuse--we refuse--to make the hard choices in \nWashington. We make choices for our political purposes. We make choices \nfor the well endowed. We make choices for the well connected, for the \nwell heeled, whether it is beach nourishment and the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars that are made off that or it is a museum or a bike \npath or the restoration of a train station. Tell me where those are in \nterms of priorities of the 9.7 percent of Americans who do not have a \njob and are looking for one and the other 6 percent who are so \ndiscouraged they are not even looking anymore. Tell me why that is a \npriority. Senator McCain's point is dead on.\n  There is a commonsense test, which is, would the average guy with the \nsame amount of money fix the bridges and fix the highways or would he \ndo the superfluous stuff, the enhancement stuff, the feel-good stuff if \nit were about his kids and his family? The average guy would not. But \nyou see, we are not the average guy. We do not have to play by the \nrules because we know that the court of public opinion only comes after \nus once every 6 years, and if we can, in fact, enhance our ability to \nraise our campaign funds, if we can, in fact, look good to the well \nconnected, then we are going to be able to find a way to say a message \nsomething different than what we actually did.\n  That is pretty cynical, but when we have 13,000 people dying on roads \nevery year because of the quality of the roads--and those are not my \nnumbers, those are NHTSA's numbers--wouldn't you think every dollar we \nhave ought to fix the roads and fix the bridges and wait on the \naesthetics until later? Wouldn't you think the common man with common \nsense would say, Let's do the most important thing first, that buys us \nthe most safety and the best transportation effect, rather than make \nthe politicians and their well-heeled buddies look good?\n  I understand why people are upset with the Congress. It is because we \nmake decisions that do not have much connection with reality. And then \nafter we do it and we don't do the oversight that is required, we blame \nit on an administration.\n  I thought the debate about whether we could trust the FAA--we can \ntrust the FAA if we do the following things: make sure they will be \nbefore us every 2 or 3 weeks talking about the progress of what they \nare doing; making sure we are having the oversight hearings; making \nsure we are doing our job to make sure the bureaucracy with which we \ngive the responsibility to carry out policy is, in fact, being held \naccountable and, if not, withdraw the funds through a special \nrescission package to make sure that since you are not acting \nresponsibly, we are going to withdraw your money. The last time there \nwas a true rescission in the Congress was 1995.\n  We talk a big game about what a good job we do in oversight and good \njudgment. What happens is staff members make the decision of what gets \nincluded and what does not get earmarked. Sometimes it is based on \neconomic priorities and sometimes it is based on the economic priority \nof who is running for reelection.\n\n[[Page S9347]]\n\n  The other problem we have is things are not very transparent here, in \nspite of our President's desire that they be that way. I have a couple \nof amendments that are going to make sure the public reports that are \nrequired in this bill are made available to the American people, not \njust to the committee staff; to make sure that HUD reports to Congress \non homes they own and the cost to the taxpayers, not just to a \ncommittee of Congress.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2371\n\n  I now call up amendment No. 2371 and ask that it be the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wish to talk about what this amendment \ndoes. This amendment forbids the mandatory spending of that 10 percent \nof money on things that are not going to make a difference when it \ncomes to highway safety and bridge repair. And it says that Gary \nRidley, the director of the department of transportation in Oklahoma, \ncan take all of the money and make new bridges and new roads and repair \nbridges and does not have to worry about taking 10 percent of the money \nand spending it on aesthetics.\n  At another time, another place, maybe we would want to do that. But \nwith our infrastructure crumbling, and with the trust fund not with \nenough money because of the economic shape in which we find ourselves, \nto continue to mandate that every transportation department in the \ncountry has to spend a full 10 percent of their money, not on what is \nimportant, but on something somebody may like, not on something that is \nabout safety, but on what somebody may like and what may look good, to \nme does not connect with common sense.\n  I am probably a minority in that opinion in this building, but I am \nnot in the minority in that opinion in this country. When times are \ngood, we can afford to make such discretionary spending mandates on the \nStates. When times are tough, when infrastructure is in poor shape, \nwhen the quality of our roads is taking people's lives every day, and \nwhen our bridges are falling down and chunks are falling off of them \nand injuring people severely, as happened in Tulsa 6 weeks ago on an \ninterstate bridge, and falls through the windshield of a car and \ncritically injures an individual who is driving down the interstate, it \nis time for us to use common sense on how we spend this money.\n  I would make one other point; that is, that this bill, compared to \nlast year, in terms of real numbers--not in terms of the numbers that \nhave been spun out there--is a 22-percent increase. If you go through \nall the appropriations bills we are bringing to the floor and what we \nhave already passed, it is like there is no recession going on. There \nis absolutely no inflation. Yet we are growing government at 12 times \nthe rate of inflation, and we are doing it on bill after bill after \nbill.\n  There is no apology anywhere from the Appropriations Committee that \nwe are sorry we have to spend this increased amount of money, in spite \nof the fact we absolutely don't have it and that we can't winnow down \nand make our priorities sharper and better. No, what we do is we just \nbump the number.\n  In case you are interested, if you include contract authority, there \nis $75.8 billion. Even if you don't include contract authority, you \nhave a 12-percent increase. In the HUD portion of the bill, we have a \n10-percent increase. So it is not just transportation. We are \nincreasing housing and urban development 10 percent. So there is no \ninflation; tax revenues are down. There is no question we have greater \nneeds, but there is no force to say: How do we more efficiently put out \nthe money? How do we hold those spending the money more accountable? \nHow do we get greater value for the money we are spending? No. You know \nwhat we do? We take the credit card out of our pocket, and we put it in \nan ATM that says: Charge to our grandchildren and charge to our \nchildren. That is what we do. Then we come up here and we say: This is \nabsolutely necessary.\n  The vast majority of families in this country today are making tough \ndecisions--very tough decisions. They are either saying: I have a job \nor I am lucky to have a job or, boy, am I thankful. I don't want to end \nup without a job, so I think I will start prioritizing where I have to \nspend money. The people where one of the two workers in the family have \nlost a job are making those tough decisions every day: What is an \nabsolute necessity and what isn't?\n  Actually, it is more than the average American. Almost every American \nis making those kinds of decisions today. But isn't it curious the \nCongress isn't? Isn't it curious we don't prioritize? Isn't it curious \nthat it has been years--whether under Republican control or Democratic \ncontrol--since we have had an appropriations bill that comes out and \nspends less money? Are all these agencies efficient? Could it be done \nin a better way to get better value with less money? Could we force \nsavings in these branches of government?\n  Those questions aren't even being asked. There are no priority \nquestions being asked. What we do is we say: Here is our 302(b) number; \nhow are we going to spend the money, rather than seeing what is the \nneed, how efficient is the bureaucracy utilizing that money under the \npolicy proscriptions we give them, and what are we going to do about \nit? So we come out spending hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and \nhundreds of billions of dollars with millions of earmarks.\n  I heard mention about the earmarks. What the American people need to \nknow about earmarks is this: It is not the earmark that is bad, it is \nthe extortion that comes with the earmark. Because everybody here knows \nthat if you have an earmark in an appropriations bill and you don't \nvote for the appropriations bill, the next time you want an earmark, \nguess what happens. They happen to remind you that: Oh, you had an \nearmark in the last one, but you didn't vote for the bill. So since you \nare not supporting our bill, we are probably not going to be as likely \nto include your earmark. What does that do? The problem with earmarks \nis it takes the focus off what we are doing collectively in the best \ninterest of the country and makes the focus about the individual and \nthe State.\n  There is nothing in this document--which is the U.S. Constitution--\nthat gives us the right to think about our States. When you are sworn \nin here, they do not say: Mr. Coburn, Oklahoma, you will uphold the \nConstitution as long as it protects Oklahoma. It says: You will uphold \nthe Constitution. Our Founders knew that any State couldn't be healthy \nunless we as a nation were healthy. Yet earmarks undermine that every \ntime and force us back to parochialism--not Federalism but \nparochialism. So we take the money from individuals in the various \nStates, and then, through our wisdom of all knowledge in Washington, we \nsend it back so we look good, rather than leaving the money there in \nthe first place and letting you decide how best to spend your own \nmoney. So we don't lessen spending. We always increase it.\n  We claim oversight--which we never do to the level that is required \nwith a government as big as this--and then we complain that somebody \nwants to eliminate earmarks, and not because the individual earmark may \nnot be a good thing--I can't think of many earmarks that probably \naren't good things--but because the earmarks aren't necessarily a \npriority for the Nation as a whole. That is the difference in being and \nenhancing statesmanship versus politics. It is OK for Oklahoma to lose \nfor a period of time if our country gets better. I have explained that \nto my State.\n  I have refused to do earmarks for my State. The reason is we are in a \nbig pot of trouble right now as a nation--a large pot of trouble. If \nyou watch the dollar index in the markets, what you see happening in \nthe last 2 weeks is the value of your savings going down because the \nvalue of the dollar is declining rapidly. Everybody knows that the \nmoney we are borrowing today will only be able to be paid back through \nhighly inflated dollars. So what you have worked for your entire life, \nwhat you have dreamed for your kids, we are undermining here a little \nbit in this very bill. It is just a little bit, but a whole bunch of \nlittle bits becomes a lot.\n  So here we go. We don't make the priorities, we don't make the hard \nchoices, and we increase the spending a ridiculous amount for the time \nwe find ourselves in, knowing a good portion of the spending is going \nto be borrowed\n\n[[Page S9348]]\n\nfrom our kids. We watch the dollar flounder, knowing that the amount \nyou have put aside for your children in the future isn't going to be \nworth anything. It is a pretty sick, neurotic system we are operating \nunder because it doesn't have enough sunshine on it, and that was the \npurpose for Senator McCain's amendment. That is the purpose for this \namendment, to have some transparency. Let's have some common sense.\n  Let's not force State transportation departments that need critical \ndollars for bridge repair and road repair to spend it on a bicycle path \nnobody is going to ride or a sound barrier that truly doesn't cut the \nsound. Let's spend it on roads and bridges. Let's not force them to \nmake choices that are stupid. Let's trust people to do what is right.\n  There is another observation I would make, and then I will close. I \nwas born in 1948, and I have seen a shift in our country in that 60-\nplus years. Our nature and our history used to be that we trusted \nAmerican citizens. I am talking of the Federal Government. We assumed \nyou would do the right thing. Unfortunately, today, so much of the \nassumption of the Federal Government--especially as it relates to the \nStates--is on the basis that we know you are going to do the wrong \nthing, and we are here to catch you; that we know better, and we are \ngoing to tell you how to do it, when to do it, and where to do it.\n  That has come about as we have had Supreme Court rulings taking away \nthe constraints our Founders said were necessary. It is called the \nenumerated powers of the Constitution. It is article I, section 8, if \nyou want to look it up. If you read what Madison and Jefferson had to \nsay about that, we have been totally violating the intent of what they \nsaid, what they meant, and what they knew we would say about what they \nmeant for the last 30 years in this country. So we find ourselves in a \nposition where we dominate with the power of dollars and taxation to \nthe detriment of our freedom, to the detriment of common sense, and to \nthe detriment of good will.\n  I am not sure how the chairman and ranking member will respond to \nthis amendment, but for this time and this situation we find ourselves \nin, we ought to eliminate this mandatory 10 percent and let Oklahoma \nand Kansas and Texas and Kentucky and New York build bridges and \nhighways, not build aesthetics with the money which we took from them \nand are now sending it back but sending it with all these restrictions \non it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I wish to thank Senator Coburn for \ndoing what we have been asking him and other Senators to do and that is \nto come to the floor and get their amendments offered.\n  I will be talking with the Senator from Oklahoma, over the next short \nwhile, to figure out the order in moving to his amendments for votes, \nas he has requested. We do have another amendment that had been offered \nby Senator McCain, amendment No. 2375, which we would like to get a \nvote on before the caucus luncheons.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2375\n\n  So I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2375 be made the \npending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing no objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we are currently working out with both \nsides to move to a vote fairly quickly, so I would advise Senators' \noffices to be ready for a vote shortly, and we will wait for that to \noccur here as soon as we can make that happen.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I join with my colleague in thanking the \nSenator from Oklahoma for offering these amendments. We are looking at \nthese amendments. I think they are good amendments, and I hope they can \nbe accepted. We have some of our staff looking at the details of some \nof the amendments to see what impact they have. We have to determine \nwhether there would be any untoward consequences from one of the \namendments, which I think probably comes within the jurisdiction of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, so I would invite them to come \ndown and look at it.\n  But I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for offering his amendments and \nfor bringing them up for discussion, and I join with my colleague from \nWashington, the chair of the subcommittee, in urging that we move \nforward with a vote. We have lots of work to do. We were on this on \nThursday and Friday and Monday. Now it is Tuesday, and we have a short \nday, and then there is Wednesday and there is Thursday. This bill needs \nto be passed, so moving the amendments forward, getting votes on them, \nhaving the discussions is very important.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent at 12:24 today \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the McCain amendment No. \n2375, with 2 minutes prior to the vote divided and controlled in the \nusual form, and that no amendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the amendment would take $1.7 billion in \nthis bill for the 589 congressionally directed spending projects, known \nby most Americans as earmarks, and redirect that money toward air \ntraffic control modernization. Every day, Americans sit on a runway, \nmiss meetings, children's soccer games, family dinners, and other \nimportant events due to air traffic delays that could have been avoided \nif our Nation had modernized the air traffic control system. The \nGovernment Accountability Office estimates that one in every four \nflights is delayed.\n  A major issue, though, here as important as modernization of the air \ntraffic control system is this bill has 589 earmarked projects on it \nworth $1.7 billion when we are facing the highest deficits in the \nhistory of this country. Americans all over this country are rising and \nsaying stop, stop this porkbarrel earmarking which breeds corruption in \nthe Nation's Capitol.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the bill before us contains 50 percent \nfewer earmarks than in 2006. Importantly, these are priorities of \nSenators who have brought them to us. They are less than 1 percent of \nthe bill. Even more important, what the amendment before us does, and I \nam a strong supporter of NextGen, is it puts money to the FAA that they \ncannot spend.\n  This is a program that does need strong oversight. We have been told \nthat in our committee time and time again by the IG and others before \nus. We want to move forward on the NextGen and we want to do it in a \nresponsible way. This amendment will give them money that they will not \nbe able to spend.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield all of our time, move to table the amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Ohio Mr. (Brown), the \nSenator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), the Senator from Washington (Ms. \nCantwell), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mrs. Hutchison).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 2370, 2371, and 2372\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have decided to come to the Chamber in \nmy capacity as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee \nto address a number of Coburn amendments that he has either laid down \nor intends to lay down, and I hope we can work to defeat these \namendments, as I understand them, and I want to say why.\n  We have a very important relationship with our States when it comes \nto transportation and highway programs, and we work with them on many \naspects of transportation. We have something called the Transportation \nEnhancement Program. It is a TE program. It was created in 1991 in the \nISTEA bill, and one of the purposes was to encourage investments in \nmany areas that have been overlooked. I want to give you an example of \nthose.\n  Since 1992, because of this TE Program, over $11.5 billion has been \nmade available to the States for some very important purposes that deal \nwith safety, that deal with making sure our highways are kept in a \ncondition we want to see them kept. I will give more examples of the \nfunding. But over that period of time, that $11.5 billion has created \n399,000 jobs. Let me repeat that. This special program Senator Coburn \nwants to strip--and he wants to strip parts of it--is responsible for \n399,000 jobs since 1992. I am here to say--because I know my friend, \nSenator Murray, agrees with me--of all the times not to visit more job \nlosses on our people, it certainly is now. Jobs are key, and the Coburn \namendment is a jobs killer.\n  Let me tell you about the various areas that fall under this program \nhe is taking the ax to.\n  Environmental mitigation. This includes projects that address water \npollution due to highway runoff. We just read a front-page story in the \nNew York Times where we see terrible water pollution affecting our \nchildren. They had a picture of a child who has been drinking water \nthat really has not been tested in the right way according to the law. \nThis child's teeth all have to be capped because his teeth rotted. So \nwe want to make sure we do not let that runoff get into waterways.\n  Also, we hear about wildlife mortality. Anyone who has seen the \nresult of a crash between a car and, let's say, a deer on a road knows \nthis is a horrific situation for all parties, and it is a matter of \nlife or death for drivers and their passengers. That is what some of \nthis money is used for and that is what our friend, Senator Coburn, \nwants to take the ax to, as far as I understand it.\n  Then there are facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists and safety \nand educational activities for pedestrians. Residents of my State are \nstrong supporters of spending transportation funds on bicycle paths and \npedestrian facilities. We all know walking and biking are forms of \ntransportation which should not be cut but, rather, encouraged.\n  Other categories of TE, the transportation enhancements, that it is \nmy understanding Senator Coburn wants to cut: acquisition of scenic \neasements and scenic history sites, including historic battlefield \nsites. Does he think that little of the history of the country that he \nwants to take an ax to this, scenic or historic highway programs, \nincluding the provision of tourist and welcome center facilities? \nAgain, tourism is one of the things we need to build up. There are many \nmillions of jobs related to tourism, landscaping, and other scenic \nbeautification. We all know and take pride in our communities. Highway \nbeautification, to me, is a key part of our quality of life--historic \npreservation, rehabilitation, and operation of historic transportation \nbuildings.\n\n  We have seen some of those. We have seen them in places as far flung \nas New York to places in St. Louis, MO, to San Francisco, CA--\npreservation of abandoned railway cars, including conservation and use \nof the cars for pedestrian or bike trails; inventory control and \nremoval of outdoor advertising and archeological planning and research. \nSenator Coburn would have us believe that transportation enhancements \nare a low-priority project. These are investments that put hundreds of \nthousands of Americans to work. These are investments that improve \nsafety, prevent pollution, save fuel, and improve the quality of life \nfor millions of Americans.\n  I wonder if Senator Murray and I can engage for a minute here through \nthe Chair.\n  What is the timing of when these amendments will be voted on? Can the \nchairman tell me?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from \nCalifornia, the Senator from Oklahoma has offered a number of \namendments. We are hoping to debate them this afternoon and vote on \nthem tomorrow morning.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask, through the Chair, if the chairman of the \nsubcommittee would allow me to be heard for a minute before we have a \nvote on any of these amendments that deal with transportation \nenhancement programs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we will make sure, as we put together the \norder for tomorrow, the Senator can be heard before the votes occur.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2366, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2366, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2366, as modified.\n\n\n[[Page S9350]]\n\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To permit Amtrak passengers to safely transport firearms and \n                  ammunition in their checked baggage)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Funding Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, beginning on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, amounts made available in this Act for the National \n     Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) shall immediately \n     cease to be available if after March 31, 2010, Amtrak \n     prohibits the secure transportation of firearms on passenger \n     trains.\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``secure \n     transportation of firearms'' means--\n       (1) if an Amtrak station accepts checked baggage for a \n     specific Amtrak route, Amtrak passengers holding a ticket for \n     such route are allowed to place an unloaded firearm or \n     starter pistol in a checked bag on such route if--\n       (A) before checking the bag or boarding the train, the \n     passenger declares to Amtrak, either orally or in writing, \n     that the firearm is in his or her bag and is unloaded;\n       (B) the firearm is carried in a hard-sided container;\n       (C) such container is locked; and\n       (D) only the passenger has the key or combination for such \n     container; and\n       (2) Amtrak passengers are allowed to place small arms \n     ammunition for personal use in a checked bag on an Amtrak \n     route if the ammunition is securely packed--\n       (A) in fiber, wood, or metal boxes; or\n       (B) in other packaging specifically designed to carry small \n     amounts of ammunition.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of amendment No. \n2366, as modified, which I have offered on behalf of millions of law-\nabiding gun owners across the country.\n  Earlier this year, I offered an amendment to the budget that would \nhave limited certain budget opportunities to Amtrak, unless this \nfederally subsidized agency enacted policies to accommodate passengers' \nsecond amendment rights. The amendment I offered passed by a bipartisan \nvote of 63 to 35, but it was not included in the final version of the \nlegislation when it returned from conference.\n  Therefore, I am here on the floor to try again. In our country today, \nairline passengers may transport firearms and ammunition in secure \nchecked baggage when declared during the check-in process. But, on the \nother hand, Amtrak passengers are not permitted to do likewise. This \nmeans that sportsmen who wish to use an Amtrak train for hunting trips \ncannot do so because they are not allowed to bring a firearm in checked \nluggage--something that is done every day at airports across our \ncountry.\n  I want to emphasize that this amendment only deals with secured and \nchecked luggage, as checked baggage on Amtrak trains. Law-abiding gun \nowners should not be penalized for seeking alternative means of travel. \nAt one time, Amtrak accepted firearms in secure checked baggage, but \nthis policy was changed in 2001.\n  The commonsense amendment before us today is straightforward. It \nsimply says that if Amtrak continues to deny the right of gun owners to \nsecurely transport firearms in checked luggage, the rail line will no \nlonger receive a Federal subsidy of $1.55 billion. At the request of \nthe leadership of the committee, I have modified my amendment to make \nit effective only after March 31, 2010, in order to give the agency \nadequate time in which to comply with this amendment.\n  I want my colleagues to know that the amendment before us today \nmirrors current TSA requirements to check a firearm for air travel. I \nmust say these requirements are detailed and strict. For example, \nshould my amendment pass, the following requirements must be met:\n  No. 1, a passenger who wishes to transport a firearm must be \ntravelling on a route that accepts checked luggage.\n  No. 2, the passenger must declare the firearm before boarding the \ntrain.\n  No. 3, the firearm must be unloaded and stored in a hard-side \ncontainer that is locked, as is required on the airlines.\n  No. 4, only the passenger can have the key or combination for the \ncontainer.\n  This was done successfully by Amtrak prior to 2001, without incident. \nRegional rail lines, such as Alaska Railroad Corporation, allow \nfirearms, as I am trying to do in this amendment, and that is done \ncurrently in Alaska Railroad Corporation, again, without incident.\n  It is sometimes much more convenient for sportsmen to travel by rail, \nparticularly in rural and remote parts of the country. The Alaska \nRailroad Corporation knows there is no need to show prejudice to lawful \nAmerican sportsmen. That is why their travellers may transport firearms \nin checked luggage, and that is why we are asking nothing more than \nthat and nothing less than that of the government-controlled Amtrak \nsystem.\n  I might also add that spending is certainly out of control in \nWashington, and it is hard for me to imagine Congress considering \nproviding over $1.5 billion to Amtrak, while the rail line \nintentionally limits its revenue and chooses not to receive passenger \nmiles from this specific and law-abiding segment of travelers.\n  Americans should not have their second amendment rights restricted \nfor any reason, particularly if they choose to travel on America's \nfederally subsidized rail line.\n  A vote in support of this amendment is a vote in support of the \nsecond amendment and for the right of gun owners across America. I urge \nadoption of the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2376\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside any \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2376.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2376.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To affirm the continuing existence of the community service \n requirements under section 12(c) of the United States Housing Act of \n                                 1937)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec_. None of the funds made available in this Act shall be \n     used to restrict implementation or enforcement of the \n     community service requirements under section 12(c) of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437j(c)).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, my amendment, No. 2376, is very simple and \nstraightforward. To understand it, we need to go back a little bit, to \n1998. In 1998, Congress passed the Quality Housing and Work \nResponsibility Act, a law requiring all able-bodied people living in \npublic housing to perform 8 hours per month of community service, with \nthe idea that individuals who are getting this benefit from all of the \nother taxpayers should give back, should contribute to the community as \nsome partial repayment for the very significant benefit they are \ngetting. I think that concept had--and I certainly hope it still has--\nwidespread consensus, bipartisan support. It has been the law since \n1998.\n  Unfortunately, some folks in Congress--I believe a minority, but some \nfolks in Congress--want to throw this basic, straightforward community \nservice requirement out the window. In fact, in 2001, these proponents \nactually got language included in the VA/HUD appropriations bill which \ntemporarily, for that one fiscal year, did do away with this community \nservice requirement. It was just that 1 year. That is the only year \nsince 1998 where the requirement was thrown out the window, but it did \nhappen in that year.\n  Unfortunately, those same folks, like-minded folks, have made the \nattempt again, and in this year's VA/HUD appropriations bill on the \nHouse side, before a lot of advocates for the community service \nrequirement were\n\n[[Page S9351]]\n\nable to take notice, a similar amendment doing away with the community \nservice requirement was passed through the House by voice. Again, this \nslipped through. The advocates of the community service requirement did \nnot notice; otherwise, they would have demanded a rollcall vote. But it \ndid slip through by voice.\n  It is very important that we correct that and preserve the community \nservice requirement in the Senate version of the bill so we can also \npreserve it in the final version of this appropriations bill. This is a \nvery basic, straightforward idea with which I believe the huge majority \nof the American people agree. It is simply saying: If you are getting a \nbenefit from the taxpayer, you are getting free or highly subsidized \npublic housing, and you are able-bodied, then you should help repay for \nthat benefit by simply devoting 8 hours per month--not per week, 8 \nhours per month--to community service.\n  I want to emphasize a few things. No. 1, this applies to fully able-\nbodied recipients of the benefit only. Exempted residents, for \ninstance, include those who are 62 years old or older, those who are \ndisabled and can certify they cannot comply with the requirement, \ncaretakers of a person with a disability, those engaged in work \nactivities or are exempt from work activities under TANF, family \nmembers in compliance with TANF, or the State welfare program's work \nrequirements. That is separate, and they would be exempt and are exempt \nfrom this.\n  Still, according to the Congressional Research Service, after you \ntake all those exempt individuals out, HUD estimates there are \napproximately 100,000 to 150,000 households that include folks who \nwould have to meet this requirement.\n  I believe, when you consider the requirement, 8 hours of community \nservice per month, when you consider the exemptions for folks over 62, \nfor folks who have any disability, for folks who are not able-bodied in \nany way, this public service requirement is truly minimal and \nthoroughly reasonable. I believe that is why it passed into law in 1998 \nwith broad public and bipartisan support. I believe that is why we \nshould retain it in law today and make sure the House attempt to throw \nthat requirement out the window is not successful.\n  Public housing authorities are given broad discretion in implementing \nand enforcing this requirement. There is no absolute penalty for not \nmeeting this requirement. Folks are not immediately thrown out of their \npublic housing. All of this has been done in an as modest, frankly, and \nabsolutely reasonable way as possible. I urge my colleagues, Democrats \nand Republicans, to retain this important part of present law, to \nretain this commonsense approach that a wide majority, a broad majority \nof the American people support. I certainly hope this amendment could \nbe accepted or, if not, retained by a good vote on the floor of the \nSenate that is overwhelming and bipartisan.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold the request for a \nquorum call?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Louisiana offers an amendment that \nmakes sure the community service requirement for people living in \npublic housing remains in effect. This includes part of the existing \nlaw and is currently being enforced by public housing authorities. What \nthe amendment of the Senator does is simply restate current law. I will \nbe happy to accept it. If the Senator is willing, we can take it on a \nvoice vote at the present time. I am willing to move forward with it.\n  Mr. VITTER. I will be happy to consider that offer and get back to \nthe distinguished Senator. My only concern is we have as much \nammunition as possible to retain this provision in conference, which a \nvery good rollcall vote could perhaps give us. That is my only concern, \nsince the House version of the bill has taken this language out. I will \nbe happy to consider that offer and personally follow up with the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Again, we are happy to accept the amendment right now. \nIf the Senator wants to have a vote, if we can work out a time to do \nthat, I am happy to do that as well.\n  Mr. VITTER. I yield my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to give actually \na little bit of a history lesson, to look back and also look forward. I \nask my colleagues to join me in looking back some 300-and-almost-75 \nyears. Roughly at that time the first Swedes and Finns sailed to \nAmerica on a couple of boats, one of which was called the Kalmar \nNyckel.\n  The first Swedes and Finns came to shore--actually, they came up the \nDelaware Bay, up into the Delaware River, and they took a left turn at \nan uncharted river and decided to name it after the child Queen of \nSweden, naming the river the ``Christina River.'' They landed their \nboats at a place which we now call The Rocks and decided to name that \narea the ``Colony of New Sweden.'' The first Swedes, the first Finns in \nAmerica came ashore in what is now really Wilmington, DE. For the first \nyear, they never called it Wilmington, they called it the Colony of New \nSweden.\n  They came by ships, and for about the next 300 years, a lot of ships \nwere built along the banks of the Christina River, especially during \nthe period from 1945 to 1946 during the heart of World War II. Among \nthe ships that were built there were destroyer escorts, troop landing \nships, and a variety of other ships that helped to win the war, helped \nto win World War II.\n  When World War II was at its most robust, fullest form, we had 10,000 \npeople who worked on the banks of the Christina River building those \nships. A few years after the war ended, what had been a vibrant \nshipbuilding area along the Christina River dried up, the activity went \naway. The war was won, and what had been a vibrant shipbuilding area \nbecame, over time, a decaying industrial wasteland with relatively \nlittle new activity.\n  In the 1960s, I-95 was built up the northeast corridor of our \ncountry, the mid-Atlantic part of our country, and it literally cut \nWilmington, DE, in half. Off to the right, to the east of I-95, was the \nChristina River, and add to that the northeast corridor, the Amtrak \nmain lines between Washington and Boston. The main line of Amtrak also \nsat between I-95 and the Christina River and served to make it \ndifficult for people even to access the river, almost hard for them to \neven know it was there.\n  I became Governor in 1993, and toward the end of that year, I was \nvisited by a former Governor, Russ Peterson, and by a former president \nof the University of Delaware.\n  They said: We have been thinking of an idea. We have actually been \nworking under the direction of a joint resolution signed by former \nGovernor Mike Castle to think about what the potential could be for \ndevelopment along the Christina River and the Brandywine Creek not far \naway. We haven't finished our job. We have had a good start on it, but \nwe need more time. We are about to run out of time under the joint \nresolution. We wonder if we can have a little more time to think it \nthrough.\n  I said: Hey, look, I am up to my eyeballs in alligators. I have been \nGovernor for less than a year. You guys take as much time as you need.\n  They went away, and I wasn't sure I would ever see them again or talk \nto them again. As it turns out, in about 6 months they came back, and \nthey said: Do you remember our coming in and talking to you?\n  I said: Yes, I remember that.\n  They said: We have gone back and done more work on a vision, if you \nwill, of what the Christina River, this industrial wasteland along \neither side of the river, of what it could be, and we would like to \nshare that with you today.\n  I said: Have at it.\n  By that time, I had been Governor about a year and a half, things \nwere settling down, and I was ready to listen. They had these big \narchitect renderings of a riverfront that certainly looked nothing like \nthe Christina River, didn't look at all like an industrial wasteland. \nThere was a river\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\nthat was pristine, with parks, walking paths, boats out on the river, \nmuseums, restaurants, places for people to live, places for people to \nwork, theaters, museums. And I never will forget--I looked at them. I \nwas blown away by the vision.\n  I said to former Governor Peterson: Who is going to make all of this \nhappen?\n  He looked me right in the eye and he said: You are.\n  I said: Why me?\n  He said: Well, because you are the Governor.\n  I said: Well, I love this vision, and let's see if we can't help to \nrealize it.\n  I think that conversation was in 1994. Anybody who today takes the \ntrain up the northeast corridor and stops at the Wilmington train \nstation would say we have made a lot of progress. The place is cleaned \nup. We actually have walking paths along the river. We have parks. We \nhave beautiful places where people live and condominiums and apartments \nas well as other homes. We have restaurants and we have museums. We \nhave hope--that is what I am here to talk about today--for a children's \nscience museum along the riverfront. But it is a vision that has been \nrealized. A lot of people come there to eat at restaurants along the \nriverfront. And the river itself is being cleaned up, the water quality \nis being cleaned up, and the environmental hazards, and so forth, the \nwaste that was left there has been for the most part cleaned up.\n  Probably in another month or so, less than a month or so, we are \ngoing to open a 250-acre wildlife refuge named after former Governor \nPeterson, built in partnership with the DuPont Company and the Nature \nEducation Center. People will come and just enjoy, literally on the \noutskirts of the city, a large, urban wildlife refuge with walking \npaths and see what might have been some 100 years ago or 50 years ago \nin that place.\n  About 10 years ago, when I was nearing the end of my time as \nGovernor, my second term, a group of citizens in our State came to see \nme, and they said they were exited about the riverfront and what was \nhappening there.\n  They said: You know, Delaware does not have a children's museum.\n  I think every other State does. We do not. In fact, it turns out \nthere are about 250 children's museums across the country.\n  They said: We are interested in having a children's museum to go with \nall of the other attractions on the riverfront.\n  We talked about it for some time, and I said: I like the idea. I like \nthe concept. But to tell you the truth, I would be a lot more \ninterested in it if it were a children's science museum.\n  At the time, I was trying to figure out, how do we get kids \nmotivated, excited about science, how do we get them excited about \ncareers in science? It is all well and good, the State is big in \ntourism, big in financial services, we have had a great history with \nthe chemical industry, shipbuilding at one time. But in our Nation and \nin my State, we need more scientists, we need more engineers, we need \nmore people who have facility in mathematics and who are going to go \nout and become inventors, create things, things of value that will help \nus, among other things, create jobs in the 21st century. Whether it is \nin clean energy or conservation or wind, solar, new ways to create \nnuclear power, we need people with those credentials too.\n  It starts very young. We have adopted, in my State, rigorous academic \nstandards for math and science, English and social studies, with a real \nfocus on the math and science. We say: This is what we expect you to \nknow and learn and be able to do. And we are going to measure students' \nprogress on that. Most every State has done that. As I said earlier, \nmost every other State has decided it is going to have its own \nchildren's museum.\n  I told the folks who presented their idea to me about a decade ago: \nIf you want me to be involved, if you want me to be as excited as you \nare, I want to change the focus not just to be a children's museum in \nDelaware, I want it to be a children's museum that focuses on science. \nI want young kids in the target audience of 6 to 12 to come here and \nleave here excited about wanting to be astronauts or wanting to be \nenvironmentalists or wanting to create new ways to harness the energy \nof the Sun or the wind or to find ways to deal with spent fuel rods \nfrom nuclear powerplants. That is where my interest is.\n  Over time, the focus of this concept, this idea of the children's \nmuseum, has turned to focus on science, and to date I am told we have \nraised over $11 million for the project. We actually have picked out \nthe building. I think they have a lease or a sort of a contract on a \nlarge structure right at the bend of the Christina River there in \nWilmington, which is where Kahunaville used to be. Kahunaville sort of \nconveys the idea of a good time, and for many years, people went there \nand had a really good time. It was a great nightclub with some big acts \nover the years. Bob Dylan performed there and Hall and Oats, all kinds \nof people over the years. It is no longer a nightclub; it is an empty \nbuilding, and it is a large empty building that actually lends itself \nto being, we think, a terrific site for a science museum for the kids \nof Delaware.\n\n  So far to date we have raised, as I said, over $11 million. To date, \nthe Federal Government has provided about $250,000. So out of over $11 \nmillion, less than 3 percent has come from the Federal Government.\n  I have asked for an appropriation, a directed appropriation, of about \nanother $198,000, and I appreciate very much the support of the \nAppropriations Committee to include that amount. If it is included in \nwhat we have already appropriated, it would be about $450,000 out of a \nbudget of roughly $11.5 million--roughly 4 percent of the total \nproject. A lot of the money is going to come from the private sector, a \nfair amount from local sources, State and local sources, as well.\n  I will give you a flavor of the kinds of exhibits we are going to \nhave there. I will mention the names of some of the sponsors. The \nDuPont Company has been great, and it is a wonderful environmental \ncompany. It has agreed to help sponsor over the next couple of years an \nexhibit that focuses on environmental issues, I think largely focusing \non estuaries. We have a big estuary in the Delaware Bay and not far \naway in the Chesapeake Bay. This will really excite our kids about the \nwater and preserving the quality of our water and improving the quality \nof our water. AstraZeneca is going to help us create an exhibit on the \nhuman body, something interactive that the kids can really get into and \nenjoy and learn from. One of our larger banks, JPMorgan Chase, is going \nto help us with a project to focus on financial literacy. If there is \nanything that would help us all, young and old, that is, I think the \nevents of the last year or two have pointed this out. We will have \nexhibits that focus on clean energy, whether it is wind, solar. We will \nhave ways to use wind and solar, to show and demonstrate how we rely on \nthose. We will have an exhibit that will focus on conservation, smart \ngrid, to show how we can be better consumers, smarter consumers. We \nwill have some focus on, among other things, nuclear energy and show \nhow we actually create electricity from nuclear power. Those are some \nof the dynamics.\n  Our vision is, that when the kids leave the children's science museum \non the banks of the Christina River, they will be juiced, they will be \nexcited, and they will want to come back. But just as importantly, when \nthey go back to class the next day or the next week, they will be \nthinking about their math assignments and even their science \nassignments a little bit differently and trying to provide a \nconnection: How is what I am learning in my classroom relevant to what \nis going on in our world? How is it relevant to what I might be doing \nas a life work later on when I am finished with school and go out into \nthe world?\n  We need more scientists, we need more engineers. I know we need both \nof those. We need people who have a lot of expertise in math. We need \npeople who are going to invent things to help us make this a better \nworld. And for what I think is a fairly modest investment on behalf of \nthe Federal Government--about 4 percent of a much bigger project--I \nthink this is a very good investment, and not just for kids in Delaware \nbut for the kids who are going to graduate from the schools and go on \nand do things in their life to help all of us in Delaware and across \nthe country and maybe even around the world.\n  Those are some of the reasons I have asked for this appropriation. I \nam\n\n[[Page S9353]]\n\ngrateful to the Congress for supporting this a year ago. When we asked \nfor about $250,000, it was included. With this money, if we are \nsuccessful in gaining this appropriation, we will be able to go forward \nand hopefully actually open the Delaware children's science museum in \nthe spring of next year, which would be a very good thing, not just for \nus in Delaware, not just for those who visit Delaware, but I think, on \na broader scale, for a lot of folks in our country.\n  I see I have been joined by the former Governor of Virginia, in whose \nState I visited a number of those children's museums, those science \nmuseums. I remember taking our boys, when they were between the ages of \n6 and 12, to a couple of them around the country. Just remember, we \nhave one who is a mechanical engineer, at a 4-year college up in \nBoston, and his little brother--now a very big brother--he is really \ngood in math and a bunch of other things as well, and I think maybe a \nlittle bit of that came from those visits all those years ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my colleague and good friend \nfrom Delaware for his compassionate interest, not only in what sounds \nlike a very worthy project in Delaware, but his constant commitment to \nmaking sure we are always looking over that next horizon, whether it is \nin education or energy issues he has been involved with as a Member of \nCongress and as a Governor, and now as the senior Senator from \nDelaware. The project he describes sounds like a good one, and I hope \nit gets favorable consideration from the Senate. I welcome the chance \nto support him.\n  I wanted to take a moment to talk about a project that is already in \nthis very important 2010 Transportation-HUD appropriations bill. I \ncommend the subcommittee chair, the Senator from Washington, and the \nranking member for their good work on this bill. There is a certain \namount of celebration in this bill for us in the greater Washington \nregion because this Transportation appropriations bill is actually the \nculmination, in many ways, of an effort that has been ongoing for close \nto 50 years. Even when your dad served in the other body, one of the \nthings I know he probably experienced was flying into our region, \nparticularly flying into Dulles, and he might have found it difficult \nto get from Dulles into greater Washington.\n  One of the most remarkable things that has always stunned me as a \nVirginian, and as a long-time resident of the national capital area is \nthat we have never had rail or metro linkage from our international \ngateway airport out at Dulles into our Nation's capital. With this \nlegislation, with actions taken earlier this year, we finally have in \nplace a financing arrangement and the beginnings of construction for \nthe long overdue Dulles Metrorail project.\n  The Dulles metrorail project is part of a 50-year plan that started \nwith the construction of Dulles Airport. Throughout that time, there \nwas always a reserve. Anybody who made that drive--and I know the \nPresiding Officer has made that drive many times--has seen the corridor \nin the middle of the road. That corridor has been reserved for \nultimately building out rail, from the existing Washington metro \nsystem, all the way to Dulles.\n  This is a project that my predecessor, John Warner, worked on for \nyears. It was one of his proud accomplishments, finalizing Federal \nsupport for this project. I commend his efforts in the past. It is a \nproject I have been involved with for over 20 years, first when I was \non the Commonwealth Transportation Board, when we had to preserve that \ncorridor for a metrorail project. I recall, back in the late 1980s and \nearly 1990s, efforts to try to take away that right-of-way so it could \nbe used for additional highway construction. There was always a need to \nsay: No, we have to reserve that. At some point, we will finally get \nmetrorail to Dulles. This has now become a reality.\n  It was a project I worked on as Governor. There were a number of \ntimes we tried to put together a very complex financing arrangement in \norder to make sure all the partners, State and local and Federal, would \nstep to the plate and do what was right but also do what was terribly \nimportant to the national capital region: making sure our international \ngateway airport is linked to the capital. I am proud to report that \nearlier this year in March, Secretary LaHood and former Senator Warner \nand myself, Governor Kaine, Congressman Frank Wolf, who has been a \nlong-time supporter, got together and signed the final funding \narrangement that committed the Federal Government, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, and local communities on this critically important project.\n  It is needed for a variety of reasons. It is needed not only to link \ninternational and domestic passengers who come into Dulles to visit our \nNation's capital, but this corridor has rapidly become the economic hub \nof all northern Virginia. Dulles Airport currently serves about 24 \nmillion passengers each year. Population in the Dulles corridor is \nexpected to increase by 50 percent and employment to increase by 47 \npercent by 2030. As someone who I know travels that corridor on a \nregular basis, you have seen how it has been built up, and there will \ncontinue to be the expansion of a great deal of economic activity for \nall northern Virginia and for the entire Washington area, particularly \nin the high-tech sector.\n  This past March, the full funding agreement was signed, and $900 \nmillion over the period of the whole project was committed from Federal \nfunds. But let me make clear it is not only the Federal Government that \nis stepping up on this critically important project. The Commonwealth \nof Virginia has committed to be a major partner in funding. The \nlocalities have stepped forward in terms of funding. There have been \nvery creative activities in terms of creating a special taxing district \nof our local property owners in the region who will benefit from this \nmetrorail extension. They have skin in the game as well. The State is \ncontributing some of the toll revenues from our toll road in the \ncorridor. This is a project, even during these difficult economic \ntimes, where the State, the localities, and the Federal Government have \nstepped up in a major way.\n  It will be enormously beneficial to our whole region. It will be \nenormously beneficial to the Commonwealth and to our Nation's capital \nin terms of the millions of visitors who come in from all over the \ncountry and the world. They will have the opportunity not only to take \none of those increasingly expensive cabs, but also simply to jump on \nthe train and come into Washington.\n  There is also another very important reason for continuing this \nproject. The Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project is an important \nmultimodal project with critical homeland security implications. \nExpanding metrorail into the Dulles corridor is terribly important in \nterms of evacuation opportunities, should the capital ever be under \nassault. It is obviously terribly important in economic development \nactivities, in terms of tourism activities. This project is crucial to \nthe well-being of the whole national capital region.\n  As a matter of fact, earlier today I was out in Tysons Corner, one of \nour major development areas on the way out to Dulles rail. Although we \nwere caught in some pretty dreadful traffic, it was a little bit of a \nmixed blessing. Part of the traffic was because construction has \nactually started on some of the rail stops in the Tysons area that will \nultimately relieve not only traffic congestion but will, obviously, \ndecrease greenhouse gases. So this project has added benefits as well, \nan issue I know is very important to the Presiding Officer in terms of \ndealing with climate change.\n  I know there are others in this body who perhaps have raised \nquestions about some of the projects that are included in this 2010 \nTransportation-HUD appropriations bill. This is one of those projects I \ncan't imagine anyone being critical of. This has been 50 years in the \nmaking. Enormous time, effort, and resources have gone into it. The \nfact that the final funding agreement has now been signed and we \nactually have broken ground is a time to celebrate. The $85 million \nincluded in this year's appropriations funding for the downpayment and \nfirst installment of what is going to be a critical Federal funding \nstream is a very worthy sum that is going to provide benefits for this \nregion and for our capital for many years to come.\n  I, again, commend the chair of the Appropriations subcommittee, my \ncolleague and friend, the Senator from\n\n[[Page S9354]]\n\nWashington, for her great work on not only this particular Dulles \nmetrorail project, which I believe, as a frequent flier in and out of \nDulles, I hope she will be the immediate beneficiary of as well, but to \nall members of her subcommittee. I thank them for their good work on \nthis bill, this important project, and the many other projects in this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate Appropriations Committee has \nreported all 12 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2010, and the \nSenate has considered and passed 4 of those bills. I expect passage of \nthe Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill we are now \nconsidering will be the fifth. I am pleased the full Senate has had the \nopportunity to consider and debate the policies and priorities embodied \nin these bills. All Senators have had the opportunity to question the \nmanagers and to offer amendments, if they wanted to do so.\n\n  By next week, I expect the House and the Senate will be convening \nconference committees to complete action on the bills that have already \npassed the Senate. It is a fact, however, there are only 2 weeks \nremaining in this fiscal year. We will probably need to pass a short-\nterm continuing resolution to keep the remainder of the government \nrunning beyond September 30. While we anticipate we will be able to \npass such a resolution, I think it is important we complete action on \nthe remaining appropriations bills as soon as possible.\n  We have sent a letter, dated March 24, to the majority leader of the \nSenate--suggested by the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nCorker, back last March--and in that letter we requested the leadership \n``allocate an appropriate amount of time for the Senate to consider, \nvote, and initiate the conference process on each of the 12 \nappropriations bills independently through a deliberative and \ntransparent process. . . .''\n  That letter stated a goal of passing 8 of the 12 bills before the \nAugust recess. While the Senate did not meet that goal of passing eight \nbills prior to the recess, I think we did make good progress. I have to \ncongratulate the distinguished chairman from Washington for helping \nlead the way and helping us achieve that progress. To a degree, we have \nbeen hampered by the lateness of the President's budget request and the \nnecessity of waiting for the House to pass the appropriations bills \nfirst.\n  But the House has now passed all of its bills, and we have a window \nof floor time available to consider the remaining bills in the Senate. \nI believe strongly all Members should have the opportunity to consider \nthe bills and participate in this process and offer amendments, if they \nchoose to do so. But with the end of the fiscal year approaching and \nfloor time becoming a precious commodity, we should not have to spend \nlarge blocks of time in quorum calls waiting for Senators to offer \namendments.\n  At some point, the bills will have to be taken up and passed one way \nor another. In the past, this has meant packaging bills together into \nomnibus bills, and we know how well that is received. Not at all. And \nall but a few Members lose the opportunity to participate and \ncontribute through the amendment process and debate and influence the \noutcome of conference reports.\n  I have concerns about the budget proposed by the President, most of \nwhich is embodied in the congressional budget resolution that provides \nthe framework for the appropriations process. I voted for several \namendments to the budget resolution that would have reduced spending \nfrom the levels proposed by the President. I also voted against the \nresolution itself. I think the level of debt we have accumulated is \nalarming.\n  The fact remains, however, that Congress has approved the President's \nbudget. While an Omnibus appropriations bill would highlight the \nproblems with the President's spending policies, I do not think that \ncourse of action would be helpful to the process. By considering the \nbills individually, though, all Senators will be given an opportunity \nto have meaningful input and participation in the process, and that is \nas it should be.\n  So I look forward to continuing to work with the distinguished \nchairman, Mr. Inouye, our subcommittee chairs, and our two leaders, and \nall Senators to complete the appropriations process in an orderly and \ntimely fashion that will reflect credit on the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis remarks. As ranking member and former chairman of this committee, \nhe knows full well we work very hard to accomplish and complete these \nbills and to get them done in a timely fashion. We are working our \nhearts out to get that done.\n  To that point, the bill before us, the transportation and housing \nbill, has now been on the floor of the Senate Thursday afternoon and \nevening, Friday, Monday, all of today, and we will finish it tomorrow. \nSo for any Senators who are sitting out there with issues, you need to \ncome to the floor and get them resolved. We hope to start a series of \nvotes tomorrow morning to get through a number of the amendments that \nare out there and finish this so we can move to the Interior \nappropriations bill tomorrow.\n  So, again, for the notification of all Senators, to the point the \nSenator from Mississippi raised, come to the floor, resolve your \ndisagreements, or help us schedule a vote. We are going to finish this \nbill tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to touch upon an issue I think has \nnot gotten as much consideration in the Senate as it might; that is, \nfor the first time since 1975, and in the midst of a major recession, \nsenior citizens in our country who are on Social Security will not--\nunless we act--be receiving a cost-of-living adjustment this year.\n  Let me repeat that. For the first time since 1975, and while we are \nin the midst of a major economic recession which is causing havoc with \nthe lives of all of our people, including senior citizens, this year--\nunless Congress acts--senior citizens will not be getting a cost-of-\nliving adjustment.\n  Among other things, this would mean monthly Social Security payments \nwould drop for millions of retirees because Medicare prescription drug \npremiums--the Medicare Part D Program--which are deducted from Social \nSecurity payments, are scheduled to increase.\n  So what we are looking at is that not only will tens of millions of \nAmerica's seniors not receive any increase in Social Security but many, \nin fact, will see a reduction because their Social Security checks will \ngo to pay for an increase in Medicare Part D payments. I would suggest \nin the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression, we \ncannot allow that to happen.\n  Many senior citizens in this country have recently, within the last \nyear or two, seen a significant decline in their savings because of the \nlosses they incurred with the drop in the stock market. Many have seen \ntheir pensions disappear. Many have seen the value of their home \ndramatically diminish. All of this is taking place at a time while \npoverty among senior citizens is going up. And the number of seniors \nwho are declaring bankruptcy is also increasing.\n  Most importantly, I think it is imperative that sooner than later we \ntake a hard look to determine how COLAs for Social Security \nbeneficiaries are, in fact, determined. Some years ago, when I was a \nMember of the House, I introduced legislation to establish a separate \nindex for seniors because the simple reality is, it is wrong to include \nseniors in the overall index because their needs--how they spend their \nmoney--are often very different than how the rest of the population \nspends their money.\n\n[[Page S9355]]\n\n  If you are a young person or a middle-aged person and you want to go \nout and buy a laptop computer today, for example, the odds are you are \ngoing to get a pretty good price on that computer, and the price of \nthat computer will be substantially lower than it was a couple years \nago. So for you, inflation for your expenditures on technology may well \nhave gone down.\n  On the other hand, if you are a senior citizen, especially one who \ndoes not have a whole lot of money, how are you spending your money? \nWell, a very significant cost for seniors, obviously, is health care. \nFor those needs Medicare does not cover, the truth is, health care \ncosts, as we all know, are exploding. They are going up.\n  So if you are a senior, the odds are you are spending a lot more for \nhealth care out of your own pocket this year than you did last year. If \nyou are a senior and you get caught in the doughnut hole of Medicare \nPart D, you are spending a lot of money because prescription drug \ncosts, in many instances, are also going up.\n\n  So I think when we take a look at the COLA, we should understand the \nneeds of somebody who is 75 or 80 years of age and how he or she spends \ntheir money, from an inflation perspective, is very different from \nsomebody who is 18 years of age or maybe 40 years of age. But be that \nas it may, there can be no debate that millions of senior citizens \ntoday, in the midst of this recession, are hurting very badly. I think \nwe would be doing a great disservice to them by turning our back on \ntheir needs and not making sure we are providing some financial support \nto them.\n  Therefore, I am asking my colleagues to join me in becoming an \noriginal cosponsor of the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act, \nlegislation I will be formally introducing on Thursday. Under this \nlegislation, all Social Security recipients, railroad retirees, SSI \nbeneficiaries, and adults receiving veterans benefits will receive a \none-time additional check of $250 in 2010. Since seniors living on \nfixed incomes are most likely to spend this money--whether it is on \nhealth care, whether it is trying to keep warm this winter--this \nlegislation would provide a boost to our economy as it emerges from the \neconomic crisis.\n  I very much appreciate that my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, \nis an original cosponsor, and I hope within the next couple of days we \ncan have more.\n  For more than three decades, seniors have relied on a cost-of-living \nadjustment in their Social Security benefits to keep up with their \nincreased expenses. Unfortunately, the current formulation for \ndetermining Social Security COLAs, in my view, does not accurately take \ninto account the purchasing needs of today's seniors who often do not \nbuy items such as laptop computers and cellular phones but spend, as I \nmentioned a moment ago, a disproportionate percentage of their income \non health care needs and prescription drugs.\n  The truth is, what we are proposing now is something very similar to \nwhat the Obama administration provided for in the stimulus package. \nThis legislation we are offering is fully paid for by simply applying \nthe Social Security payroll tax to household incomes above $250,000 and \nbelow $359,000 in 2010.\n  Under current law, only the first $106,000 of earned income is \nsubject to the Social Security payroll tax, thus a worker earning \n$106,000 pays the same payroll tax as a CEO making $300 million. This \nlegislation begins to correct this inequity in 2010, while making sure \nseniors receive a fair increase in benefits next year. I should point \nout, in terms of this offset, no one in America earning $250,000 or \nless would see their payroll taxes go up at all.\n  So I think this is an important issue. I think seniors all over this \ncountry are worried about their financial situation. They want the \nCongress to pay attention to their needs.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nWicker amendment, No. 2366, pending before the Senate on the THUD bill, \nas it is known around here--the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment bill. This is a bill which obviously includes Amtrak. \nSenator Wicker, of Mississippi, has offered an amendment which relates \ndirectly to the funding for Amtrak and whether it will be cut off.\n  The Senator from Mississippi says in his amendment he would cut off \nall Federal transportation funding for Amtrak in the next fiscal year \nunless Amtrak allows its passengers to transport guns in their checked \nbaggage. This amendment would essentially impose upon Amtrak the \nstandards for checking guns and ammunition that currently applies to \nairplanes. However, planes and trains have very different systems for \nhandling checked baggage and different security concerns.\n  Let's talk about the effect of the Wicker amendment. Amtrak has said \nit is not ready to allow guns and ammunition to be transported in \nchecked baggage. Amtrak doesn't have the security infrastructure, the \nprocesses or the trained personnel in place to ensure that checked \nfirearms would not be lost, damaged, stolen or misused. Senator Wicker \nis imposing a new burden on the Amtrak train system in America--clearly \nan unfunded mandate--so some passengers--I don't know how many--can \ncheck firearms in their baggage. If this amendment becomes law, Amtrak \nwould have to let guns checked in baggage onboard, regardless of the \nfact that they aren't prepared for this, or they forfeit Federal \ntransportation funding that the railroad desperately needs to provide \nservices to millions of Americans.\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\n  I understand the Senator from Mississippi is going to modify his \namendment to provide for a March 2010 effective date, which, in effect, \ngives about 5 or 6 months for Amtrak to hire additional security \npersonnel, to buy the equipment or create the equipment for this \nchecked baggage and to establish procedures at all the Amtrak stations \nacross America so some people can check a firearm on an Amtrak train. I \ndon't know if 6 months is feasible for Amtrak to make such a \nsignificant policy change.\n  Why is the Senator from Mississippi determined that we have to, in 6 \nmonths, make sure that any American who legally owns a gun can take it \nwith them on an Amtrak train in checked baggage? Shouldn't we take the \ntime to take a look at this and consider the basic questions of safety \nand cost before we vote for this?\n  Amtrak's current policy prohibits any type of firearm, explosive or \nweapon from being checked or carried on in baggage. This policy was put \nin place in the year 2004. Do you want to know why Amtrak put this \npolicy in place in 2004? It was after the Madrid, Spain, train attack \nthat killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 more. Amtrak's reasons for \nthis policy were clear--safety and security. It was put in place in the \naftermath of terrorist attacks that claimed lives.\n  Let me quote from a statement issued by Amtrak on its current policy.\n\n       Amtrak accepted firearms in baggage in checked baggage at \n     one time. Weapons had to be separately secured in baggage or \n     containers. However, after the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, Amtrak began to place restrictions on the carriage \n     of weapons on Amtrak trains. In 2004, the review and \n     evaluation of numerous security measures occurred again after \n     the attack on passenger trains in Madrid, Spain, on March 11, \n     2004. The purpose of this policy revision was to better \n     ensure the safety and security of Amtrak passengers and \n     employees. Amtrak decided to implement a total weapons \n     prohibition, including firearms. The only exception was for \n     sworn law enforcement personnel. Today, that policy is still \n     in effect.\n\n  That exception is reasonable--for sworn law enforcement personnel. \nBut the Senator from Mississippi wants to go beyond that. He wants to \nallow anyone who legally owns a gun in America--and I might tell you \nthat the standards in many States are not that high for the ownership \nof firearms--to impose upon Amtrak an obligation to check baggage with \nan unloaded firearm in a container, as specified, and that Amtrak has \nto set up the process for that passenger, regardless of the cost to \nAmtrak, which incidentally neither the Senator from Mississippi nor \nanyone else on the Senate floor knows. We have no idea what this is \ngoing to cost.\n  This amendment simply disregards the risk assessment that Amtrak \nconducted for the security of our rail network. It calls for \neliminating all funding for Amtrak unless they adopt the policy on \nchecking firearms in baggage the Senator from Mississippi is insisting \non.\n  The stakes for Amtrak are enormously high. In the current fiscal \nyear, Congress has appropriated $1.49 billion for Amtrak's operations \nand capital improvements. This amendment would say Congress couldn't \ngive $1 to Amtrak unless it changes the policy, as the Senator from \nMississippi insists.\n  Well, I can tell you what Amtrak means to my State of Illinois. With \nthe increasing cost of gasoline, more and more people are relying on \nAmtrak. Thank goodness they are. Using Amtrak trains means fewer cars \non the highway and less pollution. Families are saving money. It is a \ngodsend for those who use them in college towns--sending their kids to \nschool and letting the kids return using the trains.\n  In Senator Wicker's home State of Mississippi, Amtrak had a ridership \nof 100,000 people last year. That number isn't as large as the 4.4 \nmillion in my home State, but it is a fair number of people in \nMississippi who found it convenient to ride on Amtrak trains. Last \nyear, Amtrak employed 72 people in Mississippi and paid out over $4.5 \nmillion in wages. The Senator from Mississippi says: If you don't \naccept my amendment to allow firearms in checked baggage, close it \ndown.\n  Nationwide last year, 28.7 million passengers rode on Amtrak--an \naverage of more than 78,000 passengers per day. Amtrak employs nearly \n18,000 people nationwide with good jobs, but the Senator from \nMississippi would rather see Amtrak's funding, riders, and employees \ncast aside unless he is satisfied that Amtrak's checked baggage policy \nallows people to take firearms onto trains.\n  Besides concerns about terrorism, there are legitimate safety \nconcerns with permitting weapons in checked bags on trains. Amtrak \ndoesn't have the personnel, systems or security infrastructure needed \nto manage firearms aboard passenger trains. Amtrak cannot effectively \nsafeguard against theft, loss, damage or misuse of transporting guns. \nDoes the Senator from Mississippi expect Amtrak to assign someone to \nthe baggage car to guard the suitcases that may contain the firearms? \nIf he does, how is he going to pay for that?\n  Passenger trains do not have nearly the baggage handling safeguards \nthat airplanes do. Checked baggage on trains is carried in a separate \ntrain car. I wish to tell you, most of the rolling stock of Amtrak is \ndecades old and certainly these baggage cars are as well. They were \nnever designed with this level of security in mind. These train baggage \ncars are much easier to access during transit and in stations than the \nchecked baggage compartments of airlines. That is fairly obvious.\n  In addition, Amtrak trains stop much more frequently than airplanes, \nwhich creates more opportunities for access and theft and misuse of \nfirearms in checked baggage. In fact, checked luggage is often unloaded \nand presented to passengers on the platform rather than a remote, \nsecure baggage pickup area. In order to screen and capably manage \nchecked firearms, Amtrak would need to significantly revise its baggage \nhandling operations and the training of its personnel.\n  What about special situations, such as when there is a homeland \nsecurity alert due to specific threats against our rail network? There \nis not one word in the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi about \nhow to deal with these homeland security threats when it comes to \nfirearms and checked baggage. Should Amtrak be required to allow \nweapons on trains when there is a terrorism alert?\n  I wish to know if the Senator from Mississippi ever considered that. \nI know it didn't come up in a hearing on this amendment because there \nhas never been a hearing on this amendment.\n  A serious effort at revising Amtrak's weapons policy would include an \nassessment of these safety and security issues. A serious legislative \neffort at revising Amtrak's weapons policy would also look at the cost \nthis amendment imposes on Amtrak. There is a lot of criticism on the \nfloor about spending and deficits. Here we have an unfunded mandate on \nAmtrak because at least one Senator--perhaps others join him--believes \nit is a good idea that people could show up at the Amtrak station and \ncheck their firearms. Are the people willing to pay more, every \npassenger pay more for tickets, so that person can have a guard on the \nchecked baggage in the baggage car with the firearms in place? We \nregularly hear concerns about Federal spending, particularly from the \nother side of the aisle. But the Wicker amendment imposes significant \nsecurity costs that would have to be absorbed by Amtrak. They may have \nto cut back in services or raise ticket prices to absorb the cost of \nthis effort, because at virtually every Amtrak station in America they \nhave to be prepared, with the Wicker amendment, to take on firearms as \nchecked baggage.\n  There have been no hearings on this amendment. The Senate has not \ngiven Amtrak or law enforcement or Homeland Security, or the baggage \nhandling unions, or anyone affected by this amendment, the opportunity \nto even consider it and testify.\n  Given time, given the opportunity to work with these stakeholders, we \nmay be able to work out some kind of understanding that accommodates \nthe concerns of the Senator from Mississippi, but the amendment we have \nbefore us is not a responsible approach to this challenge. To think \nthat we would allow one person at one station to impose a burden and \nexpense on Amtrak to be borne by every other passenger, to me, in this \nage of terrorism, is difficult to explain and impossible to accept.\n\n[[Page S9357]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to think twice about this amendment. I know the \npolitical force behind gun amendments, but this goes too far. If it is \na good idea, why doesn't it go through the ordinary process here? At \nleast have a hearing and answer the basic questions I have raised and \nothers have raised during the course of consideration of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak as in morning business. \nI ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       WTO Airbus Interim Ruling\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this issue is actually one that is \nrelated to the bill but it is not on point, so that is why I asked for \nthat permission.\n  Earlier this month, the World Trade Organization issued an interim \nruling that the European Union's ``launch aid'' to Airbus is illegal. I \nsay this is relating to the bill because a major transportation issue \nfor us in the United States is the building of major aircraft, of \naircraft to be able to transport individuals. What we have seen taking \nplace over the last 15 years is Airbus subsidizing their way into the \ncommercial aviation market and taking market share from Boeing and \ndriving McDonnell-Douglas and other competitors out of the field \naltogether.\n  Earlier this month, about 2 weeks ago, the World Trade Organization \nissued a major finding that the European Union was doing illegal launch \naid as a subsidy and it was harming U.S. participants in this \nmarketplace. This ruling is a big one for the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, which has been pursuing this case for years. U.S. trade \npolicy regarding the aerospace industry has been remarkably consistent \nfor years and across several administrations.\n  The United States has always contended that the launch aid which the \nEU provides to Airbus to develop new aircraft constitutes an illegal \ntrade practice. Airbus's dishonest behavior has had a devastating \neffect on the commercial aviation industry in the United States. Launch \naid gives Airbus access to billions in government funds which it could \nnever afford to borrow on commercial terms. This free money directly \nharms the United States and our competitors in these fields. As the \nUSTR pointed out in a 2006 submission to the World Trade Organization, \nlaunch aid helped force Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas from the large \ncommercial aircraft market. It forced them out of the field because of \ngovernment subsidy by Europe.\n  Launch aid has also contributed to a loss of 19 percent of Boeing's \nmarket share. Imagine two of your main competitors are forced out of \nthe field, Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas, and you lose 19 percent of \nmarket share, because of a European subsidization in this field. This \nhas harmed the United States substantially, in a big way, and this is a \nhuge ruling for us.\n  This WTO interim ruling is a big win for the United States and U.S. \ncompanies that have had to deal with dishonest behavior by Airbus over \nthe years--or at least it should be a big win. For years the Department \nof Defense has said it cannot consider foreign subsidies when it holds \na competition for defense procurements. In particular, DOD has said it \nwould not consider launch aid last year when it evaluated the cost of \nthe Airbus proposal to build a new aerial refueling tanker for the Air \nForce.\n  So here we have a case, supported by administrations, Republican and \nDemocrat, over several years against Airbus that comes out in our favor \nfrom the WTO, and the next big bid this may come into effect in is in \nthe military bidding of this tanker, the $40 billion U.S. Department of \nDefense tanker bid. The Department of Defense is saying we cannot \nconsider the issue of launch aid.\n  I think that is wrong. I think it is wrongheaded. I think it is \nharmful and I think it is at cross purposes for our government, where \none end of the government, the U.S. Trade Representative office, sues \nAirbus for subsidization and the other end, the Department of Defense, \nsays we don't care, and if you give us a cheaper aircraft that way, \nthat is fine. That is at cross purposes, and I think clearly what we \nshould listen to is what the WTO has said, that this launch aid is \nillegal and it should not be allowed to use it to subsidize a military \nbid in this country by a foreign competitor.\n  Last year the Air Force chose Airbus to build the tanker because the \ncost seemed very low. But now we know that the Airbus pricetag covered \nup development costs that were illegally subsidized by the EU, and we \nhave that from a World Trade Organization interim ruling.\n  The Department of Defense, I believe, has an obligation to listen to \nthe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative when designing a new tanker \ncompetition. Defense procurement should be coordinated with our trade \npolicy. If the WTO agrees with arguments made by the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, why should the Department of Defense, our Department of \nDefense, be allowed to object? We cannot afford to have the Pentagon \nundermining our Trade Representative and our trade policy negotiating \nposition at the World Trade Organization. We have seen how launch aid \nto Airbus distorts the commercial aircraft market, driving two major \nU.S. competitors out of the field and cutting back Boeing's share of \nthe marketplace by nearly 20 percent. The WTO ruling should keep us \nfrom relearning that lesson in the military marketplace as well. \nDefense contracts should never stack the deck against American \ncompanies, particularly when the WTO foreign companies are engaged in \nillegal trade practices.\n\n  Everyone agrees that the Air Force needs new tankers. In this current \nfleet of tankers, many of the planes are already over 50 years old, and \nwhen they are finally replaced some of them will be 80 years old and \nwill still be out there flying. They need to be replaced. Tankers are a \nvital platform for the Air Force and for all of our Armed Forces. They \nenable the rest of our forces to deploy across the world. Taxpayers \nhave a right to expect a new tanker competition will have a level \nplaying field, particularly for U.S. entrants.\n  We should not ask taxpayers to ignore the illegal trade practices of \ncompanies vying to build a new tanker and we should not ask taxpayers \nto outsource this crucial capability to a foreign company offering \nunrealistic, bought-down-by-the-Government-subsidy bargain basement \nprices, subsidization from the French Government, from the German \nGovernment, to get a U.S. military contract that puts our workers out \nof jobs.\n  I call on the Secretary of Defense to ensure the new tanker \ncompetition accounts for the recent ruling from the World Trade \nOrganization. DOD should factor the value of launch aid subsidies into \nthe cost estimates for any tanker proposal Airbus might submit. This is \nthe only fair way to account for the way Airbus manipulates the \naircraft market and has done so successfully in the commercial aviation \nfield to the great detriment of the United States.\n  I call on the President to ensure Federal procurements are \ncoordinated with U.S. trade policy. This kind of coordination should be \na no-brainer. Our trade policy should not be undermined from within and \nour procurement policies should reflect our trade priorities.\n  This is a key issue. It is a key issue up in front of the military. \nIt is a key economic development issue for this country. It is a key \ncontract, a $40 billion military contract. It should be won fairly and \nsquarely by a U.S. company, not by a subsidized European group.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            ENERGY CHALLENGE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I want to challenge two popular \nmisconceptions in the Waxman-Markey climate change and energy bill that \nis now before the Senate after passing the House of Representatives.\n  The first is the idea that deliberately raising energy prices will \nsomehow be good for job growth and the economy.\n  The second is that, whatever the problems created by Waxman-Markey, \nthey can mostly be resolved by building more windmills.\n\n[[Page S9358]]\n\n  Waxman-Markey started out as a bill to reduce carbon emissions in \norder to deal with climate change. It has ended up as a $100-billion-a-\nyear energy tax nailed to a renewable energy mandate that will saddle \nconsumers with expensive energy for years to come. Instead of a broad-\nbased, national clean energy policy, Waxman-Markey has given us a \nnarrow, expensive national windmill policy.\n  I believe cheap energy means good jobs.\n  My perspective, of course, comes from Tennessee, where Alcoa has shut \ndown its smelter where my Dad worked. They are waiting for a cheaper \nelectricity contract from the Tennessee Valley Authority. Goodman, a \ncompany in Fayetteville that makes a large percentage of all the air \nconditioners in the United States, tells me that if their electricity \nprices go up too much then those jobs will go overseas. Eastman \nChemical employs 7,000 Tennesseans and uses coal as a feedstock. The \ncompany says if Waxman-Markey goes through they too might be headed \noverseas. The Valero refinery in Memphis employs 600 people refining \nfuels, including jet fuel for Federal Express at its Memphis hub. \nWaxman-Markey would cost Valero $400 million or more per year. Today \nits profits are $40 million per year at that refinery.\n  We have two big supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory \nin part because of our abundance of low-cost electricity. Just one of \nthese machines consumes 7 megawatts. Nationwide, computers use 5 \npercent of our electricity and it is still growing.\n  Our Governor has attracted two manufacturing plants to make \npolysilicon for solar cells--these are the ``green jobs'' everyone \nloves to talk about. Each of those plants uses 120 megawatts. If they \nare going to make affordable solar cells, they can't pay high \nelectricity costs.\n  A third of Tennessee's manufacturing jobs are in auto manufacturing. \nAuto parts suppliers watch their costs, including electricity costs, \nand if they go up too much they will be making auto parts in Mexico and \nJapan instead of Tennessee and Michigan.\n  Last December 10 percent of Nashvillians, even with TVA's relatively \nlow residential electric rates, said they couldn't afford to pay their \nelectric bills.\n  So let's step back for a moment and ask; What kind of America are we \ntrying to create with this climate-change and energy bill? I suggest we \nwant an America in which we have enough clean, cheap, and reliable \nenergy to create good jobs and run a prosperous industrial and high-\ntech society. In order to support the American economy that creates \nabout 25 percent of the world's wealth, we need to produce about 25 \npercent of the world's energy.\n  We want an America in which we are not creating excessive carbon \nemissions and running the risk of encouraging global warming.\n  We want an America with cleaner air--where smog in Los Angeles and in \nthe Great Smoky Mountains is a thing of the past--and where our \nchildren are less likely to suffer asthma attacks brought on by \nbreathing pollutants.\n  We want an America in which we are not creating ``energy sprawl'' by \noccupying vast tracts of farmlands, deserts, and mountaintops with \nenergy installations that ruin scenic landscapes. The great American \noutdoors is a revered part of the American character. We have spent a \ncentury preserving it. We do not want to destroy the environment in the \nname of saving the environment.\n  We want an America in which we create hundreds of thousands of \n``green jobs'' but not at the expense of destroying millions of red, \nwhite, and blue jobs. It doesn't make any sense to employ people in the \nrenewable energy sector if we are throwing them out of work in \nmanufacturing and the high tech sector.\n  That is what will happen if these new technologies raise the price of \nelectricity and send manufacturing and other energy-intensive \nindustries overseas searching for clean energy.\n  We want new, clean, energy-efficient cars, but we want them built in \nMichigan and Ohio and Tennessee, not Japan and Mexico. We want an \nAmerica where we are the unquestioned champion in cutting-edge \nscientific research and lead the world in creating the new technologies \nof the future. We want an America capable of producing enough of our \nown energy so we cannot be held hostage by some other energy-producing \ncountry. None of those goals are met by Waxman-Markey.\n  This bill produces a huge new tax on the economy. In addition, it \nrequires 15 percent of our electricity to come from a narrowly defined \ngroup of renewable sources defined as wind, solar, geothermal, and \nbiomass. While promising and intriguing, we cannot expect renewable \nenergy to do anything more in the foreseeable future than to supplement \nour current base load electricity production. It cannot replace it. \nWhat the Waxman-Markey bill proves, once again, is that one of \ngovernment's biggest mistakes is taking a good idea, renewable energy, \nand expanding it until it does not work anymore.\n  Republican Senators have a better idea: Produce more American energy \nand use less.\n  First, we should build 100 new nuclear reactors over the next 20 \nyears, just as we did from 1970 to 1990. That would double our level of \nnuclear generation to 40 percent of our electricity. Add 10 percent for \nSun and wind and other renewables, another 10 percent for \nhydroelectric, maybe 5 percent more for natural gas. By 2030, we begin \nto have a low-cost, low-carbon, clean energy policy that also puts us \nwithin sight of meeting the goals of the Kyoto Protocol on global \nwarming.\n  Step two is to electrify half of our cars and trucks. I think we can \ndo it within 20 years. This should reduce our dependence on foreign oil \nby one-third, clean the air, and keep fuel prices low. According to \nestimates by the Brookings Institution scholars, we could do this with \nthe unused nighttime electricity we have today without building one new \npowerplant.\n  Step three is to explore offshore for natural gas, which is low \ncarbon, and oil. We should use less but more of our own.\n  The final step is to double funding for energy research and \ndevelopment and launch mini-Manhattan Projects like the one we had in \nWorld War II to meet seven energy challenges: improving batteries for \nplug-in vehicles, making solar power cost competitive, making carbon \ncapture a reality, safely recycling used nuclear fuel, perfecting \nadvanced biofuels, designing green buildings, and providing energy from \nnuclear fusion.\n  Basically, our policy should be to conserve and use our nuclear gas \nand oil resources until we figure out how to make renewable and \nalternative energies more reliable and cost competitive.\n  Instead of following this simple, fourfold, low-cost clean energy \nstrategy, the Obama administration wants to spend tens of billions of \ndollars covering an area the size of West Virginia with 50-story wind \nturbines while it squirms uncomfortably at every mention of nuclear \npower.\n  According to the San Francisco Chronicle last week:\n\n       The Department of Energy is starting a new partnership with \n     the nation's six largest wind turbine manufacturers in an \n     effort to provide 20 percent of the nation's energy from wind \n     by 2030.\n\n  In his inaugural address, the President spoke eloquently of powering \nthe country with the wind, the Sun, and the Earth.\n  In June, the Wall Street Journal asked Boone Pickens, Amory Lovins, \nAl Gore, and President Obama how to reduce dependence on foreign oil \nand contribute less to climate change. These 4 came up with 24 \nsuggestions, from placing veterans in green jobs to generating 20 to 30 \npercent of electricity by wind, but made not one mention of nuclear \npower.\n  Over the next 10 years, the wind industry will receive direct Federal \ntaxpayer subsidies of about $28 billion, according to the congressional \nJoint Committee on Taxation. Most of this cost is due to the renewable \nproduction tax credit that is worth about 3 cents per kilowatt hour to \nwind developers and costs taxpayers $26 billion. Fully 75 percent of \nthe renewable tax credit goes to wind. Solar, geothermal, biomass, and \nhydropower combined make up the remaining 25 percent. There will be $1 \nbillion for construction subsidies through clean renewable energy \nbonds. There will be an investment tax credit for residential and small \nindustrial wind turbines. There will be accelerated depreciation of \nsmall wind turbines. Plus, there will be $11 billion\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\nprovided by the stimulus for building the ``smart grid'' and new \ntransmission lines. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation \ntells us the entire U.S. grid needs upgrading, but the transmission \nprojects announced so far will all go to bringing wind and solar \nelectricity from remote places to population centers.\n  All this does not even mention the Waxman-Markey renewable energy \nmandate, which will have the practical effect of forcing utilities in \nmany States to buy government-subsidized wind energy they do not \nnecessarily need from far-away States with better wind resources.\n  Let me give you an example. Between 2000 and 2004, the TVA \nconstructed a 30-megawatt wind farm on Buffalo Mountain in Tennessee at \na cost of $60 million. It is the only wind farm in the Southeast. You \nwill read in the papers that having a 30-megawatt wind farm means \ngenerating 30 megawatts of electricity. That is only what they call its \n``nameplate capacity.'' That is not real output. In practice, Buffalo \nMountain has only generated electricity 19 percent of the time since \nthe wind does not blow very much in the Southeast. That means TVA is \npaying $60 million over 20 years to generate 6 megawatts of \nelectricity. Multiply this out, and you will see it means spending $10 \nbillion to generate 1,000 megawatts, which makes Tennessee's wind mills \nmore expensive than the costliest nuclear reactor.\n  TVA considers the Buffalo Mountain wind farm to be a failed \nexperiment. In fact, looking for wind power in the Southeast is a \nlittle like looking for hydropower in the desert. Nevertheless, Waxman-\nMarkey will now force TVA and every other utility in the country to get \nat least 12 percent of their electricity from a narrowly defined group \nof renewable sources. Hydroelectric dams, for example, probably the \nbest source of renewable energy, do not count because--well, I am not \nsure exactly why. But environmental groups have been opposing them \nsince the 1950s. Nuclear does not count as renewable, either, even \nthough we have plenty of uranium and reprocessing the fuel could \nstretch it out for hundreds of years. Instead, the TVA is now \nrequesting bids for 1,250 megawatts of renewable power that it does not \nreally need and may not be able to use.\n  Wind now produces 1.3 percent of America's total electricity and 4.5 \npercent of our carbon-free clean electricity. Yet, according to the \nEnergy Information Administration, wind turbines are being subsidized \nat 30 times the rate of all other renewables and 19 times the rate of \nnuclear power, which, by the way, provides 70 percent of our carbon-\nfree, clean electricity.\n  So instead of a clean, broad-based energy policy or even a clean, \nrenewable energy policy, what we have in practice is a national \nwindmill policy. But wait a minute. They tell us all this is not really \nabout producing clean, cheap energy; it is about creating green jobs. \nThere are two problems with this argument. First, there must be at \nleast as many welders, mechanics, construction workers, and engineers \nwho would be employed in building 100 new nuclear plants during the \nnext 20 years as in all the so-called renewable energies together. \nSecond, while there may be hundreds of thousands of green jobs, there \nare tens of millions of red, white, and blue jobs in America that will \nbe quickly lost because of rising energy prices.\n  Let's look at California. The Golden State has been imposing \nrenewable energy mandates for years. It has not built a base load coal \nor nuclear plant in 20 years. Meanwhile, it has built renewables, \nrenewables, and renewables, with plenty of expensive natural gas to \nback them up. All of this contributed mightily to the California \nelectricity shortage of the year 2000. Now the State has the highest \nelectricity prices in the continental United States west of Washington, \nDC. Manufacturers are leaving in droves. Even Google and Yahoo are \nbuilding their server farms elsewhere. With all of this job loss, the \nState had an 11.9-percent unemployment rate in July and, until \nrecently, a $28 billion budget gap. Its bond rating is now the lowest \nof the 50 States.\n\n  I cannot believe the high cost of electricity in California has not \ncontributed to all of this. Has this tempered the State's enthusiasm \nfor expensive renewable energy? Apparently not. California lawmakers \nare developing legislation to increase the current 20 percent renewable \nstandard to 33 percent by 2020. State energy agencies have concluded it \ncould cost $114 billion or more to meet the 33 percent mandate, more \nthan double what the original 20 percent requirement cost. That comes \nto $3,000 per Californian.\n  Yet, according to the Wall Street Journal's news page on July 3 of \nthis year:\n\n       The state auditor warned this week that the electricity \n     sector poses a ``high risk'' to the state economy. A staff \n     report from the state energy commission also warns that \n     California can find itself uncomfortably tight on power by \n     2011 if problems continue to pile up.\n       Utilities complain that the ambitious renewable-energy \n     mandates, combined with tougher environmental regulations on \n     conventional plants, are compromising their ability to \n     deliver adequate power. ``Conflicting state policies are a \n     problem,'' said Stewart Hemphill, senior vice president of \n     procurement at Southern California Edison.\n\n  Renewable energy is intriguing and it is useful. But today it is 4 \npercent of our electricity. It has many challenges. What many people \nforget is that wind and solar energy is only available, on average, \nabout one-third of the time. And electricity today cannot be stored in \ncommercial quantities with current technologies; you either use it or \nyou lose it.\n  When you see 1,000 megawatts of wind and solar power reported in the \nnewspaper, remember it is only about 300 megawatts because these \nsources only produce electricity about one-third of the time, compared \nto American nuclear plants producing electricity 90 percent of the \ntime.\n  Denmark, with the world's biggest percentage of wind power, claims to \nget 20 percent of its electricity from wind. Yet it still produces 47 \npercent of its power with coal and imports more than 25 percent of its \nelectricity from Sweden and Germany. Moreover, it is not clear that its \ncarbon emissions have decreased at all over the last 10 years. Worse \nyet, because of wind variability, Denmark must export almost half of \nits wind power to Germany and then import nuclear and hydropower back \nfrom Germany, Sweden, and Norway.\n  Then there is what conservation groups are calling energy sprawl and \nwhich we are only beginning to come to grips with. One nuclear plant \ngenerates 1,000 megawatts and occupies 1 square mile. One big solar \nthermal plant with giant mirrors generating the same 1,000 megawatts in \nthe western desert will occupy 30 square miles. That is more than 5 \nmiles on a side. To generate the same 1,000 megawatts with wind, you \nwould need 270 square miles of 50-story wind turbines. That is an area \nmore than four times the size of Washington, DC, or that is an unbroken \nline of turbines along our ridgetops from Johnson City, TN, to \nHarrisburg, PA. If wind farms move offshore, you would need to line the \nentire 127-mile New Jersey coast with windmills 2 miles deep just to \nreplace one nuclear reactor that sits on a square mile.\n  We have not even talked about when these wind farms outlive their \nuseful life cycle of 20 years or so. Who is responsible for their \nremoval? We have already seen this problem in Hawaii and Altamonte Pass \nin California. The developers should be required to put up bonds to \nensure these turbines are taken down in case the developers walk away.\n  For those of us in the Southeast where the wind blows less than 20 \npercent of the time, they say use biomass, which means burning wood \nproducts in sort of a controlled bonfire. That is a good idea as far as \nit goes. It might conserve resources and reduce forest fires, but we \nwould need a forest 1\\1/2\\ times the size of the 550,000-acre Great \nSmoky Mountain National Park to feed a 1,000-megawatt biomass plant on \na sustained basis. It would take hundreds of trucks each day to deliver \nthe wood to the biomass plant. It is hard for me to see how this \nreduces carbon emissions.\n  Already we are beginning to see the problems. Boone Pickens, who said \nwind turbines are too ugly to put on his own ranch, recently postponed \nwhat was to be America's largest wind farm because of the difficulty of \nbuilding transmission lines from west Texas to population centers. The \nSacramento Municipal Utility District pulled out of another huge \nproject to bring wind energy from Sierra Nevada for the same\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\nreasons. The transmission lines were meeting too much opposition, \nparticularly from environmentalists.\n  We hope renewable energy can be reliable and low cost enough to \nsupplement, but when we are talking about using wind energy as a \nsubstitute for base load energy, we haven't thought about what it is \ngoing to look like in practice.\n  In conclusion, let's take a look at the true source of base load \nelectricity, nuclear power. Nuclear power already produces 20 percent \nof our electricity and 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity. It is \nso profitable, there is enough to pay back construction loans and still \nhave low rates. For example, TVA's Brown's Ferry will be repaid in 3 \nyears not 10 as had been expected. Nuclear power receives very little \nin the way of Federal subsidies. All 100 plants built between 1970 and \n1990 were built with private funds. The Price-Anderson insurance \nprogram for nuclear plants has never paid a penny of taxpayer money in \ninsurance claims.\n  There are other myths surrounding nuclear power besides subsidies. We \nneed to dispel those. Nuclear opponents claim we don't know what to do \nwith the fuel. That is not true. Scientists, including the \nadministration's Nobel Prize winning Secretary of Energy, Dr. Chu, \ntells us we can store used fuel safely onsite for 40 to 60 years while \nwe work out the best way to recycle the used fuel.\n  We can't wait any longer to start building our future with clean, \nreliable, and affordable energy. The time has come for action. We can \nrevive America's industrial and high-tech economy with the technology \nwe already have at hand. The only requirement is that we open our minds \nto the possibilities and potential of nuclear power. As we do, our \npolicy of cheap and clean energy based on nuclear power, electric cars, \noffshore exploration, and doubling the energy research and development \nwill help family budgets and create jobs. It will also prove to be the \nfastest way to increase American energy independence, to clean the air, \nand to reduce global warming.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I will be speaking about health care, \nbut I did want to note, I was listening to my colleague and friend from \nTennessee. I have invited him before, but in Minnesota we think our \nwind turbines are so beautiful, we have opened a bed and breakfast near \nPipestone. Come, stay overnight, and wake up in the morning and look at \na wind turbine. I guess it is all in the eye of the beholder. We are \nexcited about the power that wind has brought to our State.\n  I wish to address the very important issue of health care. I first \nwant to commend my colleague who is here with me today, Senator \nCantwell, for her commitment to passing a proconsumer health care bill \nthat is focused on reducing cost so that it makes health care more \naffordable to all people.\n  I rise to speak about an issue that is an economic imperative--true \nreform in the way we pay for health care. If we don't act, costs will \ncontinue to skyrocket. The country spent $2.4 trillion on health care \nlast year alone; that is, $1 out of every $6 spent in the economy was \nspent on health care. By 2018, national health care spending is \nexpected to reach $4.4 trillion, over 20 percent of our entire economy. \nThese costs are breaking the backs of our families and businesses. \nPremiums have doubled in just the last 10 years.\n  We can see from this chart, in 1999, single coverage and family \ncoverage. For single coverage in 1999, the premium was $2,196, the \npremium an individual would pay. Now it is up to $4,704. A family in \n1999 paid $5,791. Now they are paying $12,680, a doubling of the \npremiums for families. All of the statistics, all the studies show if \nwe don't do anything, if we just put our heads in the sand, we will see \na doubling of those premiums again.\n  A recent study by the Council of Economic Advisers found that small \nbusinesses pay up to 18 percent more than large businesses to provide \nhealth care insurance for their employees, often forcing these \nbusinesses to lay off employees or cut back on coverage.\n  I met with farmers today. I have met with cattle ranchers. I met with \npeople who are farming and trying their best--self-employed. I have met \nwith a small business up in northern Minnesota in Two Harbors called \nBranite Gear, a backpack company. They make fine backpacks for our \ntroops. Do you know how much the owner of that company now pays for \nhealth care for his family of four: $24,000. He said he now employs 15 \npeople. If he would have known this back 15 years ago, when he started \nthat company, he wouldn't have started it then. He is proud of that \ncompany, but his small business cannot afford to pay this kind of \nmoney.\n  These costs are also breaking the backs of American taxpayers. At the \ncurrent rate of spending, Medicare, such a crucial program for our \nseniors, a safety net, something they must have, is scheduled to be in \nthe red by the year 2017. So those people who are 55 years old and want \nto have Medicare should care about cost reform. If you are 65 years old \nand you plan to live a great life until you are 95 or 100, you should \ncare about a strong Medicare that isn't going in the red.\n  A recent Congressional Budget Office estimate shows that the majority \nof the projected $344 billion increase in Federal revenues in 2010 are \nscheduled to go automatically to cover the rising cost of health care. \nTo put it simply, my bottom line for health care reform is that we must \nget our money's worth from our health care dollars. Right now that is \nnot happening.\n  With 92 percent of our population covered, Minnesota is fortunate to \nhave one of the highest coverage rates of health insurance in the \ncountry. Part of that is we have very good health care. We have a lot \nof nonprofit health care insurance agencies. We also have Minnesota \nCare which extends coverage to so many of our people who can't afford \nit. As any Minnesota family or business knows, the price of health \ninsurance coverage has been going up faster than almost anything else, \nmuch faster than wages. People are worried about the stability of their \ncoverage. That is where I have found unity between Democrats, \nRepublicans, and independents. People want stability. They don't want \nto be thrown off because their kid gets sick. They want coverage, and \nthey want their kid to have coverage. If they change jobs, they want to \nkeep their coverage, and they also want more affordable health care.\n  I have been pressing Senate colleagues and the administration to make \nsure we have reform that results in more affordable and more accessible \nhealth care coverage. The problem is, we are paying too much. We are \nnot getting a good return all the time on what we pay. The solution \nmust be to get the best value for our health care dollars; otherwise, \ncosts will continue to wreak havoc on the budgets of government, \nbusinesses, and individual families.\n  The root of the problem is that most health care is purchased on a \nfee-for-service basis so more tests and more surgeries mean more money. \nOftentimes those surgeries and tests are completely unwarranted. We \nwant quality, and we want outcome to be the measure of good health \ncare. Quantity, not quality, is what pays right now.\n\n  According to researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, nearly $700 \nbillion per year is wasted on unnecessary or ineffective health care. \nThat is 30 percent of total health care spending.\n  My favorite story is about an HMO in the southwestern part of the \nUnited States that said: Let's look at a better way to treat diabetes. \nInstead of having people trying to get in to see their doctors, we will \nhave them seen by nurses and nurse practitioners, and we will have it \noverseen by two endocrinologists. They actually saw health care \nprofessionals more often and quality went up. Costs went down. And \nguess what. They got reimbursed less for that system because of the way \nour current system rewards quantity over quality.\n  This chart says $50 billion. The reason it says $50 billion is that \nan independent study from Dartmouth looked at how Mayo Clinic, one of \nour premier health care institutions, treats chronically ill patients \nin their last 4 years\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\nof life. Quality is incredibly high. What they looked at was the Mayo \nprotocol; if we use that in hospitals all over the country, how much \nwould we save? You would think it would cost more because it is higher \nquality. You would actually save $50 billion in taxpayer money every 5 \nyears just for this set group of patients, if the Mayo protocol was \nfollowed, because they have integrated care. They work as a team, and \nthey are careful and do what the patient wants. They put the patient in \nthe driver's seat.\n  In Minnesota we have several examples of this coordinated, outcome-\noriented system, not just the Mayo Clinic but also St. Mary's in Duluth \nand Health Partners that has done some groundbreaking work with \ndiabetes. As this chart shows, on spending per patient, just using the \nMayo protocol for chronically ill patients, $50 billion would be saved \nevery 5 years.\n  To begin reining in costs we need to have all health care providers \naiming for high-quality, cost-effective results. We must take \nsignificant steps to ensure that Medicare remains available for future \ngenerations. I want to be able to get Medicare and so do those people \nwho are 65. To do that, we have to make the system efficient and cost-\neffective with the highest quality. Let's reduce those hospital \nreadmissions, have less infections in the hospitals. Let's put those \nkinds of Mayo quality standards in place like we see at the Cleveland \nClinic and other places across the country.\n  These policy changes are important steps to make sure Medicare is \npaying for the outcome of treatment, not the number of treatments.\n  We have seen basic outlines from the Finance Committee bill, but we \nhaven't seen it yet. I support the committee's efforts to develop a \nnational program on payment bundling. In too many places, patients must \nstruggle against a fragmented delivery system where providers duplicate \nservices and sometimes work at cross-purposes. To better reward and \nencourage this collaboration, we need to have better coordination of \ncare and less incentive to bill Medicare purely by volume. Increasing \nthe bundling of services in Medicare's payment system has the potential \nto deliver savings and start encouraging quality integrated care.\n  When it comes to improving care, changing who pays the doctor isn't \nas much the issue right now, when we are looking at improved care, as \nit is changing that payment system.\n  The lesson of high-quality, efficient States such as Minnesota is \nthat someone has to be responsible for the care of the patient from \nstart to finish. Bundling will help encourage hospitals, doctors, and \npost-acute care providers to achieve savings for the Medicare Program \nthrough increased collaboration and improved coordination.\n  One of the interesting things I don't think people always know about \nis, they say: If we save money, will that mean worse care? The answer \nactually is no. It is the opposite.\n  Does higher spending equal better care? In fact, when we look across \nthe country, higher spending does not equal better care. In fact, it is \nthe opposite. Here we have a chart that shows the highest quality care \nin the country with the lowest utilization, where they are most cost \nefficient.\n  Maybe you know your doctor well. You go to the specialist they refer \nyou to so you are not running around with your x-ray to 15 different \nspecialists not knowing who is better. Look at this: highest \nutilization has the lowest quality care.\n  Research has shown moving toward a better integrated and coordinated \ndelivery system would save Medicare alone up to $100 billion per year. \nBecause Medicare is the single largest purchaser of health care, \nlinking payment to quality outcomes is essential to improve health care \noutcomes for everyone.\n  We must also stop paying for care that doesn't result in quality \nresults. Reducing preventable hospital readmissions--and I am hopeful \nthis will be in the Senate bill--is vital to curbing the wasteful \nhealth care spending plaguing our national budget. In one year, \nhospital readmissions cost Medicare $17.4 billion. A 2007 report by \nMedPAC found that Medicare paid an average of $7,200 per readmission \nthat was likely preventable. Who wants to go back in the hospital? I \ndon't think anyone wants to go back in the hospital. So not only are we \ngetting lower quality care because certain quality parameters are not \nmet, we are also spending more money for it.\n\n  I am encouraged that the Finance Committee's outline includes a \nprovision that calls for reduced payments to hospitals for preventable \nreadmissions. We know there are some readmissions that are going to \nhappen. It happens all the time--preventable readmissions. Paying for \nquality results also means reducing hospital-acquired infections. We \nshould not have to pay for an infection that comes as a result of a \nhospital stay itself. No one wants to get an extra infection in a \nhospital, and there are vast differences among hospitals in those \ninfection rates. So let's put those quality protocols in place.\n  Third, we need to better reward integrated care systems. At places \nsuch as the Mayo Clinic, a patient's overall care is managed by a \nprimary care physician in coordination with specialists, nurses, and \nother care providers as needed. It is one-stop shopping.\n  It reminds me of a football team. We do not have 10 wide receivers \nrunning around, running into each other, just like we would not have 10 \nspecialists in health care. We have one quarterback who is a primary \ncare physician, and then we have a team that works together. That is \nwhat we want to encourage in the health care system to save money.\n  To better reward and encourage this collaboration, we need to \nencourage the creation of accountable care organizations. These are \ngroups of providers that work together, as they do in Minnesota, to \ndeliver quality, coordinated care to patients. We want to put \nincentives in that reward this kind of care.\n  The President stood before his health care summit and asked: Why \nshould Minnesota be punished when it rewards, when it creates this kind \nof good, high-efficient care? The sad thing is, right now it is because \nwhen we just base pay on volume and we do not pay any attention to what \nthe results are or what the infection rates are or what the readmission \nrates are, we are not getting that kind of quality care people deserve.\n  The last thing I want to focus on is something Senator Cantwell, who \nwill be speaking after me, and I have been so focused on right now; \nthat is, putting some kind of quality index in place. The proposal here \nis to move us toward a system that links quality to cost. Right now, we \ndo not have that in place. I believe we need to do more in the finance \nbill than we even have in the House bill to get this value index in \nplace. This is a bill I have introduced.\n  Senator Cantwell is one of the lead sponsors, as well as Senator \nGregg of New Hampshire.\n  The indexing will help regulate overutilization because those who \nproduce more volume will need to also improve care or the increased \nvolume will negatively impact fees.\n  This legislation will authorize the Health and Human Services \nSecretary to create a value index as part of the formula used to \ndetermine Medicare's fee schedule.\n  By adding a value index, our bill uses cost measures that are \nstructured to allow areas with justifiably higher costs--and we know \nthere are different costs around the country--to compete on an equal \nplaying field with lower cost areas. Rewarding value in this way would \ngive physicians a financial incentive to maximize the quality of their \nservices instead of the quantity.\n  Linking rewards to outcomes creates the incentive for physicians and \nhospitals to work together to improve quality and efficiency. This \nproposal would also work in tandem with other proposals--like those \nbeing advocated by others and those I have mentioned today, the \ncoordinated, integrated care, the bundling, and other ways--to improve \nthe Medicare payment system.\n  We know there are also other ways, and I will end with just \nmentioning these--that we can improve efficiency in health care \nspending: One, as a former prosecutor, I care a lot about this, to \nreduce Medicare fraud. Law enforcement authorities estimate that health \ncare fraud costs taxpayers and costs those seniors on Medicare more \nthan $60 billion every year. This is as much as 20 percent of total \nMedicare spending. There are ways, and we have some bills that have \nalready been introduced, to greatly reduce this.\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\n  Secondly, something the President raised in his speech before \nCongress is this idea of looking at malpractice reform. I can tell you, \nin Minnesota, in 2006, we had the lowest malpractice premiums in the \nNation. Areas like ours, with more efficient care, tend to have lower \nmalpractice premiums, and that is what our doctors want.\n  One of the things we have is a certificate of merit system that has \nbeen implemented in a number of States and goes hand in hand with \nefficient care, requiring a medical expert to sign off on any \ncomplaint, and it has worked.\n  We need to reform our health care system. I am so proud to be in the \nChamber with my colleague, Senator Cantwell, a member of the Finance \nCommittee, who has been, day to day, night by night, advocating for \nthis kind of reform. We want our seniors to stay on Medicare and have \nthe kind of safety net they deserve. We want people who are 55 years \nold to be able to get Medicare when they are the age to get Medicare. \nThe way we do this is by actually increasing quality and decreasing \ncosts.\n  We do this in the State of Minnesota. We know we can do it in other \nplaces of the country. I plead with my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee that we have to look at the long-term costs if we are going \nto bring reform. We have outlined some ways to do this today. We look \nforward to working with people from all over the country. But this has \nto be a major element of reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I rise to talk about the health care reform bill and \nthe most urgent need to make sure we have provider reform as part of \nthe insurance reform package.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for her leadership on this issue. \nShe has hit the ground running when it comes to the issue of health \ncare reform, advocating for changes in policy and introducing \nlegislation at the beginning of this year called the value index \nlegislation. I am proud to be a sponsor of that legislation and proud \nwe have worked together so diligently to try to communicate why this is \nso important for America.\n  Clearly, Minnesota has had good results and is leading our country in \nthe kinds of health care practices we need to adopt. Senator Klobuchar \nhas been able to put that into legislation and to champion that \nlegislation and to work on the floor organizing colleagues from like \nStates to communicate this issue.\n       I am happy to be joining her in the letter we are sending \n     to our Senate leadership and to the President of 1the United \n     States talking about why it is so important to get these \n     reforms adopted.\n  So I thank her for being out here this evening to communicate this \nimportant public policy area, and, again, for having Minnesota be front \nand center in this debate.\n\n  What we are trying to address is an urgent problem; that is, the \nMedicare system, basically--if we do nothing--is going to go broke. It \nis doubling in its cost to the Federal Government.\n  We are talking about reform. We are talking about adding more people. \nSo if we look at Medicare spending and where we are today and the \namount we are going to see in the future, we know we are quickly \ngrowing that number--from 2009 to 2015--to be over $1.2 trillion. So \nthe cost of this--of Medicare doubling over 10 years--is something we \nknow as a country we cannot sustain.\n  Without health care reform--without even the discussion of adding the \nuninsured--we know we cannot sustain the doubling of Medicare in the \nnext 10 years. So we need to change the system.\n  We know what the cause of this crisis is, too. There are many \nelements to health care and health care costs, but we know from the \nmany hearings and testimony we have had from experts that the fee-for-\nservice system is driving up the cost of health care. Fee for service \nrewards providers for the quantity of services they provide without \nregard to whether those services benefit the patient.\n  I ask my colleagues if they have ever experienced this situation I am \nabout to describe because I know many Americans will tell you this is \nexactly what they have experienced. Have you ever asked yourself why \nyour physician, while you are in the middle of a health care \nappointment, seems so hurried? Have you ever asked yourself why the \ndoctor seems so hurried to go to the next appointment?\n  Well, the reason is because that is the way we pay doctors. We pay \ndoctors by the number of patients they see and the number of procedures \nthey order. So the system we have today actually creates an incentive \nfor doctors to spend as little time with each patient as possible.\n  If we think about that, if we think about where our health care \nsystem is today, how is that good for delivering outcomes? How is that \ngood for making sure the patient gets the best care?\n  I want to make sure I am clear. This is not the fault of the doctors. \nThey are just following the rules of the game as it is being played \ntoday. Indeed, many physician organizations are advocating the changes \nin organizational structure that the Senator from Minnesota and I are \nadvocating. They understand it is a daunting task to reform health \ncare. But in this case, they know the problem is simple enough to \ngrasp. All we have to do is follow the money, and what we see in both \nprivate insurance and Medicare is that we are routinely paying for \nduplicative or inefficient care. Then the cost of Medicare and the cost \neventually to taxpayers skyrockets.\n  So if we look at the fee-for-service model, it is pretty clear. It is \na feedback loop. In business, in technology we call this a positive \nfeedback loop because it just feeds each other because we have more \nuse, we order more tests, we have more duplication of services, and we \nhave more spending, and the cycle just keeps going and it keeps \nperpetrating itself. The end result is, we just keep adding costs to \nour system.\n  Nowhere is there an outcome that is judged here, nor is there a value \nto the patient. It is a fee for service that just generates more \nspending. We cannot emphasize that enough because the current system \npromotes an overutilization of what are scarce health care dollars and \nresources.\n  As one national study shows, there is an estimated $700 billion a \nyear in wasted health care dollars. That is health care spending that \nmay not even be--certainly it is wasted dollars. Some people have said \nit can even do harm in the way the money is spent.\n  So we are out here today advocating for a different model. We are out \nhere saying it is good to talk about insurance reform, but if Medicare \nis one in every five health care dollars and Medicare is driving health \ncare spending, it is also driving expensive health insurance. So if we \nhave expensive fee-for-service Medicare that is helping to waste \nprecious Medicare dollars, you bet it is also driving expensive health \ninsurance.\n  The good news is, we already know there is a viable alternative. The \nreason we know that is because we know there are States such as \nWashington and Minnesota and many others across the country that have \nput some of these new practices into place. We know they are working in \nthe real world. In some parts of the country, we have reforms that have \nreversed these trends and they have cut costs and they have put the \nemphasis where it belongs.\n  The bottom line is, they put the patient first. Imagine that: putting \nthe patient first--not the number of procedures ordered, not the number \nof people seen, but putting the patient first by making sure we are \nfocusing on their outcomes.\n  These States and parts of the country have done this by organizing a \ndelivery of care system so the doctors can take the time with their \npatients, and they can take the lead in coordinating their care. \nPatients in these delivery systems get better access to their \nphysicians, they experience shorter waiting times, they benefit from \ncoordinated care that is provided by their primary care physician and \nother health care individuals, and the health care outcomes are better.\n  In fact, if we look at some of these States, and we look at some of \nthe individual criteria, who in America\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\nwould not like shorter waiting times to get to see the health care \nprovider they need to see or better access to doctors or to have one \ndoctor coordinate with their other health care providers their specific \nneeds and treatments and to guarantee better outcomes?\n  On this chart is data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation from \n2008 of what we get when we put a coordinated care delivery system in \nplace and we integrate the care of the individual in the delivery \nsystem. So this kind of delivery system is good for individuals, but it \nis also good for the taxpayer because not only does the patient \nbenefit, we cut down on the bureaucracy and that $700 billion of \nwasteful spending I talked about a few minutes ago.\n  So I believe every part of the country ought to take heed of this \nphenomenal result and the fact that, as my colleague from Minnesota \nsaid, we could save the taxpayers over $100 billion a year if we made \nthis change to coordinated care across the country.\n  When Medicare is structured in a way that it encourages better \nquality and more efficient care, we will also see the price in private \ninsurance go down as well because the cost of correlation of Medicare \ndriving private insurance is there.\n\n  So my colleagues who come from States that have more expensive \nMedicare might think that is somewhat of a benefit, but I guarantee it \nis also driving more expensive private insurance and your citizens are \nnot getting the best care. This Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study \nproves that. If we were looking at other States, all these checkmarks \non the cost and utilization would be high.\n  So we know the health care debate puts us at a crossroads. It puts us \nat a crossroads about what we are going to do about our current health \ncare system. We can either fix these problems or we can exacerbate it \nand make it worse. We all want to help the uninsured in America, but to \nadd more people to this health care system, to cover more people under \nhealth care without changing the way we pay for Medicare is going to \nexplode the Federal deficit. So we want to make sure we don't \nexacerbate this problem.\n  As the Senator from Minnesota said, her home State has implemented \nthese things. So has Washington State. We know that where health care \ncosts are managed efficiently, we are producing great results. But we \nknow the gap between these reimbursement rates in other areas of the \ncountry is still leaving us with inefficient delivery systems, and we \nknow that for our States, we are delivering efficient care. If you \ncontinue to have inefficient systems in other parts of the country that \npay more but are less efficient and don't deliver patients better care, \nyou are going to continue to have health care practitioners migrate to \nthose areas. That is why fixing the health care system but not \naddressing this issue is not a real solution for us because we cannot \ncontinue to see people from Washington and Minnesota and other places \nmigrate to high-cost, high-paid doctor States, with no guaranteeing of \nbetter outcomes but certainly more pay for physicians.\n  We know the fee-for-service model is bleeding our country, and we \nknow we need to make changes to that. We need to have a quality care \nsystem. So that is why I joined Senator Klobuchar at the beginning of \nthe year in introducing legislation for a value index and that is why \nwe have been fighting in the Finance Committee to add these kinds of \nreforms to the system. I am very proud the Finance Committee is looking \nat insurance reform, to ban practices such as excluding individuals \njust because they have a preexisting condition, but provider reform in \nhow Medicare is delivered is as crucial to delivering a good health \ncare system in America. We are advocating that we have a health care \nsystem that puts the patient first, that puts them in the focus of how \nphysicians get paid.\n  We do this specifically by striking a blow against fee for service \nand replacing it with a model that allows physicians to spend more time \nwith their patients, to better coordinate their care, to provide them \nwith preventive care for the future, and to make sure they are getting \nthe quality of care they deserve. As one of my constituents came into \nmy office to talk about this said: I don't want to be medicated, I want \nto be cured. What she meant is don't just write me a prescription and \ntell me to go away; I want you to focus on my specific health care \nneeds. That is what so many people think about our health care system. \nAt a time when we do have advances in new technologies and preventive \ncare and wellness, that can get our consumers focusing on their own \nhealth care needs.\n  So our proposal changes the current payment incentive structure by \nusing a new value index to measure the quality and efficiency of \nservice. And only by replacing the fee-for-service system with this new \nvalue index will we start to control health care costs. According to \ntestimony before the Senate Finance Committee, this is where we are \ngoing to get our biggest savings in health care cost reduction. The \nfee-for-service system, as one of the witnesses said, is the most \nbroken part of Medicare. Under the value index system that we are \nproposing, the Federal Government would do much better and taxpayers \nwould do much better in making sure we do not see that doubling of \nMedicare rates.\n  That is why my colleagues and I are sending a letter--and I see my \ncolleague from Washington on the floor, Senator Murray, who several \nyears ago introduced the MediFair legislation; legislation that said we \nhave to have fairness in the way Medicare dollars are spent around the \ncountry. We can't continue to incent areas of good practice while we \nare warning areas of inefficient care, and she has been a champion \nbehind this issue for many years. So I appreciate her being on the \nfloor because I know she cares passionately about this issue as well. I \nguess that is the point.\n  Those of us who are from these regions are tired of providing \nefficient, coordinated care and not--I think the Presiding Officer is \nfrom one of those States. You can't believe the frustration we have of \ngoing to community after community, knowing we provide better outcomes, \nknowing we provide better care, knowing people have made it work on the \nlowest margins possible. Yet people are leaving our States because they \ncan go make a better buck somewhere else off the inefficient health \ncare system we are delivering. It would be one thing if they could make \nthat quicker buck by going to some State and they were saying: You know \nwhat. We are more expensive, but we deliver more care. That is not what \nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation says. It says they don't deliver \nbetter care. If you can imagine, if you have that fee-for-service \nmodel, where you are spending more and ordering more and out of time \nand so you order all that, how are you getting the best outcomes? You \nare throwing a lot of money at it, but you are not focusing on what is \nthe real quality of care to deliver to that patient.\n  I know my colleagues on the Finance Committee are trying to focus on \nhealth care reforms for the overall system. There are various proposals \nthat I am sure we will see tomorrow as this draft legislation comes out \ntalking about value-based reforms for hospitals and pilot programs for \ncertain regions and accountable care organizations which can help, in \nthe long run, drive down costs by having global health care budgets. \nBut I would say to my colleagues we cannot just have tweaks to this \nsystem. We can't just have pilot programs. We can't just gently turn \nthe wheel of the Titanic and think it is going to avoid the catastrophe \nwe are going to see if we don't reform Medicare.\n  So we will be working hard in the next couple weeks. As I said, we \nare sending a letter to the President and to the leadership here that \nit is time to fix this system; that we have the opportunity to have a \n21st century health care delivery system, with all the great \ninformation and all the great technology that is out there, but this \nsystem can't keep rewarding insurance companies by 435 percent annual \nprofits just because our whole system is set up to order more. Because \nthis isn't about paying for volume. The point is not to pay for volume; \nit is to pay for value. We want to make sure we are paying for that \nvalue and not just the fee-for-service volume system that currently \ndoesn't put patients first in America.\n  So we will be working hard to get these implemented so we can support \nthis health care legislation.\n  I thank the President and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2366, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I seek recognition because in front \nof us we have a proposal I think could be very damaging to our country. \nAn amendment has been proposed that I consider unnecessary and \npotentially dangerous which is being offered by the Senator from \nMississippi, Mr. Wicker.\n  What we are finding is that there is a challenge to whether Amtrak \ncan continue to operate after the 1st of October. It has been modified, \nbut initially it would propose a ban put on Amtrak's operations unless \nguns can be carried in baggage on Amtrak trains. While that is an issue \nthat could be discussed--think about it: Amtrak carries 28 million \npeople in a year, and Amtrak produces far less toxic emissions and is \nmuch more energy efficient. We have been delinquent for so many years \nin investing in good railroading. In this advanced country, in this, \nthe richest country in the world, no matter what our economic condition \nis, it is incomprehensible for that kind of a choice to be put forward: \nEither you carry guns in our trains--in your baggage on our trains or \nelse we shut down the railroad.\n  It is preposterous when you think of the services that are offered, \nnot just directly on the Amtrak trains but on the Amtrak tracks where, \nin many States, it is also used by commuting services. It would cripple \nthe functioning of our country. It is outrageous that, at this point in \ntime, when we have worked so hard to generate funding for Amtrak to \nimprove the service, to bring it up to the 21st century, and it is \nsuggested that maybe we ought to shut it down because we have a \ndisagreement about whether guns can be carried in baggage on railroad \ncars.\n  This amendment now has moved the time period to discontinuing the \nservice in March. Well, I don't know what the value of that is, very \nfrankly. If that kind of a threat hangs over us, do we continue to \ninvest billions of dollars? Do we try to get private investors to buy \nAmtrak bonds? I don't think so, not when we face a threat such as that.\n  Last fall, this Chamber voted overwhelmingly, 74 to 24, to \nreauthorize Amtrak and modernize our Nation's passenger rail system \nand, oddly enough, the Senator from Mississippi voted for this \nlegislation. Amtrak has made much progress because of that new law, but \nthe amendment on the floor would undo all that.\n  The Wicker amendment, as I said earlier, would completely shut down \nour Nation's passenger rail service. That is hardly a thing to do when \nour infrastructure is so severely degraded because of a far greater use \nthan we ever expected. I wish to be clear. This amendment would hardly \ngive Amtrak any time before it might be required to start allowing \nfirearms to be carried on its trains. At this moment, Amtrak will tell \nyou they don't have the means to carry these guns securely and safely.\n  Senator Wicker noted in 2004 Amtrak made a decision to stop \ntransporting guns in the name of security. Why did it happen in 2004? I \nremind those who can hear that it was September 11, 2001, and the \nterrorist attacks in Madrid which reminded us that railroad travel \norganizations are an attractive target for terrorist attacks.\n  Amtrak determined it lacked the ability to securely transport checked \nfirearms. It is a decision that was not casually made.\n  I wish to be able to work with the Senator from Mississippi and \nAmtrak to see if we can develop a reasonable plan so that passengers \ncan safely and reasonably transport guns in checked bags on Amtrak \ntrain. I don't agree with it, but I am happy to discuss it, in \ndeference to Senator Wicker. When you think of what Amtrak means in our \ncountry, I remind you that on September 11, when the World Trade Center \ncame crashing down, taking with it almost 3,000 lives, the only way you \ncould get there on that day, and a couple days thereafter, was by \ntrain, by Amtrak. Aviation was shut down across the country and in much \nof the world. Highways were jammed beyond effective use. But Amtrak was \nthere to help. And to say that our security doesn't raise the issue of \nwhether we can transport guns on Amtrak--that doesn't make sense to me.\n  If Senator Wicker's amendment is adopted, all Amtrak trains across \nthe country, and those that use Amtrak's tracks, could come to a \ncomplete halt in a matter of months.\n  It is outrageous to propose something this crippling over an issue \nthat can be resolved. Yet, the Wicker amendment threatens to leave us \nwith no passenger rail service in America. We cannot afford to sabotage \nour passenger train service to meet this crazy timetable--and I say \ncrazy. When you think about it, for years, we fought to get Amtrak \nstanding as it should be, the principal rail service in a country like \nours. Amtrak was created in 1970, taken out of private hands and put \ninto government hands as a quasi-government corporation. We are \nspending $1.5 billion a year to bring Amtrak up to current standards. \nThe Recovery Act included $8 billion for high-speed rail, plus the \nPresident's budget called for a billion dollars annually for 5 years. \nBy comparison, foreign governments--in 2005, France's national railway \nagency got $8.3 billion in government spending. I said it was $1\\1/2\\ \nbillion in America, and France spent $8.3 billion. Why? Because it is \nefficient. It reduces toxic emissions and the dependency on foreign \noil. Germany spent about $9 billion annually on passenger rail service. \nSpain has a plan to spend $150 billion on rail from 2005 to 2020, or an \naverage of $10 billion a year. And we are trying to play catchup now.\n  Since 1971, a total of $33 billion has been spent on Amtrak. That is \nalmost 40 years, averaging less than a billion dollars a year, as we \nsee what other countries have done. Ridership on Amtrak, in 1988, was \n21 million. In 2008, it was 28 million. People are turning to Amtrak \nbecause they know it is a very respectable way to travel, if it is \navailable to you.\n  So when we look at that and see that the growth of ridership is so \nsubstantial, that tells us we ought to figure out ways to do things \ndifferently. When we look at the whole picture, frankly, it brings a \nlot of concern when you think of the demand for Amtrak services. \nAmtrak, in the last year, had 28 million riders. For instance, New York \nCity, the financial center of the world and the country, is dependent \non the functioning of that financial system. We saw what happened when \nit almost broke down in these last months. In an average day in New \nYork City, more people travel through New York's Penn Station than John \nF. Kennedy Airport, LaGuardia, and Liberty Airport put together on the \nsame day. Penn Station--more people travel through there than all three \nof those airports in a day. And unless guns are permitted to be put \naboard a train, we should shut down Amtrak? We should punish the \nAmerican people because we cannot have guns travel on Amtrak trains? \nThis cannot be justified by any stretch of the imagination.\n  Also, we fail to look at something else. When we put people on \nAmtrak, we free up room in the skyways and on the highways. I cannot \ntell you how often I often fly between here and New Jersey, my home \nState, and I have had a pilot say welcome aboard such-and-such airline, \nand we will be departing soon for a 45-minute flight to Newark Liberty \nAirport. We get on the plane, the doors close, and they move us away \nfrom the gate, and the pilot gets on and says: We just learned that in \nthe New York area we have a 2-hour delay, so we sat there looking at \none another crossly. Everybody was angry and upset. If I had taken \nAmtrak--I came down yesterday in just over 2\\1/2\\ hours. What a \ndifference. Very often, airplane trips less than 250 miles are the \nslowest means of travel because of the delays from airport to airport, \nand because of weather, et cetera. There are hardly any highways that I \ntravel in the country, as my colleagues do--no matter what city you go \nto, if it is during particular hours, you cannot get there from here.\n  I have been in the Senate now for 25 years. When I first came to \nWashington, the ride from where I live was about a 12-minute ride. Now, \nin the evening, I can wait a half an hour while red lights change to \ngreen and traffic doesn't move. Go by rail. We see what happens in a \nreasonable facsimile, when you look at the Metro, a very successful \noperation here in Washington, DC. People want the convenience, the \nreliability, and they don't worry about the weather. It makes us feel \nbetter about our time spent. We get home with the family, and we get\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\nto work on time, and we get to the doctor, and other places you have to \ngo on a regular basis.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will look at this and say it could \nbe an important issue for some people--certainly, for some particular \ninterest. Typically, it is the NRA pushing this interest, but \ndiscounting that, people have a right to vote. But I plead with my \ncolleagues, please, don't punish the American people, or the American \neconomy, and don't take the chance for that disruption, and don't \ndiminish our ability for rapid movement if we have to in a moment of \nthreat.\n  I hope the vote will say if you want to have this discussion, let's \nhave it, but don't put a sword hanging over the head of Amtrak.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

She is \nworking to come up with an agreement that will provide for \nconsideration of other amendments to the bill, but we have not been \nable to get consent. I hope we can.\n  We have just entered into an agreement which will provide for votes \nin relation to seven pending amendments. There are at least two pending \namendments that will not require rollcall votes. Maybe some of the \nothers won't.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \nupcoming anniversary of the signing of the Constitution of the United \nStates of America. September 17, 1787, will mark the 222nd year that \nhas passed since that final meeting in Independence Hall, when 39 \ndelegates supported the adoption of the Constitution.\n  Beginning on May 25, 1787, 55 delegates gathered almost daily in the \nState House in Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation. By \nthe middle of June, it became apparent to the delegates that merely \namending of the Articles of Confederation would not suffice. These \ninspired men worked together to form a new government that would embody \nthe principals of liberty, democracy, and equality. What resulted was \nan entirely new document designed to bind the individual States more \nfirmly into one nation by ceding greater power to the central \ngovernment while still respecting the sovereignty of the States and the \nrights of the people. After being signed in September of 1787, Congress \nsent printed copies of the Constitution to the State legislatures for \nratification. By June 21, 1788, nine States had approved the \nConstitution, finally forming ``a more perfect Union.''\n  The Constitution of the United States of America stands today as our \nNation's most sacred and inspired document. It is the oldest \nConstitution in the world and an enduring legacy of a generation of \npatriots eager to provide liberty and protection to the citizens of \nthis new country. The Constitution is the basis for our laws, our \nrights, and our responsibilities as Americans. It is a gift for which \nwe all should be grateful. As President Coolidge once remarked, ``To \nlive under the American Constitution is the greatest political \nprivilege that was ever accorded to the human race.''\n  As our country continues to age, year by year, the importance of the \nConstitution will never fade. It is a living document, and is as \nrelevant now as it was to its framers in the 18th century. I call upon \nmy colleagues in the Senate to join me in celebrating the signing of \nthe Constitution, and in turn, the assurance of our freedoms as \ncitizens of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9365-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9365-S9366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CELEBRATION OF CARBON DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this year, the State of Illinois has \ndesignated September 15, 2009, as Carbon Day. As an official State \nholiday, communities across the State are encouraged to focus on \nreducing our State's carbon footprint and preserving our environment. \nSchools, organizations, businesses, and communities throughout Illinois \nwill participate in organized events ranging from tree plantings to \nthose promoting recycling and composting.\n  Carbon Day allows Illinois residents to find their own ways to help \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and participate in the fight against \nglobal warming. Most of us don't think too much about how our daily \nactivities contribute to greenhouse gases. This new State holiday asks \npeople to think about that and offers ideas each of us can use to make \na difference.\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\n  We do need to act. Global warming likely will lead to more severe \nheat waves and more fierce storms. That affects all of us. These are \nweather patterns that compromise air and water quality, reduce \nagricultural productivity, and threaten public health.\n  The simple step of planting a tree this fall can make a difference in \nsomeone's carbon footprint. One tree alone can absorb as much carbon \ndioxide as a single car can produce over 26,000 miles of driving. The \nmore trees we plant, the greater the impact.

KENNEDY\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues today to express \nmy profound and heartfelt sadness on the passing of Senator Edward M. \nKennedy, a universally acknowledged ``lion of this institution''--an \nunsurpassed colleague, a legislator's legislator, and political icon of \nincalculable, landmark significance to the U.S. Senate and the Nation \nand a good friend to me and to so many others in this body through the \nyears.\n  Like all of my colleagues here today, I want to first and foremost \noffer my most sincere condolences to Ted's extraordinary wife Vicki, \nwho has been such a tower of strength, courage, and faith; as well as \nto Ted's three children Kara, Ted, Jr., and Patrick Kennedy and two \nstepchildren Curran and Caroline Raclin; Ted's sister, Jean Kennedy \nSmith, and to his entire family who have done so much to shape the \ncourse of our Nation. My heart goes out to Senator Kennedy's numerous \ngrandchildren, nieces, and nephews whose participation in his funeral \nmass could not have been more moving. I also extend my deepest \nsympathies to the people of Massachusetts, who have lost a legendary \nchampion and fierce advocate for nearly half a century.\n  And how powerful and poignant was the remarkable outpouring of \nrespect and affection for Senator Kennedy by the American people--from \nthe streets of Boston, outside the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library \nand Museum, and near the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, to \ncongressional staff assembled on the Senate steps and mourners and \nwell-wishers on the Capitol grounds or along the route to his final \nresting place at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  On an occasion of such a large and historic loss, summoning the \nappropriate words to capture the immense depth and breadth of this \nmoment as well as the magnitude of its meaning represents the most \ndaunting of challenges. Like every Senator fortunate enough to serve in \nthis esteemed chamber during the span of the last 46 years, I have \nnever known a Senate without Ted Kennedy, and it is difficult to \ncomprehend that this hallowed Chamber will never again resound with \nSenator Kennedy's booming voice that would literally shake these walls.\n  As I look around this Chamber, I know I am far from alone in saying I \nwill miss Ted's oratorical command of rhetoric and argumentation as \nwell as his passion-filled gestures that punctuated his statements, and \nof course I will never forget those occasions when Ted would really get \nwound up as only Ted could, and his glasses would come off, and he \nwould swing them around and around, faster and faster as his polemic \nreached a crescendo. And so, there is a highly personal and inescapable \nvoid among all of us that is at once acutely palpable, indescribable, \nand unforgettable.\n  I can still remember entering the Senate in 1995 having served in the \nU.S. House of Representatives and looking to my fellow New Englander, \nSenator Kennedy, as a model legislator, the best of his generation even \nthen, for what can be achieved in the Senate with passion and devotion \nand an almost peerless ability to simply ``get things done.''\n  I always profoundly admired Ted for his commitment to this country \nand the steadfast, immutable determination he exhibited each and every \nday as he sought to better our Nation to the benefit not just of his \nconstituents in Massachusetts but to all Americans. And he did so with \nuncommon civility and candor, facility and efficacy, partisanship and \nbipartisanship, as well as the most seriousness of purpose and \nirrepressible good humor. In short, Ted Kennedy combined legislative \ncraftsmanship and legendary statesmanship that were the marvel of his \ntime and that represented a pinnacle of leadership.\n  And part and parcel of his historic and overarching legacy is not \njust the results produced by his hard-fought labors, which have reached \nevery corner of our country, but how he legislated and conducted the \ndemanding task of advancing the public policy process. Where there was \na divide, he saw an opportunity to repair the breach. Where there were \nopposing forces, he resolved to find a point of alliance.\n  As my colleagues here can attest, Senator Kennedy was ever-cognizant \nthat your adversary today could, and frankly often would be, your ally \ntomorrow--the staunch opponent you encounter on one occasion may well \nsupport you on another down the road. Because for Ted, common ground \nwas not simply a plot of earth he tilled, cultivated, or nourished, it \nwas soil he intuitively knew was meant to be shared and that would be \nimproved through collaboration. And he understood keenly that the most \npowerful light was not the spotlight, but reflected light that shone \nfirst on someone else.\n  And if Ted Kennedy put into practice the idea that politics in the \noften-cited words of German Chancellor Bismarck was indeed ``the art of \nthe possible,'' he was also equally adept at implementing the notion \nthat leadership was the catalyst for accomplishing the impossible. Not, \nhowever, by going it alone but rather by enlisting the active support \nof others.\n  The fact is, like so many of my colleagues in this Chamber, I was \nprivileged to work with Senator Kennedy on several memorable measures, \nand one recent endeavor in particular exemplifies his collaborative \nspirit--the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. That experience \nfor me represented a microcosm of Ted's unrivaled political and public \npolicy acumen.\n  To begin with, Senator Kennedy, as chairman of the Senate Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions or HELP, ordinarily would \nhave been the lead sponsor on legislation being reported out of his \ncommittee. But, as all of us in this Chamber know, there was nothing \n``ordinary'' about Ted Kennedy, and he graciously deferred the lead \nsponsorship to me and instead joined as lead Democratic sponsor of our \nmeasure, a gesture of incredible generosity and good will that I will \nnever forget. And so, after already twice garnering Senate passage, we \nbegan a third attempt to achieve Senate enactment of vital reforms to \nprotect Americans from both health insurance and workplace \ndiscrimination based on their genetic makeup. Beginning in November of \n2006, we embarked on what was to be a second 18-month-long effort to \nsystematically address every issue which opponents raised. Senator \nKennedy's remarkable capacity to build consensus with both his \ncolleagues and stakeholders, spoke to his consummate skills as a \nlegislator and negotiator.\n  And Ted never tired in this undertaking, and his knowledge and skills \nand those of his superb and dedicated staff helped ensure our success \nwhen, on May 21 of last year, we at last witnessed the enactment into \nlaw of this landmark civil rights protection. Our victory was tempered, \nhowever, by the fact that due to his illness, even then, Ted could not \njoin us at the White House that day for the signing. And yet it speaks \nenormous volumes that Senator Kennedy chose to devote his remaining \nenergies in the past 15 months prior to his passing to ensuring that \nhealth reform advance ever forward.\n  As anyone who has come into contact with Ted Kennedy can tell you, he \npossessed and exuded a contagious joy and exuberance that permeated all \nhe did. I well recall a few years ago being in\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\nBoston for a Base Closure and Realignment--BRAC--Commission hearing, \nand we were waiting for an elevator. As many in this Chamber will \nrecall, this was a very anxious and uncertain period for a number of \nus. But I will always remember seeing the elevator doors open and who \nshould appear but Ted Kennedy, alongside a large group of his \nconstituents, fighting the closure of a facility in Massachusetts. And \nwithout missing a beat, he roared with his sonorous voice: ``You go \nfight them Olympia with everything you've got!'' The whole crowd with \nhim cheered.\n  That moment reflected so much of what Ted exemplified, encompassed, \nand meant to so many, and he approached his causes with a ferocity of \nspirit and feeling that was unmatched. It is true, as all of us in this \ninstitution know all too well, if Ted Kennedy were opposite you in a \ndebate, and sometimes I was, it could be rough going and you had better \nbe prepared! But if he were with you, let's just say your chances for \nvictory increased exponentially!\n  And Ted never lost that gusto--not in legislating and not in life. \nWho could forget witnessing Ted throwing out the first pitch for New \nEngland's beloved Boston Red Sox at this year's home opener at Fenway \nPark? Or his zeal for his beloved Massachusetts or, for that matter, \nthe Maine coast which he loved so much where he sailed every summer. \nIndeed, one year he and Vicki visited an inn near our family place at \nHancock Point. And I will always remember the excitement and \nanticipation he exhibited as he showed me his map of the journey he and \nVicki were preparing to undertake, sailing along the beautiful Maine \ncoastline.\n  As my colleagues know above all, this greatest of deliberative bodies \nhas lost a giant and a legislative standard-bearer who was tirelessly \ndevoted to its history, its stewardship, and its purpose, and his ardor \nand love for this most august institution and the Nation it serves will \nnever be extinguished. Senator Kennedy now ranks among a rarefied, \npantheon of legendary Senators such as Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. \nHe was, to evoke the title of the Pulitzer-Prize winning book by his \nbrother, John, truly a ``profile in courage.''\n  The great American poet, Carl Sandburg, once wrote: ``I see America \nnot in the setting sun of night . . . I see America in the crimson \nlight of a rising sun. I see great days ahead, great days possible to \nmen and women of will and vision.'' Those days are indeed possible for \nthis Senate, this Congress, and our country precisely because of the \nindefatigable will and limitless vision of public servants such as \nSenator Ted Kennedy. We honor his memory and his legacy best by \nstriving every day to make this process work for the U.S. Senate and \nfor the American people.\n  And what Maine's own Henry Wadsworth Longfellow penned about another \nSenator from Massachusetts, Charles Sumner, we say today about Senator \nKennedy:\n\n     So when a great man dies,\n     For years beyond our ken,\n     The light he leaves behind him lies\n     Upon the paths of men.\n\n  So it will forever be with Senator Edward M. Kennedy. We will not see \nhis like again. He will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9367-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week we celebrate the 15th anniversary \nof the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, one of our most powerful tools \nto combat domestic violence and other crimes perpetrated against women \nand families.\n  The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 marked an \nimportant national commitment to survivors of domestic violence and \nsexual assault. This landmark legislation filled a void in Federal law \nthat left many victims without the help they needed. In commemorating \nthis milestone, I would like to recognize the leadership of Vice \nPresident Joe Biden. His dedication to eliminating violence against \nwomen and families was vital to our success in passing the original \nlegislation and subsequent reauthorizations. I am proud to have worked \nwith him on this important matter for nearly two decades.\n  As a prosecutor in Vermont earlier in my career, I witnessed the \ndevastating impact of domestic violence and sexual assault. I saw how \nit affects people from all walks of life, regardless of gender, race, \nculture, age, class or sexuality. Our Nation has made remarkable \nprogress since that time in recognizing that domestic violence and \nsexual assault are crimes, and we have responded with better laws, \nsocial support, and coordinated community resources.\n  Since the Violence Against Women Act became law, domestic violence \nreporting rates by women have increased by as much as 50 percent, and \nreporting rates by men have risen by 37 percent. At the same time, the \nnumber of individuals killed by an intimate partner has decreased by 24 \npercent for women and 48 percent for men. These are huge improvements, \nand we should be proud of the work we have accomplished together. There \nis, of course, more work to be done. Millions of women, men, children, \nand families continue to be traumatized by abuse, leading to increased \nrates of crime, violence and suffering.\n  Earlier this year, I chaired a Judiciary Committee hearing on the \nongoing importance of VAWA. We heard from individuals around the \ncountry who shared with us the impact the law has had on their lives \nand the continuing need to strengthen it. We have been hearing for some \ntime about important steps we can take to enhance VAWA, which is why at \nthe beginning of this year I introduced the Improving Assistance to \nDomestic and Sexual Violence Victims Act of 2009, a bill to make \nseveral needed corrections and improvements to VAWA. Among other \nimportant changes, this bill would bolster privacy protections for \nvictims of domestic violence and offer greater help in rural and tribal \nareas. These improvements would ensure that the law is as effective and \nstrong as it was intended to be and that it meets the needs of those it \nseeks to protect. We were able to report this bill from the Judiciary \nCommittee in May but with an amendment that has complicated further \nprogress.\n  On this 15th anniversary, it is important that we pause to celebrate \nwhat we have accomplished. There is no doubt we have made great strides \nin reducing domestic violence and sexual assault, but we know more work \nremains to be done. I look forward to working together with other \nSenators, the Obama-Biden administration, and experts in the field to \nensure that VAWA remains a vital resource for prosecutors, law \nenforcement agencies, victim service providers, and, most importantly, \nthe women and families who are threatened with violence and abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9367-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9367-S9368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GLENNS FERRY CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \nacknowledge the 100th anniversary of the founding of the city of Glenns \nFerry, ID. On September 26, 2009, the citizens of Glenns Ferry will \ngather in the high school gymnasium to commemorate the 100th year of \nits founding. This is a very historic and special day for this \ncommunity.\n  Glenns Ferry boasts a colorful Western heritage as one of the most \nfamous river crossings on the Oregon Trail. Pioneers would ford the \nSnake River at the Three Island Crossing until 1869 when Gustavus \n``Gus'' Glenn constructed a ferry roughly 2 miles upstream. Gus's ferry \nwould cut-off nearly 20 miles from the Southern Oregon Trail route, as \nit carried two wagons at a time across the river.\n  In 1870, Gus's brother Oliver S. Glenn--known as O.S.--joined him in \noperating the ferry and together they ran it successfully until 1876. \nIn 1871, the town site was platted just downstream from the ferry site \nand a community started to grow from the desert.\n  In 1883, this area was inundated by a force of tracklayers whose duty \nit was to lay the tracks of the Oregon Short Line railroad. The \ntracklayers camp required 23 saloons and a dance hall. With the \nestablishment of a post office and the appointment of O.S. Glenn as \npostmaster, the site required a formal name. And what more suitable a \nname than ``Glenns Ferry'' in recognition of the enormous contributions \nmade by the Glenn family.\n  The coming of the railroad caused the eventual discontinuation of the\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\nferry service in approximately 1889. Although Glenn's Ferry was \nabandoned, the name was not, but was instead given to the city, which \nwas incorporated in October of 1909.\n  Since that time, Glenns Ferry has developed into a prosperous \ncommunity along interstate 84 and has retained its historical western \nroots while incorporating new business and development. In 1971, the \nThree Island State Park was developed with campgrounds, cabins and a \nhistory center. Each August for the past 25 years, the park joined with \nthe city of Glenns Ferry to reenact the crossing just like the pioneers \nin the 1800s prior to the ferry's development. Last month marked the \nlast reenactment of the dangerous river crossing, but the annual \nfestival will continue in celebration of the city's heritage.\n  The economic backbone of Glenns Ferry is agriculture. Elmore County \ngrows a wide variety of crops and animals--cattle, alfalfa hay, \npotatoes, grapes, sugarbeets, wheat, barley, and dairy. Glenns Ferry \nhas become known for its award-winning wines at Carmela Vineyards and \nCold Springs Winery. Glenns Ferry is also the home of Korey Hall, \nfullback for the Green Bay Packers and former Boise State University \nfootball star.\n  Glenns Ferry has much to celebrate and look forward to in its next \ncentury as it provides important goods and services at home and abroad. \nCongratulations to the city of Glenns Ferry for 100 years of service \nand success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9368-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          COMMENDING TOM WALSH\n\n Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, a great man is being honored by \nthe Salvation Army in Casper, WY. Tom Walsh is a patriot, a teacher, a \nleader, and a friend. It is fitting that the Salvation Army has \nbestowed upon him this year's Others Award. It is the highest award the \nlocal Salvation Army unit bestows for outstanding contributions and \nimpacts in the community.\n  Born and raised in Thermopolis, WY, Tom attended the University of \nWyoming and ultimately received a doctorate from the University of \nColorado. How fortunate we are that Tom and his wife Rita chose Casper \nas the place to live, work, and raise their family.\n  When one looks around the Casper community, Tom's influence is \nobvious. He served as mayor and on the Casper City Council. The Casper \nChamber of Commerce also benefited from his guidance. Our world-famous \ndrum and bugle corps, the Casper Troopers, have been the recipients of \nhis time, talent, and generosity. The list goes on and on.\n  Tom had a distinguished career in the Wyoming Legislature. He was \neffective in passing legislation to improve our community and our \nState, particularly in the areas of education, county libraries, tort \nreform, community colleges, and substance abuse. Some of the efforts he \nis most proud of include the Business Ready Communities Program and the \nVeterans Property Tax Exemption Program. Tom resigned his service as a \nState representative due to his battle with leukemia--a battle he is \nfighting with distinction and tenacity.\n  Though Tom's great achievements are numerous, I know he is \nparticularly proud of his role as an Army Reserve ambassador. In this \nposition, Tom provided extraordinary support to our soldiers and their \nfamilies while stationed on the frontlines in the global war on \nterrorism. Tom went far above the duties of an Army Reserve ambassador. \nHe used his position as a State legislator to successfully sponsor a \nbill to make it easier for Wyoming families to cope while their \nbreadwinner is off to war. The bill created a $5 million trust fund, \nused to help qualifying families with special financial needs. The bill \nthat passed into Wyoming law during the 57th Wyoming Legislature \ndemonstrates the public's concern for and commitment to our Reserve \nmembers and their families as they adjust to the new reality of modern \nwar. For his efforts, he received the Patrick Henry Award from the \nNational Guard Association.\n  Mr. President, join me in sending our congratulations and thanks to \nTom Walsh. Receiving the Others Award from the Casper Salvation Army is \na fitting tribute to this fine American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9368-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMENDING REAR ADMIRAL CHRISTINE M. BRUZEK-KOHLER\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great \nAmerican and a dedicated naval officer who has diligently served for \nthe past 35 years and most recently served as the Director, Navy Nurse \nCorps. Admiral Bruzek-Kohler, a native of Camden, New Jersey, entered \nthe Navy in 1974 after earning her Bachelor of Science in Nursing from \nVillanova University. Admiral Bruzek-Kohler served in many nursing \nroles, obtained her master's and doctoral degrees, and was selected to \nserve in many distinguished senior health executive assignments \nincluding executive officer, commanding officer, and now regional \ncommander and commander. However, the most rewarding role of her career \nwas serving as the 21st Director Navy Nurse Corps, where she led more \nthan 4100 Active-Duty and Reserve nurses to advance the role and \nrelevance of nursing in the military and throughout our Nation. With \nvisionary leadership, she championed initiatives that successfully \nincreased nurse recruitment and retention through accession and \nspecialty pay bonuses, loan repayment programs, and educational \nopportunities to both military and Federal civilian nurses. Seeing \nfirsthand the physical and psychological wounds of war borne by our \nyoung servicemembers and their families, Admiral Bruzek-Kohler \nspearheaded nursing operational readiness improvements to include \nclinical sustainment policies and the expansion of mental health nurse \nspecialists and mental health nurse practitioners within the Nurse \nCorps.\n  Admiral Bruzek-Kohler served with passion and conviction and \nprofoundly impacted Federal nursing issues within the Navy and our \nnation. Her performance reflects exceptionally on herself, the U.S. \nNavy, the Department of Defense, and the United States of America. I \nextend my deepest appreciation to Admiral Bruzek-Kohler on behalf of a \ngrateful nation for her years of dedicated service to the Navy Nurse \nCorps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9368-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9368-S9369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING FORT VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to honor in the Record of \nthe Senate Fort Valley State University in Fort Valley, GA, and the \nschools leadership team, headed by its great president and alumnus, Dr. \nLarry E. Rivers.\n  This fall, more than 1,500 new freshmen have started classes at Fort \nValley State University, making their mark on their very first day as \nthe largest incoming freshman class in the schools history. This large \nfreshmen class allowed the school to exceed the enrollment goal set by \nDr. Rivers. In fact, total enrollment has doubled since Dr. Rivers \narrival at Fort Valley State University in 2006.\n  The 2010 edition of Americas Best Colleges by U.S. News Media Group \nlisted Fort Valley State University as No. 21 among historically Black \ncolleges and universities. FVSU is listed among first-tier schools such \nas Spelman College, Howard University, and Morehouse College.\n  Due to these great achievements by FVSU, the school is expanding at a \nrapid pace. A new $9 million stadium opened on August 29, 2009, to \nstart the Wildcat football season. In addition, plans for 2010 include \na $16.7 million science building and a $6 million student amenities \nbuilding. Other plans for the future include a Family Development \nCenter and the expansion of the Stallworth Agricultural Research \nBuilding to add additional laboratory space. The Georgia Board of \nRegents also recently approved new FVSU College of Education programs, \nincluding agriculture education 6-12, special education general \ncurriculum/early childhood education P-5, middle grades education 4-8, \nand school counselor. The board of regents also approved online \nbachelors degree programs in political science, psychology and \nEnglish--Technical English and professional writing--and offsite \nprograms in criminal justice, business administration, and an online \ncriminal justice franchise.\n  It is also evident through the school's community outreach efforts \nthat the young people who attend Fort\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\nValley State University are putting the skills they learn in the \nclassroom to even greater use in the surrounding community and are \nlearning to make a positive difference in the lives of others.\n  I am pleased to acknowledge the great work that is done each day at \nFort Valley State University, and I appreciate the vision of Dr. Rivers \nand his team to ensure students receive the highest quality education \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9369-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING HOWARD HIGH SCHOOL OF TECHNOLOGY\n\n Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Howard High School \nof Technology in Wilmington, which is celebrating its 140th anniversary \nthis month. This institution was the only high school for African \nAmericans in my home State of Delaware until the 1920s and played an \nimportant role in the historic Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of \nEducation.\n  Howard High School was founded in 1869 as a four-room elementary \nschool, which eventually began to graduate high school students in \n1893. Today, the school boasts 860 students in grades 9 through 12. \nGraduates earn both a high school diploma and a certificate of \ncompetency in one of 13 programs. Howard was a Blue Ribbon school in \n1997 and 1999 as a result of its students' academic success. It has \nalso been a National Service Learning Leader School since 2000, \nreceiving grants to engage students in service activities linked to \nacademic achievement and civic responsibility.\n  In April 2005, Howard High School was designated as a national \nlandmark because of its significance in the 1954 Brown v. Board of \nEducation case, which struck down the ``separate but equal'' doctrine \nand ended the segregation of public schools. Howard graduate Louis \nRedding worked with a team of lawyers, led by Thurgood Marshall, to win \nthe landmark ruling. Delaware's specific case, Belton v. Gebhart, \nchallenged the inferior conditions of two schools designated for \nAfrican-American children. In the suburb of Claymont, African-American \nchildren were prohibited from attending the area's local high school. \nInstead, they had to ride a school bus for nearly an hour to attend \nHoward High.\n  I congratulate Howard High School of Technology on its anniversary \nand wish its students, teachers, and administrators much success as it \ncontinues to serve as one of Wilmington's pre-eminent schools, open to \nall and fostering achievement in a number of academic fields.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9369-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9369-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9369-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:46 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to provide all Medicare beneficiaries with the right \nto guaranteed issue of a Medicare supplemental policy; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, a key component of the health reform debate \nis ensuring that all people--regardless of their health status--have \naccess to comprehensive and affordable coverage options. Unfortunately, \nunder current law Medicare beneficiaries are subject to discriminatory \nmedical practices that deny coverage options based on their age, \ncondition, or disability.\n  Medigap plans provide vital assistance to Medicare beneficiaries in \npaying Medicare cost-sharing. Without supplemental coverage, the \nabsence of an out-of-pocket limit in Medicare leaves beneficiaries \nvulnerable to catastrophic medical expenses.\n  Unfortunately, Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities or who have \nend-stage renal disease, ESRD, do not have the same guaranteed issue \nrights as Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older. In the absence of \nequal opportunity and access to Medigap policies at the Federal level, \n29 States have chosen to grant the same rights to disabled and ESRD \nbeneficiaries that seniors currently enjoy.\n  ESRD beneficiaries are also the only group of Medicare beneficiaries \ncurrently denied the same Medicare choices as other Medicare \nbeneficiaries. They are statutorily prohibited from enrolling in \nMedicare Advantage plans.\n  Today I am introducing the Equal Access to Medicare Options Act, a \nbill that improves coverage options to Medicare beneficiaries. First, \nthe legislation would extend guaranteed issue of Medigap policies to \nall Medicare beneficiaries rather than limiting guaranteed issue to \nthose beneficiaries who are over 65 years of age. This change will \nsignificantly improve coverage options and affordability for \nbeneficiaries with disabilities or end-stage renal disease.\n  Second, the legislation recognizes that Medicare beneficiaries need \nflexibility to adjust their coverage as changes to their plans are \nmade. More specifically, the legislation would give guaranteed issue \nrights to Medicare Advantage enrollees if they decide to switch to \ntraditional Medicare during an enrollment period. Today, if a Medicare \nAdvantage enrollee learns of premium increases or benefit reduction in \ntheir plan, they have the option of returning to traditional Medicare \nbut they have no assurance they can buy Medigap coverage if they do so.\n  Third, the legislation would provide guaranteed issue to dual \neligibles who lose their Medicaid coverage and find themselves in \ntraditional Medicare without the cost protections of Medicaid and \nwithout supplemental coverage options.\n  Finally, this legislation would for the first time give beneficiaries \nwith end-stage renal disease the option of enrolling in Medicare \nAdvantage plans.\n  I would like to thank a number of organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of the Equal Access to Medicare Options Act \nand who have endorsed it today, including the AARP, California Health \nAdvocates, Center for Medicare Advocacy, Consortium for Citizens with \nDisabilities, Consumers Union, Dialysis Patient Citizens, Fresenius \nMedical Care, Medicare Rights Center, and the National Kidney \nFoundation.\n  These reforms would ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries regardless \nof their disability or age have equal opportunity and access to \naffordable Medicare options to reduce out-of-pocket costs. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to achieve these \ngoals in the context of health care reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Hatch, and \n        Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1670. A bill to reform and modernize the limitations on exclusive \nrights relating to secondary transmissions of certain signals; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during the past decade we have witnessed \ntremendous development in the way video content is made available to \nconsumers. Today, as a result of digital technology, we can watch \nmovies, television programs, and other video not only on our television \nsets, but also on our computers, phones, and other mobile devices. In \norder to maximize the potential of digital content, Congress must \nensure that our copyright and communications laws are modernized and \nupdated to accommodate the digital revolution. Today, I join with \nSenators Sessions, Kohl, Hatch, and Kyl in introducing the Satellite \nTelevision Modernization Act of 2009. Our legislation will reauthorize, \nmodernize, and simplify important portions of the statutory license \nused by satellite providers that will otherwise expire at the end of \nthis year.\n  The transition to digital television requires Congress to modernize \nthe statutory copyright licenses that allow cable and satellite \nproviders to retransmit the content of local broadcast stations. In \nFebruary, many stations across the country, including those in Vermont, \nmade the digital transition and can now offer multiple programming \nchannels over a single, crystal-clear digital signal. In June, the \nremaining broadcast stations across the country completed the digital \ntransition. The current statutory licenses, however, are based on the \nnow outdated analog standard. In our reauthorization, we seek to ensure \nthat the licenses work properly in the digital world.\n  In June 2008, the U.S. Copyright Office issued a report on the \nstatutory licenses, and offered recommendations on how to improve the \ncurrent system. The Copyright Office's principal recommendation was to \nmove toward abolishing the compulsory licenses, in particular the \ndistant signal licenses. Short of that, the Copyright Office offered \nsuggestions on how to harmonize and streamline the licenses.\n  The legislation we introduce today draws on the recommendations of \nthe Copyright Office and takes important steps toward limiting future \nreliance on the section 119 distant signal license used by satellite \nproviders. This legislation will move locally oriented elements out of \nthe distant signal license--such as the special exception that allows \nVermonters in the State's southern-most counties to receive Vermont \nbroadcast stations by satellite--and place them into the section 122 \nlicense, which facilitates the retransmission of local content with the \nconsent of the broadcaster. The bill will also fix an anomaly in the \ndistant signal license, which will make it easier for satellite \nproviders to serve local markets that are missing a network affiliate.\n  Making these changes will improve the ability of satellite providers \nto deliver a full complement of network stations to consumers, as well \nas make it easier for them to offer local stations. In Vermont, these \nchanges will have the additional benefit of fostering competition \nbetween DISH Network and DirecTV, by allowing DISH to offer Vermont \nbroadcast stations in southern Vermont, a service DirecTV provides \ntoday. The legislation also adds a new provision to the local license \nthat will allow satellite providers such as DISH to import a missing \nnetwork station from an adjacent market when the local market is not \nserved by all four principle networks, after the provider first obtains \nthe station's consent. This new provision will make it more likely and \nreasonable for DISH to launch local service in these markets, which is \ngood for local broadcasters, good for satellite providers, and good for \nconsumers.\n  These changes will not only improve the satellite licenses, but will \nbegin the process of phasing out the distant signal license as \nsatellite providers offer local service in more markets. As the distant \nsignal license fades, Congress should follow the Copyright Office's \nsuggestion and move ultimately toward a market-based system, in which \nstatutory licenses are unnecessary.\n  One further step we can take toward a marketplace model this year is \nto allow broadcast stations to opt-out of the statutory licenses. All \nnon-broadcast channels carried by cable and satellite providers, such \nas ESPN and the USA Network, are able to aggregate a complex series of \ncontent rights, and negotiate for carriage in the free market. Local \nbroadcasters should be permitted to do the same if they, too, are able \nto aggregate the necessary rights to license directly to cable and \nsatellite providers. This is a proposal I expect the Judiciary \nCommittee to examine as the bill moves through the mark up process. I \nencourage all industry participants to work with the Committee so that \nwe can address any concerns about this market-based approach.\n  Short of repealing the compulsory licenses, the Copyright Office \nrecommended harmonizing the cable and satellite licenses in order to \ncreate regulatory parity between the two industries. The section 111 \nlicense used by cable, for instance, is based on FCC rules that have \nlong since been repealed, and the license itself has not been \nsignificantly updated since it was established more than 30 years ago. \nThe arcane nature of the cable license can at times produce unintended \nresults, such as cable companies paying copyright holders for content \nthat consumers do not actually receive. This is referred to as the \nphantom signal problem. In contrast, satellite companies pay a flat, \nper subscriber rate based on consumers actually receiving a broadcast \nstation. Comprehensive reforms to section 111 that aim to modernize the \nstatute and create regulatory parity between cable and satellite \nproviders would address these disparities. We take a more modest \napproach in the bill we introduce today. The legislation contains an \namendment that will resolve the phantom signal issue. I appreciate that \nmembers of the content community and the cable system came together to \nfind a solution on which they can all agree.\n  The Satellite Television Modernization Act is one component of the \nreauthorization. Portions of the expiring law are within the \njurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Commerce, and I look forward to \nworking with the leadership of that Committee, and our counterparts in \nthe House of Representatives, to enact legislation that once again \nimproves the law by fostering competition, protecting broadcasters, and \nimproving service to consumers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1670\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my colleague \nfrom Vermont, Senator Leahy, the Satellite Television Modernization \nAct. I also note the efforts of Senators Sessions, Kohl, and Kyl in \ncrafting this bipartisan bill.\n  It is hard to believe that 5 years have transpired since we passed \nthe Satellite Home Viewer Extension Act, SHVERA, of 2004. Much has \noccurred since that time, including the transition from analog to \ndigital signals, which occurred in June. That is why the proposed \nlegislation will not only reauthorize the statutory license used by \nsatellite television providers, but will bring all of the statutory \nlicenses into the digital age so that consumers can receive a good \nquality digital signal. Additionally, S. 1670 expands access to low \npower stations by broadening the license for low power stations to \ncover the entire local market; permits satellite providers to carry a \nnoncommercial educational broadcast station if a station is part of a \nstate-wide network; improves the ability of both DirecTV and DISH \nNetwork to provide local signals to local markets; and addresses the \n``phantom signal'' issue, where currently cable providers may be \nrequired to pay royalty fees under section 111 based on subscribers who \ndo not receive the content for which the royalty is being paid.\n  I hasten to point out, however, that much more needs to be done to \nmove away from government regulation and toward a marketplace where \nsatellite providers and cable providers can compete based on market \nforces. This is not a new issue for this body. In fact, during the 2004 \nreauthorization of SHVERA, Congress required that the U.S. Copyright \nOffice prepare a report to make recommendations on the operations of, \nand revisions to, sections 111, 119, and 122 of the Copyright Act. The \nCopyright Office provided this report to Congress on June 30, 2008.\n  While I will not provide a line by line summary of the Report, I will \nunderscore some key findings that the Copyright Office, under the \nleadership of Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters, suggests that \nCongress consider\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\nwhen legislating in this area of the law. Specifically, the Copyright \nOffice found that ``below-market rates may have been justifiable when \ncable and satellite were nascent industries and needed a mechanism to \nallow them to serve their subscriber base with valuable distant \nsignals.'' The Report continues by stating that ``the current \nmultichannel video distribution marketplace is robust and has, for a \nlong time, overshadowed the broadcast industry.'' Moreover, the \nCopyright Office further argues that ``it is now time to phase out \nsection 111 and section 119 so that copyright owners can negotiate \nmarket rates for the carriage of programming.''\n  I agree with the Copyright Office that something needs to be done to \n``phase out'' these compulsory licenses. There is no longer any reason \nthat the cable and satellite industries need a government-sponsored \nsubsidy--paid for by program providers--for the right to retransmit \nbroadcast signals. I believe we can devise a way that would phase out \nthese compulsory licenses without disrupting the market. In fact, it is \nalready being done today, as cable and satellite services license \nprogramming for more than 550 non-broadcast networks directly in the \nmarketplace without a need for a compulsory license.\n  Some have suggested a market trigger mechanism that would create an \nopportunity for, but not require, copyright owners to license their \ncopyrighted programming on broadcast television in the same manner as \nthey do currently for cable channels like TBS, ESPN, Nickelodeon, \nDisney Channel, FX, and Bravo. Copyright owners would have a choice \nbetween continuing to operate under the compulsory license, or if they \nprefer, licensing cable and satellite retransmission of their works \ndirectly through the free market as is done every day for the hundreds \nof non-broadcast cable channels.\n  I hope that industry stakeholders will participate in creating a \npractical and reasonable approach to rectifying this important issue. \nAt a minimum, it is time to let program creators and distributors have \nthe option to determine the terms and conditions for their intellectual \nproperty rights. I am pleased that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman \nPat Leahy is committed to exploring viable options for a marketplace \nmodel, and I look forward to working with him and our colleagues on \nthis and other issues before final passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mrs. Shaheen):\n  S. 1672. A bill to reauthorize the National Oilheat Research Alliance \nAct of 2000; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with Senator Snowe \nand Senator Shaheen, the National Oilheat Research Alliance \nReauthorization Act of 2009. Since its establishment in 2001, the \nNational Oilheat Research Alliance, NORA, has been a helpful entity for \nconsumers of home heating fuel.\n  As part of the Energy Act of 2000, Congress authorized the heating \noil industry to conduct a referendum to create NORA and to permit a \nsmall fraction of the wholesale price of heating oil--2/10 of a cent \nper gallon--to be paid by oilheat wholesale distributors to fund \nindustry-led research and development, energy conservation, safety, \ntraining, and consumer education initiatives.\n  Since that time, R funded in part by NORA has been responsible for \ngains in efficiency as well as improvement in equipment that run on \nbiofuels. In my home state, the next generation of oilheat technicians \nis being taught using classes developed by NORA.\n  NORA's current authorization expires in February 2010. The bipartisan \nbill we are introducing today extends the authorization for another \nyear to allow NORA to continue operating. This extension will give \nCongress time to complete a longer-term reauthorization that will make \nimportant reforms to NORA.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage charitable contributions of real property for conservation \npurposes by Native Corporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague, \nSenator Murkowski, in introducing legislation that would give Alaska \nNative Corporation, ANC, parity for an important tax incentive \nencouraging the permanent protection of land through the charitable \ndonation of a conservation easement. I would also like to commend our \ncolleague Congressman Don Young, who today introduces a companion bill \nin the House of Representatives.\n  America's wildlife, waters, and land are an invaluable part of our \nNation's heritage. It is imperative to preserve these natural treasures \nfor future generations. Congress long ago concluded that it was good \npublic policy to encourage the charitable contribution of conservation \neasements to organizations dedicated to maintaining natural habitats or \nopen spaces help protect the nation's heritage. A conservation easement \ncreates a legally enforceable land preservation agreement between a \nwilling landowner and another organization. The purpose of a \nconservation easement is to protect permanently land from certain forms \nof development or use. The property that is the subject to the easement \nremains the private property of the landowner. The organization holding \nthe easement must monitor future uses of the land to ensure compliance \nwith the terms of the easement and to enforce the terms if a violation \noccurs.\n  In 2006, Congress enhanced the charitable tax deduction for \nconservation easements in order to encourage such gifts. With the 2006 \nlegislation, Congress temporarily increased the maximum deduction limit \nfor individuals donating qualified conservation easements from 30 \npercent to 50 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Congress \nalso created an exception for qualified farmers or ranchers, which are \nnon-publicly traded corporations or individuals whose gross income from \nthe trade or business of farming is greater than 50 percent of the \ntaxpayer's gross income. In the case of a qualified farmer or rancher, \nthe limitation increased from 30 percent to 100 percent. The 2008 Farm \nBill extended the temporary rules for two additional years to \ncharitable contributions made before December 31, 2009.\n  Unfortunately, the way the law was crafted has disadvantaged a number \nof important landowners in my home state. Alaska Native Corporations, \nANCs, own nearly 90 percent of the private land in Alaska, including \nsome of the most scenic and resource rich. However, although they are \nvery similar to the small communal family farms that are eligible, \nsubsistence-based Alaskan Native communities are ineligible for these \nimportant new tax incentives. For thousands of years, Alaska has been \nhome to Native communities, whose rich heritages, languages, and \ntraditions have thrived in the region's unique landscape. Members of \nAlaska Native communities continue to have a deeply symbiotic \nrelationship with the land even today. Much like their ancestors, many \nNative Alaskan communities engage in\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\ntraditional subsistence activities, with nearly 70 percent of their \nfood coming from the land or adjacent waters. For many communities, \nsubsistence is an economic necessity considering both the lack of \neconomic development and the cost and difficulty involved in purchasing \nfood. For example, in Kotzebue, a community in Northwestern Alaska, \nmilk costs nearly $10 per gallon. In Buckland, a village home to \napproximately 400 people, a pound of hamburger, when it is actually \navailable, costs $14.00.\n  In Alaska, the Native Corporations have an important role to be \nstewards of the land. Their shareholders see themselves as the \ncaretakers of the land and water as their ancestors have for thousands \nof years. Nonetheless, in Alaska today this means they have to balance \nthe need for resource development and the need to cultivate the land \nfor subsistence activities. The traditional lifestyles of Native \nAlaskans are under increasing stress from outside influences. \nPopulation growth and the pressure to pursue cash-generating activities \nhave increased the desire for substantial development, significantly \nadding to the ecological stress on already fragile ecosystems. Without \npermanent protection, their lands could be developed in a manner that \nwould destroy its ability to support the traditional ways and \nsubsistence lifestyles crucial to Alaskan Native communities. Making \nuse of tax incentives available to other Americans will make it easier \nfor Native communities to make the right decisions for their \nshareholders.\n  Today, Alaska Native communities are not eligible for the 50 percent \ndeduction available to individuals because they are federally chartered \nas C corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of \n1971, ANCSA. This leaves Alaska Natives without the ability to convert \nto an eligible entity as other landowners can. In addition, most Alaska \nNative Corporations do not have sufficient gross income from the trade \nor business of what is considered traditional farming to be eligible \nfor the 100 percent deduction available to qualified farmers or \nranchers. This is in spite of the fact that as a group the Alaska \nNative shareholders of Alaska Native Corporations receive far more in \nsubsistence benefits than they receive in income from the Alaska Native \nCorporation. As a result, Alaska Native Corporations do not have the \nsame ability to offset the cost to permanently protect their \nproperties, which contain important wildlife, fish, and other habitats, \nthrough donations of qualified conservation easements.\n  The bill I am introducing with Senator Murkowski will allow Alaska \nNative Corporations to protect these important wildlife habitats, many \nused for subsistence, by providing an enhanced deduction for qualified \nconservation easements. The legislation modifies Section 170(b)(2) of \nthe Internal Revenue Code by creating a new subsection that provides \nAlaska Native Corporations with a deduction for donations of certain \nqualified conservation easements. In order to be eligible, a qualified \ncharitable conservation contribution must: (1) otherwise qualify under \nSection 170(h)(1); (2) be made by a Native Corporation; and (3) be land \nthat was conveyed by ANCSA. Under Section 170(b)(2)(iii)(I), ``Native \nCorporation'' is defined by ANCSA, section 3(m). Under Section \n170(b)(2)(i), the maximum deduction limit would be set at 100 percent \nof the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. If the taxpayer has deductions \nin excess of the applicable percentage-of-income limitation, Section \n170(b)(2)(ii) would allow the taxpayer to carry-forward the deduction \nfor up to 15 years.\n  Congress must act to assist Alaska Native communities in permanently \nprotecting their culturally, historically, and ecologically significant \nland, preserving the communities and their rich traditions in the \nprocess. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 1674. A bill to provide for an exclusion under the Supplemental \nSecurity Income program and the Medicaid program for compensation \nprovided to individuals who participate in clinical trials for rare \ndiseases or conditions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come here today to introduce the \nbipartisan Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act. I would like to \nbegin by thanking my friend Congressman Edward Markey for introducing \nthis legislation in the House. I also want to thank Senator Dodd, \nSenator Shelby and Senator Inhofe for cosponsoring this legislation. I \nwould also like to thank the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for bringing \nthis issue to my attention.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is important because it would \ngive people who are eligible for Social Security Income and Medicaid \nthe same access to clinical trials as those who are more financially \nfortunate. Currently, those with rare diseases, such as Cystic Fibrosis \nand Tuberous Sclerosis rely on clinical trials as their only hope. \nLittle is known about these diseases and a clinical trial may often be \nthe only way individuals can seek treatment for these rare diseases and \ncontribute to helping find a cure.\n  Currently, SSI and Medicaid eligible individuals who want to \nparticipate in a clinical trial have to worry about whether or not they \nwill see a loss or a reduction in their benefits for their \nparticipation in a clinical trial if the trial offers any sort of \nresearch compensation to participants as part of its approved Internal \nReview Board study design. This legislation would make it so benefits \nthat these individuals receive from clinical trials are not counted \nagainst those who are seeking SSI or Medicaid benefits or those who are \nalready eligible for these benefits.\n  A good example of why this legislation is needed is Sean from \nMaryland. Sean is a Medicaid beneficiary who voluntarily enrolled in a \nclinical trial. He was paid for his participation in the study and \nsubsequently lost his health benefits. Shortly after the study he \ncontracted pneumonia and was treated for the illness. After \nhospitalization he found out that the money he received would \ndisqualify him for Medicaid. Because he lost his health benefits he now \nowes $80,000 for the two weeks of treatment he received for pneumonia.\n  While I believe this bill fixes a fundamental problem that has \nprecluded hope for too many people who have a rare disease and receive \nSSI or Medicaid, I have heard some legitimate concerns that research \ncompensation may create the wrong kind of incentives for low-income \npeople. These are important concerns and when it comes to this issue I \nbelieve there do need to be important safeguards in place. That is why \nthis bill includes a GAO study to make sure that the program is working \nand that it is fair to those on SSI and Medicaid who are participating \nin clinical trials for rare diseases. The bill sunsets in 5 years so \nthat Congress can reexamine the issue after getting the GAO report on \nthe program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that adults on \nSSI and Medicaid can have the same access to clinical trials as those \nmore financially fortunate. I look forward to working with Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Grassley on passing this bill this year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday with my colleague, Senator Ron Wyden, to introduce the Improving \nAccess to Clinical Trials Act, I-ACT, a bill to allow patients with \nrare diseases to participate in clinical drug studies without losing \ntheir eligibility for public assistance like Supplemental Security \nIncome, SSI, and Medicaid. This bill provides potentially lifesaving \ntreatments through clinical trials for those suffering with rare \ndiseases, like cystic fibrosis, CF, a life-threatening genetic disease \nthat affects about 30,000 people nationwide. This hits especially close \nto home for me because I have a staff member, Sage Streck, with CF, and \nshe has participated in some of these trials that further drug research \nas they seek better treatments for rare diseases. About half of these \npatients are on Medicare or Medicaid and are eligible for SSI benefits.\n  Cystic fibrosis used to be primarily a childhood disease because \npeople simply didn't live long enough to reach adulthood. But now, \nthanks to the many treatments discovered through clinical trials, the \naverage life expectancy is 37 years old. Additionally, these advances \nin science allow CF patients to live more normal lives and not spend \nall their lives in hospitals or\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\nusing respiratory machines. The more CF patients can participate in \nclinical trials, the faster scientists can discover new treatments and \neventually a cure.\n  Sage has personally seen in her lifetime five drugs that started in \nclinical trials and are now available to CF patients. Each medication \nhas increased her quality of life and decreased the amount of time she \nhas spent in the hospital or on IV antibiotics. There are more than 30 \npromising drugs in the research pipeline right now that the CF \nFoundation is calling miracle drugs so it is imperative that patients \nhave access to clinical trials so these drugs can get on the market.\n  Under current law, the small compensation provided to trial \nparticipants, which averages around $500, is included as additional \nincome that could cause a person to lose their public assistance \nbenefits, like Supplemental Security Income, SSI, and Medicaid. These \nbenefits are crucial for patients living with rare diseases. For \ninstance, nearly 50 percent of the CF population uses SSI or Medicaid. \nAs a result, patients choose not to enroll in clinical trials that \ncould dramatically improve their lives out of the fear that they may \nlose the benefits on which they rely.\n  This bill allows patients with a rare disease to disregard up to \n$2,000 of compensation received for participation in a clinical trial \nin their SSI and Medicaid income calculations. Though it will have a \nnegligible impact on the Federal budget, it will make a dramatic \ndifference in the lives of those who will gain access to potentially \nlife-saving treatments by enrolling in clinical trials as well as all \nthose in the future whose lives will be improved by the medical \nadvances that arise from this research.\n  Please join me in supporting this legislation that will provide \npatients with rare disease access to potentially lifesaving clinical \ntrials without losing their public assistance health benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9380-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 266--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF JOHN SWEENEY TO \n                    THE UNITED STATES LABOR MOVEMENT\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. \nKlobuchar, Mr. Casey, Mr. Franken, Mr. Brown, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sanders, \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nBegich, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. \nShaheen, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Webb, and Mr. Tester) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 39\n\n       Whereas adequate and secure housing for people with human \n     immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n     (referred to in this resolution as ``HIV/AIDS'') is a \n     challenge with global dimensions, and adequate housing is one \n     of the greatest unmet needs of people in the United States \n     with HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas growing empirical evidence shows that the \n     socioeconomic status and structural factors such as access to \n     adequate housing are key determinants of health;\n       Whereas the link between poverty, disparities in the risk \n     of human immunodeficiency virus (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``HIV'') infection, and health outcomes is well \n     established, and new research demonstrates the direct \n     relationship between inadequate housing and greater risk of \n     HIV infection, poor health outcomes, and early death;\n       Whereas rates of HIV infection are 3 to 16 times higher \n     among people who are homeless or have an unstable housing \n     situation, 70 percent of all people living with HIV/AIDS \n     report an experience of homelessness or housing instability \n     during their lifetime, and the HIV/AIDS death rate is 7 to 9 \n     times higher for homeless adults than for the general \n     population;\n       Whereas poor living conditions, including overcrowding and \n     homelessness, undermine safety, privacy, and efforts to \n     promote self-respect, human dignity, and responsible sexual \n     behavior;\n       Whereas people who are homeless or have an unstable housing \n     situation are 2 to 6 times more likely to use hard drugs, \n     share needles, or exchange sex for money and housing than \n     similar persons with stable housing, because the lack of \n     stable housing directly impacts the ability of people living \n     in poverty to reduce HIV risk behaviors;\n       Whereas, in spite of the evidence indicating that adequate \n     housing has a direct positive effect on HIV prevention, \n     treatment, and health outcomes, the housing resources devoted \n     to the national response to HIV/AIDS have been inadequate, \n     and housing has been largely ignored in policy discussions at \n     the international level; and\n       Whereas, in 1990, Congress recognized the housing needs of \n     people with HIV/AIDS when it enacted the AIDS Housing \n     Opportunity Act (42 U.S.C. 12901 et seq.), commonly referred \n     to as the ``Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS \n     Program'' or ``HOPWA Program'', as part of the Cranston-\n     Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Public Law 101-\n     625), and the HOPWA program currently serves approximately \n     70,000 households: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) stable and affordable housing is an essential component \n     of an effective strategy for HIV prevention, treatment, and \n     care; and\n       (2) the United States should make a commitment to providing \n     adequate funding for the development of housing as a response \n     to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9381-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9381-S9382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2370.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Tourism, including conventions and meetings, is an \n     important part of the United States economy that generates \n     billions of dollars in tax revenues for many localities.\n       (2) Analysts estimate that approximately 90 percent of \n     employers in the travel industry are small businesses and \n     more than 12 percent of United States employees are employed \n     by the travel industry.\n       (3) Many local economies around the country have developed \n     into destinations for vacationers and conventioneers alike, \n     and those local economies depend on the travel industry to \n     support local employment, create new jobs, and generate tax \n     revenues for critical public services.\n       (4) These same destinations are home to large and small \n     businesses that have unique skills, amenities, and resources \n     for planning and facilitating meetings and conventions for \n     all purposes and, consequently, may deliver value and \n     convenience for individuals and organizations in need of a \n     location for an official event.\n       (5) Locating an official event in such a city frequently \n     may save taxpayer dollars, as compared to other locations.\n       (6) Agencies and departments of the United States have a \n     responsibility to find ways to maximize taxpayer dollars in \n     conducting official business, including planning and \n     conducting official meetings attended by Federal employees.\n       (7) In deciding where to locate an official government \n     meeting by applying this principle of maximizing taxpayer \n     dollars, government officials often will conclude that many \n     locations known as resort destinations also will provide the \n     best value and convenience for official meetings and \n     business.\n       (8) Resort and vacation destination cities tend to be \n     affected disproportionally during economic downturns and, \n     therefore, are especially vulnerable to discrimination by \n     meeting and convention planners, which could exacerbate \n     unemployment and related demands on United States taxpayers.\n       (b) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under this Act may be used by an agency or \n     department of the United States to establish or implement an \n     internal policy regarding travel, event, meeting, or \n     conference locations that discourages or prohibits the \n     selection of such a location because the location is \n     perceived to be a resort or vacation destination.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2400.

Res. 267\n\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic \n     cancers, and the reported mortality rate from ovarian cancer \n     is increasing;\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer \n     deaths among women in the United States;\n       Whereas the mortality rate for ovarian cancer has not \n     significantly decreased since the ``War on Cancer'' was \n     declared, nearly 40 years ago;\n       Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, and 90 \n     percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer do not have a \n     family history that puts them at higher risk;\n       Whereas the Pap test is sensitive and specific to the early \n     detection of cervical cancer, but not to ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas there is currently no reliable early detection test \n     for ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of \n     ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal \n     pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary \n     symptoms, and several other symptoms that are easily confused \n     with other diseases;\n       Whereas, due to the lack of a reliable early detection \n     test, 75 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected at \n     an advanced stage, making the overall 5-year survival rate \n     only 45 percent;\n       Whereas, if ovarian cancer is diagnosed and treated at an \n     early stage, before the cancer spreads outside of the ovary, \n     the survival rate is as high as 90 percent;\n       Whereas there are factors that are known to reduce the risk \n     for ovarian cancer and that play an important role in the \n     prevention of the disease;\n       Whereas awareness and early recognition of ovarian cancer \n     symptoms are the best way to save the lives of women;\n       Whereas, each year during the month of September, the \n     Ovarian Cancer National Alliance holds a number of events to \n     increase public awareness of ovarian cancer; and\n       Whereas the President has designated September 2009 as \n     ``National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/15/senate-section/article/S9389-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9389-S9390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN.
