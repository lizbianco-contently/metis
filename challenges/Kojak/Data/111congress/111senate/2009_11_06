The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S11240]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as we resume consideration of the MilCon/\nVA bill, I remind my colleagues how important this bill is to the \nhealth and well being of our Nation's veterans and military troops and \nfamilies.\n  Overall, the bill provides $134 billion for veterans health and \nbenefits and for urgent investments in military construction, including \nfamily housing, barracks and operational facilities.\n  Within that total, the bill before the Senate provides increased \nfunding for a number of smaller but important initiatives. Let me cite \njust a few examples.\n  For veterans, the bill provides $3.2 billion for health care and \nsupportive services for homeless veterans. Ending homelessness among \nveterans is one of Secretary Shinseki's top priorities, and I am \ncommitted to doing everything possible through the appropriations \nprocess to help him achieve that goal. To that end, I have an amendment \nto provide another $50 million to the VA to renovate empty buildings on \nVA medical campuses to provide housing and services to homeless vets.\n  For the military, the bill fully funds the expansion of the \nHomeowners Assistance Program to help military families who face steep \nlosses on home sales as a result of orders to new posts during the \ncurrent mortgage crisis. Military families cannot pick and choose when \nor where they move--they go where their orders send them when they are \ntold to move. The expansion of the Homeowners Assistance Program is \ndesigned to help military families who must move at a time when home \nvalues have plummeted to avoid foreclosure or financial ruin by \ncompensating them for losses on home sales.\n  And for the Nation's economic and environmental health, the bill \nprovides $225 million to promote energy conservation and investment in \nrenewable energy resources at U.S. military bases, nearly triple the \nbudget request. The Defense Department is the single largest consumer \nof energy in the Nation. This bill provides the funding to step up \nefforts to reduce energy consumption on military bases and to promote \nrenewable energy alternatives, ranging from installing energy efficient \nlight bulbs to powering an installation with geothermal energy.\n  These are just a few examples of the many important programs funded \nin this bill, and a few of the reasons why it is important that we act \nswiftly to pass the bill. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor if \nthey wish to speak or if they have amendments to offer, and to work \nwith the committee staff to clear amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2737 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  (Purpose: To make available from Medical Services, $150,000,000 for \n           homeless veterans comprehensive service programs)\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2737.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Udall], for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, and Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 2737 \n     to amendment No. 2730.\n       On page 52, after line 21, add the following:\n       Sec. 229.  Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this title under the heading ``medical \n     services'', $150,000,000 shall be available for the grant \n     program under section 2011 of title 38, United States Code, \n     and per diem payments under section 2012 of such title.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank \nSenator Johnson for all his hard work on this appropriations bill. The \nMilitary Construction, Veterans Affairs appropriations bill is one of \nthe most important bills we do in the Congress because, as he has said \nearlier, it supports our veterans, supports their health care, supports \nmilitary construction, and supports what they do in the communities \naround the country and across the world. In particular, it supports the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  After reviewing this piece of legislation, I commend Senator Johnson \non his excellent leadership. I also thank him for working with me on \nthis particular amendment. I also thank his excellent staff.\n  I rise to talk about America's forgotten heroes and to offer this \namendment to improve upon the excellent legislation before us today. \nImagine dedicating your life to serving your country. You give up time \nwith your family, you put your life on the line, you sacrifice \neverything for the freedom and security of your fellow Americans. Then, \nyou come home and you cannot hold down a job or you cannot adjust to \neveryday life because of the traumatic experience you have been \nthrough. Soon, you find yourself without four walls to call home.\n  Many of our veterans transition back into civilian life without \nproblems. For many others, it simply takes more time. But for some \nveterans, that transition is painfully difficult. Sometimes, it never \nhappens at all. Right now, more than 130,000 of our Nation's 24 million \nmilitary veterans--brave Americans who answered the call to serve--are \nhomeless on any given day. They are in their greatest hour of need, \nliving on the streets without support or any hope for a better \ntomorrow.\n  If every American living on the street is a tragedy, every veteran \nliving on the street is a crime. Our veterans deserve better than that \nfrom the Nation they served. At the bare minimum, this country has a \nresponsibility to provide its veterans with a place to lay their heads.\n  Sadly, when it comes to this basic duty, we have not lived up to our \nideals. Roughly, 200,000 American veterans experience homelessness at \nsome time during the year. Veterans are twice as likely as other \nAmericans to be homeless. This is a statistic that should outrage all \nof us.\n  President Obama has set a goal of eliminating the homelessness of \nveterans in 5 years. I commend him for that. I commend the subcommittee \nfor the legislation they have put together to provide funding for \nseveral VA homelessness programs--and I commend Senator Johnson for his \nleadership on this legislation--including $144 million for the Homeless \nGrant and Per Diem Program.\n  My amendment, however, increases the funding in the bill by a modest \n$6 million, bringing it to the program's full authorization \nlevel. Senators Bond and Bingaman are joining in this effort as \namendment cosponsors, and I thank them for their support.\n\n  This amendment will provide additional funds to construct, renovate, \nand acquire buildings to be used as service centers or transitional \nhousing for homeless veterans. These grants are critical to \norganizations working to provide shelter to our homeless veterans. In \nmy home State of New Mexico, six organizations in Albuquerque, Gallup, \nLas Cruces, and Las Vegas, have received these funds over the past 8 \nyears. They will tell you firsthand how critical this funding is to our \nveterans and to our country.\n  While I know this funding is not an end-all, be-all solution to \nveteran homelessness, it is a good start.\n  I received a letter from a 15-year-old Boy Scout from Albuquerque a \nbit ago. His father and grandfather are veterans, and he is planning to \nfollow in their footsteps and join the military himself when he is old \nenough. This young man wrote to say how angry he is that we are not \ndoing enough to help our homeless veterans. Here is what he said in his \nletter that he wrote me:\n\n       These men and women are doing what they were called to do \n     by our government . . . but then they come back and are \n     treated so poorly by everyone . . . We, as a nation, need to \n     do more to help our veterans.\n\n  As long as America faces threats and values freedom, we will need men \nand women to protect us. And as long as men and women serve in uniform, \nwe all have a sacred responsibility to support them.\n  To the smart young man who wrote me that letter and to all America's \nveterans, this bill and this amendment builds on efforts to meet our \ncountry's moral obligations to the men and women who so bravely served \nour country. I urge my colleagues to support passage of both.\n\n[[Page S11241]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this is an excellent amendment. I thank \nthe Senator for offering it. I will accept this amendment at the \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for \na comment, I, once again, thank Senator Johnson. I know when he looks \nat these veterans issues and deals with them, he has the utmost \nrespect. I believe he has a son who has served. He brings a compassion \nto these veterans issues that shows in this legislation we have on the \nfloor today.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will review the legislation and see that \nthe Senator from South Dakota put a lot of hard work in and his staff \nhas put a lot of hard work in. I once again appreciate him and his \nstaff for working with me on this amendment. I look forward to working \nwith him to see that it is accepted.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I submit pursuant to Senate rules a \nreport, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Disclosure of Congressionally Directed Spending Items\n\n       I certify that the information required by rule XLIV of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate related to congressionally \n     directed spending items has been identified in the committee \n     report which accompanies S. 1407 and that the required \n     information has been available on a publicly accessible \n     congressional website at least 48 hours before a vote on the \n     pending bill.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Too Big To Fail Legislation\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as a result of the greed, the \nrecklessness, and the illegal behavior of a handful of executives on \nWall Street, we are in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression. Millions of Americans from one end of this country to \nthe other have lost their jobs, they have lost their homes, they have \nlost their savings, they have lost their ability to send their kids to \ncollege, and they have lost their hope. In fact, just this morning, we \nhave learned that the official unemployment rate is now a staggering \n10.2 percent--the highest in over 26 years.\n  Since the recession began in December of 2007, 8.2 million Americans \nhave lost their jobs and the unemployment rate has more than doubled. \nIn total, today 15.7 million Americans are officially unemployed; \nanother 9.3 million are working part time--they want to work 40 hours a \nweek, but they are only working part time; and 2.2 million workers have \ngiven up looking for work altogether. When you add those three factors \ntogether--official unemployment, people who have given up looking for \nwork, and people working part time who want to work full time--what you \nare left with is an incredible 17.5 percent of the American workforce \nunemployed or underemployed--27 million Americans. And when we go out \nand we find that people are angry or hurt or depressed, that is one of \nthe reasons.\n  Over a year has gone by since Congress--against my vote--passed the \n$700 billion bailout for Wall Street. The Federal Reserve has committed \ntrillions of additional dollars in virtually zero-interest loans and \nother assistance to large financial institutions. Add it all together, \nand you are looking at the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of \nthe world.\n  Then-President Bush, Secretary of the Treasury Paulson, and Fed \nChairman Ben Bernanke told us at that time that we needed to bail out \nWall Street because we could not allow these huge financial \ninstitutions and insurance companies to fail because if they failed, \ntheir failure would be systemic and would impact every aspect of our \neconomy and would take down large segments not only of financial \nservices but the entire economy as well. We all remember: This is not a \nbailout of Wall Street, this is a bailout to help Main Street.\n  One might think, if these institutions were ``too big to fail,'' one \nkind of obvious solution--and you don't need a Ph.D. in economics to \nfigure this out--is that you might want to make them smaller. If they \nare too big to fail, maybe you would want to reduce their size. Yet, \nunder the leadership of the Bush administration and Fed Chairman Ben \nBernanke, these financial institutions did not get smaller, they got \nbigger.\n  Last year, Bank of America, the largest commercial bank in this \ncountry, which received a $45 billion taxpayer bailout, purchased \nCountrywide, the largest mortgage lender in this country, and Merrill \nLynch, the largest brokerage firm in this country. You don't become \nsmaller when you incorporate other large institutions into your \nexistence.\n  Last year, JPMorgan Chase, which received a $25 billion bailout from \nthe Treasury Department and a $29 billion bridge loan from the Fed, \nacquired Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, the largest savings and \nloan in the country.\n  Last year, the Treasury Department provided an $18 billion tax break \nto Wells Fargo to purchase Wachovia, allowing that bank to control 11 \npercent of all bank deposits in this country.\n  Today, these huge financial institutions have become so big that, \naccording to the Washington Post, the four largest banks in America--\nand I want people to hear this--Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan \nChase, and Citigroup, now issue one of every two mortgages. Got that? \nThe largest four financial institutions issue half of the mortgages in \nAmerica. They issue two out of three credit cards and hold $4 out of \nevery $10 in bank deposits in the entire country.\n  The face value of over-the-counter derivatives at commercial banks \nhas grown to $290 trillion, 95 percent of which are held at just five \nfinancial institutions in the entire country--JPMorgan Chase, Bank of \nAmerica, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. Derivatives are \nnothing more than side bets by Wall Street gamblers that oil prices \nwill go up or down or that the subprime mortgage market will continue \nto get worse or on the weather or whatever can make them a quick buck. \nRisky derivative schemes led to the $182 billion bailout of AIG, the \ncollapse of Lehman Brothers, the downfall of Bear Stearns, and \nprecipitated the largest bailout in the history of the world.\n  If any of these financial institutions were to get into major trouble \nagain--and, frankly, there is no reason to believe that will not happen \nbecause they are spending millions of dollars trying to influence \nCongress to prevent any action to stop them from going back to the way \nthey were before the collapse--we would be in line for a bailout that \nwould be even larger than the bailout that took place over a year ago. \nObviously, we cannot allow that to happen.\n  Not only are too-big-to-fail financial institutions bad for \ntaxpayers, the enormous concentration of ownership in the financial \nsector has led to higher bank fees, usurious interest rates on credit \ncards, and fewer choices for consumers.\n  Mr. President, I am sure you have gotten the same calls I have gotten \nfrom people who say: You know, I pay my credit card bills on time every \nsingle month, and suddenly they raise my interest rates to 29 percent, \nto 30 percent. And one of the reasons these guys can get away with \ndoing that is there is not a heck of a lot of competition out there. \nOne out of four American families, as a result of this greed, this \nusury, is now paying an interest rate of at least 20 percent on their \ncredit cards. That is another issue that, obviously, we have to deal \nwith.\n  According to BusinessWeek:\n\n       Bank of America sent letters notifying some responsible \n     cardholders that it would more than double their rates to as \n     high as 28 percent.\n\n  These are people who pay their bills on time.\n  According to a recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts, credit card \ninterest rates went up by an average of 20 percent in the first 6 \nmonths of this year, even as banks' cost of lending declined. In other \nwords, as banks get bigger, consumers are having to pay twice--once to \nbail out these institutions when they screw up altogether and a second \ntime to pay higher fees and interest rates.\n\n[[Page S11242]]\n\n  The time has come for us to do exactly what Teddy Roosevelt, a good \nRepublican, did in the early 1900s; the time is now to do what I think \nmost Americans understand we have to do; that is, break up these huge \nfinancial institutions.\n  Yesterday, I introduced S. 2746, the Too Big To Fail, Too Big To \nExist Act, which would do just that, and that is the bottom line. The \nbottom line here is that if a financial institution is too big to fail, \nthat financial institution is too big to exist, and we have to start \nbreaking them up.\n  This legislation is all of two pages. So when people ask you if you \nhave read it, unlike the 1,900-page health care legislation, you can \nsay with all confidence that you have read it, because it is all of two \npages. What it says is, first, that the Secretary of the Treasury has \nto identify every single financial institution and insurance company in \nthis country that is too big to fail within 90 days. In other words, \nwhat are the institutions that if they fail would cause widespread \neconomic harm to the country? The Secretary of the Treasury does that \nwithin 90 days. After 1 year, the Secretary of the Treasury would be \nrequired to break up these institutions so that their failure would not \nlead to the collapse of the U.S. or global economy.\n  There is growing support in our country and around the world for \nbreaking up too-big-to-fail financial institutions. Let me give you a \nfew important examples of that growing sentiment all over the world.\n  It was reported in the Washington Post and major media all over the \nworld that the British Government, in fact, is moving in that \ndirection. Let me quote from the Washington Post:\n\n       The British Government will break up parts of major \n     financial institutions bailed out by taxpayers. Spurred on by \n     European regulators, the British Government is forcing the \n     Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group and Northern \n     Rock to sell off parts of their operations. The Europeans are \n     calling for more and smaller banks to increase competition \n     and eliminate the threat posed by banks so large that they \n     must be rescued by taxpayers, no matter how they conducted \n     their business, in order to avoid damaging the global \n     financial system.\n\n  That is about it. Ain't more complicated than that. Let's break them \nup before they again lead this world to a major financial crisis. Let's \nbreak them up before they require hundreds and hundreds of billions of \ndollars in bailout. And in my view, it is a positive thing that the \nGovernment of the UK is moving in that direction.\n  But it is not just the Government of UK. On October 15, 2009, \nBloomberg News reported that former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan--perhaps more than any other individual, the person most \nresponsible for the deregulatory efforts which led us to where we are \ntoday--said this. This is what Greenspan said on October 15, 2009:\n\n       If they're too big to fail, they're too big. In 1911, we \n     broke up Standard Oil--so what happened? The individual parts \n     became more valuable than the whole.\n\n  Former Fed Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, the head of President \nObama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, said:\n\n       Keep banks small so that any failure won't have systematic \n     importance . . . People say I'm old-fashioned and banks can \n     no longer be separated from nonbank activity. That argument \n     brought us to where we are today.\n\n  That is former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.\n  Robert Reich, President Clinton's former Labor Secretary, said:\n\n       No important public interest is served by allowing giant \n     banks to grow too big to fail . . . Wall Street giants should \n     be split-up--and soon.\n\n  Sheila Bair, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \nhas said:\n\n       We need to reduce our reliance on large financial \n     institutions and put an end to the idea that certain banks \n     are too big to fail.\n\n  On and on, people all over our country, conservatives, progressives, \nare making that point.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. As Members of the Senate, Members of \nCongress, we are besieged every day by enormously powerful and wealthy \nspecial interests. The health insurance industry is spending over $1 \nmillion a day on lobbying, huge amounts of campaign contributions. The \ndrug companies, the military defense contractors, you name it, they are \nall outside the door, fighting to make sure that their special \ninterests are getting more and more. But at the top of that list of \npowerful special interests certainly are the large financial interests. \nOver a 10-year period they spent over $5 billion in lobbying and \ncampaign contributions in order to make sure that Congress deregulated \ntheir activities so they could merge, so they could engage in reckless \nfinancial speculation.\n  They won and the American people have lost, and the American people \nare paying that price today. The time is now for us to say enough is \nenough, for us to do what I think the vast majority of the American \npeople want us to do and that is, if an institution is too big to fail, \nit is too big to exist.\n  Let's start breaking them up for two basic reasons. No. 1, I don't \nwant to see a huge bailout having to take place again, hundreds and \nhundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money going to these guys. \nNo. 2, it is unhealthy for the economy when so few people have such a \nconcentration of ownership in terms of credit cards, in terms of \nmortgages, in terms of other financial transactions. The small business \ncommunity and middle business community desperately need credit and \nthey are not getting credit. You have people on there who are \ncontrolling a whole lot of our financial system.\n  Now is the time to do what Teddy Roosevelt did well over 100 years \nago, and that is to stand up to these guys. For the well-being of the \neconomy and for the American people, let's break them up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Rural Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to join with the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee to urge passage of S. 1963. This bill \ncontains the Rural Veterans Healthcare Improvement Act, a bipartisan \nmeasure that will make countless improvements in the VA for veterans in \nmost of the rural places in this country. This bill locks in the \nmileage reimbursement rate for disabled veterans who have to travel \nlong distances to get to a VA clinic. It also gives greater authority \nto develop new strategies to address the mental health needs of OIF and \nOEF veterans in highly rural areas where access to health care is an \nenormous challenge.\n  I am also pleased the bill authorized hiring of health care \ncoordinators at a local level, to prioritize the needs of our country's \n184,000 American Indian veterans. Most of these veterans are located in \nonly a few States. The bill gets folks who understand the unique needs \nof tribal veterans to the areas that need them the most. I am honored \nwe were able to get strong support across the veterans community for \nthis bill and I think it will help a lot of rural veterans if we get \nthis bill passed.\n  When someone puts their life on the line to defend this country, they \nhave earned health care, education benefits, and disability benefits if \nneeded. America's responsibility to honor the promise of our veterans \nshould not depend on whether the veteran lives in an urban area, but \ntoo often that is still the case. This bill helps to address some of \nthe inequalities facing rural veterans.\n  This bill was approved unanimously by the VA Committee just before \nMemorial Day. It is now almost Veterans Day. We can do better by folks \nwho served our country and settled down in rural America. Let's not \nstand in the way for better VA services for rural veterans.\n  I understand there has been a hold put on this bill. Our veterans are \ntoo important for politics. The fact of the matter is, our veterans are \nfolks who, as I said in my comments, have served this country so very \nwell. We need to\n\n[[Page S11243]]\n\nstep to the plate and serve them in the same way they served us--live \nup to our promises, live up to our obligations to the veterans of this \ncountry.\n  I encourage the Senate to pass this bill very soon. Hopefully, we can \nget it done before Veterans Day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know there are \nvery few Senators still here in the Capitol. Most people, as they \nshould, have gone home to meet with constituents, something I will do a \nlittle later this afternoon. I realize there may be very few staff \nmembers who may be listening. I realize the other body is in session \nand may possibly take up the health care bill that all of us have been \ntalking about for some time here on the floor.\n  I want to make a point I made a few days ago one more time. Early \nthis week I woke up early in the morning and was thinking about the \nhealth care legislation that is before this body--or will be before \nthis body very soon. It has been the focus of the country, if you will, \nover the last several months. I thought about the provisions that are \nthe base building blocks in this legislation. You have a piece of \nlegislation that is taking Medicare savings, $400 to $500 billion, and \nusing those ``savings'' to leverage a whole new entitlement, not using \nthose ``savings'' to take Medicare and make it more solvent or to deal \nwith the SGR issue so many physicians around this country are concerned \nabout.\n  I thought about the fact that not long ago, a couple of years ago--\nand probably, Mr. President, even when you were doing the same thing I \nwas doing and that is seeking this office--so many people were \nconcerned about the unfunded liabilities we had in Medicare and Social \nSecurity. There seemed to be a bipartisan move to want to solve that \nproblem for the long haul so we knew that those particular entities \nwould be dealt with in an appropriate way. Here we have a bill that is \ntaking $400 billion to $500 billion in savings, depending on which \ndraft, whether it is the House or the Senate, and instead of making \nMedicare more solvent--it has $38 trillion in unfunded liabilities--we \nin this body are using those savings to leverage a whole new program.\n\n  Second, we are using Medicaid and basically creating huge unfunded \nmandates for our States. I think all of us know that. In my own State \nwe have a Democratic Governor who wants to see health care reform \noccur, as I do, but he is very concerned, in a State that expects \nrevenues to be at 2008 levels in 2013, that all of a sudden he has this \nunfunded mandate.\n  Third, this bill, as we know, is going to raise insurance rates \nbecause of some of the provisions wherein insurance companies have to \ntake all comers but everyone doesn't have to bill health insurance. In \nmy own State, it is a 60-percent increase projected in 5 years by an \nindependent group. This is not something the insurance companies \ndirectly put together; an audit was put together to look at this.\n  If I had drafted this bill, Bob Corker from Tennessee, a Republican, \nif any of the people on this side of the aisle had drafted this bill, \nthere would not be one single Democratic vote for this bill if you look \nat those components which are the basic building blocks of this bill. \nThis week, as I have come up here to vote, I have talked to numbers of \nmy friends, like you, Mr. President. You are one of the specific ones. \nI don't want to throw you in this category, but you are my friend. I \nhave numbers of friends on the other side of the aisle where I seek to \nfind common ground and we cosponsor legislation together. You and I are \nworking on something right now.\n  As I rode the elevator up yesterday to the vote we had last night, I \ntalked to some numbers of my friends on the other side of the aisle, \nboth on the elevator, walking here, but on this floor.\n  And I said: You know, guys, if I had offered this bill, or any \nRepublican had offered this bill that we are getting ready to debate on \nthe Senate floor, there would not be a single Democratic vote for it.\n  That is not because of partisanship, by the way; it is because of \nwhat is in the bill itself. Almost to a person, there were a few who \nsaid they agreed.\n  They said: You are right. If Republicans offered a bill that is at \n$400 to $500 billion of Medicare savings and did not apply it to making \nMedicare more solvent but took that to leverage a whole new program, \nthere would not be a single Democratic vote for that bill.\n  So I understand. We had a President of our party during the first 2 \nyears I was here. I understand what happens when you are going to ``do \none for the Gipper,'' if you will. You are going to ``do one for the \nPresident'' who needs this. But this is a very important piece of \nlegislation. I do not understand--I really do not--on something that is \ngoing to be hard to undo, why so many of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are supporting a piece of legislation that if they \nwere left to their own accord and in a vacuum--did not have the \nPresident, did not have the majority leader, did not have the Speaker \nof the House pushing this legislation--if it was just presented to them \nif they were at a townhall meeting, they had never heard of this \nlegislation before, and somebody said: Would you support a bill that \ndoes this, I do not think there would be a person on the other side of \nthe aisle who would support this legislation.\n  So as we move into this weekend--and I know this body is not going to \ntake it up. I know the House is. I hope there are a few House Members \nlistening. I hope people will think about this and step back away from \nit.\n  I am one of those Republicans who wants to see responsible health \ncare reform. I want to see us lower the costs of this delivery system, \nwhich this bill candidly does not do. I want to see more Americans have \naccess--if not all--to affordable, quality health care.\n  This bill, we all know, takes us in a direction, there is no \nquestion, that is not the right direction. I hope that together we will \nfigure out a way to address health care reform in a way that will stand \nthe test of time.\n  This bill will not do that, and I know I have already talked to many \nof the people I mentioned yesterday who said: We realize we are going \nto create lots of problems. They are going to have to be dealt with \ndown the road, but we cannot vote against this piece of legislation \ntoday.\n  I hope the body will rise to the occasion. I hope the body will put \naside a piece of legislation that I do not think anybody feels great \nabout. I hope we will come together and do something that is in the \nbest interests of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       rural veterans health care\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to discuss \nan important veterans' bill. Before I do so, I wish to express my great \nsadness about the horrible tragedy yesterday at Fort Hood. My thoughts \nand prayers are with those wounded, the families of those killed, and \nto all the soldiers and civilians defending our great nation at Fort \nHood.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I take my \nresponsibility to the Nation's veterans very seriously. We are an \nactive committee and are working hard to make improvements in VA care \nand benefits.\n  I am delighted to note that the President signed the Veterans Health \nCare Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 into law last month. \nThis measure will provide timely and predictable funding for the \nveterans health care system. I am grateful to all who worked on this, \nincluding the committee's ranking member, and the Veterans Service \nOrganizations, that made this one of their priorities.\n  Despite this success, we, as a committee, have not been able to \nachieve action on S. 1963, the proposed Caregiver and Veterans Health \nServices Act of 2009. This vitally important veterans' health bill is \nbeing held up by a single Senator. Each day that this measure is \ndelayed, means that vital benefits for veterans are delayed.\n\n[[Page S11244]]\n\n  This is a bipartisan bill, the provisions of which were reported by \nthe committee as S. 801 and S. 252, with the full support of our \nranking member, Senator Burr.\n  This bill is supported by many veterans' organizations, including the \nAmerican Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Wounded Warrior \nProject.\n  Various other advocates support this bill, as well, including the \nNurses Organization of Veterans Affairs, the Brain Injury Association \nof America, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American \nAssociation of Colleges of Nursing, and many others.\n  By blocking S. 1963, this single senator is denying veterans many \nbenefits and services.\n  One of the key benefits is caregiver assistance for our most \nseriously wounded veterans.\n  The committee continues to hear about family members who quit their \njobs, go through their savings, and lose their health insurance, as \nthey stay home to care for their wounded family members.\n  For those family members who manage to keep their jobs, their \nemployers, including many small businesses already struggling in these \neconomic times, lose money from absenteeism and declining productivity.\n  The toll on the caregivers, who try to do it all, can be measured in \nhigher rates of depression, and poor health as they struggle to care \nfor these wounded warriors, an obligation that ultimately belongs to \nthe government.\n  This legislation fulfills VA's obligation to care for the nation's \nwounded veterans, by providing their caregivers with counseling, \nsupport, and a living stipend.\n  The measure also provides health care to the family caregivers of \ninjured veterans. These caregivers deserve our support and assistance.\n  As a representative of the Wounded Warrior project said in testimony \nbefore the committee, ``The time has surely come to create a robust, \nnationwide wounded warrior family caregiver program to address the \nurgent needs of these family members.'' S. 1963 creates such a program.\n  By blocking S. 1963, this Senator is also blocking benefits \nspecifically for women veterans. This bill, and Senator Murray has been \na leader on this, would do a number of things, such as increase funding \nfor mental health care for women who suffered military sexual trauma, \nand for medical services for newborn children.\n  With the help of Senator Tester, this bill also would improve access \nto care in rural areas. States which have an especially high number of \nveterans living in rural areas, such as Montana, Nevada, Wyoming, \nFlorida, Arizona, Arkansas, Virginia, Idaho, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, \nwould benefit greatly from these programs.\n  The bill also attacks another problem, that of homeless veterans.\n  On any given night we know that more than 130,000 veterans are \nhomeless.\n  We know that homelessness is often a consequence of multiple factors, \nincluding unstable family supports, job loss, and health problems.\n  S. 1963 would also create programs to help ease the burden of veteran \nhomelessness, including programs aimed at outreach so that veterans \nknow that they are eligble for benefits.\n  This lone Senator also is blocking provisions that would improve \nquality controls for VA health care, from the facility level to the \nnational level.\n  Two years ago, the VA hospital in Marion, IL, hadnine veterans die \nfollowing surgery.\n  The VA's inspector general found that the Marion VA's quality \ncontrols were not adequate to ensure that veterans received good \nquality care.\n  This month, the IG published another report on the Marion hospital, \nfinding that it still did not have adequate quality controls. It is \ntime for this body to act, so that no more veterans receive less than \nthe best care VA can provide.\n  Senator Durbin drafted provisions in this bill that will help improve \noverall quality management so as to help fix the problems at Marion and \nother facilities.\n  S. 1963 would provide uniform allowances for VA police officers. Many \norganizations have expressed support for these provisions, including \nthe Fraternal Order of Police.\n  VA police officers ensure the security of veterans and their families \nwhile they are visiting VA hospitals and clinics.\n  To refuse to provide for these officers because it is too expensive \nis not only penny-wise and pound-foolish, it cheapens the sacrifices of \nthese uniformed officers and the Nation's veterans who are protected by \nthem.\n  While I understand that the Senator who is refusing to agree to allow \nthis bill to go forward questions the cost of the underlying bill, I \nwould say that we cannot now turn our back on the obligation to care \nfor those who fought in those efforts.\n  When we, as a body, vote to send American troops to war, we are \npromising to care for them when they return.\n  I firmly believe the cost of veterans' benefits and services is a \ntrue cost of war and must be treated as such.\n  We are preparing to observe Veterans Day.\n  Let us remember that we owe our veterans our gratitude and \nappreciation year round, and not merely on the day set aside for the \ncommemoration of their service and sacrifice.\n  It would be truly disgraceful if veterans were made to feel forgotten \nexcept for this 1 day per year.\n  Indeed, our gratitude should be as steadfast as the great monuments \nthat Americans have built in commemoration of the very service and \nsacrifices our veterans made.\n  There should be no ambivalence in our attitude toward those who serve \nin the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  And this legislation should be immediately cleared by the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1963, the \nCaregiver and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009. I thank the \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Akaka, for his \nleadership on this bill and in committee.\n  S. 1963 is comprehensive legislation that addresses many of the needs \nof our veterans, our Nation's heroes. Provisions are included to \nimprove veterans health care, provide benefits for caregivers of \nwounded veterans, enhance outreach to homeless veterans, and expand \nhealth care for female veterans. The bill also provides for VA \npersonnel improvement and quality management. Rural veterans, such as \nthose in my State who face challenges accessing health care every day, \nwill benefit from this bill. It expands telemedicine programs and \nprovides the Department of Veterans Affairs authority to recruit and \nretain high-quality health professionals in rural communities. The bill \nalso improves mental health care. Eligibility to receive readjustment \ncounseling for Iraq and Afghanistan vets, including the National Guard \nand reservists, will increase.\n  So many issues facing our veterans today are addressed in S. 1963. \nPassage of this legislation and its enactment into law will improve and \nincrease services for veterans and acknowledge the sacrifice of their \ncaregivers.\n  Yet even as Veterans Day approaches, a Member of the Senate has \nplaced a hold on this bill, denying better services for our veterans. I \ncannot imagine why this hold has been placed on this legislation. How \ncan a Member of the Senate deny our veterans better care? How can my \nSenate colleague justify his hold on a bill that helps homeless and \nwounded veterans? How can my colleague deny veteran caregivers deserved \nrelief and support? There is no excuse for not supporting our veterans \nand their caregivers. They have earned better than what we have \nprovided to date. This bill gives us an opportunity to provide for \nveterans and to honor their sacrifices. This bill, on which my \ncolleague has placed a hold, will eliminate copayments for veterans who \nare catastrophically disabled and allow the VA to reimburse these \nveterans for emergency care at non-VA facilities. How can my colleague \ndeny disabled veterans easier and less costly medical care? Veterans \nhave paid their dues, and it is our turn, our duty, and our obligation \nto take care of them.\n  I am disappointed my Senate colleague does not share this same sense\n\n[[Page S11245]]\n\nof duty and responsibility to our Nation's heroes who have sacrificed \nso much for our very right to stand in this body and debate this \nmatter. There is no good reason or rationale for a hold to be placed on \nthis legislation.\n  I call on my colleague to remove this hold and ask my colleague to \nremember, as Veterans Day approaches, that those who have served this \ncountry deserve better. They have earned it. It is my obligation and \nhis obligation to support our veterans and to always remember the \nsacrifice they have made.\n  Senator Coburn, let the Senate proceed with recognizing and providing \nfor our Nation's veterans by removing your hold on S. 1963.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Akaka for his unwavering support and advocacy \nfor our veterans.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Tragedy at Fort Hood, Texas\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as so many of my \ncolleagues have, to reflect on the extraordinary tragedy that took \nplace at Fort Hood, TX, yesterday. It is almost inconceivable such an \nevent could take place.\n  As we sort through the motives and the rationale, which may take \nweeks, I think we, obviously, have to extend our deepest, sincerest \ncondolences to the families of these men and women. They were there \nbecause they wanted to serve their country. They were there because \nthey were willing to risk their lives in service to this Nation.\n  Tragically and inexplicably, it happened on a post in the United \nStates not in a faraway land. I think this is a moment where we all \nhave to stop, not only to extend our warmest condolences to the \nfamilies, but also to reflect on the service and sacrifice of all the \ntroops. Their continued willingness to serve and expose themselves to \nrisk, to leave their families behind--all of this creates the pressure, \nthe tension, the burden of soldiering in this moment in our history. We \nowe them more than we can repay them.\n  At this moment, I express my deepest condolences to the families and \nalso to those soldiers who came to the aid of their comrades, who \nexposed themselves in a dangerous manner to try to get people to \nsafety, to try to provide first aid to the wounded. They continue to be \nour heroes, and they always will be.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to speak on the military construction \nbill before us. I want to commend, obviously, my colleagues, Senator \nJohnson and Senator Hutchison, for their great work. I had the \nprivilege for a short time to serve as the acting chairman of the \nsubcommittee and worked very closely with both Senator Johnson, our \nchairman, and Senator Hutchison, the ranking member. They are both very \ncommitted and dedicated colleagues, and they have done a remarkable \njob.\n  This bill provides $134 billion for military construction, military \nfamily housing, and veterans affairs programs, an increase of \napproximately $429 million over the President's request.\n  This bill provides a total of $109 billion for the VA and increases \nfunding for medical care by $4.2 billion over last year's funding.\n  For the first time, the bill includes advance appropriations for the \nVA's medical programs to ensure a stable and uninterrupted funding \nstream.\n  This bill also provides funding to combat homelessness among \nveterans. This is a priority of both Secretary Gates and Secretary \nShinseki, and also Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. This bill includes $3.2 billion for health care, support \nservices, and housing assistance for homeless veterans.\n  I hope, again, the Senate will act before Veterans Day to pass this \nmeasure. I think it would be a fitting tribute to our veterans, whom we \nhonor in words, and I think we have the chance, early next week, to \nhonor them in deeds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my following remarks be \nprinted elsewhere in Morning Business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reed are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

METZ\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have been very fortunate in my life. One \nof the great opportunities I received from Senator John O. Pastore of \nRhode Island was the opportunity to attend West Point. At West Point, \nit was not just a great education, it was not just an opportunity to \nserve the Nation. The most important opportunity I had was to meet an \nextraordinary group of my colleagues and classmates who have served \nthis Nation with great distinction now for over 30 years.\n  Recently, some of my colleagues who have reached general officer \nranks have retired: GEN Bill Dailey, who was one of the chiefs of our \nspecial operations forces, someone whose heroism and courage would be \nwell renowned if it could be revealed, but because of his special \noperations missions, much of what he has done will be classified for \nmany years; GEN Mike Maples, who was the head of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency--two valued friends and classmates who have \nretired.\n  In a few days, another of my classmates will join that distinguished \nroster: LTG Tom Metz. Tom Metz is someone who personifies the values of \nduty, honor, and country, and who has spent his entire life in service \nto the Nation.\n  He joined the Army as an enlisted man in 1966. He went to the Army's \nWest Point preparatory school, and then he joined the class of 1971 in \nthe summer of 1967. Even then, back in the late 1960s, it was quite \nobvious that Tom Metz was going to be a leader in our Army, that he was \ngoing to command great responsibilities. It was a function of his skill \nbut, most importantly, it was a function of his character, his \ncommitment to those he led and to the Nation he chose to serve.\n  Tom Metz's career has been an extraordinary one. He started as a \nlieutenant in the 1st Battalion of the 509th Parachute Infantry \nRegiment in Germany in the 1970s. He rose through the ranks to hold \ncommand at every level: platoon, company, battalion.\n  He concluded his command responsibilities in Iraq as the commander of \nMulti-National Corps-Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. There he led \nour forces from January 2004 to February 2005.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the aftermath of \nthe elections debacle in Afghanistan.\n  President Hamid Karzai's first term was characterized by a cloud of \ncorruption and mismanagement. In his speech on Tuesday, President \nKarzai promised to battle corruption and to build a government that \nincludes elements of his political opposition. Our President, President \nObama, said that Mr. Karzai's performance should be measured not in \nwords but deeds. I believe this to be true, and I wish to offer some \nthoughts on how President Karzai can rebuild the confidence of the \nAfghan people as well as the international community.\n  I am afraid the time window for this new government will be very \nshort, so President Karzai needs to move quickly and with resolve. We \nmight ask, what are the markers by which we should measure the progress \nof this new Afghan Government? I believe there are at least five areas \nto review.\n  First: President Karzai intends to build a better legislative \nframework to combat corruption. This is good. But he has also said that \ncorruption cannot be solved by replacing high-ranking officials. I \ncould not disagree more with that assessment. With a host of government \nofficials accused of corruption, we will not see a significant break \nwith the past. A large part of battling corruption is removing the \nperception of corruption. Keeping these officials in place will only \nserve to fuel a commonly held perception that Mr. Karzai refuses to \nresolutely deal with this issue of corruption.\n  I echo President Obama's call for strengthening the country's \nanticorruption commission. The establishment of such a body is long \noverdue and could play a key role in rebuilding Afghanistan's trust in \nthe legitimacy of the Karzai government. The CIA should not--should \nnot--be cooperating with Wali Karzai. If we are serious about \ncorruption, we should also be judged by our deeds and not our words.\n  There are ministries in Afghanistan that are in need of serious \nreform. The Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, must confront \nthe corruption practiced by police officers on a daily basis. The \nAgriculture, Energy, and Private Development Ministries also require \nsubstantial reforms.\n  A second area to examine: President Karzai should move quickly to \npublicly distance himself from some of the more unsavory characters \nfrom his election campaign.\n  GEN Abdul Rashid Dostum, the Uzbek warlord, has been accused of \nterrible human rights violations for his role in detaining thousands of \nTaliban fighters who were suffocated in shipping containers. Mr. \nKarzai's Vice Presidential partner, Mr. Fahim, has been accused of drug \ntrafficking.\n  I fully acknowledge and I think everyone in this body fully \nacknowledges that President Karzai has a difficult job of balancing a \nwide variety of Afghan power centers and ethnic groups. We know that. \nBut building a foundation for his country on such dubious grounds not \nonly calls into question his judgment but seriously endangers the \nprospects for sustainable reform.\n  Third: Karzai should keep in place those who have competently \nfulfilled their responsibilities.\n  Most noteworthy, perhaps, is the Governor of Helmand Province, \nGovernor Mangal, who continues to struggle on the front lines against \nthe Taliban. I had the opportunity this past August to meet Governor \nMangal and to spend some time with him. He is very brave, and he is \nvery competent. I think President Karzai should understand that the \nAmerican people expect Governors to be strengthened and not undermined. \nMr. Karzai should empower provincial Governors and local leaders who \nhave proven their ability to lead. At the national level, the Health \nMinister has also done a commendable job, and the Education Ministry \nhas made some important strides.\n  We cannot tell Karzai whom to retain or dismiss in his new \ngovernment, but these personnel decisions send a very strong signal to \nthe Afghan people and the international community of where he intends \nto lead the country in the short term.\n  Fourth: President Karzai needs to take steps to improve the election \nprocess in Afghanistan.\n  Systemic and widespread fraud marred the 2009 election. President \nKarzai should call for an inquiry into the 2009 electoral process led \nby experts from Afghanistan and the international community. \nParliamentary elections are scheduled for next year. Without a serious \ninvestigation and an effort to address the shortcomings of the \nelectoral system, the elections in 2010 and in the future are at risk. \nWithout clean electoral processes in place, the Afghan people will \ncontinue to question the legitimacy of their elected leaders.\n  Fifth and finally: The viability and legitimacy of this new Karzai \ngovernment will be determined in large part by whom he decides to \nincorporate from the opposition.\n  While his main opponent, Abdullah, has said he will not join a unity \ngovernment, there are competent people from his team who can play a \nconstructive role in Afghanistan.\n  We want and need President Karzai as a reliable partner. I hope his \nreelection will provide the opportunity for a fresh start in \nAfghanistan, a start that is characterized by a commitment to good \ngovernance, political inclusion, and a realization that Afghanistan's \nfuture must be based upon the rule of law.\n  When I saw President Karzai in August just after the election, I \nimplored him to confront these pressing issues and explained that the \npatience of the American people was not infinite--in fact, it grows \nshorter by the day.\n  The next few weeks will be pivotal. President Karzai can do so much \nto rebuild the confidence of the international community and the Afghan \npeople in this short period of time. As President Obama determines our \ntroop commitment to the Afghan theater, it must be done with a \nconfidence in Afghanistan's decisionmakers--a confidence that \nfrequently does not often exist today.\n  President Karzai cannot let his golden hour pass. It is too important \nto the future of Afghanistan. It is too important to the Afghan people. \nFinally and most critically, it is too important for the American \nfamilies who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and have relatives \ncurrently serving in Afghanistan. The sacrifice made by U.S. troops and \ncivilians working to bring stability and a democratic future to the \ncountry cannot be overstated or undervalued. This should be the \nstarting point for any discussion with President Karzai.\n  I believe he has a solemn obligation to get this right, just as we \nhave an obligation here in the Congress to get our strategy in \nAfghanistan right. There won't be just one way to do that. We will get \nit right only by vigorous debate, only by an honest dialog of the \nchallenges we face.\n  But one of the most significant challenges, in addition to the \nobvious security challenge as well as the developmental challenges, is \nthis central concern we have about governance. Governance in \nAfghanistan starts with President Karzai. He has an opportunity to \ndemonstrate he is committed to these reforms on corruption, on the \nbetter delivery of services to his people, but he has not done very \nwell in a lot of those measures in the recent past. He has to prove \nhimself first and foremost to his own people that he is serious about \nthese reforms, but I think he also has an obligation to our government \nand to the international community to demonstrate that he wants to get \nthis right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before I begin my remarks for today, I \nwish to say a few words about the tragedy that occurred yesterday at \nFort Hood. I know I share the feelings of all Americans who were deeply \nsaddened by the events of yesterday, and our thoughts and prayers go \nout to the families of the young men and women who were lost and who \nwere injured in the tragic situation that occurred yesterday.\n  I also wish to take this opportunity to add words of appreciation to \nthe first responders and the medical professionals who helped these men \nand women who were injured yesterday. It is heroes helping heroes that \nreally shows America at its best. Our thoughts and prayers will be with \nall of these brave young men and women who were tragically slain \nyesterday, and their families.\n  Mr. President, the purpose for which I rise today is to talk about \nthe spending of this Congress, something I have been doing for the last \nfew weeks since I had the privilege to join this institution as the \nSenator from Florida. I have big concerns, and the more I have been \nhere and the more I have seen over the past few weeks has given me even \nmore concern.\n  Unlike American families and unlike the majority of American States, \nthis institution spends money it doesn't have. Each day, we go more \nthan $4 billion in debt as we pay for programs we don't have enough \nmoney for--$4 billion a day, the national debt grows. Additionally, we \nspend $253 billion a year on interest payments. It is the fourth \nlargest expenditure in the budget after defense, Social Security, and \nMedicare. So the fourth largest expenditure that we spend every year \ndoesn't go to a new program, it doesn't go to help a person; it goes to \npay for programs in the past that we couldn't afford. It took us until \n1982 to go $1 trillion in debt. Yet we are shortly coming upon nearly \n$12 trillion in debt. In a matter of days, we will hit that number. \nMore troubling still, this past year, 2009, this Congress, for its \nannual budget, grew a deficit of $1.4 trillion. That is as much deficit \nas was accrued in the past 4 years combined.\n  So I plan to come to this Chamber every week and talk about the \nspending problem this Congress has in order to highlight this issue. It \nis of grave concern to me, not just as a Senator who represents 18 \nmillion people in Florida but as a father of three children--Max, \nTaylor, and Chase, 6, 4, and 2--and a baby on the way. My wife and I \nare concerned, as every parent should be, about their future. It is our \nobligation as parents to make sure they have better opportunities than \nwe had. In fact, that is the American creed, that every generation \nensures that its children have equal or better opportunities than the \nopportunities they enjoy. But I am concerned for my children and for \nall the children in this country that at this present rate of spending, \nwe will not be able to ensure that they have those equal or better \nopportunities.\n  Congress is spending too much. Both sides of the aisle talk about \nfiscal restraint and fiscal discipline, and yet we keep spending more \nthan we have. This government took in $2.1 trillion in revenues this \nyear; yet we spent $3.5 trillion.\n  I am not used to this system because, as you know, I come from a \nState system, where I served as a chief of staff to a Governor. In \nFlorida, we have to balance our budget. Every year we looked at the \nreceipts. We anxiously looked, almost on a monthly basis, to see how \nmuch money was coming in to determine how much could be spent, or what \nkind of tax breaks could be given back to the people, or how much could \nbe put in the reserves. Those were the good times. As the economy \ndeclined, we watched the money and made decisions about how much we \nwere going to have to cut. At the end of the day, we had to balance the \nbudget.\n  Congress doesn't do that. Congress spends more than it takes in, and \nit puts those obligations on our children and grandchildren who some \nday will have to pay off this debt. But the time to make tough choices \nshould not be tomorrow; the time to make tough choices is today.\n  One of the first pieces of legislation I had an opportunity to \nconsider and to vote on was an appropriations bill for housing, urban \ndevelopment, and transportation--important issues for this country. In \nthe opportunity to consider that appropriations bill, this Congress \ncould have cut spending or increased the deficit. Well, it chose to \nincrease the deficit, and the increase was by more than 23 percent over \nlast year's budget, in a time when we are spending much more than we \nhave. In a time when we are about to have a $12 trillion national debt, \nwe decided to spend 23 percent more than we did last year. What did we \nspend the money on? Certainly, plenty of good things. Obviously, \ntransportation and housing are important. But we spent money on a lot \nof questionable things, too. We built transportation museums--monuments \nto roads we have not yet built. We put up congratulatory signs, saying \nthis is how we spent money on a road, and we funded airports with no \nplanes, as the number of Americans losing their jobs has now risen to a \n10.2-percent national unemployment level.\n  We are spending $700 million a day to pay the interest on the debt, \nand we are funding transportation museums. If we would have stayed at \nthe spending level from last year and cut out these extraneous \nprograms, congratulatory signs that tell us we built a road, \ntransportation museums, and other spending programs--which some \namendments sought to cut, but they did not pass--we would have saved \n$12.7 billion. In Washington, $12.7 billion doesn't sound like a lot of \nmoney. We talk about trillions of dollars here. But $12.7 billion could \nhave done a lot of good.\n  What could we have spent that money on? I think it is important to \nrealize that every time we spend a dollar, we are making a choice. It \nis a choice about how we are going to direct this country's future. We \ncan either return that dollar and not spend it, give it back to the \npeople who paid it, or we could not spend it and not increase our debt \nand put that on our children's backs, or we could have spent it on \nsomething different and maybe better.\n  Here is an example: One thing I applaud the administration for in \ntheir stimulus program is they have $8 billion set aside for high-speed \nrail. That is exactly the kind of thing this country should undertake. \nThe Federal Government should not do much, but they can do things that \ncommunities and States cannot often do for themselves. High-speed rail \nis such a national-sized project, in my opinion, that the role of the \nFederal Government is there. It makes sense in this difficult economic \ntime, because you will actually create thousands of jobs by building \nthe high-speed rail. Once it is built, you will have a long-term gain, \nbecause that high-speed rail will be there to promote infrastructure, \nto promote jobs, and to ease the burdens on our everyday lives. There \nis $8 billion in the Federal budget this year that States can apply for \nto build high-speed rail. My State has an application in, along with 40 \nother States. We are seeking $2.5 billion to connect Orlando to Tampa, \nwhich would be fantastic for our State. I hope our State gets those \ndollars. But there is only $8 billion to apply for, and there are 40 \nStates that want the money. Imagine if we would have taken the $12.7 \nbillion we wasted here and put it into that program; maybe more States \ncould have had high-speed rail.\n  Let me give another example. What can you do with $12.7 billion? With \n$12 billion, you could put 427,000 college students through a 4-year \ncollege. We have to realize every time we spend a dollar, it is a \nchoice. That dollar could have been spent better, or it could have been \nreturned to the people.\n  President Obama recommended in this appropriations bill that we cut \n$211 million out of it. I don't think that\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\nwas enough, but let's give credit where it is due. He suggested we cut \n$211 million. We didn't even do that. The Senate could only find $15 \nmillion to cut and the House only $20 million. Because of Congress's \nspending and the administration's lack of willingness to cut spending, \nPresident Obama has presided over more new domestic spending in his \nfirst 10 months in office than President Clinton did in 8 years.\n  One of the first bills I supported when I came here was the Budget \nEnforcement Legislative Tool Act of 2009. It is a long title. It is a \nproposal I think both Republicans and Democrats should be able to agree \nupon. The bill requires us in Congress to do an up-or-down vote on the \nPresident's recommendation on spending. In this case, we would have cut \nmore than $200 million if we would have adopted the President's \nrecommendation; not enough but better than what we did.\n  I believe it is time to stop talking about cutting spending and do \nsomething about it. I am going to come each week to the floor and talk \nabout the various appropriations bills we have gone over. I will keep a \nrunning tally, starting with the $12 billion we could have saved in \nthis appropriation. At the end of the day, hopefully, the comments I \nmake will encourage others in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives to take this spending situation seriously.\n  I guess all of us wish we were in the situation the Federal \nGovernment is in, where we could spend more than we have, in terms of \nincome, and never have to pay it back. But the truth is, the Federal \nGovernment isn't in that situation either. One day the chickens are \ngoing to come home to roost. One day we are going to be accountable for \nthe money we spend. One day it will impact our standing in the world. I \nbelieve that day is very soon. We already know that the banks of the \nworld--the central banks--are starting to shed dollars. They no longer \nwant to hold our currency because they are losing faith in the United \nStates of America as the leading world financial power. We already know \nwe are having to sell more and more debt to countries that don't even \nhave our interests--countries such as China--and we already know we are \nlosing our standing and our ability to move forward because the rest of \nthe world doesn't feel we financially manage our situation well.\n  While our economy is straining, while countries look at us as suspect \nfor our spending patterns, countries such as Brazil are on fire, \nAmerican dollars and investments go there, because people think there \nis a better opportunity to make money in those countries than in the \nUnited States.\n  I want a better future for our children. If we are going to have a \nbetter future for our children, we are going to have to restrain our \nspending and get serious about balancing the budget of the Federal \nGovernment, as the States do and as families do across America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last night this body voted by a margin of 55 \nto 45 against an amendment I cosponsored, which had been offered by \nSenator Graham, the purpose of which would be to prohibit the use of \nfunds from the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill to \ntransfer individuals from Guantanamo and conduct trials of the alleged \n9/11 perpetrators in the United States domestic court system.\n  The key argument in favor of tabling that amendment was that the \nPresident should be allowed discretion between using article III \nFederal courts and the military commissions that had been set up in \nGuantanamo.\n  First, I was clear to the President, and to others, that I recognize \nhis constitutional authority to use article III courts in that type of \nsituation. But, again, I want to express my deep concern that, as we \nproceed forward with examining the cases of those detainees who are at \nGuantanamo, this issue is actually going to get more complicated, and \nwe should hope that the discretion the President uses is very narrowly \napplied.\n  The amendment Senator Graham offered addresses only the six alleged \nperpetrators in the 9/11 situation. A number of my colleagues came up \nto me and said: If you have an individual who is conducting an act of \nterror on American soil, shouldn't the President be authorized the \ndiscretion to try them in a Federal court?\n  My personal view is, it is perhaps constitutionally permissible but \ninappropriate, in the same sense as on December 7, 1941, when Japanese \nbombers attacked Pearl Harbor. This was a foreign entity killing \nAmericans, including American civilians, on American soil. It was not \nconsidered appropriate at that time, say, if we had a prisoner of war, \nif we shot a pilot down, that we would have brought them into the \nAmerican court system and given them all due process rights, tried them \nfor homicides, et cetera. They were combatants. They committed an act \nof war, and they should have been--and they were in the past--treated \nin that way.\n  My belief is, even with the 9/11 perpetrators conducting such acts on \nour soil, there should be a different way, a more proper way to address \nthese situations that involve enemy combatants.\n  This issue is only going to get more complicated. We have a second \nincrement of people who are at Guantanamo who are foreign nationals, \nnot American citizens, who were apprehended on foreign soil--\nAfghanistan being a classic example--for acts of war that were \nconducted not in this country but, again, on foreign soil. They are in \nGuantanamo. One would question the logic of whether they should be \nbrought on American soil to be examined by an American court system and \nthen apprehended in American prisons. I strongly believe this is not \nthe appropriate way to deal with these individuals and particularly \nsince, with the national Defense authorization bill that was just \nsigned by the President, we have built in appropriate procedural \nprotections in the Military Commissions Act.\n  Then we have a third increment of people who are in Guantanamo who, \nwe are told, because of either tainted evidence or the lack of \nsufficient evidence, may never be tried at all, nor will they be \nreleased because they are considered to be threats to our future at a \ntime when we have ongoing, basically, combat relations against the \ninternational forces of terrorism, of which they are a part.\n  This third increment which, as I said, will probably never be tried, \nis also being considered relevant to move into the United States. Here \nis the question we are going to have to answer: If you bring these \npeople into the United States, our Constitution provides that \nindividuals tried in article III courts should have a right--or an \nindividual subject to article III courts should be tried in a speedy \nmanner. We all have a right to a speedy trial if you are in the United \nStates. We are not going to do that. So then the question is: What are \nwe going to do with them?\n  If you read the Supreme Court cases--and, again, as I said yesterday \nduring the debate, I read in detail the Hamdi case which deals in part \nwith this situation--if this individual is deemed an enemy combatant, \nthey can be held for the duration of what we call the hostilities, \nuntil hostilities cease. That is a huge conundrum in terms of dealing \nwith people who are not going to be charged, who are not American \ncitizens, who are apprehended for acts outside our country and yet are \ngoing to be put into our prison system potentially indefinitely. I \ndon't think it is going to reduce the situation we have had in \nGuantanamo in terms of the way a lot of people have viewed the \nprocesses that were in place there. I think it is only going to \ntransfer that concern into the United States because these people will \nbe detained in U.S. prisons, and I don't think that is going to be \nmitigated if these U.S. prisons happen to be military prisons.\n  I wished to come to the floor to express my concern that the \nPresident, who has been given the discretion through the vote yesterday \nwhich tabled the Graham amendment, should be using it very narrowly, \nshould not be in a rush to shut down the Guantanamo\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\nfacility in a manner that brings us the second and third increment of \nproblems.\n  I ask that the Members of this body join me in expressing their \nconcern about a proper way to address this very complicated situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Virginia yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I rise to address an issue I know this \nbody will be dealing with in much greater detail in the coming weeks \nand months; that is, financial reregulation.\n  On Monday, I am introducing legislation to establish a systemic risk \ncouncil. I have worked with Chairman Dodd on this issue and his staff, \nand I am very grateful that his discussion draft--although I have not \nseen the specific language--is expected to include a strong systemic \noversight council which I have been advocating.\n  I appreciate Chairman Dodd's leadership on this issue and look \nforward to working with him and the administration on making it a \nreality.\n  As I have articulated previously on the floor and in an opinion piece \npublished in the Washington Post, we need to establish a framework for \naddressing systemic risk in our financial system. Systemic risk is not \nthe only area we need to address but is an area where the current \nsystem has unequivocally failed.\n  Systemic risk is actually a number of risks united by the possibility \nthat, if left uncontrolled, they could have consequences for the entire \nmarkets or the entire economy. We saw examples of that a year ago.\n  Most often, systemic risk comes from the failure of an important \nfinancial institution. But because that is not the only source, we \nshould not expect to control systemic risks with a rigid, one-size-\nfits-all approach.\n  In order to do this, we need a body that can look across our \nfinancial system at all sources of risk, that can spot gaps or \nopportunities for firms to avoid regulation, and that will not be \nconsumed by other day-to-day responsibilities or protecting its own \nregulatory turf.\n  Some have proposed that the Federal Reserve serve as the systemic \nrisk regulator. But its monetary policy responsibilities present \npotential conflicts, and it has proven incapable of properly regulating \nlarge institutions.\n  The Federal Reserve claims to be the systemic risk regulator at the \nmoment, but it has obviously failed to take on that task, and we need \nto be careful in balancing its responsibilities and authorities in the \ncoming years.\n  That is why, if we want to ensure that monetary policy and systemic \nrisk are each managed in the best possible manner, we must recognize \nthat institutional structures and responsibilities do matter. Doubling \ndown on a structure of the past that has not performed well outside of \nits core function is not how we should confront the challenges of the \nfuture.\n  Our Founding Fathers opposed concentrations of power and favored a \nsystem of checks and balances. We have resisted creating an all-\npowerful central bank, and a council would allow for such a system of \nchecks and balances.\n  The Federal Reserve is, of course, not the only agency that has not \nperformed well in the crisis over the last year or so. The current \nsystem has failed to provide proper checks and balances and has \nreplaced healthy competition where efficient and innovative firms \nflourish with a system where a handful of firms are too large to fail, \ncan threaten the safety of the entire system, and enjoy an implicit--or \nmaybe even more explicit now--government guarantee that destroys any \nnotion of market competition.\n  This failure points to another task we must take on in financial \nregulatory modernization. We must end the notion of too big to fail. \nThat is why I believe we should establish a strong systemic risk \noversight council, and I will be introducing legislation, as I \nmentioned, to do that.\n  A systemic risk council is not a silver bullet but avoids the \npitfalls of entrusting systemic risk responsibility with one single \nagency that has other missions, and those other missions could serve as \na source of conflict of interest.\n  A council could see across the horizon and have all the information \nand expertise flow up into it. It addresses our stovepipe problems and \navoids the conflicts that come from also conducting monetary policy and \nhelps to stave off regulatory capture.\n  The systemic risk oversight council I propose would consist of the \nTreasury Secretary, of course, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve--\nthey would play a valuable role--and the heads of the major financial \nregulatory agencies, two independent members, including the chair of \nthe council.\n\n  This chair of the council would be independently appointed by the \nPresident. It would be charged with the responsibility for working to \nimprove our understanding and control of systemic risks. This builds on \nthe model of the President's working group on financial markets. An \nindependent chair, appointed by the President and approved by Congress \nand supported by a permanent staff, has proven to be relatively \neffective and ends up resembling the National Transportation Safety \nBoard or the National Security Council.\n  Critics of this approach have said you cannot convene a committee to \nput out a fire. But we do convene committees to prepare for and respond \nto large-scale crises time and again across our whole system. \nExperience has taught us boards and councils can work in a wide range \nof contexts, provided they have the right responsibilities, powers, and \nmembership. Even the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation are run by boards.\n  In addition, I believe we should leave the real emergency powers with \nthe regulators. The Federal Reserve should retain its 13(3) authority, \nthough it should be tightened up. Bank regulators should retain prompt \nand corrective action authority, and the FDIC should retain its \nresolution powers. As a matter of fact, Senator Corker and I have \nintroduced legislation already that expands the FDIC's resolution \npowers to include bank holding companies.\n  In a crisis, however, the council should coordinate all of these \nregulators and their actions, as police, fire, and emergency response \nall coordinate in local emergencies. But the systemic risk council \ncannot just be a debating society, and so it would have real resources \nand power.\n  First, in addition to gathering and analyzing data, the council could \nhelp to determine how to regulate new products and markets in order to \nminimize regulatory gaps. Those regulatory gaps often end up with \nregulatory arbitrage, as we have seen recently. It would first identify \ngaps in the system and then have the appropriate regulators work \ntogether to fill these gaps.\n  With these tools, we will eliminate the huge blind spots our \nregulators had last fall when new and unregulated markets tail-spun out \nof control. We will eliminate the ability of firms to avoid regulation \nor find the weakest regulator by ensuring consistent treatment of \nactivities across the financial markets.\n  Second, in order to address the too-big-to-fail issue, the council \nwill work to prevent firms from becoming too large to fail. It would do \nthis in three specific ways.\n  First, it would have the authority to identify large firms that could \npose systemic risk if they failed but did not currently have an end-to-\nend prudential regulator and would assign them a Federal regulator. \nThis could include hedge funds, insurance companies or other nonbank \nfinancial companies. Making sure those companies that have no \nregulatory oversight, if they fall into this category of too big to \nfail, have some kind of oversight is terribly important.\n  Second, the council would establish systemwide prudential standards \nfor large firms, including counterparty exposure limits, increased \ncapital requirements, reduced leverage and strengthened risk management \nrequirements, all to make sure that while we would not set arbitrary \ncaps\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\non size, we would make sure, as a firm gets too large or takes on too \nmuch excessive risk, that there are additional requirements, such as \nadditional capital and others I outlined.\n  Finally, it would work with the council to ensure that any firm could \nfail safely--we saw in the past that there was no plan on how we would \nunwind a Lehman or an AIG--by working with the financial regulators, \nthe day-to-day prudential regulators, to develop clear, written plans \nfor the unwinding or failure of a financial company. In a sense, we \nwould be asking some of these too-big-to-fail institutions to \npreapprove or put forward their own funeral plans or dissolution plans \nso we would know how we go through this process, should that \nunfortunate event take place. These plans would be made in advance of \ntrouble and could not rely on the type of government intervention we \nwere forced into last fall.\n  As I have said, the systemic risk council is not a silver bullet. \nMany systemic risks already lie squarely within the responsibility of \nour day-to-day financial regulators. We need to make sure our current \nregulators have clear missions, including managing risks within their \ninstitutions and regulated markets, and we must ensure these regulators \ndo their job.\n  But that is only half of the answer because other systemic risks lay \noutside of the day-to-day prudential regulators' job description, in \nbetween the cracks of our existing regulatory system. The Systemic Risk \nCouncil's responsibilities would be clear and focused. Systemic risk \nwould be its only job, and it would help fill in the cracks and prevent \nproblems from becoming unmanageably large or complex.\n  What I am proposing today boils down to a simple, consistent, and I \nbelieve common sense idea: If we want to do something constructive \nabout systemic risk, we should create a mechanism that can ensure our \nregulators do their jobs, avoid conflicts of interest, and fully \nleverage our existing regulatory resources to promote the proactive \nidentification and control of systemic risks. By having this council, \nmade up of the heads of the day-to-day prudential regulators--the Fed, \nthe Treasury, independent members, and this independent chair appointed \nby the President--I believe we create this mechanism.\n  We need to make sure we never again put the American taxpayer into \nthe kind of financial duress we had take place last year. I believe the \nSystemic Risk Council approach, working as one piece of an overall \nfinancial modernization and reregulation, will lead us in that \ndirection.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. I would yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to talk about jobs today, but the Senator piqued \nmy interest by talking about too big to fail. Some believe--and I am \none of those who believe--that too big to fail means you are too big. \nAs you know, in Great Britain this week they decided to begin taking \napart institutions that are too big to fail. And I know there are other \napproaches here in trying to deal with systemic risk and a variety of \napproaches to try to address the issue, but has the Senator had \nthoughts about whether too big to fail is just flatout too big?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am very familiar with what happened in the UK, with the \nsituation with the Bank of Scotland, which had received governmental \nassistance--somewhat similar to the banks that had received our TARP \nfinancing. They came in and said: We are going to start to break up \nthis institution. Former Fed Chair Paul Volcker has suggested that \ncertain banks should perhaps be prohibited from taking on excessive \nrisk activities, in a sense going back almost to a Glass-Steagall \napproach. Those are both areas that I believe warrant further \nconsideration.\n  Our approach here has been to say that while it is hard, in this \ninterconnected financial system we have where institutions crisscross \nall across the world, to put an arbitrary size cap on it, what we can \ndo, by putting this type of Systemic Risk Council in place, we can put \nbarriers and a price of getting too large by having added capital \nrequirements; by having this designation that you have to show us a \ndissolution plan and that the Systemic Risk Council would weigh in; by \nassuring that if you take on too much risk activities on your own \ntrading desk, there is a higher price to pay for that.\n  There are these other examples, as you mentioned, that we will be \ndebating through this whole process. I know the Senator has raised this \nissue at times on the floor as well, and I will solicit his advice and \ncomments. And perhaps we need to go even beyond that in looking at, as \nI think you appropriately pointed out, at the end of the day, does too \nbig to fail mean just too big? It is a hard place to draw a line. But I \nthank the Senator for his question, and I yield my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Virginia is very thoughtful on these \nissues. I know the workshops he has been putting on are very helpful. \nAs we try to work through these with respect to resolution and other \nauthorities, it is very important for us to try to use the best ideas \nthat exist in this Chamber to put together an approach that would \nprevent ever again what happened last year and the year before.\n  So I have some thoughts about the use of the Fed with respect to \nsystemic risk and other things, and I will speak about them later. But \nmy interest was piqued by the Senator's discussion on the floor because \nI think this is very important. If we don't find ways to put the \nfoundation back under this economic system of ours, people aren't going \nto have confidence going forward. Part of financial reform is to \nestablish that confidence, and I think the work the Senator from \nVirginia has been doing is extraordinary work.\n  My hope is that at the end stage we can probably come closer to the \nside of, if you are too big to fail, you are probably too big, because \ntoo big to fail is almost, by definition, no-fault capitalism. But \nbetween here and there, there are a lot of interesting and useful ideas \nthat are being developed, and the Senator from Virginia is in the \nmiddle of them, and I appreciate his work.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments, \nand I look forward to working with him. I think this is clearly an area \nwhere we will find common cause with our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. Never again should the American taxpayer have to pick up \nthe burden from institutions that have been financially irresponsible \nand then from those financial irresponsibilities that pose a systemic \nrisk where we the taxpayers are left basically holding the bag.\n  So I thank the Senator for his comments, and I look forward to \nworking with him on this very important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/06/senate-section/article/S11250-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11250-S11252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JOBS AND THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to comment this morning about \nthe information that was released this morning on unemployment. The \nunemployment level has now gone to 10.2 percent. That is an antiseptic \nnumber. It doesn't mean so much as a number, but it sure means a whole \nlot to the folks who have lost their jobs.\n  We are now at a point where we have had a massive number of job \nlosses since this economic decline began. This is the steepest economic \ndecline since the Great Depression.\n  In the same couple of weeks where we have learned that the economy \nhas once again begun to grow--that is good news--we also know that \npeople are still losing their jobs, and that is bad news. An economic \nrecovery that is a jobless recovery, in my judgment, is not a real \neconomic recovery.\n  We are working on a lot of things here in the Senate, all very \nimportant--health care, climate change--but in my judgment, the most \nimportant thing for this Congress and this government to do is to try \nto restart this economic engine in a way that creates real jobs, puts \nour economy back on track, produces real, significant jobs that pay \nwell, and that puts the American people to work in order to make a \nliving and to care for their families. When that happens, we will have \nachieved something significant.\n  Let me say quickly, as I have said before, this President has been in \noffice less than 10 months. He inherited an unbelievable economic \nmess--the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression. So I \nunderstand that. I\n\n[[Page S11251]]\n\nknow he understood this was not an optimal time, perhaps, to assume the \nreins, but he understands and we understand that we have to do \neverything we can to get this economy started once again.\n  To hear a report on a Friday that we are at 10.2 percent \nunemployment--that is tough news, and we have a lot to do here in the \nCongress and in our government to try to find a way to put this back on \ntrack. There is some evidence that maybe this is beginning, but, again, \na jobless economic recovery is not a real economic recovery. We need to \nfocus like a laser on the question of how do you create new jobs in \nthis country.\n  Clearly, small-to-medium-sized businesses are the job generators in \nthis country, and we need to find ways and we need to focus all our \nattention to finding ways to incentivize the creation of jobs once \nagain in the private sector. I think public policies that can \nincentivize the creation of those jobs is what is expected of us. There \nis a lot of urgency for a lot of things. In my judgment, the most \nsignificant urgent priority at the moment is the focus on jobs and \ngetting people back to work.\n  I am going to have a meeting next Tuesday morning with a good many of \nmy colleagues to talk about putting together the set of policies on an \nurgent basis that will try to push that result. We just cannot decide \nthat, well, this is the long tail of a serious long-term economic \ndownturn that has now reached bottom and is now coming back up with an \neconomic growth of, I believe 3.6 percent this quarter. We cannot \nbelieve that somehow that is going to do the job because growth without \njobs is not real economic recovery. So we have a lot of work to do.\n  While saying what I have just said, we also have two different \neconomies working in this country. A lot of folks lost their jobs last \nmonth, last year, and the last few years--somewhere over 7.6 million \nAmericans--and they had to tell their loved ones that they weren't \nemployed anymore, that their jobs were gone, not because they were bad \nworkers, not because they did a bad job, but because of cutbacks, \nbecause of this steep economic decline. And now we see day after day \nthat there is another economy working out there.\n  I just brought a few of these to the floor of the Senate to describe \nthe difficulty of people who are looking for work, who lost their jobs \nlast month. When they read these papers, it explains the difficulty \nthey see in this, and probably the anger--more likely the anger.\n  October 17: The headline from the New York Times reads ``Bailout \nHelps Fuel a New Era of Wall Street Wealth.'' Quoting from the article:\n\n       Titans like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are making \n     fortunes in hot areas like trading stocks and bonds, rather \n     than in the ho-hum business of lending people money. They are \n     also profiting by taking risks that weaker rivals are unable \n     or unwilling to shoulder--a benefit of less competition after \n     the failure of some investment firms last year.\n\n  October 26, Bloomberg. Quoting from this article:\n\n       Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. paid top \n     executives an average of $18.2 million each last year as the \n     banks accepted a total of $90 billion in taxpayer funds to \n     survive the financial crisis. Citigroup . . . paid $390 \n     million to 21 people, an average of $18.6 million each . . . \n     Bank of America paid $227.8 million to 13 executives, or \n     $17.5 million apiece.\n\n  Again, these payments in some cases are from companies that might not \nhave been around were it not for the Federal Government providing some \nfunds for them. These are payments and bonuses that are unbelievable. \nAnd we are told now that in the next 30 days or so Wall Street is going \nto pay itself somewhere around $140 billion in bonuses.\n  Let me just describe again what was done in the last year and a half \nfor some of the biggest financial firms in this country that steered \nthis country's economy into the ditch. So far, it has been between $12 \nbillion and $15--excuse me, trillion. It is hard to get the b's and t's \nstraight. Between $12 trillion and $15 trillion has been lent, spent, \ncommitted, pledged, subsidized, or guaranteed. Let me say that again. \nSomewhere between $12 trillion and $15 trillion of the taxpayers' \nmoney, through the Congress--mostly through the Federal Reserve Board \nand other devices--has been lent, spent, committed, pledged, \nsubsidized, or guaranteed. And because of that, presumably, some of \nthese firms that are now paying these bonuses are firms that would \notherwise not have been around. But for those taxpayer funds, they \nwouldn't have been around.\n  So what we are doing is picking up the paper every single day and \nseeing articles such as this: October 20, the New York Times, Bob \nHerbert writes:\n\n       The lead headline, in the upper right-hand corners, said: \n     ``U.S. Deficit Rises to $1.4 Trillion; Biggest Since '45.'' \n     The headline next to it said: ``Bailout Helps Revive Banks, \n     And Bonuses.''\n\n  And this is Allan Sloan, September 8:\n\n       A Year After Lehman, Wall Street's Acting Like Wall Street \n     Again. It's been 12 months since Lehman Brothers failed, \n     setting off a chain reaction that came horrifyingly close to \n     destroying the world's financial system. That anniversary \n     makes this a convenient time to take a deep breath, look back \n     . . . and see what we can learn from the past turbulent year \n     . . . What are the lessons? How has Wall Street changed since \n     Lehman went broke last September 15?\n\n  That is a year ago. The fact is, Wall Street is back doing the same \nthings they did prior to the collapse.\n  Here is another article:\n\n       What Red Ink? Wall Street Paid Hefty Bonuses. Despite \n     crippling losses, multibillion-dollar bailouts and the \n     passing of some of the most prominent names and businesses, \n     employees at financial companies in New York, the now \n     diminished world capital of capital, collected an estimated \n     $178.4 billion in bonuses for the year.\n\n  And they are speaking of the year 2008.\n  Continuing with this article:\n\n       That was the sixth-largest haul on record, according to a \n     report by the New York State comptroller.\n\n  Again, that was in the New York Times.\n  Here is one from the Washington Post dated July 30, 2009. The \nheadline read: ``Report Outlines Big Bonuses at Rescued Banks.'' \nQuoting from the article:\n\n       Two firms, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, suffered losses of \n     more than $27 billion each but paid out $5.3 billion and $3.6 \n     billion in bonuses, respectively, the report noted. At \n     Citigroup, 738 employees got bonuses of at least $1 million, \n     the report said, while 11 executives received a combined $77 \n     million in cash, deferred cash and stock awards.\n\n  The point is, we have a couple of different economies working here. \nWe have an economy in which we read of some companies making very large \nprofits and paying very large bonuses--and some of them, by the way, \nwouldn't exist were it not for the American taxpayer backstopping the \nreckless behavior and the losses they incurred as they steered this \neconomy into the ditch; then, today, 10.2 percent unemployment at the \nsame time we see the economy, we are told, is growing at a 3.6-percent \nrate in the third quarter.\n  The point I want to make this morning is simple. The American people \nwill not stand long for two economies. The fact is, 10.2 percent \nunemployment is not acceptable, not acceptable to anybody. Those who \nare losing their jobs and losing hope and losing their homes, in some \ncases, should expect that the urgent priority, among all of us in \ngovernment, is to decide that jobs are No. 1. Restarting this economic \nengine, putting this economy back on track, and putting people back to \nwork has to be the urgent priority of this Congress. I hope the work I \nand others can do will make some small contribution to that in the \ncoming days.\n  I think the American people, if you look at the history of this \ncountry, have always been a resilient bunch. We have been through tough \ntimes and been through good times. But it is time now, as I said the \nother day, for us to stop thinking of ourselves as two different teams \nin places like the Senate. There ought to be only one team that works \ntogether to find ways to put people back to work in this country and \nget this country's economy started again.\n  If you take a look over the economic history of this country and see \nwhat made America great, it is lifting people out of poverty, putting \npeople to work, on payrolls, making a good wage to be able to take care \nof their families. That expansion of the middle class is what has made \nthis country great. It is not the capability of the people at the very \ntop to make even more and to pay even bigger bonuses, it is the \nexpansion of the middle class that has made this country a great \ncountry, and what we\n\n[[Page S11252]]\n\nhave seen now is a shrinking of the middle class. We have seen more \nunemployment in what used to be the middle class. Day after day, even \nas people are losing their jobs in this country, we still see companies \nshipping American jobs overseas and getting a tax break for doing it.\n  We have a lot of things on our plate to do to try to fix what is \nwrong. I am convinced we can. I have an effervescent spirit of hope \nthat we can do these things, but we have to start now. Of those this \nmorning who read in the paper that the unemployment rate is 10.2 \npercent, those who have lost their jobs fully understand what that \nnumber means. I hope all of us in this Chamber do as well. It requires \nfrom us an urgent priority to get to work and fix this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/06/senate-section/article/S11252-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL FAMILY CAREGIVERS MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of the \nSenate to National Family Caregivers Month, sponsored by the National \nFamily Caregivers Association. Every day more and more American \nfamilies are put in the tough situation of taking care of their elderly \nloved ones. Caregivers are our friends, family, and neighbors who have \nbecome an instrumental part of providing the necessary care that their \nfamilies need and deserve. Eighty percentof all homecare services today \nare provided by family caregivers, and I am proud to support them this \nmonth during National Caregivers Month. I have always been a strong \nsupporter of family caregivers and have worked hard to make sure they \nget the resources and funding that they deserve.\n  It has been my privilege to do all I can here on the federal level to \nhelp in this endeavor. Recently, the Washoe County Senior Services \nRespite Care Program needed resources to provide nonmedical respite \ncare for those suffering from dementia, Alzheimer's, and a host of \nother terrible diseases. I secured the necessary funding in the \nCommerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of \n2010. When this act passes, it will allot $95,000 to aid our seniors \nwho are afflicted. And I am pleased that I was able to get bipartisan \nsupport for the passage of the Lifespan Respite Care Act. This act \nauthorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award matching \ngrants to eligible state agencies that are in desperate need for \nfunding to help families.\n  As our fight for quality and affordable health care continues, I will \nmake sure that our family caregivers get the support and resources that \nthey need to continue this difficult task. We will do all we can during \nNational Family Caregivers Month to give these dedicated family members \nthe recognition they deserve.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ``An individual has not started \nliving until he can rise above the narrow confines of his \nindividualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.'' I \nfirmly believe that the National Family Caregivers Association \ncharacterizes this ideal. I wish this organization all the best as it \nworks to raise awareness during National Family Caregivers Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/06/senate-section/article/S11252-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:39 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1849.

A bill to amend the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of \n1965 to provide consistent and reliable authority for, and for the \nfunding of, the land and water conservation fund to maximize the \neffectiveness of the fund for future generations, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Land and \nWater Conservation Authorization and Funding Act of 2009. I am pleased \nthat Senator Baucus has joined me as an original cosponsor.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide consistent \nfunding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, LWCF, program at a \ntime when its purposes have never been more important to our \ncommunities and quality of life. This program provides funding for \nStates and Federal land management agencies for the purchase of land \nand interests in land from willing sellers. Since its inception in \n1964, LWCF has led to the protection of more than five million acres of \nland and water across the country, including such irreplaceable \nlandscapes as the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, the redwood \nforests in California, the Rocky Mountain Front in Montana, and Denali \nNational Park and Preserve in Alaska.\n  In my own State of New Mexico, LWCF funds have been used in many \nimportant landscapes including the Santa Fe National Forest to provide \nhundreds of miles of trails for hiking, horseback riding and off-road \nvehicle use, and to protect the unique Valles Caldera from development. \nGoing forward, the Bureau of Land Management hopes to protect portions \nof the Rio Grande National Wild and Scenic River in New Mexico using \nLWCF funds.\n  Equally important, this program's flexibility means that it also is \nused to protect what is sometimes most valuable to our communities--the \nlesser-known special places virtually in our own backyard. The \navailability of portions of this funding to States means that it can be \nused to protect local landscapes when development threatens the open \nspaces that communities need for clean water and recreation. It is also \navailable for the purchase of conservation easements when public \nownership of land is not the best solution. These easements--acquired \nat the request of the landowner--protect the landscape against \ndevelopment while retaining private ownership.\n  Since its inception in 1964, the law has provided that the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund will accumulate revenues from Federal outdoor \nrecreation user fees, the Federal motorboat fuel tax, surplus property \nsales, and from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf. It \nhas been authorized at $900 million a year since 1977. In establishing \nLWCF, Congress recognized the importance of the protection of lands \nwith significant natural, recreation and scenic attributes, and for the \ndevelopment of outdoor recreation lands and facilities at the State and \nlocal level.\n  Under current law these funds cannot be spent until they are further \nappropriated each year. Congress has rarely appropriated the $900 \nmillion annually that was authorized as necessary as far back as 1977. \nThe levels of funding for both Federal agencies and States have \nfluctuated wildly over the years. In addition, LWCF itself will expire \nin 2015 if not reauthorized.\n  However, the purpose of LWCF--the acquisition of land and interests \nin land--is one that requires consistency and predictability in order \nto be truly effective. The opportunity for land purchase can emerge \nquickly and can be quickly lost. The cost often requires that deals be \nstructured over a period of time. The absence of a consistent amount of \nfunding annually makes it virtually impossible for Federal agencies or \nStates to plan effectively or to ensure that they can protect those \nareas most important to communities and to the nation as a whole and at \nthe lowest cost.\n  Protection of special places and landscapes for the common good has \nalways been a great American idea that we have exported to the rest of \nthe world. These lands are a wonderful gift that every taxpayer \nreceives at birth, and values very highly. Today, even more than when \nLWCF was enacted, there is increasing pressure on our natural \nlandscapes, both as a result of man-made development and changes in our \nclimate. It is more imperative than ever that we protect and restore \nour ecosystems so that they stay resilient. By protecting natural \nsystems, we are protecting human health and the economy by providing \nclean water, clean air, livable coastal areas and the quality of life \nthat is so important to all Americans.\n  The time has come to make sure that the Land and Water Conservation \nFund has consistent and predictable funding and that it continues \nbeyond 2015. This bill will not change the authorized amount or the \nwell-established purposes and parameters of the Fund. It simply \nprovides that the monies deposited in the Fund under current law will \nbe available without further appropriation at the authorized amount.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nfor one year the employer wage credit for employees who are active duty \nmembers of the uniformed services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small Business \nand Military Families Assistance Act which provides an extension of a \nprovision included in the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax, \nHEART, Act of 2008 which passed last Congress. Senator Lincoln is a \ncosponsor. The HEART Act has been referred to as the ``thank you bill'' \nand that is very appropriate. The purpose of the HEART Act was to \nprovide military families with well deserved tax relief. As we approach \nVeterans Day, I believe that it is appropriate to extend the tax credit \nfor small employers of reservists called to active duty.\n  The best definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those who \nserve our country. That means giving our troops the resources they need \nto keep them safe while they are protecting us. It means supporting our \ntroops at home as well as abroad.\n  Currently, there are over 120,000 military personnel serving in Iraq. \nThere are approximately 68,000 U.S. service members in Afghanistan. \nMany of these men and women are reservists and have been called to \nactive duty, frequently for multiple tours.\n  Most large businesses have the resources to provide supplemental \nincome to reservist employees called up. I applaud the businesses that \nhave been able to pay supplemental income to their reservists, but it \nis not easy for small businesses to do the same.\n  In January 2007, the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nheld a hearing on veterans' small business issues. A majority of our \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are Reserve and National \nGuard members--35 percent of whom are either self-employed or own or \nare employed by a small business.\n  We heard some disturbing statistics about the impact and unintended \nconsequences the call up of reservists is having on small businesses. \nAccording to a January 2007 survey conducted by Workforce Management, \n54 percent of the businesses surveyed responded that they would not \nhire a citizen soldier if they knew that they could be called up for an \nindeterminate amount of time. I am concerned that long call ups and \nredeployments have made it hard for small businesses to be supportive \nof civilian soldiers.\n  The HEART Act provides a tax credit to small businesses to assist \nwith the cost of paying the salary of their reservist employees when \nthey are called to active duty. This tax credit provides an incentive \nfor small employers to eliminate any pay gap between civilian and \nmilitary pay. The provision provides small businesses with less than 50 \nemployees with a tax credit of 20 percent of the differential pay. The \nmaximum credit is $4,000. The credit is for amounts paid for before \nJanuary 1, 2010. My legislation would extend this provision for an \nadditional year.\n  While our reservists are continuing to serve, we should continue to \nprovide assistance. Now is not the time to end this credit which helps \nsmall business do the right thing. During these difficult economic \ntimes, it is a struggle for small business to pay their employees who \nare a called up a wage differential.\n  Our service men and women need to know that we are honoring their \nservice. An extension of the small business credit will help our \nmilitary families with some of their financial burdens. It cannot repay \nthe sacrifices they have made for us, but it is a small way we can \nsupport our troops and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/06/senate-section/article/S11255-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 343--TO CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY PARTY'S MEMBERSHIP ON \n  CERTAIN COMMITTEES FOR THE ONE HUNDRED ELEVENTH CONGRESS, OR UNTIL \n                      THEIR SUCCESSORS ARE CHOSEN\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.
