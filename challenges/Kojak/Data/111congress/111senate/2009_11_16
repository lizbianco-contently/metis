Mr. President, I want to speak about the decision \nannounced last Friday by the Attorney General to bring Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed and other 9/11 coconspirators to the United States from \nGuantanamo Bay to stand trial in the Southern District of New York.\n  Of course, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is the self-described mastermind of \nthe 9/11 tragedy where 3,000 Americans\n\n[[Page S11360]]\n\nwere killed. This is a terrible--a terrible--decision by the Attorney \nGeneral and by the administration for any number of reasons, but I \nwould like to explain why I believe this decision should be \nreconsidered by the Attorney General and the President of the United \nStates--because of the risk at which it puts Americans and because this \nprovides Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a self-described superterrorist--this \ngives him everything he could have ever wanted, which is a platform to \nspew his hate-filled ideology and one in which he can recruit other \nlike-minded individuals all around the world who may be watching.\n  One of the things I am always amazed by in our great country is how \nshort our memory is. Of course, we are a nation at war after 9/11. But \nthis is a war unlike any other this Nation has ever fought. We are at \nwar with a murderous ideology, with ruthless killers who wear no \nuniforms and use civilians as human shields. Treating these war crimes \nlike ordinary criminal events and trying these killers in an article \nIII or a Federal court under the Constitution is simply reverting to a \npre-9/11 mentality.\n  What do I mean by that? Mr. President, you will recall that the 9/11 \nCommission investigated the causes of what happened on September 11, \n2001. One of the things they identified was the wall separating the \nsharing of intelligence which was shared among the intelligence \ncommunity, and what information was developed during a criminal \ninvestigation had to be kept separate from ordinary intelligence \ncollected by our military and our intelligence community. One of the \nthings the 9/11 Commission unanimously said was that we needed to tear \ndown that wall and share information, as we can consistent with the \nlaw, in order to protect the American people.\n  Simply put, the trial of the 9/11 coconspirators, not in a military \ncommission at Guantanamo Bay but in a Federal district court in \nManhattan, one of the most populous portions of our country, is simply \nforgetting the lessons we should have learned on 9/11, which the 9/11 \nCommission so eloquently laid out for us and demonstrated.\n  But let's focus on who Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is, lest we have \nforgotten. According to the 9/11 Commission Report:\n\n       KSM [Khalid Shaikh Mohammed] describes a grandiose original \n     plan: a total of ten aircraft to be hijacked, 9 of which \n     would crash into targets on both coasts.\n       They included those eventually hit on September 11 plus: \n     CIA and FBI headquarters, nuclear power plants, and the \n     tallest buildings in California and the State of Washington.\n\n  Further quoting the report:\n\n       KSM [Khalid Shaikh Mohammed] himself was to land the 10th \n     plane at a U.S. airport and--after killing all adult male \n     passengers on board and alerting the media--delivering a \n     speech excoriating U.S. support for Israel, the Philippines, \n     and repressive governments in the Arab world.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission report concluded:\n\n       This is theater, a spectacle of destruction with KSM \n     [Khalid Shaikh Mohammed] as the self-cast star--the \n     superterrorist.\n\n  This is whom the Attorney General announced we will be bringing from \nGuantanamo Bay to a court in Manhattan to try as a common criminal. But \nhe is anything but a common criminal. He is guilty of nothing less than \nwar crimes against innocent Americans. According to this decision, the \nAttorney General is going to be providing him the forum he can use in \norder to proclaim himself as the ``superterrorist'' and in order to \nattract like-minded ideologues to his sick and twisted ideas of jihad. \nA criminal trial only gives Khalid Shaikh Mohammed the platform he has \nsought for years: a platform to expound his hatred to his would-be \nfollowers around the world.\n  The second reason this is a bad idea is because our civilian courts \nand procedures are ill-suited for terrorism trials because we cannot \nput judges in charge of national security.\n  I have high regard for the men and women who serve on our judicial \nbenches around the country. I myself was a judge for 13 years in Texas. \nBut our experience with terrorist trials shows that civilian courts are \nan inappropriate forum for a trial of war crimes.\n  As a result of information--this is one example why--as a result of \ninformation disclosed during the trials related to the East Africa \nEmbassy bombings, Osama bin Laden became aware of cell phone \nintercepts, which prompted his organization to discontinue cell phone \nconversations. Because of the evidence disclosed in the trial, they \nsimply realized they were being eavesdropped on and quit using cell \nphones, denying us that intelligence.\n  During the trial of Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World \nTrade bombing, terrorists became aware of a communications link that \nprovided enormously valuable intelligence to U.S. officials. This link, \ntoo, was shut down after the disclosure in that trial.\n  Then there was the trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Blind Sheik. \nA secret list of unindicted coconspirators in the prosecution wound up \nin the hands of Osama bin Laden in Sudan.\n  During the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the 20th hijacker, \nprosecutors inadvertently leaked sensitive material to defense counsel. \nHere is what the judge had to say about that case, which she \ncharacterized as ``like a circus.'' She said:\n\n       [Lawyers] are talking about the contents of sealed hearings \n     [to the media], if I see any more [of] what I think are \n     inappropriate leaks, I'm going to ask the FBI to start an \n     investigation.\n\n  But that trial never even made it to a jury. Moussaoui's lawyers tied \nthe court up in knots so he could use the trial as a platform to air \nhis anti-American tirades. The only reason the trial ultimately ended \nwas because at the last minute Moussaoui decided to plead guilty. That \nplea relieved the government of the choice between allowing a fishing \nexpedition into its intelligence files or dismissing the charges \naltogether.\n  One thing we can see with great confidence is that the trial of \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed in a Federal district court in Manhattan will \nbecome the same kind of media circus times 10. It will give Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed a platform to inspire his fellow terrorists.\n\n  Prosecutors will be forced to reveal U.S. intelligence on Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed, the methods and sources for acquiring that \ninformation, and his relationships with fellow al-Qaida operatives \naround the world. That information will allow al-Qaida to develop more \neffective plots and to alert operatives whose cover is blown. This \ninformation will enable al-Qaida to detect our means of intelligence \ngathering and to push forward into areas we know nothing about.\n  Congress has made clear that U.S. civilian courts are not the \nappropriate venue to bring terrorists to justice. That is why we \npassed, in 2006, the Military Commissions Act. The military commissions \nwere specifically designed to prevent sensitive disclosures and to \nprotect classified information and sensitive sources and methods. Of \ncourse, we know from our work on these military commissions that they \nhave a long history in our Republic--dating back from the Revolutionary \nWar, to the Civil War, and to World War II--and they are an appropriate \nforum for Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and other terrorists.\n  As a matter of fact, the Attorney General made the baffling decision \nto try some of the worst of the worst--a superterrorist such as Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed--in a Federal district court in Manhattan and to leave \nother terrorists for trial in Guantanamo Bay before military \ncommissions. And I say, if Guantanamo Bay and military commissions are \ngood enough for these other terrorists in the opinion of the Attorney \nGeneral, they ought to be good enough for terrorists such as Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed and his fellow 9/11 coconspirators.\n  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and other terrorists, simply put, should not \nbe brought to the United States. They should not be granted the same \nrights and privileges as American criminal defendants. They should stay \nat Guantanamo Bay and be prosecuted through the military commissions \nestablished by Congress under the terms circumscribed by the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  I ask my colleagues to remember that on July 19, 2007, we had a vote \non this sense-of-the-Senate resolution: It is the sense of the Senate \nthat detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, including senior members \nof al-Qaida, should not be released into American society, nor should \nthey be transferred\n\n[[Page S11361]]\n\nstateside into facilities in American communities and neighborhoods. \nThat sense-of-the-Senate resolution passed 94 to 3. Rarely do we see \nsuch unanimous, bipartisan opposition for the very acts the Attorney \nGeneral announced last Friday, and it is with good reasons, some of \nwhich I have had the opportunity to discuss today. But there are other \nreasons that I will look for opportunities to come back and talk about \nto my colleagues.\n  I would ask the President of the United States to overrule the \ndecision of his Attorney General because it is ill-advised. It will \nmake America a more dangerous place, and it will allow terrorists such \nas Khalid Shaikh Mohammed--it will provide them the platform to spew \ntheir hateful ideology and encourage others to join them in killing \ninnocent Americans and other individuals.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Military Construction and Department of Veterans \nAffairs appropriations bill. This critical legislation will provide \nfull funding for veterans health care and other essential VA services.\n  Last week, Mr. President, as I am sure you and many of my colleagues \ndid, I had the opportunity to meet with veterans around my State, \nreally for 2 days, and I came back to Washington with a renewed \ncommitment to provide our Nation's veterans with full support and the \nbenefits they so clearly deserve.\n  Passing this VA appropriations bill is an important step toward \nfulfilling the promise we make to our veterans when they enlist: that \nwe will take care of them when they return home. I figure, when they \nsigned up for war there was no waiting line, so when they come home to \nthe United States of America and they need a job or they need health \ncare or they need any type of help from this government, there should \nnot be a waiting line.\n  But funding the VA's health care system--as we are doing this week--\nand other existing veterans programs is only part of fulfilling that \npromise. Another critical component of fulfilling that promise is \nhelping our newest generation of veterans make the difficult transition \nfrom military to civilian life--and what a difficult transition it is. \nNew figures have recently come out that show that for post-9/11 \nveterans, their unemployment in October was 11.6 percent--significantly \nabove the national average. But, like many of the national unemployment \nrate statistics, this statistic conceals the true scope of the problem. \nHere is the number to remember: 18. Eighteen percent of veterans who \nleft the military in the past 1 to 3 years are unemployed, according to \na 2008 Department of Veterans Affairs employment survey. Of those \nveterans who have found work, 25 percent earn less than $21,800 per \nyear and only 58 percent of veterans who are employed have been able to \nfind work in the private sector.\n  These are the people whom I saw when I was at home. One of the things \nthat came to my attention was that a number of them would choose, if \nthey could, to pursue apprenticeships. A lot of them want to go to \ncollege for 2-year or 4-year degrees. We have large numbers of \nreturning soldiers in college in Minnesota. One of the things I found \nfrom visiting some of our technical colleges is that a number of them \nwould like to choose to pursue a different way to find a job.\n\n  A recent VA survey of private sector employers found there is a \nperception that servicemembers do not perform duties within tightly \ndefined skill sets. The study concluded there should be a greater \nemphasis placed on business and professional training of veterans \ncoupled with increased efforts to match their skills with available \njobs. That is why I introduced bipartisan legislation last week, joined \nby Senator Johanns of Nebraska and Senator Murray of Washington, to \nhelp Iraq and Afghanistan veterans obtain the training and experience \nnecessary for full-time employment by allowing them to use their post-\n9/11 GI bill benefits for job training and apprenticeship programs.\n  As my colleagues know, last year, under the leadership of Senator \nWebb, we passed into law the Post-9/11 Veterans' Educational Assistance \nAct, which will provide the men and women who served on active duty \nsince September 11, 2001, with comprehensive educational benefits \nsimilar to those World War II veterans received. While I believe there \nis no greater investment we can make in the future of our veterans than \ngranting them the chance to pursue the higher education of their \nchoosing, I also believe we must not limit veterans' opportunities to \nonly the pursuit of academic degrees. Not every returning soldier \nchooses to go to college, but they still want a job. Job training, from \npipefitting to law enforcement, should also be covered by the GI bill.\n  Our legislation, the Post-9/11 Veterans' Job Training Act, would \nallow veterans who wish to enter the workforce immediately rather than \npursuing an academic degree to use their post-9/11 GI bill benefits to \nobtain critical training and job skills.\n  Specifically, veterans enrolled in an on-the-job training or \napprenticeship program could use their benefits to pay for a percentage \nof their monthly housing costs, which would decline over a period of \nmonths; certification and testing fees; relocation and travel expenses; \nand tutoring costs. We put these things together based on our \ndiscussion with veterans across the country to see what their exact \nneeds were to make it easier for them to go through the pipefitting \napprenticeship programs and others that land them in the workforce more \nimmediately.\n  In order to qualify under this legislation, veterans must be enrolled \nin programs that have been approved by their State's accrediting \nagency. As under the old GI bill, veterans can also receive a salary \nfrom their employer during this training. This bill will restore the \nsame eligibility and benefits for job training and apprenticeship \nprograms that were available to veterans under the Montgomery GI bill, \nbut are no longer available under the post-9/11 GI bill.\n  I talked to Senator Webb and I know there were some reasons this got \nchanged. He is, in fact, supportive of including this, because we have \nseen this skyrocketing unemployment rate, in part because of the \neconomy, and we want to find every opportunity we can for our veterans \nto find work.\n  According to the VA, up to 10 percent of veterans use their \nMontgomery GI bill benefits for education other than college or \ngraduate school, including for on-the-job training and apprenticeship \nprograms. Through this legislation, post-9/11 veterans will be able to \nuse their expanded benefits for the very same purposes. In Minnesota \nalone, there are over 50 such programs currently providing training and \nemployment opportunities to veterans, including jobs in law \nenforcement, construction, engineering, and education.\n  I was at one of these institutions in Minneapolis this last week and \nmet with some of our veterans, some of whom have done multiple tours in \nIraq and one who was leaving in a few months, and they found it very \nhelpful to return to these apprenticeship programs--some of which \ninvolve incredibly complex subjects--offering them the opportunity to \nlearn those trades, and this will greatly help them so they can better \nafford these programs. By applying the new GI bill benefits they have \nearned toward these programs, veterans can acquire the skills and \nexperience they need for success in the civilian workforce.\n  Last week, President Obama signed an Executive order creating a \nCouncil on Veterans Employment and directing each Federal agency and \ndepartment to establish an office to focus on the hiring of veterans. \nLike the President, I am committed to ensuring that veterans have a \npath to stable employment when they leave the military.\n  One other piece of legislation I wish to mention, because I am \nhopeful it will be included in our health care reform, is the Veterans \nto Paramedics Transition Act which I introduced along with Senator \nEnzi. It helps returning veterans with medical training to pursue \nfurther education as paramedics. One of the things I found in our\n\n[[Page S11362]]\n\nState was that in rural areas of the country--rural areas of Minnesota, \nrural areas of Virginia, rural areas in Wyoming--there are not enough \nparamedics. Here we have these returning soldiers who are trained in \nthis area, but for them to have to move again and to go through an \nentire 2 years of training can be very difficult. The idea is not to \nsay no training is needed but to simply give them some credit; set up \nrules to make it easy for colleges to give them credit for that on-the-\njob training they had as paramedics in Iraq and Afghanistan. It \ninvolves two problems: the problem of returning veterans who don't have \njobs, and the problem of the lack of paramedics in the rural areas. So \nwe are very hopeful, with the help of Senator Enzi and Senator Harkin, \nthat we will be able to get this bill on the health care reform bill.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass not just the \nVeterans to Paramedics Act but also this bill we introduced last week \nto make it easier for veterans, when they come home--our soldiers--to \nchoose if they want to go to a pipefitting program or to go to a law \nenforcement program. For those veterans, there will probably be 10 \npercent of them who don't feel at that moment that they want to pursue \nan academic degree, but they need a job.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we come back from the Veterans Day \nrecess, the Senate resumes consideration of the MILCON-VA \nappropriations bill. As I have stated several times on the floor during \nthis debate, this is a vital piece of legislation that needs to be \npassed as quickly as possible.\n  As I speak, the VA is operating under a stopgap funding measure. \nFunding the VA in that manner is far from ideal and interrupts planning \nand hiring at VA hospitals. The bill before the Senate today protects \nagainst this sort of problem in the future by providing $48.2 billion \nin advance appropriations for VA medical care. This is something that \nis supported by both sides of the aisle. In fact, this bill is one of \nthe most bipartisan measures that we take up every year. That is why it \nmystifies me that we seem to be in a holding pattern.\n  One of the most critical parts of this bill is medical care for our \nNation's vets. The VA is expecting to treat almost 6.1 million patients \nin fiscal year 2010, an increase of 2.1 percent over last year. \nMoreover, the Department estimates it will see the number of Iraq and \nAfghanistan war vets rise to 419,000 this year, a 61-percent increase \nin patient load since 2008. With these facts in mind, the bill targets \nthe vast majority of discretionary funding for vets' medical care. The \nbill provides a total of $44.7 billion for medical care. Additionally, \nit provides $580 million for vital medical and prosthetic research. \nThis is one of the many reasons why we need to get this bill passed and \nsent to conference as soon as possible.\n  In addition, hundreds of urgent military construction projects are on \nhold awaiting passage of this bill.\n  Under a unanimous consent agreement entered into last Monday, there \nare 27 amendments in order to this bill and one motion. As I understand \nit, we will soon be voting on one of the amendments and the motion to \ncommit. Between now and the time of the vote, I wish to try to clear \nsome of the other amendments that are in order to the bill. I have read \nall these amendments, and the vast majority are not controversial. It \nseems to me we should be able to clear them. If there are objections to \nany of these amendments, I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and \nexpress what objections they may have.\n  Taking care of our vets and our military troops and their families is \none of the most important tasks of this body. Surely, we can all work \ntogether and pass this bill quickly.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2781 to Amendment No. 2779\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Durbin, I send a \nsecond-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S11363]]\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Guantanamo Prisoners\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I am here to speak about the recent \ndecision of the Obama administration to bring five terrorists allegedly \nresponsible and who admitted being responsible for planning and \nexecuting the 9/11 attacks and having them tried in a criminal court in \nNew York. This is the group of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four other \nalleged 9/11 plotters.\n  The reason I stand before you today is to ask you the question: Why? \nWhy are we bringing enemy combatants, terrorists, to trial in a civil \nvenue in New York? The decision of the Attorney General does not make \nsense to me. It is not sound in terms of our historical precedent for \nthese types of hearings, and it puts our national security at risk for \nthe future.\n  Criminal trials for terrorists are different and should be different \nthan criminal trials of those who commit crimes in this country. After \nall, we afford our citizens who commit crimes the presumption of \ninnocence. It is part of the bargain we have with our citizens, that we \nwill not presume them guilty. We afford them rights--rights that are \nset forth in our Bill of Rights, rights that are guaranteed \nconstitutionally. We do not guarantee these rights for people who are \nnot U.S. citizens. More importantly, we do not guarantee these rights \nfor terrorists who attack our country in an act of war.\n  Right now, we are fighting this war in two theaters--in Afghanistan \nand Iraq. These are enemy combatants. They are not U.S. citizens. They \nwere not resident in the United States when they committed this crime.\n  I wish to go through the rights we afford the criminally accused in a \nnormal prosecution in this country and show why they are not suited for \na terrorist.\n  We extend the right to remain silent; the right to have that silence \nnot used against you; the right to choose between a public trial before \na judge or jury; the right to summon and compel the attendance of \nwitnesses to testify on the accused's behalf; the right to a speedy \ntrial; the right to see all the evidence collected against the accused; \nthe right to learn how the evidence was collected; and the right to \nappeal not only the verdict but almost every ruling a judge performs in \nthe case.\n  Why are we extending these rights to enemy combatants who killed \nnearly 3,000 innocents on 9/11 through an act of war? They did not wear \na military uniform, and the planes they flew were not the planes of \nforeign countries with foreign flags. But there is no difference \nbetween the war we are in with them and wars we have had against other \ncountries.\n  The precedent of what may happen when we afford these rights to these \nterrorists is not good. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey talked \nabout what happened when we tried terrorists in U.S. criminal courts. \nDuring the trial of Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World \nTrade Center bombing, a part of testimony which we thought was \ninnocuous at the time that came out in the public courtroom talked \nabout the delivery of a cell phone battery. It tipped off the \nterrorists still at large that one of their communication links had \nbeen compromised. Mukasey said that link, which had been monitored by \nthe government and provided enormous, valuable intelligence, was \nimmediately shut down and lost in our war on terror.\n  Mukasey also noted that ``In the multidefendant terrorism prosecution \nof Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, [also known as ``the Blind Sheik'' for his \nrole in the 1993 World Trade Center bombings] . . . the government was \nrequired to disclose, as it is routinely in conspiracy cases,'' the \nnames of the unindicted coconspirators, one of whom was Osama bin \nLaden.\n  We are giving information in these public trials, which were never \nmeant for terrorism, which was never meant for people we are at war \nwith, that may be used against us in a future terrorist attack.\n  Why are we doing this? What is the purpose? We have military \ntribunals to perform this function. This is not something new to this \ncountry. We have been using military tribunals since the time of George \nWashington. He used it during the American Revolution to deal with \nBritish spies. None other than Franklin Delano Roosevelt used them in \nWorld War II. We had eight German agents who sneaked ashore with the \nintent to plant explosives at railroad facilities and bridges. \nRoosevelt used military tribunals to try and convict those Germans who \ncame across in World War II, and the Supreme Court upheld it. These \nmilitary tribunals are not something new. They have to be done right. \nThey have to give due process.\n  We used them against the driver of Osama bin Laden, and one of the \ncharges was dismissed against him. So they are a fair process.\n  Why are we bringing the 9/11 terrorists to a criminal court in New \nYork? These are not bank robbers. These are people with whom we are at \nwar. Why are we affording them extra rights? Why are we affording them \nextra rights when the information that is revealed during the discovery \nprocess in Federal court may compromise our national security and lead \nto additional terrorist attacks? Why are we doing this? It doesn't make \nany sense to me. It defies history, and it is going to present and \npossibly provide future challenges to our national security.\n  Finally, let's think about what these trials are going to be like. We \nare giving these terrorists an international reality show where they \nare going to be able to have a platform each and every day to talk \nabout their war against our country and our values. I wish to quote \nfrom David Brooks in his column in the Washington Post. He said:\n\n       Terrorism is an act of propaganda. So now [Khalid Sheik \n     Mohammed] gets to commit the original act of propaganda, \n     which was the attack, and now he's going to have a long \n     trial, an international reality show, which will be followed \n     here, but more importantly, followed around the world. So \n     he's getting a second bite of the apple at spreading his \n     propaganda message.\n\n  What happens if because of all of the rights that are afforded to a \nperson who is tried in a criminal court in the United States, what \nhappens if because one of those rights and all of the presumptions \nthere are against being found guilty, presumptions that we afford to \nour citizens because they are part of our constitutional democracy, \nwhat happens if Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, is \nacquitted on a technicality? Then what? What are we going to do with \nhim? Are we going to release him? Are we going to let him off on the \nstreets in New York? I don't think so. Then we are going to hold him \nagain. What does that say to the international community? He had a \ntrial, he was acquitted, but we are still going to hold him because we \nthink he is a threat. That is going to backfire on this administration.\n  In conclusion, I cannot understand why we are doing this. I cannot \nunderstand, when we have a historical precedent of a military tribunal \nthat we have used since the time of George Washington, that we used \nduring World War II, why we are going to bring these terrorists who \nkilled or were responsible for killing nearly 3,000 innocents on \nSeptember 11, why we are going to try them in Federal court as \ncriminals and not understand what they truly are, which are terrorists \nwith whom we are at war.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2746 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment so I can call up amendment No. 2746.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2746 to amendment No. 2730.\n\n\n[[Page S11364]]\n\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require reporting on alternatives to major construction \n     projects related to the security of strategic nuclear weapons \n                              facilities)\n\n       On page 27, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       Sec. 128. (a) During each of fiscal years 2010 through \n     2014, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report analyzing \n     alternative designs for any major construction projects \n     requested in that fiscal year related to the security of \n     strategic nuclear weapons facilities.\n       (b) The report shall examine, with regard to each \n     alternative--\n       (1) the costs, including full life cycle costs; and\n       (2) the benefits, including security enhancements.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment would enhance the security \nof our strategic nuclear weapons arsenal and help ensure that the \nDefense Department makes the best use of taxpayer dollars. I am pleased \nit has the support of the chairmen of both the Military Construction \nAppropriations subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee.\n  The amendment would require the department to submit an analysis of \nalternative designs for any major military construction projects to \nsecure our nuclear weapons that it plans to initiate. GAO recently \nfound that the Navy initiated two significant new projects without \nfully analyzing all of the alternatives. Therefore, we cannot be sure \nthat we have found the safest and most cost effective means of \nprotecting our nuclear weapons.\n  Ensuring the security of our nuclear materials and weapons is more \nimportant today that it has ever been. The Commission on the Strategic \nPosture of the United States recently concluded that the threat posed \nby the danger of terrorists accessing nuclear materials is greater than \nthe threat that a foreign government would choose to use such weapons \nagainst us. Unfortunately, in the face of this new threat, our \nstewardship of our own arsenal has grown lax in recent years. All of my \ncolleagues are aware of the serious breakdown in leadership which \nresulted in the unintentional shipment of nuclear-related \nintercontinental ballistic missile parts to Taiwan. They are likely \nalso aware that a B-52 bomber flew across the continental United States \nmistakenly loaded with five nuclear warheads. These incidents led to \nthe resignation of the Air Force Chief of Staff and Air Force \nSecretary. Just recently, a wing commander was relieved of command for \nsubstandard performance during several nuclear surety inspections at \nMinot Air Force Base. Clearly, this is an area that warrants sustained \ncongressional oversight.\n  I recently wrote to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Global \nStrategic Affairs, Dr. Michael Nacht, asking him to include in the \nNuclear Posture Review an analysis of the ideal means to secure our \ndomestic nuclear complex from a terrorist attack. Securing nuclear \nmaterials is not just about command and control--it is also about \nensuring the physical security needed to ward off an attack. In 2008, \nthe Department of Energy's Office of Independent Oversight conducted an \nevaluation, including a mock terrorist attack, of a U.S. lab that \nstores weapons-grade nuclear materials. The oversight office found that \nthe lab's security program had significant weaknesses. In light of \nthese numerous security incidents, Congress must step up its efforts to \nconduct oversight of our nuclear weapons complex.\n  This amendment is a small step in that direction. As the Defense \nDepartment completes the Nuclear Posture Review and stands up a new \ncommand in the Air Force to handle nuclear weapons, it is important \nthat we send a message that we want a careful analysis of the best \nmeans to secure our nuclear weapons.\n  The Defense Department spends roughly a billion dollars annually on \nnuclear weapons security, including about $50 million annually on \nmilitary construction. GAO recently found that ``the Navy plans to \nspend about $1.1 billion on security improvements to protect ballistic \nmissile submarines while in transit, but selected one alternative \nwithout considering the full life cycle costs of the available \nalternatives.'' In particular, the ``Navy did not consider the military \nconstruction costs of building new facilities to support the new \nsecurity measures. . . .'' In another case, the Navy interpreted DOD \nguidance as ``precluding the considerations of costs and benefits.'' \nThis amendment will ensure that this does not happen again.\n  GAO also found that DOD occasionally cited costs ``as a criterion for \ndeviations from security requirements.'' This amendment will ensure \nthat the Department conducts a full cost benefit analysis and provides \nit to Congress. That way we can ensure that DOD is not deviating from \nsecurity requirements unnecessarily for cost.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2748 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I could, I would like to move on, set \nthat amendment aside in favor of bringing up amendment No. 2748.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself and \n     Mr. Sanders, proposes an amendment numbered 2748 to amendment \n     No. 2730.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make available $5,000,000 for grants to community-based \n   organizations and State and local government entities to conduct \n              outreach to veterans in under-served areas)\n\n       On page 52, after line 21, add the following:\n       Sec. 229.  Of the amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this title, the Secretary shall award $5,000,000 \n     in competitively-awarded grants to community-based \n     organizations and State and local government entities with a \n     demonstrated record of serving veterans to conduct outreach \n     to ensure that veterans in under-served areas receive the \n     care and benefits for which they are eligible.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment would establish a pilot \nprogram to give grants to community-based organizations to conduct \noutreach for veterans. Many veterans are not aware of care and benefits \navailable to them through the VA or need help navigating the VA \nbureaucracy to access those benefits.\n  The VA has recognized the need to conduct additional outreach to \nveterans but does not have the presence in certain underserved \ncommunities, including rural areas, to do so directly. This amendment \nwould ensure the VA makes grants to organizations, including State and \nlocal governmental entities, that have a presence in the community and \nexperience working with veterans.\n  This amendment is based on my Veterans Outreach Improvement Act, \nwhich I first introduced over 5 years ago. That bill has been endorsed \nby the American Legion; Veterans of Foreign Wars; Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica; Vietnam Veterans of America; National Guard Association of the \nUnited States; Wounded Warrior Project; and the National Association of \nState Directors of Veterans Affairs. The companion bill has already \npassed the House.\n  The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee has endorsed the idea of a \npilot grant program and has authorized the program in the pending \nCaregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2009.\n  The amendment would set aside $5 million in funding for the grants. \nCBO has certified that the amendment has no score and is deficit-\nneutral.\n  The grants would be awarded on a competitive basis. A wide variety of \ngroups could apply for the grants. State departments of veterans \naffairs could apply for the grants. In Wisconsin, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs runs a ``supermarket'' of benefits where veterans can \ncome and learn about programs available to them through the VA. In the \nfirst several years of the program, over 10,000 Wisconsin veterans \nlearned about VA programs for which they were eligible. If that many \nveterans in Wisconsin alone were unaware of these programs, you can \nimagine the need for greater outreach nationwide.\n\n[[Page S11365]]\n\n  Other groups that may apply for grants include the county veteran \nservice officers who are present in counties throughout most States. \nThese individuals have a presence in many rural communities where the \nVA's presence is minimal. Rather than hiring contractors that know \nnothing about veterans issues to conduct outreach by phone to veterans, \nas the VA has done, this amendment would allow the VA to leverage \nexisting expertise in the community. Both State and local governmental \nentities are currently conducting outreach notwithstanding the fact \nthat this is a Federal responsibility. Given the current strain on \nState and local budgets, we cannot assume that they will continue to be \nable to offer these services.\n  Community-based nonprofits with experience working with veterans will \nalso be eligible for the grants. These organizations may have special \nskills for working with underserved veterans, such as expertise in \nassisting those with mental disabilities.\n  Given the high number of service members returning from Afghanistan \nand Iraq, it is essential that we conduct outreach to these veterans \nnow to ensure that they get the services they need from the VA. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Nomination of David F. Hamilton\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to share some thoughts about the \nHamilton nomination in particular and some thoughts about the idea that \njudges can be subject to a filibuster. It is a matter that has been the \nsubject of discussion in the Senate for a number of years. I wish to \nshare with my colleagues how it all came about, where I think we are \ntoday, and why Mr. Hamilton does not deserve to be confirmed as a \nFederal judge.\n  I recognize he has many qualities, and I am not saying anything about \nhim personally. But his approach to the law is unacceptable and is \nactivist and evidences a philosophy that indicates he would not be \nserving under the law and under the Constitution but, as he has said, a \njudge is free to write footnotes to the Constitution. I don't think \njudges are empowered to write footnotes to the Constitution. According \nto their oath, judges serve under the Constitution. They don't get to \namend it or footnote it, and they are not above it.\n  Back when President Clinton was in office, he nominated a number of \njudges who were activist. I voted for over 90 percent of his nominees. \nBut I believed a number were activists, and I opposed them. There was \nmuch discussion about it. Nominees such as Marsha Berzon and Richard \nPaez I believed, were not going to be faithful to the law if confirmed. \nMy instincts in that regard have been proven correct. This was in the \n1990s.\n  Regardless, I remember then-majority leader Trent Lott, a Republican, \nmoved for cloture on Berzon and Paez. We had votes. I and an \noverwhelming number of Republicans voted for cloture; that is, voted to \nbring up the nominees for a vote. Then a number of us voted against \nthem. We didn't think they should be confirmed. But we didn't adhere to \nthe view that filibustering was appropriate. That is when President \nClinton, a Democrat, was in the White House.\n  Then, my Democratic colleagues in the Senate opposed filibusters and \nmade all kinds of speeches against filibusters and against delaying \nvotes.\n  Then President Bush, a Republican, got elected. In January, before he \nactually took office or about the time he took office, my Democratic \ncolleagues had a retreat. At the retreat they met with legal scholars: \nLaurence Tribe, Cass Sunstein, and Marcia Greenberg. They advised them \nthey should no longer follow tradition but should change the ground \nrules. In fact, they did so in a lot of areas. The New York Times \nreported that the decision at this meeting was about changing the \nground rules on confirmations.\n  When President Bush started nominating judges, they were suddenly \nsubject to filibuster--consistent, sustained filibusters, vote after \nvote. I believe there were 30 different cloture votes filed to move his \nnominees forward. That is what happened. We ended up with a series of \nnominees who were fabulous nominees President Bush had submitted, and \nthey couldn't get a vote. Priscilla Owen, a member of the Texas Supreme \nCourt, was given the highest possible rating by the ABA; Judge Bill \nPryor, now Justice Bill Pryor from Alabama, a fabulous, brilliant \nnominee; Miguel Estrada; Janice Rogers Brown, an African-American woman \nwho had been elected to the California Supreme Court and was a fabulous \nnominee. I remember her particularly since she had been born in \nAlabama. We couldn't bring them up for a vote. It went on and on.\n  Finally, the only thing that then-majority leader Bill Frist could do \nwas to change the rules of the Senate to allow us to vote. He finally \ngot the situation to the point that that appeared to be likely to \noccur.\n  It was at that point that the Gang of 14--seven Republican and seven \nDemocratic Senators--got together and basically said: Too many nominees \nare being filibustered. We are abusing the filibuster rule, but we \ndon't think we ought to eliminate the filibuster altogether, but only \nin extraordinary circumstances. If you really think this is not a good \nnominee who should not serve on the bench, vote no. But only if you \nstrongly believe there is some serious flaws in this nominee's \nbackground, only then should you participate in a filibuster. It is \nlegitimate if there is extraordinary circumstances. That is what they \nsaid.\n  A number of the judges got through. Several did not. There were 8 or \n10 in controversy at that time for the circuit bench. Priscilla Owen, \nBill Pryor, and Janice Rogers Brown were confirmed, but several others \ndidn't make it from that group.\n  Now we have a Democratic President, and his nominees are coming up. \nJustice Sotomayor, whom he nominated to the Supreme Court, was a nice \nperson, a capable person. She made some speeches that were troubling. \nWe all analyzed that and studied that a good bit. What we concluded \nwas--at least what I concluded, I think most of my colleagues did too--\nthat while we may have serious doubts about whether she should be \nconfirmed for the Supreme Court, we didn't think there were \nextraordinary circumstances that would justify a filibuster. So she was \ngiven an up-or-down vote. I voted against her nomination, but she was \nconfirmed.\n  That is normally the way things have happened. Robert Bork's \nnomination failed on an up-or-down vote. Justice Clarence Thomas was \nconfirmed on an up-or-down vote. However, President Bush's nominee for \nthe Supreme Court, Justice Alito, was filibustered. He was a fabulous \nnominee who was so impressive in committee, almost as impressive as \nPresident Bush's other nominee, Chief Justice John Roberts. He should \nnot have been filibustered, but he was. President Obama was one who led \nthe filibuster and participated in it. But it failed, and Justice Alito \nwas confirmed.\n  In 1997, when a Democratic President was in office and they were \ntrying to move his nominees forward, Senator Boxer said:\n\n       It is not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process \n     and prevent numbers of highly qualified nominees from even \n     being given a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  That is being denied an up-or-down vote by filibuster. She opposed \nthat. Yet when President Bush was nominating judges, she voted 35 times \nto block his nominees by filibuster.\n  During the Clinton administration, Senator Schumer said:\n\n       I also plead with my colleagues to move judges with \n     alacrity--vote them up or down. This delay makes a mockery of \n     the Constitution, makes a mockery of the fact that we are \n     here working, and makes a mockery of the lives of very \n     sincere people. . . .\n\n  Senator Schumer later voted 34 times to keep President Bush's \nnominees from having an up-or-down vote, in other words, to filibuster \nhis nominees.\n  Our distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, \nlikewise made similar statements. I will not go into all of those, but \nI can do so. I can definitely state time after\n\n[[Page S11366]]\n\ntime, Senator after Senator who opposed filibusters when President \nClinton was sending nominees to the Senate led the filibusters against \nPresident Bush's nominees.\n  The Democrats have a clear majority in the Senate, 60 Members. \nSenator Reid recently came to the Chamber to demand a time agreement \nfor Judge David Hamilton's nomination to the Seventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Apparently, he was not happy that some of us wanted to have \nmore debate about it. He said:\n\n       We are going to do Judge David Hamilton [for the] Seventh \n     Circuit, who has been waiting since April. We have agreed to \n     time agreements. Do you want an hour, 2 hours, 5 hours, 10 \n     hours of debate? No, we don't want anything.\n\n  He is speaking for the Republicans.\n\n       They don't want a time agreement. This is so important that \n     we will spend 2 days debating it if we can have a vote. But \n     that is not good enough. No time is sufficient.\n\n  That is what he grumbled about. He has a lot on his plate. But \nSenator Reid has a short memory. When Senator Reid was in the middle of \nfilibustering Priscilla Owen, a fabulous nominee, and Senator Bob \nBennett made a unanimous consent request that the Senate commit 10 \nhours to debating her nomination and then give her an up-or-down vote, \nSenator Reid objected. When Senator Bennett asked how much time would \nbe sufficient for the nomination, Senator Reid responded by saying:\n\n       [T]here is not a number [of hours] in the universe that \n     would be sufficient.\n\n  Later, Senator McConnell sought a time agreement on Judge Owen. \nSenator Reid responded by saying:\n\n       We would not agree to a time agreement . . . of any \n     duration.\n\n  Majority Leader Reid voted 27 times to filibuster President Bush's \nnominees. There are a number of other statements I could cite that \ndemonstrate how some of my Democratic colleagues have forgotten the \nfactual record.\n  The truth is, my colleagues on the Democratic side fought against \nmoving to cloture on 17 of President Bush's judicial nominees on 30 \nseparate occasions. In doing so, they changed 214 years of Senate \ntradition. That is a fact.\n  I remember, as a new Member of the Senate, when President Clinton was \nin office. I believed the Senate should abide by those rules. I \nremember voting for cloture to move two nominations--Berzon and Paez. \nAlthough I voted against them, I did not support a filibuster. I did \nnot think we should change the Senate tradition.\n  Once those debates started--colleagues will remember--it was a pretty \nhot debate. We believed strongly that there was no basis to block a lot \nof these nominees. The only thing these judges had in common was that \nthey believed a judge should strictly apply the law, that they should \nbe objective, that they should not allow their personal feelings to \nenter into their decision-making, or their empathies, and that they \nwould be faithful to the law even if they didn't like the law. If it \nwas passed by some legislature or the Congress, they ought to be \nenforcing it regardless of what they personally thought. They were not \nelected to make the law; they were elected to enforce the law. The \nAmerican people agreed with that overwhelmingly.\n  One night we debated all night. We went all night long to try to \nencourage colleagues to give up on the filibusters. But they didn't. \nThat is how we got the Gang of 14 came about and made the rule change.\n  So my Democratic colleagues are sort of suggesting, it seems to me, \nthat it is somehow improper that on any nominee Republicans would \ndemand they achieve a 60-vote margin to move to an up-or-down vote--\nwhat they have been doing time after time. I will just say if we allow \nthat to happen, this is the effect of it. It would mean for a \nRepublican President who nominates a judge to the bench, his nominee \nwould have to get 60 votes in the Senate to be confirmed. But if a \nDemocrat is in office, and Republicans are not able to filibuster, it \nwould only take 51 votes to get them confirmed.\n  That is the kind of situation we are in. So the answer becomes, to \nme, pretty obvious, and I think to others on our side. We had a full \ndebate. We had a real battle. We went on for several years. We debated \nthe rules of the Senate, and the Senate, in effect, established a new \nrule. The new rule is, filibusters are legitimate, but only if there \nare extraordinary circumstances. I think that is not totally improper. \nI guess we are stuck with it. That is where we are, and I think that is \nprobably where we are going to stay for a while.\n  So as we go forward today, we will be asking--maybe each of us--what \n``extraordinary circumstances'' is. There is no exact definition of it. \nWhen is it appropriate to vote against cloture on a judicial nominee? \nWhat does ``extraordinary circumstances'' mean? Each Senator will make \nup their own mind. There is no firm definition.\n  In my view, Judge Hamilton is an example of a nominee who does fit \nthe ``extraordinary circumstances'' standard for a number of reasons. \nIt is difficult for Members on this side of the aisle to vote to end \ndebate on a nominee as controversial as Judge Hamilton. Indeed, we have \nhad no debate on him at all on the floor to date. No one on this side \nof the aisle has made a statement similar to the one Senator Reid made \nabout there not being enough time in the universe to debate the \nnominee.\n  If we look back and see how the decision was made on the nominees who \ncame through when the rule was changed, maybe we can get some feeling \nfor the appropriate way to view--based at least on what happened \nbefore--the meaning of ``extraordinary circumstances.''\n  As to Judge Bill Pryor, the Democrats forced three cloture votes. \nThey blocked him three times. Many of my colleagues who are now arguing \nagainst a filibuster, saying Judge Hamilton should not be filibustered, \ndid not hesitate to vote to block an up-or-down vote on Judge Pryor.\n  During his confirmation, then Alabama Attorney General Pryor was \ncriticized because he had pro-life personal views, although he had a \nrecord of showing that he criticized an Alabama law, as attorney \ngeneral, that was anti-abortion, when he felt it was unconstitutional. \nAs attorney general, he said it was unenforceable. It was a close \nquestion, but the Supreme Court had ruled on it, and Bill Pryor said: I \nam a man of the law. Even though I am pro-life, I cannot enforce this \nlaw.\n  That was not good enough. They thought he, as a strong and practicing \nCatholic, was too religious. So now, if we look at Judge Hamilton--I am \nnot sure what his religious beliefs are, and it certainly is not a \nmatter that is important--but in Hinrichs v. Bosma, in the district \ncourt where he is a Federal district judge, in 2005, Judge Hamilton \nprohibited prayers in the Indiana House of Representatives that \nexpressly mentioned Jesus Christ, saying they violated the \nEstablishment Clause of the United States. Yet he would have allowed \nprayers which mentioned Allah. They had an imam pray at the legislature \ntoo.\n  Mr. President, I will wrap up.\n  In Grossbaum v. Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority, he \ndenied a rabbi's plea to allow a Menorah to be part of the Indianapolis \nMunicipal Building's holiday display. The Seventh Circuit reversed him \nunanimously.\n  So I would ask, between the criticism of Judge Pryor and Judge \nHamilton, who is out of the mainstream? Where is the extraordinary \ncircumstance?\n  Then there was Priscilla Owen, some of my Democratic colleagues found \nextraordinary her dissents in close, split cases, dealing with parental \nconsent. Judge Owen was concerned that a 16-year-old in Texas could get \nan aspirin at school without parental consent but, under Texas law, \ncould have an abortion without any parental involvement. She voted to \nuphold the ruling of the lower court judge that parents should be at \nleast notified before their daughters underwent an operation, and my \ncolleagues did not like that.\n  Judge Hamilton, on the other hand, succeeded in blocking the \nenforcement of an Indiana informed consent law for 7 years. In \nreversing him, the Seventh Circuit noted that Judge Hamilton had abused \nhis judicial discretion. The court of appeals said this:\n\n       [F]or seven years Indiana has been prevented from enforcing \n     a statute materially identical to a law held valid by the \n     Supreme Court in Casey, by this court in Karlin, and by the \n     Fifth Circuit in Barnes. No court anywhere in the country \n     (other than one district judge in Indiana)--\n\n  They were talking about Judge Hamilton--\n\n\n[[Page S11367]]\n\n\n     has held any similar law invalid in the years since Casey. . \n     . . Indiana (like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin)--\n\n  According to the Court--\n\n     is entitled to put its law into effect and have that law \n     judged by its own consequences.\n\n  So between the criticisms of Judge Owen and Judge Hamilton, which one \nis outside the mainstream?\n  Well, there are other issues we could talk about and will talk about \nas the debate goes forward. But I just wanted to share that to say I am \nnot one who believes we should lightly oppose a nominee. I think they \nshould be given some deference, whatever a Senator believes. I believe \na President's nominee should be given deference. But we are not a \nrubberstamp. We are being asked to give this nominee a lifetime \nappointment. If they believe they have the power to frustrate \nlegislative will and popular will, when what the legislature did is not \nin violation of the Constitution, they do not need to be on the bench. \nThat is my view and I think a lot of others' view too.\n  The American people are unhappy with judges who believe they can \nallow their feelings, their empathies to cause them to render opinions \nthat do not follow the law. The great American heritage is an objective \nview of the law, and the oath that a judge takes is to be impartial and \nto serve under the Constitution and the laws of the United States.\n  Because I am deeply troubled by Mr. Hamilton's record--not by his \npersonal qualities, but his record and his speeches--I will be opposing \nthe nomination and not voting for cloture.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Nomination of Judge David Hamilton\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Judge \nDavid Hamilton whom the President has nominated to serve on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n  I first had the pleasure of supporting David Hamilton almost 15 years \nago when he was nominated to the Federal district court. I said then \nthat ``the high quality of his education, legal experience, and \ncharacter well prepare him for this position'' and expressed my belief \nthat ``his keen intellect and strong legal background will make him a \ngreat judge.'' This confidence in David Hamilton's character and \nabilities was shared by all who knew him regardless of political \naffiliation throughout Indiana's legal and civic communities.\n  I have known David since his childhood. His father, the Reverend \nRichard Hamilton, was our family's pastor at St. Luke's United \nMethodist Church in Indianapolis where his mother was the soloist in \nthe choir. Knowing firsthand his family's character and commitment to \nservice, it has been no surprise to me that David's life has borne \nwitness to the values learned in his youth.\n  David graduated with honors from Pennsylvania's Haverford College, \nwon a Fulbright Scholarship to study in Germany, and then earned his \nlaw degree at Yale. After clerking for the Seventh Circuit Court, David \njoined the Indianapolis office of Barnes & Thornburg where he became a \npartner and acquired extensive litigation experience in the Indiana and \nFederal judicial systems.\n  When our colleague, Senator Evan Bayh, was elected Governor of \nIndiana, he asked David to serve as his chief legal counsel. Among \nother achievements in that role, David supervised the overhaul of State \nethics rules and guidelines and coordinated judicial and prosecutorial \nappointments.\n  In the latter capacity, David worked closely with Judge John Tinder, \nthen a President Reagan appointee to the district bench, whom President \nBush recently appointed to the Seventh Circuit with the unanimous \nsupport of the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate.\n  When David was nominated to the district court, Judge John Tinder \nwrote to me that David was ``meticulous in asking the difficult \nquestions of and about judicial nominees.'' He said his approach to \nthese duties ``typifies the deliberate and sensitive way in which he \napproaches matters in his professional life.''\n  The same is true of David's approach to his judicial duties. Leading \nmembers of the Indiana bar testify to his brilliance and, as important, \nto his character, dedication, and fairness. Geoffrey Slaughter, \npresident of the Indiana Federalist Society, also endorsed Judge \nHamilton's nomination, saying:\n\n       I regard Judge Hamilton as an excellent jurist with a \n     first-rate intellect. He is unfailingly polite to lawyers. He \n     asks tough questions to both sides, and he is very smart. His \n     judicial philosophy is left of center, but well within the \n     mainstream.\n\n  His colleagues on the Southern District of Indiana bench--a talented \nand exceptionally collegial group from both parties--unanimously \nendorse that conclusion.\n  I recognize some of my colleagues do not share this view. Specific \ncharges have been levied that Judge Hamilton has used his position on \nthe Federal courts to drive a political agenda. I believe a closer look \nat his record will reveal that Judge Hamilton has not been a judicial \nactivist and has ruled objectively and within the judicial mainstream.\n  Upon receiving a letter from my good friend and colleague, the \nranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I asked Indianapolis \nattorney and former Associate Counsel to President Ronald Reagan, \nnamely, Peter Rusthoven, to review concerns raised regarding David \nHamilton's nomination.\n  Judge Hamilton has been criticized for a speech delivered in 2003 \nwhen he cited that judges ``write a series of footnotes to the \nConstitution.''\n  It has been suggested that this comment is evidence of a judicial \nactivist philosophy. However, Judge Hamilton never wrote that judicial \ndecisions are an appropriate means to change the Constitution. The \nfootnotes comment means simply that judicial decisions illustrate how \nthe Constitution applies to particular circumstances. For example, \nChief Justice Marshall's seminal Marbury v. Madison decision, \nestablishing judicial authority to pass on the constitutionality of \nactions by the political branches, illustrates a vital aspect of how \nthe Constitution applies, but does not assert judicial power to amend \nthe Constitution, much less based on a judge's personal views.\n  Another charge levied is that Judge Hamilton prohibited public \nprayers involving Jesus Christ but allowed prayers invoking Allah. \nHowever, Judge Hamilton did not say, as some suggest, that prayers in \nthe Indiana Legislature ``Allah'' as the Muslim deity were permissible \nwhile prayers to Jesus Christ were not. He in fact said that using \nAllah as a generic reference to the deity could theoretically be \npermissible in nonsectarian prayer, as would be true of using the word \nfor God in any language. Judge Hamilton was clear that legislative \nprayer advancing the religion of Islam would be prohibited. I support a \nmore permissive approach to public prayer than Judge Hamilton, but \nclearly his ruling comports with Supreme Court authority. As Justice \nAntonin Scalia explained, government-sponsored endorsements of religion \nare sectarian if they ``specify details upon which men and women who \nbelieve in a benevolent, omnipotent Creator and Ruler of the world are \nknown to differ, for example, the divinity of Jesus Christ.''\n  Also contrary to certain charges, Judge Hamilton's ruling on the \nissue was not reversed. The Seventh Circuit's later reversal did not \ninvolve the merits, but the separate, procedural issue of whether the \ntaxpayer plaintiffs had legal standing to challenge the legislative \npractice. In this case, a subsequent Supreme Court ruling created a new \nprecedent which led to the reversal.\n  A similar reversal situation occurred regarding an effort to compel \nlocal officials to include a Menorah as part of a holiday display in \nthe Indianapolis City-County Building. The Seventh Circuit opinion by \nReagan appointee Judge Ripple makes this point in its opening \nparagraph, saying Judge Hamilton's ruling had been made ``without the \nbenefit of the Supreme Court's recent guidance in this area.''\n  There have have also been claims, citing the Almanac of the Federal \nJudiciary, that Judge Hamilton is one of the most lenient judges in his \ndistrict in criminal matters. However, the Almanac cited \nextraordinarily high\n\n[[Page S11368]]\n\npraise for Judge Hamilton. The Almanac summary states: ``Hamilton is \nfair when it comes to sentencing, according to lawyers.'' Practitioners \nconsistently stated that he is objective and shows no bias.\n  In demonstrating this alleged leniency, critics have cited a case in \nwhich Judge Hamilton ``used his opinion to request clemency for a \npolice officer who pled guilty to two counts of producing child \npornography.'' Judge Hamilton in fact imposed the 15-year sentence \nrequired by sentencing guidelines even though he believed it excessive \nin the circumstances. Doing what the law requires even when a judge may \npersonally disagree is a textbook example of judicial restraint. \nFurther, there were, indeed, circumstances in the case that might \nproperly be considered in a later executive clemency request, which is \nall that the unpublished decision was pointing out. In other cases with \ndifferent circumstances, Judge Hamilton has imposed rigorous sentences \nfor child pornography as long as 100 years.\n  Critics also point to another case in which they argue that Judge \nHamilton disregarded an earlier conviction in order to avoid imposing a \nlife sentence on a repeat offender. In this particular case, Judge \nHamilton made a mistake and has admitted it. Judge Hamilton initially \nimposed a 25-year sentence for drug and firearms offenses on a 55-year-\nold man taking into account a 10-year-old prior conviction. The issue \nwas whether the sentence should be further enhanced based on a 35-year-\nold prior conviction on marijuana charges under the now repealed \nFederal Youth Corrections Act. Judge Hamilton now believes the Seventh \nCircuit was correct to apply a sentence enhancement, and he imposed a \nlife sentence on remand.\n  Another complaint is that Judge Hamilton used his position to \npurposely delay enforcement of Indiana's informed consent abortion laws \nfor 7 years. Judge Hamilton's analysis in the Indiana case differs from \nmy own, but his actions were defensible in the context of what lower \ncourts must do in the field of abortion law jurisprudence.\n  As those who believe Roe v. Wade was fundamentally mistaken would \nargue, ``undue burden'' issues of the sort Judge Hamilton and the \nSeventh Circuit wrestled with in the Indiana litigation are an \nunfortunate, inevitable consequence of what Justice Scalia has called \nthe Supreme Court's continued effort to craft an ``abortion code'' \nwithout grounding in the text of the Constitution. Hence, it is hardly \nsurprising that jurists will come out on different sides of undue \nburden inquiries. They necessarily entail judges weighing what is or is \nnot undue by a standard that is unguided by any constitutional \nlanguage. The Supreme Court itself continues to struggle to articulate \ntests that will elucidate this matter of law.\n  One illustration of that point is that five members of the full \nSeventh Circuit--including Judge Posner, a Reagan appointee--voted to \ngrant rehearing en banc of the 2-1 decision reversing Judge Hamilton's \nruling. Further, even in reversing, the Seventh Circuit did not hold \nthat Judge Hamilton's fact findings were ``clearly erroneous,'' which \nis the pertinent appellate review standard on evidentiary questions.\n  The delay assertion unfairly ignores that the delay was due in very \nlarge part to litigation decisions made by the State of Indiana itself. \nJudge Hamilton's preliminary injunction decision in 1995 was \nimmediately appealable by the State as a matter of right; but the State \nchose not to appeal. The same was true of Judge Hamilton's 1997 \ndecision modifying that injunction; again, the State chose not to \nappeal. Thereafter, the State as well as the plaintiffs sought \ncontinuances of the trial, including to permit further discovery on \ncomplex statistical issues that are an aspect of the undue burden \nanalysis. The notion that Judge Hamilton was in any way trying \npersonally to delay the case, whether based on his personal views on \nany issue or for any other reason, is unfounded.\n  Allow me to close with a few further thoughts on our nominations \nprocess. When I introduced now Chief Justice John Roberts to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in 2005, I expressed my concern that the Federal \njudiciary is seen by many as another political branch. The confirmation \nprocess is often accompanied by the same oversimplifications and \ndistortions that are disturbing even in campaigns for offices that are, \nin fact, political. This phenomenon is most pronounced at the Supreme \nCourt level, and traces to several causes that I will not try to \naddress today. I mention this, however, to underscore my commitment to \na different view of judicial nominations, which I believe comports with \nthe proper role of the judiciary in our constitutional framework.\n  I do not view our Federal courts as the forum for resolving political \ndisputes that the legislative and executive branches cannot, or do not \nwant to, resolve.\n  This is why I believe our confirmation decisions should not be based \non partisan considerations, much less on how we hope or predict a given \njudicial nominee will rule on particular issues of public moment or \ncontroversy. I have instead tried to evaluate judicial candidates on \nwhether they have the requisite intellect, experience, character and \ntemperament that Americans deserve from their judges, and also on \nwhether they indeed appreciate the vital, and yet vitally limited, role \nof the Federal judiciary faithfully to interpret and apply our laws, \nrather than seeking to impose their own policy views. I support Judge \nHamilton's nomination because he is superbly qualified under both sets \nof criteria.\n  Finally, permit me to thank my colleague from Indiana, Senator Evan \nBayh, on the thoughtful, cooperative, merit-driven attitude that has \nmarked his own approach to recommending prospective judicial nominees \nfrom our State. The two most recent examples are his strong support for \nPresident Bush's nominations of Judge Tinder for the Seventh Circuit \nand of Judge William Lawrence for the Southern district of Indiana.\n  Thank you for this opportunity to express my support for Judge David \nHamilton. I am hopeful that my colleagues will vote tomorrow to end \ndebate on this important nomination.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will so state.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. How much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the minority side, 16\\1/2\\ minutes; on the \nmajority side, 46\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I know we are going to vote at 5:30 on \nan amendment and on a motion to commit. I send a motion to commit to \nthe desk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] moves to commit the \n     bill H.R. 3082 to the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate with instructions to report the same back to the \n     Senate with changes to reprioritize spending within the bill \n     in order to provide sufficient funding to ensure coverage of \n     medically necessary care and payment of caregivers for \n     disabled veterans, including but not limited to those who \n     fought in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, \n     Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm, Operation \n     Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and any combat \n     zone in the War on Terrorism, and that such funding for \n     veterans' assistance should be paid for with reductions in \n     spending for earmarks for less urgent projects and other \n     unnecessary programs not requested by the Commander in Chief.\n\n\n[[Page S11369]]\n\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I think under the agreement I will have \n30 minutes to discuss this and the other amendment I have; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may consume 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair. I will try not to consume that amount \nof time to move this along.\n  Last weekend, the Senate, prior to Veterans Day, had the urgency of \npassing a bill that will, in fact, help a specified group of veterans, \nbut it won't help veterans who have identical needs to that group of \nveterans because they were excluded from it.\n  The Caregivers Act also will require, at a minimum, $3.7 billion in \nspending over the next 5 years, and none of it--there was no decision \nto make in terms of that bill on any priorities about what we get rid \nof. As a matter of fact, the intent, as stated by the majority whip, \nwas that we needed to pass this before last Wednesday so that people \ncould get care. Well, the truth is, no care will come about if there is \nno money in this bill for that program.\n  The whole purpose for this motion to commit is to do two things: One, \nsend the committee back and eliminate the discrimination against \nveterans in the first gulf war, against veterans in the Vietnam war, \nthe Korean war, and World War II who have identical needs that require \nfamily caregivers and include them in it. The second aspect of the \nmotion to commit is to find it from the available funds we have today. \nWe suggest some opportunity for that but don't mandate where it comes \nfrom. But we should reduce spending somewhere else to pay for this. The \nreason that is important is, this past year, 43 cents out of every \ndollar we spent we borrowed from our grandchildren.\n  So in making a motion to commit this bill, we are doing three \nessential things. No. 1 is that we are actually being truthful that we \nreally want to take care of this need and will do it in this fiscal \nyear. No. 2 is that we are not discriminating against other veterans \nwho have identical needs. No. 3 is that we are not discriminating \nagainst our children and grandchildren by not making hard choices to \npay for it within existing funds.\n  I have no illusions that this motion to commit will succeed. But it \ndoesn't change the very real facts that are in front of this Nation--\nthat we cannot continue to spend money without making choices about \nwhat is most important. None of us disagree that taking care of those \nwho have sacrificed for us has to become No. 2 behind the defense of \nthis Nation in terms of the priorities for this country. Nothing else \nis higher in priority. Yet the bill we have before us doesn't make that \na priority and the authorizing language doesn't make that a priority. \nAs a matter of fact, the bill before us asks the VA to study this issue \nrather than actually go on and fund this issue by making the \nappropriate changes.\n  There is a significant increase in this bill, and outside of foreign \nexpenditures, it is over 5.5 percent. It is not objectionable that it \nwould be there, that kind of increase, given the demand our troops have \nhad and their injuries and what they have suffered in terms of \ndefending this country and fighting two ongoing wars. However, some of \nthat money ought to be winnowed down so that we can take care of the \nvery people who protect us.\n  We have had these tremendous speeches on why we have to do it now. If \nthose speeches aren't going to ring hollow, we ought to commit the bill \nto make sure we have money for the Veterans Caregiver Act.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2757\n\n  The other area I wish to spend time on is that in this bill we also \nhave various and sundry reports that have been requested by the \ncommittee of different branches of the Federal Government. One of the \nmost important ways to build trust in the Congress today is for us to \ncreate and increase the level of transparency for the American people \nto see our actions. This amendment is simply an amendment that says any \nreports that do not divulge or put at risk national security data \nshould be made available to all the Senators, all the Congress, and all \nof the American people. This has been in several of the appropriations \nbills we have passed in the Senate. Unfortunately, rarely has it stayed \nin the conference report because there are those who don't want the \nAmerican people to see what we are doing and how we are doing it.\n  I will sum up. We find ourselves in a big pickle right now as a \nnation. We soon will be voting in this body to increase the debt limit \nto $12.1 trillion. That figures out as a significant amount of money \nfor every individual in this country--well over $35,000--but it is a \nvery small amount compared to what is getting ready to happen in the \nnext 9 years as our debt triples. Our debt will triple in the next 9 \nyears, which means we will go from 30-some thousand dollars per \nindividual to very close to $100,000 per individual.\n  That doesn't compare to the unfunded liability. If you take everybody \nin this country who is 25 years of age and younger--that is 103 million \nAmericans--and you ask what is the consequence to those young Americans \n20 years from now, the consequence is that they are going to be paying \nfor another $1 million in debt for which they got no benefit, and the \ninterest costs on that alone will be over $70,000 per year, per \nindividual under age 25 today and under 45 20 years from now and all \ntheir kids.\n  The idea that we ought to pay for the new things we do by eliminating \nthe things that aren't important, that we ought to pay for the new \nthings we do by eliminating some of the $300 billion worth of waste, \nfraud, and duplication in the Federal Government every year is not a \nnovel idea outside Washington; it is only a novel idea inside \nWashington--the very fact that the next generation will be put at a \ndisadvantage because we lack the same courage and clarity of moral \ncharacter our troops have in terms of making tough choices.\n  My hope is that with the motion to commit, in fact, the body will \nlook and say we really can fund this and find waste and we can make \nchoices about what is most important versus what is not most important, \nand not only will we help the veterans who are deserving of our \nassistance at this time, but we will also help the veterans' children \nand grandchildren by not plugging a credit card in and saying: Whatever \nwe are going to do for veterans today, we are going to charge to you.\n  Instead, I hope that we are going to carry the load and that we are \ngoing to embrace the heritage of our country, the heritage of sacrifice \nand of creating opportunity that is better for the generations that \nfollow than the opportunities that were given to us. That is not \nhappening right now in our country. We are going to have a larger \ndeficit next year than we have this year. We are going to take 43 cents \nout of every dollar we actually spend next year and we are going to \ncharge that all to those two generations that follow us. That is not \nwhat made this country strong. That is not what our veterans fought \nfor. That is not the country they want to see in the future. It is time \nwe made some hard choices.\n  The resistance will be: I don't want to eliminate my earmark; I don't \nwant to eliminate the parochial things I have done for my State to take \ncare of veterans. They will not come out and say that, but that will be \nthe result of the vote. The vote is, take care of the politicians, say \nyou are taking care of the veterans, but undermine the future of the \nnext two generations. That is what the vote is going to be about on the \nmotion to commit--a lot of controversy and emotion associated with not \ndoing things on time. But I would rather do things right and do things \nthat will secure the future rather than destroy it. I would rather do \nthings that honor the sacrifice rather than dishonor the sacrifice.\n  We can claim all we want when we pass a veterans caregiver bill, but \nif we don't fund it and there is no money for it, it is an announcement \nthat we care but no action behind it. If we don't cover all the \nveterans who have the same need, we know it is political only. The \nmotion to commit makes sure that we cover all veterans, that we treat \nthem all equally, and if they have the same kinds of needs, they will \nget the same kinds of service--not because they are young and served in \nthe war on terror but because they served this great Nation and \npreserved it with their courage, valor, and commitment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11370]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no \namendments be in order to the Coburn amendment or motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, the MILCON-VA bill before the Senate \ntoday funds critically important programs for our Nation's military \nforces and their families and for our vets. Most of the funding was \nrequested by the President, but certain programs were enhanced or \naugmented by the committee after careful consideration and evaluation \nof the budget request. Let me give two examples of the funding in this \nbill that was not requested by the President that would be stripped out \nunder the mandate of the motion to commit: $50 million for community-\nbased outpatient clinics for vets in rural areas underserved by VA \nmedical centers. These clinics serve as medical lifelines for vets in \nrural areas who do not have ready access to a VA Hospital.\n  There is $50 million in a pending amendment to renovate excess \nbuildings on VA medical campuses for homeless vets shelters and \nservices. An estimated 131,000 vets are homeless on any given night. \nSecretary Shinseki has made it a priority to eliminate homelessness \namong vets, and this bill supports that effort.\n  There is $300 million to complete the funding requirement for the \nexpanded Homeowners Assistance Program for military personnel, to \nprotect military families under orders to move during the current \nmortgage crisis from disastrous losses on home sales and to shield \nwounded warriors and surviving spouses from the financial ravages of \nthe mortgage crisis.\n  There is $7.5 million for a chapel center at Dover Air Force Base, \nDE, to replace a wood-frame chapel built in 1956. The existing chapel \nhas asbestos in the ventilation system, the roof is too unstable for \nmaintenance personnel to walk on, and the Chaplain Command has rated \nthe current chapel as the worst in the command. Yet this decrepit \nfacility serves as the primary site for hosting families waiting to \nview the dignified transfer of the fallen from the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This project was not included in the President's budget \nrequest but was added by the committee.\n  These are but a few examples of the types of programs and projects \nfunded in the bill that were not requested by the President. They are \nnot, as this motion would suggest, less urgent or unnecessary simply \nbecause they were not requested by the President. They are the product \nof careful analysis and evaluation by the committee of jurisdiction and \ndeveloped in close consultation with the authorizing committees.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the committee-passed version of the \nMILCON-VA bill and reject the motion to commit it to the committee.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I know my colleague, the chairman of \nthe Veterans Affairs and Military Construction Subcommittee, has \nalready spoken on the bill. I rise to make a couple of points.\n  First, I thank the Senate for not meeting on this bill last Tuesday, \nwhen it was scheduled to be taken up and passed and, instead, allowing \nso many of our colleagues to go to the memorial service at Fort Hood in \nKilleen. It was a wonderful service. So many of our colleagues were in \nattendance from all over the country to show their support for the \ntroops, to show sympathy for the families. There were approximately 200 \nfamily members there. Of course, the President and Mrs. Obama were \nthere. There were many House Members. It showed to the base and to the \nthousands of troops who attended how much we care about them. I am \ngrateful to my colleagues for that gesture.\n  We have a good bill. My colleague Senator Johnson and I have worked \ntogether on this bill. We have stayed within our budget. We have tried \nto make sure we are covering the needs of our veterans.\n  The emphasis in the veterans section is in health care. We know we \nmust do more for the mental health and getting people who have been in \nAfghanistan or Iraq back into the mainstream so they can lead normal \nlives. We have done that. We have put over $4 billion into mental \nhealth funding. We are setting up centers now for mental health \nexcellence. I am pleased we are making that a priority.\n  In addition, spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries. We know so \nmany of our wounded soldiers suffer traumatic injuries. We need to make \nsure we have the ability to give them all of the rehabilitation \nnecessary for them to reenter a life of quality. We are adding one more \ntier 1 polytrauma center. We have four. We are adding one more in San \nAntonio, TX, in the VA center, which we are very pleased to be able to \ndo.\n\n  The homeless veterans program is also being augmented in this bill, \nand I applaud Senator Johnson's efforts for creating the initiative \nlast year to increase the VA footprint in our rural areas for our \nhealth care facilities. I think this is very helpful and warranted.\n  On the military construction side, this morning I was at Dyess Air \nForce Base, where we broke ground on two incredible facilities. One \nwill be a maintenance facility for both the B-1 bombers and also the C-\n130s and new C-130Js that are going to be coming into our system next \nyear. It is going to be a great facility, and we are very excited about \nthat. We have a Reserve training headquarters there at Dyess, as well, \nand we broke ground on that building today.\n  In addition, our BRAC has been fully funded. That was a priority of \nmine because I thought it was very important we fully fund our BRAC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President. I wish to go ahead to the \nvote because I know it is important. But I will just say, I fully \nsupport our bill and look forward to working on the amendments and \npassing this bill, finally, tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2757\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, evenly \ndivided, on Coburn amendment No. 2757.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I support the amendment from the \nSenator from Oklahoma, amendment No. 2757, disclosure of reports. Our \nside was willing to agree to this amendment by unanimous consent or \nvoice vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I also support this amendment. I \nthink the reporting requirements are absolutely the right thing to do.\n  Madam President, I yield back the rest of my time and ask for the \nvote to commence.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Kaufman), the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. \nWhitehouse) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Kaufman) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nIsakson), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided on the \nCoburn motion to commit.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this motion to commit is based on the \nfact that we have a need among veterans that has an upcoming \nauthorization bill but there is no money in this bill for it. The \nmotion to commit would instruct the conferees to expand those eligible \nto all veterans who have the same need, to find the money to pay for \nthe first year of this in that bill and not charge it to the next \ngeneration.\n  The idea behind the motion to commit is that our veterans are a \npriority, and if they are, we ought to defund things that are less of a \npriority and make sure we take care of them. The obligation for us to \nfulfill our commitment to veterans is not obviated by the lack of our \nobligation to fulfill our commitment to the generation that follows.\n  I would appreciate the support of my colleagues on the motion to \ncommit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the motion? The Senator \nfrom South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, as I have indicated before, I strongly \noppose the motion to commit this bill with instructions.\n  This bill funds programs that are vitally important to America's \nmilitary troops and their families and to our Nation's veterans. Most \nof these programs were funded in the budget request but not all. This \nbill includes additional funding for such programs as housing for \nhomeless veterans, rural clinics for veterans in underserved areas, \nmortgage relief for military personnel under orders to move during the \ncurrent mortgage crisis, and for wounded veterans and surviving spouses \nand funding for an array of regionally needed military construction \nprojects not included in the budget request.\n  The MILCON-VA bill before the Senate is a good piece of legislation. \nLikewise, the veterans caregiver assistance authorization bill is \nimportant legislation. The two bills should not be confused. Congress \nshould pass both the MILCON/VA appropriations bill and the caregivers \nassistance authorization bill without further delay.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Congressional Award Act 30th Anniversary\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, today I rise to recognize the 30th \nanniversary of Public Law 96-114, which is the Congressional Award Act. \nMy predecessor, Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, was a champion of \nthis program.\n  In 1979, the late Congressman James Howard of New Jersey and Senator \nWallop introduced the Congressional Award Act legislation.\n  Thirty years ago, as you recall, America was still living with the \nCold War. The country was in the middle of a serious national \nconversation, one that would require America's young people to \nparticipate in a period of national service. It was a controversial \nconcept, in part because the country had eliminated the armed services \ndraft. Legislation to establish the congressional award had been \nintroduced in Congress for several sessions, but no action had yet been \ntaken. When Senator Wallop was approached as someone who might have an \ninterest, he quickly understood and embraced the core of the program.\n  Our Nation's young people have worthy contributions to make to the \nworld around it, he thought and he said, and the process required to \nearn an award was a productive path to determine their future. Senator \nWallop felt that if America was thinking about requiring national \nservice, then Congress should recognize and thank America's youth for \ntheir positive contributions made through the course of their own \nlives. He saw the congressional award as the perfect opportunity to do \nthis.\n  When Senator Wallop agreed to serve as a sponsor of the congressional \naward, he made it a full commitment. The legislation quickly moved \nthrough\n\n[[Page S11372]]\n\nCongress, and it became law in his very first term of the three terms \nhe spent in the Senate.\n  The congressional award is available to any young person in our \ncountry aged 14 to 23, no matter their life circumstances or their \ncurrent abilities. Through goal setting, participants move from where \nthey are to where they can be, providing service to others and \nexploring their own interest in the process.\n  Recipients of the award are not selected for it. The recipients of \nthe award earn it. It has been my privilege to witness the success of \nthis program both in my home State of Wyoming and around the country. I \nthank all of the Members of Congress who are involved in the \ncongressional award in their own States and districts. I encourage \nthose who have not yet done so to bring this program to their young \nconstituents. And most of all today, I thank our former colleague, \nSenator Malcolm Wallop, for his gift--a gift of opportunity for \nAmerica's young people through the creation of a congressional award, \nan award that was signed into law 30 years ago today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I have come to the Chamber pretty often \nin the last 3 months, as we continue the debate on health care, to \nshare letters from people from Ohio, from Steubenville, from Wauseon, \nfrom Ashtabula, from Hamilton and Middletown, people who write me \nconcerned with the direction of our health care system.\n  What I find in almost every one of these letters that have come from \nOhioans and people I mostly don't know, although I hear these stories \nin person--last night I heard them in Cleveland, a few days in \nColumbus; I have heard them from all over the State--is that so many \npeople, a year ago, if you had asked these same people who wrote the \nletters, are you happy with your health care plan, they would have said \nyes. But something happened in the last year.\n  Maybe they had a child born with a preexisting condition. Maybe they \ngot really sick and their insurance was canceled because it cost the \ninsurance company too much money or their premiums were high or they \nowned a small business with 20 employees and one of their employees got \nespecially sick and the insurance price spiked and they could no longer \nafford the insurance for any of their 20 employees.\n  The other thing I hear over and over is--a lot of people who send me \nletters who have lost their insurance, they are my age or a little bit \nolder. I turned 57 last week. These are letters from people who are 57 \nor 62, particularly in their early sixties. They say it is so important \nto them to turn 65 so they will have insurance. Think of that: I can't \nwait until I am a little older so I can then have the security and \npeace of mind and put that anxiety behind me. We have a health care \nsystem now where people think they want to be a little bit older so \nthey can qualify for Medicare, to have the stability of Medicare. \nSomething is wrong with that. Those are the two things I hear over and \nover: I need to be 65 so I can get Medicare because I know it is \nreliable and stable or I used to be satisfied with my insurance but \nlook what happened.\n  Let me share some of these letters. Karen from Mahoning Valley, \naround Youngstown, Poland, Austintown, that area of Ohio. She writes:\n\n       I am a high school art teacher. Last week I was speaking to \n     one of my students who said she had a health issue. I \n     suggested she go see a doctor but she said she can't because \n     her family doesn't have health insurance. I have suggested \n     she at least go see the school nurse but I know she needs \n     regular visits to a physician. I am appalled at the lack of \n     concern shown by many Members of Congress and by the special \n     interests trying to control the health reform process. Please \n     make the changes for the people who elected you and reap the \n     benefit of seeing positive change in our country.\n\n  Do you know what will happen? I don't know the student's health \nproblem, but what people would say about this is, if her student gets \nsick, she can go to the emergency room and get health care. But that is \nnot the best way to deliver health care. But forget about the best way \nto deliver it. What happens to the student? Maybe the student has \nasthma. My wife almost died of asthma when she was a teenager, but she \nhad good health insurance because her dad carried a union card and \nworked for a local utility company and was able to make sure she got \nthe care she needed. This young woman, say she had asthma. She would \nonly get coverage in the emergency room if she had an asthma attack. \nShe wouldn't get any help from the emergency room to manage her asthma \nor any of the medicines she needs for asthma or any of the kinds of \nthings my wife's insurance pays for for her asthma and so many others \nwho have insurance. So what we are doing is jeopardizing this girl's \nlife and her health, and we are also costing the system more money \nbecause instead of managing the asthma, she has to go for acute care.\n\n  So the emergency room does not mean everybody has health care \ncoverage in this country. It means they will take care of you if you \nare really sick and you have some acute attack of something. They will \nnot take care of you to manage your diabetes or manage your asthma or \nmanage your heart disease. They only take care of you--the emergency \nroom--when you have a heart attack, if you are uninsured. What kind of \nhealth care system is that? It is not as humane as it should be, and it \nis way more expensive and it jeopardizes people's lives.\n  Margaret is from Clermont County, the whole other end of the State. \nClermont County is on the Ohio River, just east of Cincinnati, Batavia, \nthat part of Ohio.\n\n       My oral cancer was diagnosed in 2005. It came back in \n     December 2007, September 2008, and February 2009.\n       We've been lucky and found it early each time, which \n     allowed me to avoid radiation therapy--so far.\n       I worry all the time that eventually I won't be able to \n     work and would lose my health insurance.\n       My husband will retire in 2011, when he qualifies for \n     Medicare. But I'm only 61 and have to wait four years before \n     enrolling in Medicare.\n       I don't understand how opponents of reform can be \n     unsympathetic to the plight of millions of people who have \n     preexisting conditions or have to lose everything to qualify \n     for Medicaid.\n       We need reform now.\n\n  So here is another example. Margaret from southwest Ohio says: I am 4 \nyears away from Medicare. My husband can retire and get Medicare. I am \nstill 4 years away. What are my options? Do we spend everything we \nhave--basically spend whatever their net worth is--to qualify for \nMedicaid, which is available to many low-income people, or do I just \nhope my cancer does not act up again before I turn 65? But again, she \nneeds maintenance of care, some medication to help her so she can make \nit through this time.\n  Margaret, as Karen's student and Karen's student's family, could \nbenefit from a public option because it would give them more choice.\n  In Clermont County in southwest Ohio, two insurance companies have 85 \npercent of the insurance business in that area, that, I believe, four \ncounty area: Hamilton, Clermont, Butler, and Warren Counties. Two \ncompanies have 85 percent of the business. That means the quality of \ninsurance is less and the cost of the insurance is more. That always \nhappens when there is no real competition. So that is why it is so \nimportant people have the public option, so Margaret can get insurance, \nshe can choose the public option or she can choose Aetna or WellPoint \nor Cigna or Medical Mutual--any company she wants.\n  But it also means the public option will keep the price down because \nmore competition means better quality; more competition means keeping \nthe price down. As the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Oregon, said \nin a meeting I was just in, one of the things the public option does \nis--we tell people: You need to get insurance. There are a number of \npeople who, I am sure, have come up to him in Eugene or Portland or \nplaces in Oregon, as they have come up to me in Mansfield and Ashland \nand Galion and Crestline, OH, and said: You are going to make me\n\n[[Page S11373]]\n\nbuy insurance. I don't want my insurance dollars to go to a private \ncompany. I want the choice of letting them go to the public option, a \nMedicare-like plan, so I have that choice and I can direct my insurance \ndollars to the place I want them to go.\n  A third letter I will read--I have two more to share with my \ncolleagues--is from Bill from Cuyahoga County, which is the Cleveland \narea. Bill writes:\n\n       My spouse was diagnosed with breast cancer over two years \n     ago. She worked for a commercial airline for 36 years, but \n     along with other employees in their mid-50s, she was asked to \n     take early retirement or face the possibility of reduced \n     retirement benefits.\n       She took the early retirement package and subsequently \n     found a part-time job with a local bank.\n       The health insurance coverage is inadequate and barely pays \n     any benefits.\n       We have been together for more than 10 years, and during \n     that time she didn't have so much as a cold.\n       But boom, the next thing you know she is sick with breast \n     cancer, with chemo and medications that weaken her.\n       After her treatment sessions, she would then go off to work \n     because she needed to keep her health benefits.\n       But finally, a few weeks ago, se quit her job. She's on \n     COBRA now which we hope will last until she turns 65 years \n     old and is eligible for Medicare.\n       My wife paid her [insurance] premiums for 36 years--\n\n  When she was with the airline--\n\n     while she was healthy but now that she is older and needs \n     insurance, the benefits are cut or non-existent.\n\n  Bill's story is what we hear over and over, and it is in this same \nletter. Bill's story is: My wife paid for insurance all these years. We \nthought we had good insurance, and we did have good insurance until we \nneeded it, until my wife got sick. Then the insurance was not so good. \nAnd Bill's story, with his wife, is: She looks forward to being 65 so \nshe can have Medicare coverage.\n  Again, what kind of health care system does that? The insurance is OK \nuntil you really need it, and then they cut you off if you are too \nexpensive, they cut you off if you have a preexisting condition, or \nthey cut your son or daughter off because a baby is born with a \npreexisting condition. What kind of health care system says: Boy, I \ncan't wait until I am 3 years older so I can have that good government \nplan, that Medicare plan that will mean stability and predictability?\n  We clearly need to help people get through this anxiety that so many \nAmericans have because they just hope they do not get sick before they \nturn 65 or they hope they do not get too expensively sick, if you will, \nbecause they are going to lose their insurance because their insurance \ncompany will cut them off. That is why we need the public option. We \nneed insurance reform. We need no more preexisting condition \nexclusions. We have done that in the bill.\n  No more discrimination based on gender or disability or race or age \nor geography. We have done that in the bill. No more disqualifications \nor annual cap because your health care costs too much, you spent too \nmany days in the hospital, went to too many expensive doctors, had too \nmuch treatment. It is so expensive the insurance company is going to \ncancel your insurance. We are going to say: No more of insurance \ncompanies gaming the system.\n  We know--and the Senator from Oregon was on the floor with me a \ncouple weeks ago and talked then--that insurance companies are making \nmore and more profits, a 400-percent increase from 7 years ago. \nInsurance company CEOs' salaries--the Aetna CEO makes $24 million a \nyear. The CEOs of the 10 largest insurance companies in the country \naverage $11 million in pay.\n  How are they doing that? They are doing that by cutting off people \nsuch as Bill's wife. They are doing that by using preexisting \nconditions and keeping people from getting insurance. That is why the \npublic option for Bill and his wife would mean they would be in a \nsituation where they could have more choice--those insurance reforms I \ntalked about. The public option would help to enforce those insurance \nreforms so Aetna and Blue Cross and WellPoint and these companies could \nnot game the system the way they have so they can pay these huge \nsalaries and have these increasingly huge profits. The public option \nwill simply give people more choice. And it is only an option.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I tell the Senator, I was back home in Illinois during \nthe break and went to southern Illinois, which is an area the Senator \nwould be familiar with in a second. It is a small town, rural area. I \nlove it. That is where my roots are in our State. I stopped at a hotel \nin the area of Marion, IL, and there is a nice lady who fixes breakfast \nin the morning for the guests. Her name is Judy. She could not be any \nkinder and nicer and always has a warm greeting.\n\n  She came up to me, as she was getting a cup of coffee, and said: Is \nthis health care thing going to help me?\n  I said: Do you have health insurance?\n  She said: Oh, no. I've never had health insurance.\n  Judy, I am guessing, is about 60 years old.\n  I said: Well, I can tell you, if you just give me an idea about \nyourself, I will give you kind of an idea of what you might expect.\n  She said: Well, they keep cutting our hours at the hotel here. I am \ndown to 30 hours a week, and I get paid about $8 an hour.\n  So I said: Well, I'll do a quick calculation. I think you make about \n$12,000 a year.\n  She said: Yeah.\n  Imagine, living on $12,000 a year, which is what her gross income is.\n  I said: By most of the bills that are going through Congress now, \nunless you are making over $14,000 or $15,000 a year, you will be \ncovered by Medicaid, which means you are going to have health insurance \nfor the first time in your life through Medicaid.\n  She said: I don't have to pay for it?\n  I said: No. You're in a low-income situation. You wouldn't have to \npay for it at $12,000 a year.\n  I say to the Senator, I thought, as the Senator was just speaking, \nwhat if she were making $15,000 a year and her employer did not offer \nhealth insurance? As I understand it, at that point, most of the bills \nsay: It is time for you to find a way to find health insurance. And the \ninsurance exchange will give you some options from which to choose.\n  What the Senator is saying--what I believe, and I think what the vast \nmajority of our people believe--is, one of those options should be a \nnot-for-profit plan, the lowest cost for Judy to buy into. As the \nPresiding Officer pointed out in an earlier meeting we had, if we were \nto say we are going to impose an obligation on people to buy health \ninsurance but only give them private health insurance options, I think \nmost people would say: Wait a minute. If you are going to impose an \nobligation on me to buy health insurance, give me some affordable \noptions.\n  Our support for a public option is to come up with a not-for-profit \nplan that is not trying to please shareholders, that is not advertising \non radio and television, and that does not hire lots of people, clerks \nto say no. That, to me, is a sensible outcome for the obligation to buy \nhealth insurance because it gives people choices.\n  I salute Senator Harry Reid because, as our Democratic leader, he \nsaid maybe there are some Governors, some States, some people who just \ndo not want a public option. Let them decide to opt out of the system. \nThey can opt out. They are not going to be forced in. They can opt out. \nI think that is a reasonable way to move.\n  So I say to the Senator from Ohio, you probably have a lot of your \nconstituents, just like mine--like Judy who works down at this hotel--\nwho are uninsured at the moment. She has diabetes, incidentally. She \ntold me she had some medical issues and could not even go to a doctor, \nsee a doctor, because she just does not make enough money. That is the \nreality of life for a lot of hard-working people in Illinois, and in \nOhio, I am sure.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Assistant Majority Leader Durbin.\n  That story is so common. I was in a restaurant in Columbus one day \nand had breakfast with my daughter, who lives there. The young woman \nwho waited on us, who is working probably about the same number of \nhours--she is waiting tables. She is doing a little better than that, I \nthink, in terms of her income. She is also tutoring some music students \nbecause she went to college and got a degree in music. She hopes to \nturn that into a business. She\n\n[[Page S11374]]\n\nis making more money than what would qualify her for Medicaid. With the \nlegislation, she would get the opportunity.\n  She said: Are you going to pass this bill?\n  I said: Yes.\n  She said: Are you going to have a public option?\n  I said: Majority Leader Reid is putting the public option in the \nbill. The House passed a bill with the public option. So I believe we \nare going to have a public option in the bill.\n  So again, as Senator Durbin said, depending on their income, people \nwill take their personal money, adding it to help they get from the \ngovernment, to be able to pay the premiums. Let them decide for \nthemselves. We do not want to tell them they have to go into a \nMedicare-like public option. We do not want to tell them they have to \ngo to Aetna or Cigna or Blue Cross or WellPoint. Give them that chance \nand give them that choice. They can compare on cost. They can compare \nwhat kind of service they get, what kind of illnesses are covered.\n  Then, as Senator Durbin pointed out, one of the things with private \nhealth insurance is that a big part of their profits--and their profits \nhave gown, as have their salaries for the top executives--a big part of \ntheir profits comes from hiring bureaucrats who deny care. They first \ntry not to insure you by invoking a preexisting condition or something \nso you cannot get insurance. They hire a bunch of people to deny you \neven getting the insurance.\n  Then, if you are able to qualify for insurance because you do not \nhave a preexisting condition, and you get sick, then they hire a bunch \nof bureaucrats who process your claim and many times turn you down. \nAbout a third--almost a third--of claims initially are turned down by \nan insurance company. More of them are accepted after you appeal.\n  But, for example, take Judy in Marion, IL, who the Senator just \ntalked about. If she were to have coverage from a private health \ninsurance company--you know how hard people work in hotels, whether \ncleaning rooms or waiting tables, or being at the front desk or \nwhatever they are doing, and doing maintenance work there. They are \nworking so hard. They are very tired at the end of the day, as are most \nAmericans. They file a health care claim that is legitimate. The \ninsurance company tells them no. Then they have to find the time during \nthe work day, if they work when the insurance companies' lines are \nopen, to call and call and call.\n  Some of them call their Congressman or Senator, and we try to help \npeople all the time push the insurance companies. They will talk to us. \nWe are much more likely to be able to help them than they can help \nthemselves when we call in. But why should that be? Why should they \nhave to call their Members of Congress or call Senator Durbin or \nSenator Merkley or me to help fight an insurance company?\n  When people are sick, the last thing they want to do is fight an \ninsurance company to get reimbursed.\n  We know what the President said during the 2008 Presidential race \nabout his own mother, that she was dying from cancer and had to fight \nwith insurance companies. It is simply not the kind of health care \nsystem we should have.\n  I have met so many Judys from Marion, IL, in places such as \nSteubenville and Cambridge and Lima and Findlay, OH, who work so hard \nand cannot get insurance and cannot manage their care, cannot manage \ntheir health. People like that die younger than people who dress like \nthis and have good insurance. People like that so often--Judy has not \nbeen able to take care of her diabetes. My son-in-law has diabetes. He \nwas diagnosed with type I diabetes at the age of 29. That was about 5 \nyears ago. He works for Ohio State. He has a good health care plan. He \ntakes really good care of himself, but he has the support of a health \ncare system to do it. He is in the capital city with great private \nhospitals and public hospitals, with good insurance, but there are so \nmany who can't go to those hospitals unless they are so acutely sick. \nThen they go to the emergency room. Why do we want people with diabetes \nor asthma or a heart condition to wait until they are sick to go to an \nemergency room instead of managing their care?\n\n  Our health care system in this country, as good as it is to so many \npeople who have good insurance, is the worst anywhere. Let me put it \nthis way: We have more people in the hospital who have chronic \nconditions such as diabetes and heart disease and asthma, conditions \nthat one can manage outside a hospital at a much lower cost. In this \ncountry, they are more likely to end up in a hospital than in any other \ncountry in the world, and that is one of the things our legislation \nwill fix.\n  Let me share one last letter, and I appreciate Senator Durbin joining \nus. This is from Deborah from Columbiana County, a county just like \nMarion, IL; a small, rural county; a pretty low-income county, a lot of \njob loss, just south of Youngstown along the Ohio River. Deborah is a \n56-year-old wife of a disabled retiree who suffers from a heart \ncondition, arthritis, and three ruptured discs in his back.\n  Within 1 month of his retirement, the steel company he worked for \nfiled for bankruptcy and went out of business. This left them with a \nreduced monthly pension and the loss of all health care coverage that \nhe worked for 33 years to earn. They went without insurance from 2003 \nuntil he qualified for Social Security disability and Medicare in 2008. \nDeborah doesn't qualify, however, for either Social Security disability \nor Medicare. She has tried to get private health care coverage, but \nthey can't afford the $2,400 to $3,000 a month for premiums.\n  She says:\n\n       My question is this: In the health care reform, will there \n     be a public option that doesn't disqualify me because of my \n     preexisting condition? Will I have to continue trying to \n     purchase coverage from private insurance companies?\n\n  Exactly what Senator Durbin said: You never hear of Medicare denying \nsomebody coverage because of a preexisting condition. We are certainly \nhearing about it from Wellpoint and CIGNA. We certainly hear about it \nfrom other private insurance companies. But we are never going to hear \nabout the public option--once we enact it as part of U.S. law, we are \nnever going to hear about the public option disqualifying people \nbecause of a preexisting condition.\n  So what Deborah wants and needs is the choice. She can choose a \nprivate plan or she can choose the public option. But she can be \nassured the public option will not disqualify her or her husband or \nanybody else with a preexisting condition. She knows even if she gets \nsick and she spends a lot of money for her health care and for \nhospitals and treatments and doctors visits that her insurance would \nnot be cut off because her care costs so much money. That is the beauty \nof the public option. It brings in competition, it keeps prices down, \nand it protects the public from being denied care because of a \npreexisting condition or illness.\n  In the next few weeks, Senator Reid plans to bring this bill to the \nSenate floor. It will include a strong public option with a State opt-\nout, as Senator Durbin said, so if a State such as Arkansas or Nebraska \nor wherever decides this is not for them, they can go and talk to their \nGovernor and to their legislature and they can opt out of it. I don't \nthink very many States will because I think the public option will \nmatter for millions and millions of Americans. I believe hundreds of \nthousands of people in my State will decide they want to be in the \npublic option. But even if they don't, they will understand--people \nwill know their private insurance will be better, it will be a higher \nquality and less cost because of the competition from the public \noption.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I speak with gratitude to Senator Brown \nfrom Ohio who regularly comes to the Senate floor to address this issue \nwhich will be pending soon before the Senate and which may be the most \nimportant issue we will face during our lifetime. So I am glad his \nleadership is demonstrated again this evening on this issue.\n\n\n                             Guantanamo Bay\n\n  When people are asked about our troops on Veterans Day, there is a\n\n[[Page S11375]]\n\nwarm feeling about the sacrifice and courage they show by volunteering \nto serve our country. We were all saddened by the tragedy at Fort Hood. \nWe are saddened to learn that even more soldiers are dying overseas. We \nare worried about the multiple deployments and the conditions they face \noverseas. We are worried, when they come home, to keep our promise to \nthem that they get the medical care they need.\n  One of the issues that relates directly to our troops and their \nsafety is the issue of Guantanamo. Guantanamo is a detention facility \nthat was created by the previous President after 9/11 in an effort to \ntry to gather those we thought were dangerous to the United States and \nother places and hold them safely. That facility was opened and \nexpanded at considerable expense, but, unfortunately, during the course \nof its early history it became controversial, particularly overseas. \nGuantanamo came to symbolize in the minds of many overseas an image of \nthe United States of which they were critical. Whether that was just or \nunjust, it is a fact.\n  As a result, GEN Colin L. Powell, who served as Chairman of our Joint \nChiefs of Staff, as well as Secretary of State under President George \nBush, said--and I paraphrase him--I wouldn't close Guantanamo tomorrow, \nI would close it this afternoon. Similar statements have been made by \nAdmiral Mullen, who is now Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, about \nthe danger that Guantanamo poses as long as it is open. GEN David \nPetraeus, who has served and commanded our troops overseas and knows \nterrorism, as it has stared him in the face, and who has seen its \nresults, has said Guantanamo should be closed. Former President George \nW. Bush on eight different occasions called for the closure of \nGuantanamo. It has been a strongly held position by the former \nPresident and many in his Cabinet, a position shared by many of us in \nCongress, and a position which was the leading position taken by our \nnew President when he was elected earlier this year--the closure of \nGuantanamo.\n  The obvious question was, What do we do with the remaining prisoners? \nSome of them are safe to release; others are not. What happens to those \nwho are not? We have had a debate back and forth on the floor of the \nSenate. The position taken by most on the Republican side of the aisle \nis to oppose the closure of Guantanamo. They oppose the position taken \nby General Powell and General Petraeus and so many others, but that is \ntheir right to do. Many of them have challenged this President, if he \nis going to close Guantanamo, to say what he would do with these \ndetainees.\n  Over the weekend there was a disclosure of a plan the President is \ndeveloping. They have not made a final decision on where these \ndetainees will go, but one of the options they are considering is in my \nhome State of Illinois. It is in a small community called Thomson, IL, \nin Carroll County. You will find it on the northwest corner of our \nState about 50 or 60 miles north of the Quad Cities, Rock Island area, \nabout 50 or 60 miles southwest of Rockford. It is a very rural county. \nIt is a county that has faced enormous difficulties in the past and \nfaces high unemployment today.\n  About 8 or 9 years ago, the State of Illinois built a state-of-the-\nart, maximum security prison in Thomson, IL. It holds 1,600 beds and \nthe latest technology to safely contain the prisoners who were sent \nthere. Then my State fell on hard times and couldn't open the prison, \nand it sat there. The town of Thomson, Carroll County, made \ninfrastructure investments in anticipation of this prison coming and \nnew employment coming to the area. Now, for the last 8 years, they have \npaid the bills on that infrastructure but have had very few jobs at the \nprison.\n  Currently, there are about 100 inmates being held in a minimum \nsecurity setting. The prison has not been utilized as it should be or \ncould be. So the mayor of the town, who is a very good man--we call him \nVillage President back in Illinois--Jerry ``Duke'' Hebeler, wrote a \nletter to me and to Governor Patrick Quinn and to the President and \nsaid: I hope you will consider our empty prison sitting in Thomson, IL, \nas a place for Federal prisoners, including the detainees at \nGuantanamo.\n  Well, I saw this letter and thought that may be the answer. I \nsubmitted the letter to the administration. Governor Quinn hand carried \nit to the President of the United States and asked him to consider the \nThomson facility.\n\n  They are now, as of today, on the ground looking at what they would \ndo to convert this into a Federal prison, but also a prison that would \nhouse the Guantanamo detainees. It is a little complicated because \nunder the Geneva Convention, those who are arrested in war have to be \nheld in a setting separate from the ordinary corrections facilities of \nour government. So the Department of Defense maintains a military \nprison at Guantanamo and would at Thomson as part of that prison \nfacility, but it is separate. It is run by the Department of Defense, \nnot by the Bureau of Prisons.\n  So the idea is to take about one-fourth of the Thomson facility and \nset it aside for the Guantanamo detainees. I don't know the exact \nnumber we would have transferred there, but we are told it would be \nfewer than 100 prisoners. That leaves the rest of the facility with \nover 1,000 beds to alleviate some of the overcrowding we have in \nFederal prisons today.\n  The net result of this would be dramatic in terms of the local \neconomy. It is estimated it would create anywhere between 1,800 to \n3,200 jobs, some 1,800 at the prison itself and others in the community \nfor businesses that would support the prison. The economic activity \nassociated with this new prison is estimated to be over $200 million a \nyear, which means in a 4-year period of time anywhere from $800 million \nto $1 billion will be spent in this community.\n  I need not tell the Presiding Officer, as you reflect on your own \nhome State of Oregon, what it means for a small town in a rural \ncommunity to have that kind of influence of people and spending. Twenty \npercent of the jobs will likely go to people living in Iowa across the \nriver, easily accessible, 80 percent on the Illinois side. That is just \nthe best estimate. But the net result of it would be a positive \ninjection of jobs and economic activity into a very tough environment \neconomically.\n  When we talk about creating jobs, most of us would turn cartwheels as \nSenators and Congressmen to announce 100 jobs coming to any town. The \nnotion of 2,000 to 3,000 jobs coming is unimaginable, and it is a once-\nin-a-lifetime opportunity.\n  Governor Pat Quinn has endorsed it. I have endorsed it as well. We \nare working out the details and getting questions answered to see if we \ncan move forward and do it on a timely basis.\n  Not surprisingly, critics have appeared, some within our own State. \nThe Republican--not all of the Republicans in Congress in our State, \nbut many of them--have held press conferences opposing the sale of the \nThomson prison to the Federal Government. They are entitled to their \npoint of view, and I respect them even though we may disagree. But I \nwill tell my colleagues that several of the arguments they are making \nagainst the use of the Thomson prison are just plain wrong.\n  One of them--I think the overriding argument--is that we should be \nafraid of what it means to bring Guantanamo detainees to the United \nStates, on our soil. What they fail to acknowledge is that currently we \nhave 340 convicted terrorists in America's prisons today, and 35 in the \nState of Illinois, some of them convicted for al-Qaida activities. It \nhas not endangered the people living near those prisons. In fact, they \nmay not even be the most dangerous people in these prisons. The fact \nis, they are there. The idea of bringing in fewer than 100 into the \nThomson prison is not going to change this calculus much, if any. There \nwill still be terrorists held in other prisons in our State, and \nterrorists would be held there, and that is something our prison people \ndo, and do well. The guards and the administrators know how to handle \nthese prisons safely and securely.\n  When this Thomson prison is reconfigured, if it is chosen, it will be \nsafer than any supermax facility in the United States, and there has \nnever been an escapee from a supermax facility. That is a fact.\n  The second argument made by one of the Congressmen is one that is \ntroubling because he said he feared that\n\n[[Page S11376]]\n\nthese detainees would be released into the United States. That \nCongressman should know better. We have passed two bills signed by \nPresident Obama which prohibit releasing detainees from Guantanamo into \nthe United States. It is not going to happen. It shouldn't happen. So \nthat is a fear that should be dispelled.\n  The third argument this Congressman made was that under the rules, \nevery detainee would be entitled to 10 visitors a year, which meant if \nthere is 100 detainees there would be 1,000, as he called them, Islamic \nfollowers, jihad followers, coming into the State of Illinois, landing \nat O'Hare and heading over across our State to the Thomson area.\n  Well, he is just plain wrong. The detainees currently held at \nGuantanamo are not entitled to any visits from family and friends. \nNone. The only visits come from attorneys, their legal counsel, and \nthat rule would still apply at the Thomson prison. So this notion of a \nthousand jihadist visitors coming to Illinois isn't going to happen. It \nwouldn't happen.\n\n  The fourth point that has been raised is one that I really think gets \nto the heart of the issue. It is the argument that if we brought these \ndetainees to the United States and put them in a prison, there would be \nretaliation against the United States.\n  This one Congressman has gone so far as to pinpoint specific \nbuildings in Chicago in which he thinks the terrorists would try to \ndestroy and kill innocent people. I think that kind of designation of \nspecific buildings crosses a line we should not cross. I don't know \nthat it gives ideas to terrorists, but to speak of this so casually is \nwrong. I wish he hadn't said that. Think about what he is arguing. He \nargues that if we capture, prosecute, and incarcerate those who would \nterrorize the United States, we run the risk of retaliation. His \nargument is: Let's not make them mad. Well, I couldn't disagree with \nhim more. As heartbreaking as 9/11 was, after that day we came forward \nwith a determination to tell the world that the United States was going \nto make those responsible answer for the violence of that day and any \nother violence perpetrated upon the United States. That is what we are \ndoing.\n  We have 340 terrorists currently incarcerated across America. The \nfact that we have successfully prosecuted 195 of them since 9/11 says \nwe are going to use our system of justice to bring justice to this \nsituation. If we are going to cower in fear, believing the enforcement \nof our laws and the incarceration of terrorists will provoke more \nterrorism, then we will have lost our way as a nation. We need to show \nthe courage of our convictions to let people know the rule of law will \nbe applied in the United States to all who harm us. That is what this \nincarceration at Thomson would do.\n  I don't know if President Obama will make the final decision to send \nthese detainees to his home State of Illinois. I believe we can work \nwith the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Defense to make \ncertain that they are held safely, that they pay the price for what \nthey have done, and that they are held as long as necessary to avoid \nany danger to people of the United States. We can do this in a humane \nfashion, and we can do it in a professional fashion. We don't have to \napologize or run scared, as some of the critics of this idea are today.\n  In conclusion, I am proud of the people of Carroll County in Thomson, \nIL, for stepping up and realizing they desperately need help \neconomically, seeing a great asset in that community that can be \nutilized to not only serve our State but to serve our Nation and to put \nour best foot forward to show we will apply standards of justice there \nthat are applied across America--standards that are fair, standards \nthat recognize the basic freedoms we hold dear and the system of \njustice we hold dear that says those who are guilty of crime will pay a \nprice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11376-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

If we can clear some of the further amendments that are \nlisted for a vote, I know we will be able to do that. Some of these are \nbeing negotiated at this time. At least we have a way forward.\n  Our staffs have worked very diligently on this since we started this \nbill last Tuesday and, for various reasons, we are going to finish it \ntomorrow, a week later. We could not have done it without a lot of \ncooperation. I thank my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Johnson, and his staff: Christina Evans, Chad \nSchulken, and Andy Vanlandingham. My staff also has ably worked through \nthese. When I was called away to Fort Hood, my chief clerk, Dennis \nBalkham, did a great job with the help of Ben Hammond in our office. I \nappreciate very much all the cooperation and the help we have had \ncoming to this point.\n  I am pleased with our bill. I think we have a good bill that will do \nwhat all of us want, which is to assure that our veterans have the \nhealth care, the benefits, the needed outreach they should have for \ngetting their benefits on a timely basis. This is one of the priorities \nwe are funding in this bill. Secondly, of course, the military \nconstruction part of this bill is going to assure many quality-of-life \nimprovements for our military personnel. Also, we will be building in \nfaraway places where our troops are being housed right now. We want to \ngive them every comfort we possibly can as they are fighting for our \nfreedom.\n  I thank my colleagues and certainly appreciate that we are now moving \ntoward final passage of this bill tomorrow.

Mr. President, on November 16, 1989, six Jesuit \nFathers, their housekeeper, and her daughter were brutally murdered by \nmembers of the Salvadoran Army. The Senate has passed a resolution \nremembering and honoring the lives and work of these individuals, and \ntoday, as we solemnly mark the 20th anniversary of this tragedy, I am \nstruck by the enduring legacy of those who lived and taught their \ncommitment to justice, human rights, and peace in the face of violence \nand oppression.\n  A New York Times article published on November 17, 1989, a day after \ntheir murders, remembered Father Ignacio Ellacuria Bescoetxea as a \nstrong advocate for human rights and a key participant in successful \nnegotiations for the release of the President's daughter in 1985. \nFather Ignacio Martin-Baro was ``a gentle academic type, with an office \noverflowing with books, papers, everything,'' and the editor of a \nwidely distributed scholarly journal. Father Segundo Montes worked to \ncollect data on atrocities committed in El Salvador's war so that, some \nday, justice could be done and victims would not be forgotten. Father \nAmando Lopez was a committed professor of theology and served the \nseminary as its rector. Father Juan Ramon Moreno was the assistant \ndirector of the university's chapel which also served as an auditorium \nfor lectures making relevant church teachings to the situation in El \nSalvador. Father Joaquin Lopez y Lopez was the director in El Salvador \nof Fe y Alegria which organized primary schools for children in the \npoorest neighborhoods.\n  These men put their faith and academic expertise in philosophy, \npolitical science, sociology, economics, and theology to good use. They \nmaintained a distinct hope for an El Salvador at peace, and a country \nthat respected and protected the rights and well-being of all its \npeople--including the very poorest. These teachers were invaluable \neducators not only for their students and fellow Salvadorans, but also \nfor the global community, bringing international attention and \nawareness to the plight of those most deeply affected by the conflict \nin their country. Though tragic, their deaths, and those of their \nhousekeeper, Julia Elba Ramos, and her daughter, Celina Mariset Ramos, \nhelped bring about the negotiations that ultimately led to peace in \n1992, and their work on human rights and social justice is continued \ntoday by many in El Salvador and around the world, including the 28 \nJesuit colleges and universities in the U.S.\n  The civil war is long over, and we witnessed a landmark for democracy \nthis spring as El Salvador hosted its first transfer of power between \npolitical parties in a relatively peaceful and transparent election. \nThe new government faces many challenges, including widespread poverty, \ncrime, and gang violence, and the work of the six priests remains just \nas important today--to address these great challenges, El Salvador must \ncommit itself to the causes of education, justice, and human rights \nthat they championed two decades ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11379-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11379-S11380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for \nNational Adoption Month and the efforts of those individuals who play a \nrole in foster care and the adoption process.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \napproximately 51,000 children are adopted in the United States of \nAmerica each year. This is an encouraging figure and a strong testament \nto the efficacy of child welfare workers and foster care families \naround the country. However, this month also provides us with an \nopportunity to look at the more sobering side of this issue.\n  Currently, more than 130,000 children await adoption in the United \nStates. This figure represents children who do not yet know the safety \nand security of loving parents or a home to call their own. This is a \ndilemma about which we must raise awareness and for which we must find \nsolutions.\n  As a father myself, I can speak for the sacrifices that most parents \nwillingly make for the well-being of their children. I therefore deeply \nadmire and respect those who make these sacrifices for children who are \nnot their own by birth by providing foster homes or by seeking to \nadopt.\n  Many adoptive parents have fought their way through significant \nobstacles in the legal process in order to adopt, and all have taken \nrisks and made sacrifices in their own lives to create a family where \nnone has been before.\n  The theme of this year's effort to raise awareness about the adoption \nof children and youth from foster care, ``You don't have to be perfect \nto be a perfect parent,'' should help serve as a reminder that, \nalthough many would-be adoptive parents feel unequal to the job, they \nhave a great deal to offer these children.\n  There are many ways to adopt, whether through the public foster care \nsystem, domestic adoption through private agencies within the United \nStates, or intercountry adoption, to name a few, and numerous adoption \nagencies and workers stand ready to assist in the process.\n  As a Senator, I have seen the statistics of those children for whom \nno home was made, for whom no parent stepped up to the hard but \nrewarding job of parenting, and while there are encouraging exceptions, \nfigures make it very clear that society has found no replacement for a \nstable home and loving parents.\n  Thus, it is both for the sake of these children and for the welfare \nof our Nation that I encourage adoption as a way to enhance one's own \nlife and the society in which we all live. As I have\n\n[[Page S11380]]\n\nsaid in the past, the act of adoption itself represents the value that \nAmericans place on the worth of each human life, and it is throughout \nthis particular month of the year that we take time to reaffirm this \nsacrificial and rewarding act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11380-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I wish to remember the life of an \nextraordinary resident from my home State of Alaska, Juanita Lou Helms. \nMs. Helms passed away on November 7, 2009, in her hometown of \nFairbanks. She was 68.\n  Ms. Helms was active in local community organizations, politics, and \nmost importantly, was devoted to her husband, their four children, and \ngrandchildren.\n  Juanita began her public service on the borough assembly in 1980, but \nshe is most well known in the community for becoming the Fairbanks \nNorth Star Borough's first female mayor in 1985. During her two terms, \nMayor Helms sheparded the Borough through difficult financial times. As \nan ``open door'' mayor and terrific listener, she inspired the trust \nneeded to find common ground among her constituents.\n  Among her accomplishments was the construction of the community's \nconvention center, improving air quality, and helping thaw the ``ice \ncurtain'' by establishing a sister city relationship with Yakutsk in \nEastern Russia.\n  Away from the political realm, Ms. Helms was involved in innumerable \ncivic endeavors, especially parent-teacher groups in Fairbanks. She \nalso held an assortment of jobs in the community from carhop to court \nclerk to rental property manager.\n  In her personal life Juanita was an avid dancer who was loved by her \nfamily and all who knew her. She and her husband Sam were devoted to \ntheir children Fawn, Selene, Ren, and Karisse. They were so deeply \ninvolved in their lives and those of their many grandchildren that the \nnumber of events they attended and participated in are virtually \ncountless.\n  Juanita will be missed by her family, friends, and all of the people \nshe touched in the State of Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11380-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING ANNIE ASHENFELTER\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of \nAnnie ``Akkuluq'' Ashenfelter. I am saddened to announce with her \npassing on October 8, 2009, the village of White Mountain and the great \nState of Alaska lost an elder of great cultural knowledge, wisdom, and \nlanguage. The magnitude of this loss is better understood by recalling \nthe immense contributions she gave her family, community, and region.\n  Annie was born in White Mountain on January 24, 1913. She spoke \nInupiat as her first language and learned English when she went to \nschool. She completed the third grade.\n  Annie lived a subsistence life, reliant on the land and its resources \nto sustain her family. Annie's steadfast connection to her Inupiat \nidentity ensured her children, grandchildren and her many generations \nto follow would remain grounded in those same cultural roots and \nvalues. Annie loved to go camping and fishing, living off the land, \nspending 90 years of her life sharing this love with her family. She \nenjoyed preparing Native food and sharing what she had with others. \nAnnie was a talented sewer, of both children's clothing and animal \nskins. She made all 10 of her children's clothing: pants, shirts, \nparkies, mukluks, and mittens.\n  Annie was a pillar of her community. She had strength of character, \nembodied knowledge of the land, and symbolized the resilience of the \nInupiat people. Her kind heart has left a permanent mark on the lives \nof countless individuals. Annie was easy to laugh, had good memories, \nand enjoyed the simple things in life: getting up in the morning, \nhaving her morning cup of coffee, sitting at the window and observing \nlife in White Mountain. Annie never had a bad word to say about anyone, \never. Even during the difficult times, she lived her life with grace, \nhumor, love, strength, joy and understanding. Annie was a strong Fish \nRiver Inupiaq woman.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, please join me in honor and remembrance \nof Annie ``Akkuluq'' Ashenfelter, whose love and wisdom will forever be \nin the memories of those who loved and knew her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11380-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO EDEN SUTLEY\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nhonor a very special Louisianian, Eden Sutley, who has served her State \nand Nation with great distinction. Eden is a Lafayette, LA, native who \nis currently a junior at the George Washington University in \nWashington, DC. Just like Louisiana's senior Senator, Eden Sutley is a \nproud member of the Delta Gamma Fraternity.\n  Winston Churchill, one of the great figures of World War II, once \nsaid: ``We make a living by what we do, but we make a life by what we \ngive.''\n  Eden Sutley may not know what she wants to do to earn a living after \ncollege, but her volunteer spirit and desire to give back to the \n``greatest generation'' precisely highlights the sentiment to which Mr. \nChurchill refers.\n  At the urging of her father, 2 years ago Eden became involved with \nLouisiana HonorAir Program. This group, based in Eden's hometown of \nLafayette, honors surviving World War II veterans by giving them an \nopportunity to see the Washington, DC, memorials dedicated to their \nservice. After flying up from Louisiana, the veterans visit the World \nWar II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo Jima memorials and travel to Arlington \nNational Cemetery.\n  Eden Sutley has played an important role during HonorAir's trips to \nWashington, DC. For each visit, Eden organizes about 40 of her sorority \nsisters to come out and assist these World War II heroes. They help by \npushing wheelchairs, taking pictures, and handing out water as these \nLouisiana World War II veterans experience the Nation's Capital, many \nfor the first time.\n  In all, Eden has recruited over 200 sorority sisters to lend a hand \nto our HonorAir veterans. They have volunteered on more than a dozen \nSaturdays since 2007, helping over 1,000 veterans. There have been \nseven different flights this year alone, including the last trip of the \nyear, which occurred October 24.\n  Volunteering with HonorAir to assist the World War II veterans is so \npopular among her fellow Delta Gammas that some sisters come back to \nhelp out even after they have graduated. Eden has also inspired two \nother Louisianians, Terricia Soyombo and Brooke Oschner, who are also \nDelta Gammas at George Washington University, to become part of this \neffort. Through her role as Delta Gamma president at George Washington, \nEden has been instrumental in getting other Greek organizations \ninvolved, as well.\n  Eden has demonstrated a passion for public service that serves as a \nmodel for college students across our great country. On behalf of \nLouisiana HonorAir and our entire State, I thank Eden for her \nleadership, for her willingness to give back, and for inspiring others \nto do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11380-5", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11380-S11381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA WWII VETERANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 97 \nWorld War II veterans from all over Louisiana who travelled to \nWashington, DC, on October 24 to visit the various memorials and \nmonuments that recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable \nservicemembers.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, sponsored this \ntrip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is honoring surviving \nWorld War II Louisiana veterans by giving them an opportunity to see \nthe memorials dedicated to their service. The veterans visited the \nWorld War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iwo Jima memorials. They also \ntravelled to Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n[[Page S11381]]\n\n  This was the last of three flights Louisiana HonorAir made to \nWashington, DC this fall. It is the 20th flight to depart from \nLouisiana, which has sent more HonorAir flights than any other State to \nthe Nation's Capital.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our \nmilitary on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today about 30,000 living WWII veterans, \nand each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory of \nfreedom over tyranny. This HonorAir group had 41 veterans who served in \nthe U.S. Army, 11 in the Army Air Corps, 33 in the Navy, 6 in the \nMarine Corps, 3 in the Merchant Marines, 1 in the Coast Guard, and 2 \nwere a part of Women's Army Corps, WAC.\n  Our heroes, many of them from Southeast Louisiana, trekked the world \nfor their country. They fought in Germany, Holland, France, Italy, \nAfrica, Guam, Bougainville, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, the \nPhilippines, New Guinea, Japan, and Saipan. Their journeys included the \ninvasions of North Africa, Sicily, and Normandy.\n  One of our Army veterans fought on the front lines in Europe and was \nheld as a prisoner of war. Another Army veteran was wounded in Bastogne \nand received a Purple Heart for his service.\n  One Army Air Corps veteran served in 37 combat missions between 1943 \nand 1945 as a B-24 tail gunner. One Army veteran served in Normandy \nduring D-day.\n  Another Army veteran received five battle stars for his service. Yet \nanother one of our Army veterans received a Purple Heart and five \nmedals, including the Bronze Star Medal, for his service in Europe.\n  I am also proud to acknowledge that of the 97 veterans who visited \nWashington this past weekend, two were women who served our country \nwith honor and distinction during World War II.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 97 veterans, all \nLouisiana heroes, who visited Washington. We thank Louisiana HonorAir \nfor making these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11381-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM McCORKLE\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, it is an honor to recognize Dr. \nWilliam McCorkle, who after 52 years of extraordinary service to our \nNation, is retiring from Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL.\n  In the words of Napoleon Bonaparte, ``Victory belongs to the most \npersevering.''\n  Dr. McCorkle is a person who has used his perseverance, \ndetermination, and forthrightness not only to personally succeed in the \nArmy but more importantly to do what is best for our warfighters.\n  A 1950 graduate of the University of Richmond with a bachelor of \nscience degree in Physics and a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of \nTennessee in 1956, Dr. McCorkle came to Redstone in 1957 from a \nposition at Tulane University.\n  Not since Dr. Wernher von Braun has one man done more to promote \nrocket development at Redstone than Dr. McCorkle. Since he joined the \nAviation and Missile Command, Dr. McCorkle has been a pillar in the \naviation and missile research and development fields.\n  As director of the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and \nEngineering Center, Dr. McCorkle is an internationally recognized \nleader in aviation and missile technology, and has been involved in \nvirtually every Army rocket and missile development program since 1956. \nHe helped build the very foundation that has made the U.S. Army's \naviation and missile programs so successful.\n  Dr. McCorkle's efforts have been instrumental in taking engineering \nideas and transforming them into weapon systems. Dr. McCorkle was key \nin the development of the Prototype Integration Facility which has \ntransformed the Army's rapid response capability to meet the needs of \nthe soldier in the battlefield.\n  This facility is on the forefront of providing our servicemembers \nwith quick solutions to critical problems they currently face in \ncombat. Dr. McCorkle's work on this initiative has led to the building \nof a world-class research program at Redstone Arsenal valued at over \n$1.2 billion.\n  More importantly, he has dramatically increased rapid prototyping \nefforts that have led to significant advancements to unmanned aerial \nvehicles at use today in combat.\n  Dr. McCorkle has effectively championed the use and growth of \nunmanned aerial vehicles and the new capabilities that have increased \ntheir value in combat. In conjunction with the Air Force, Dr. \nMcCorkle's team led the development of advanced technology to arm \npredator unmanned aerial vehicles with Hellfire missiles. This program \nis now one of the most successful weapon systems being used today in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  Under Dr. McCorkle's guidance, aviation research has also flourished. \nThe Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center \nis heavily involved in the research and development initiatives behind \nmany of the most utilized Army helicopter programs, including those on \nthe Apache, Black Hawk, and Chinook helicopters.\n  After the rapid development of blue force tracking, a new capability \nthat tracks the location of friendly and hostile military forces, units \noverseas were able to install this technology directly in the field.\n  Continuously, throughout Operation Iraqi Freedom, it was reported \nthat blue force tracking systems were working flawlessly, even allowing \ntroops to fly in formation during sandstorms and brown-out conditions. \nThis is an invaluable advancement for our soldiers and Dr. McCorkle \nensured it was delivered to our servicemembers in the field at a \ncritical time.\n  Dr. McCorkle's work has significantly improved technology development \nand reduced the time to field equipment, ensuring our warfighters are \nthe best equipped fighting force in the world. His work has also \nreduced the cost of these programs for the taxpayer.\n  Under his direction, the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, \nand Engineering Center developed the Department of Defense's Best Value \nEngineering Program, which has consistently achieved 70 percent of the \nArmy Materiel Command's total savings and 30 percent of the \nDepartment's total savings. His Service Life Prediction Program has \nachieved over $8 billion in cost avoidance.\n  Dr. McCorkle has been on the forefront of new technology to provide \nour warfighters with the best equipment and our nation the best defense \nfrom those who wish to threaten us.\n  Under his guidance and leadership, the Aviation and Missile Research, \nDevelopment, and Engineering Center was consistently recognized as an \nArmy Materiel Command Laboratory of Excellence and formally recognized \nas the Army's best laboratory eight times.\n  I thank Dr. McCorkle for his years of service to our Nation, the Army \nand, most importantly, the warfighter. He has been a genuine asset to \nboth the Service and the warfighter.\n  In everything he did, Dr. McCorkle strove for excellence in himself \nand sought to inspire the same in those around him.\n  His leadership, experience, and expertise have advanced our rocket, \nmissile, and aviation programs beyond what was ever imagined when he \nfirst came to work for the Army. I am proud to have worked with Dr. \nMcCorkle for over 30 years, but I am even more honored to call him my \nfriend.\n  Dr. McCorkle, I wish you and your wife Nancy the very best as you \nenjoy your well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11381-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11381-S11382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GORDON J. JONES\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nGordon J. Jones of the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe, who passed away on \nOctober 6. He was a man of great faith in God and had a strong \nconviction to serve his country, State, city, and Santee Sioux tribal \ncommunity in many generous and selfless capacities.\n\n[[Page S11382]]\n\n  After graduating from Oglala Community High School in Pine Ridge, SD, \nGordon joined the Armed Forces and served in the Air Force until his \ndischarge in 1954. Eventually, he returned home to Pine Ridge to work \nas a police officer.\n  Gordon went on to serve the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe in a number \nof leadership positions, including tribal chairman, treasurer, trustee, \nand judge. His knowledgeable and competent abilities remained evident \nthroughout his service in each of these official tribal roles. Gordon \nalso fought for the interests of Indian Country during his time with \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs and as the executive director of the \nFlandreau Santee Sioux Gaming Commission. His leadership and guidance \nwhile with the Commission resulted in greater accountability within \nIndian gaming in the form of the National Indian Gaming Regulations, \nwhich he was instrumental in developing.\n  Gordon's lifelong service to veterans and citizens of South Dakota is \nreflected in his membership in the American Indian Veteran Lodge, the \nAmerican Legion, the Flandreau Bible Church, the Kiwanis, the Shriners, \nand the VFW. Gordon was the longest serving member of the South Dakota \nHuman Rights Commission which he served on from 1985 and resigned in \n2001 due to health issues. He was the legion chaplain for South Dakota \nfrom 1997-1998. This type of active and continuous involvement stands \nas a testament to Gordon's commitment to his community and his fellow \nSouth Dakotans. It is this type of selfless volunteerism which makes \nSouth Dakota truly great.\n  Gordon's opinions and actions influenced policies and decisions at \nall levels of government. His involvement within his local community, \nhis service to his tribe and State, his time in the Armed Forces and \nhis testimony before U.S. congressional leaders all speak to the great \ndevotion and passion which Gordon demonstrated throughout his life. His \nmany accomplishments show the enormous difference a single life can \nhave on so many others. South Dakota is better because of the life and \nefforts of Gordon. This life of active service and involved citizenship \nprovides an example for each of us to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11382-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11382-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11382-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 3962.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to limit \nthe penalty for failure to disclose reportable transactions based on \nresulting tax benefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Today, I am pleased to introduce the Small Business \nPenalty Relief Act of 2009 with my good friend and Ranking Member of \nthe Finance Committee, Chuck Grassley.\n  The bill provides much needed penalty relief to small businesses \nacross America that are being assessed large penalties by the Internal \nRevenue Service because they unknowingly invested in something called a \n``listed tax shelter transaction.''\n  Many of these businesses thought they were putting their money into \nsound investments for the benefit of their employees and learned only \nafter they were audited by the IRS that they instead had invested in \nsomething the IRS considers to be a tax shelter.\n  Most small businesses do not have the resources to pay sophisticated \ntax lawyers and accountants to review all their business decisions. \nThey have to do the best they can on their own. And that is how they \nended up in the middle of a nightmare with the IRS.\n  When a business invests in a listed tax shelter, the law requires \nthat business to attach a form to the tax return telling the IRS about \nthe shelter. If the business doesn't attach the form, it can be subject \nto a penalty of $200,000 per year. If the business has elected \nSubchapter S status, an additional $100,000 penalty applies at the \nindividual level. Total penalties can add up to $300,000 each year. \nMultiply that by several years, and you can easily approach $1 million \nor more in penalties for a tax shelter you didn't even know you had.\n  In the case of many small businesses, the annual tax benefit from \ntheir investment is quite minor--perhaps as small as $15,000. The \n$300,000 penalty plainly is out of whack.\n  Just to be clear, Senator Grassley and I are not soft on tax \nshelters. We spearheaded legislation in 2004 that gave the IRS better \ntools to stop individuals and big companies from cleverly manipulating \nthe tax code to avoid paying the taxes they owed. Our efforts were \nfocused on egregious deals that cheated the U.S. Government out of \nmillions and billions of dollars. Our efforts have made a serious dent \nin the proliferation of abusive tax scams and schemes.\n  But we didn't intend that the 2004 legislation would end up \nthreatening the existence of small businesses in Montana and across \nAmerica, and the livelihoods of their employees who risk losing their \njobs if the business goes under.\n  Small businesses are struggling already. They don't need the added \nand unfair burden of a penalty that can be as much as 20 times larger \nthan the taxes they saved.\n  This bill changes the way the penalty is calculated. The penalty is \nbased on a percentage of the tax benefit resulting from the investment. \nIt is fairer and won't drive these companies out of business.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of our Nation. Particularly in \nthese tough economic times, we must make sure the tax laws reflect the \nimportant role that small business plays in our Nation's economic \nhealth and our citizens' economic security.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2772. A bill to establish a criminal justice reinvestment grant \nprogram to help States and local jurisdictions reduce spending on \ncorrections, control growth in the prison and jail populations, and \nincrease public safety; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am proud today to join Senators \nCornyn and Leahy in introducing the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act \nof 2009, a bill designed to help States and localities approach \nspending on corrections in a more rational manner, better manage growth \nin the prison and jail populations, and increase public safety.\n  Over 2,200,000 American adults are incarcerated in state and local \nprisons and jails; the prison population alone nearly tripled between \n1987 and 2007, from 585,000 to almost 1,600,000 inmates. States, in \nturn, have increased spending on corrections by $40 billion in the past \n20 years. Despite the continued growth of the inmate population, about \nhalf the states plan to cut corrections budgets for fiscal year 2010 \namid budget shortfalls.\n  Most policymakers have limited access to detailed, data-driven \nexplanations about changes in crime, arrests, convictions, and prison \nand jail population trends. The Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act will \nprovide them with the resources to undergo a thorough analysis of the \ndrivers of growth, and to create and implement policy options to manage \nthat growth.\n  Specifically, the legislation will create a two-part grant program \nfor governments to analyze criminal justice trends, develop policy \noptions to address growth in the corrections system, and implement and \nmeasure the impact of the policy changes. Through Phase 1 grants, \ngovernment entities will be able to conduct a comprehensive analysis of \ncorrections data, evaluate the cost-effectiveness of state and local \nspending on corrections, and develop policy options suggested by the \nanalysis. Phase 2 grants will provide funds to help government entities \nimplement those policy options and to measure their effectiveness.\n  Model programs in several states have already found this kind of data \nstudy helpful in managing the costs of a growing inmate population. An \nanalysis of prison data in my home state of Rhode Island, for example, \nprompted legislation to standardize the calculation of earned time \ncredits, establish risk reduction program credits, and require the use \nof risk assessments to inform parole release decisions. In Texas, the \nhome State of one of my cosponsors, Senator Cornyn, the solution was \nmuch different but equally effective--following its analysis, the State \ninvested $227 million on treatment programs and residential facilities \nto curb population growth, which averted spending $523 million on new \nprisons.\n  The Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act will help state and local \ngovernments spend their limited corrections budgets in a more targeted, \nrational way to both manage inmate population growth and protect public \nsafety. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Whitehouse \nand Cornyn in introducing the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act of \n2009. This important bipartisan legislation would help jurisdictions \ncontrol the increased costs facing correctional systems across the \ncountry, while also improving public safety and reducing recidivism.\n  In recent years, Federal and State governments have passed many new \ncriminal laws creating more and longer sentences for more and more \ncrimes. As a former prosecutor, I strongly believe in securing tough \nand appropriate prison sentences for people who break our laws. But \nwhile it is important to ensure that serious crimes result in \nsignificant sentences, we must also work to make our criminal justice \nsystem as effective and efficient as possible. That is why I have long \nchampioned legislation like the Second Chance Act, which helps ensure \nthat when people get out of prison, they enter our communities as \nproductive members of society, so we can start to reverse the dangerous \ncycles of recidivism and violence.\n\n[[Page S11385]]\n\n  We have an obligation to help states cope with overburdened criminal \njustice systems and rising recidivism rates. Over the last twenty \nyears, state spending on corrections has risen from $10 billion to $45 \nbillion a year by some reports, and that number is expected to rise. \nDespite mounting expenditures, recidivism rates remain high, and by \nsome measures have actually worsened. The fastest growing category of \nadmissions to prison is people already under some form of community \nsupervision, such as probation or parole. We must learn how to break \nthis cycle. Fixing this problem will make our communities safer, and we \nmust act quickly because states simply cannot continue to spend these \nenormous sums on corrections, especially in these very difficult \neconomic times.\n  The Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act provides states with the needed \ntechnical and financial resources to help them take key steps to break \nthe cycle of recidivism. By helping states implement data-driven \nstrategies to more effectively manage their correctional systems and to \nreinvest the saving in programs to reduce crime, the bill serves the \ndual purpose of cutting costs and improving public safety. I look \nforward to working with Senators Whitehouse and Cornyn and others to \nensure the passage of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 2773. A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to carry out a \nprogram to support the research, demonstration, and development of \ncommercial applications for offshore wind energy, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nrequires the Secretary of Energy to carry out a program of research, \ndevelopment, demonstration and commercial application to advance \noffshore wind turbine technology. This bill will advance the goal of \nthe Department of Energy to produce 20 percent of our Nation's \nelectricity from wind resources by 2030.\n  Mr. President, 61 percent of U.S. wind resources is in deepwater, \ngreater than 60 meters, 197 feet, depth. Winds at these locations are \nstronger and more consistent than closer to shore or on land. But, it \nwill take technological advances to harness this energy efficiently and \ncost-effectively.\n  This bill will focus national efforts to develop offshore wind \ntechnologies. This should be a national priority because it can produce \nclean, renewable energy for major U.S. population centers. The 28 \ncoastal U.S. States use 78 percent of the electricity in the U.S. For \nexample, Maine's offshore wind resource is close to the 55 million \npeople who live in New England, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. \nThis is 18 percent of the total U.S. population.\n  Developing cost-competitive offshore wind technology will require \nimprovements in the efficiency, reliability, and capacity of offshore \nwind turbines and reductions in the cost of manufacturing, \nconstruction, deployment, generation, and maintenance of offshore wind \nenergy systems. That is why my bill directs the Secretary of Energy to \nsupport existing university centers and establish new centers to \nsupport research, development, demonstration and commercial \napplication. The bill authorizes $50 million annually tbo over 10 years \nfor the design, demonstration, and deployment of advanced wind turbine \nfoundations and support structures, blades, turbine systems, \ncomponents, and supporting land- and water-based infrastructure for \napplication in shallow water, transitional depth, and deep water \noffshore. The bill authorizes full-scale testing and establishment of \nregional demonstrations of offshore wind components and systems to \nvalidate technology and performance; assessments of U.S. offshore wind \nresources, environmental impacts and benefits, siting and permitting \nissues, exclusion zones, and transmission needs for inclusion in a \npublically accessible database; design, demonstration, and deployment \nof integrated sensors, actuators and advanced materials, such as \ncomposite materials; advanced blade manufacturing activity, such as \nautomation, materials, and assembly of large-scale components, to \nstimulate the development of a U.S.-blade manufacturing capacity; \nmethods to assess and mitigate the effects of wind energy systems on \nmarine ecosystems and marine industries; and other research areas as \ndetermined by the Secretary.\n  This bill would support critical renewable energy research that would \nhelp reduce our use of fossil fuels and improve our energy security. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Offshore Wind Energy Research, \nDevelopment, Demonstration and Commercial Application Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2774. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprevent Medicare payments being lost to fraud, waste, or abuse; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 2008, Medicare accounted for about \n$470 billion of the $2 trillion spent on health care in the U.S..\n  Conservative estimates are that as much as $60 billion of that \nMedicare spending is lost to fraud, waste, and abuse each year.\n  News reports today tell us that the Medicare payment error rate for \nfiscal year 2009 is going to be 12.4 percent. To put it in a different \nway, last year, Medicare made 47 billion dollars in improper payments. \n$47 billion of taxpayer money that by all accounts was wasted by \nMedicare on payments that shouldn't have been made.\n  As Medicare spending continues to skyrocket, so will the dollars lost \nto fraud, waste and abuse.\n  That problem is bad enough. But it is even worse because it turns out \nthat a rule in the law today makes it easier for crooks to cheat the \nsystem and steal money from Medicare.\n  A recent 60 Minutes segment highlighted how the law as written \ncontributes to the problem and drives this growing danger to the \nAmerican taxpayer and public coffers.\n  In this segment, we saw a medical supply company that billed \nMedicare, $2 million this past July--despite being empty and having \napparently no staff.\n  Federal agents described the problem as far bigger than the drug \nbusiness in Miami now. They were told it has pushed aside cocaine as \nthe biggest criminal enterprise there.\n  According to those interviewed by 60 Minutes, an entire health care \nfraud industry exists today that is committed to doing nothing except \nfinding ways to rip off the Medicare program.\n  Many of these suppliers don't exist. There is no office that exists \nand nobody who works there. They recruit doctors and patients and use \nstolen patient lists, and do nothing but figure out how to steal from \nMedicare.\n  One man interviewed said he was waking up every day making $20,000-\n$40,000 every day. It was like winning the lottery he said. He was \nrunning a fake medical supply company that didn't actually sell any \nmedical equipment to anyone. He says he stole at least 20 million \ndollars from Medicare. He said it was, quote ``real easy.''\n  All he says he needed was someone pretending to run the office and \nthen he just had to check his bank account every day to see how much \nmoney he had made. All he did was fill out forms to Medicare and in 15 \nto 30 days he would have the money in his bank account.\n  Even more alarming, he says that there are about 2,000 to 3,000 more \nfake medical suppliers just in Miami billing Medicare fake claims.\n  They are able to do this because Federal law puts Medicare in a \nposition of having to ``pay and chase'' health care fraudsters. this is \nbecause federal law requires that Medicare pay providers promptly \nregardless of any risk of fraud, waste, or abuse.\n  The prompt payment requirement in current law requires payment for a \n``clean'' claim within 14 to 30 days. And that is not enough time for \nthe limited number of Medicare auditors to determine if the claim is \nlegitimate before the payment has to be made.\n  The result is that this ``prompt payment rule'' requires that \nMedicare pay fraudsters first, and ask questions later.\n  This requirement in current law doesn't make any sense. I am here \ntoday to introduce a bill to fix it.\n  This legislation, the Fighting Medicare Payment Fraud Act of 2009 \nAct, would provide the government with an important new tool to fight \nfraud, waste and abuse in Medicare. This bill will stop the cycle of \n``paying and chasing.'' This legislation would protect\n\n[[Page S11386]]\n\nFederal taxpayer dollars from being wasted on suspicious payments that \nare required to be made because of the prompt payment rule.\n  Today, the prompt payment rule applies to all payments regardless of \nthe risk that those payments would be to fly-by-night operators. But \nthis legislation ends the policy of pay first and ask questions later.\n  This legislation gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the \nauthority to ask questions first and then and ONLY then to make the \npayment if the health care provider and the payment for services check \nout.\n  This bill accomplishes that by extending the time period in which \npayments must be made under the prompt payment rule in cases where the \nSecretary determines there is a likelihood of fraud, waste or abuse.\n  For categories of providers or suppliers, the payment time period can \nbe extended to up to one year. For individual providers or suppliers, \nthe Secretary would be required to take whatever time is necessary to \nengage in more in-depth reviews to determine that the claims are \nsupposed to be paid in the first place.\n  With this additional time, the Secretary would be required to conduct \nmore detailed reviews of suspicious claims to make sure they are \nsupposed to be paid.\n  This would help ensure that Medicare dollars are in fact going to \nbona fide providers, instead of fraudsters with empty strip mall \nmedical supply companies.\n  Finally, this legislation requires the experts in the Office of \nInspector General to recommend, on at least an annual basis, categories \nof providers or suppliers that warrant additional time before payments \nare made under the prompt payment rule.\n  To make sure there is action on these recommendations, the Secretary \nwould be required to provide a response to the Inspector General on \nthese recommendations.\n  With this new authority to fight health care fraud, the Federal \nGovernment will be in a better position to protect taxpayer dollars and \ncatch health care crooks.\n  Crooks are taking advantage of Medicare's prompt payment requirement. \nThey know they can bill Medicare, get their payment, and be gone before \nthey get caught. And Federal law enables it to happen. That has got to \nend. This legislation takes that step.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Webb):\n  S. 2776. A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to create the \nright business environment for doubling production of clean nuclear \nenergy and other clean energy and to create mini-Manhattan projects for \nclean energy research and development; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Webb of Virginia, the colleague \nof the Presiding Officer, and I are introducing legislation today to \npropose that the United States build its clean energy future upon the \nlessons of the Manhattan Project of World War II. That helped end the \nwar. It was a millions-of-man-hour effort that the New York Times \ncalled ``without doubt, the most concentrated intellectual effort in \nhistory.''\n  Specifically, we will introduce legislation to create the business \nand regulatory environment to double our country's nuclear power \nproduction within 20 years and to launch five mini-Manhattan Projects \nto make advanced clean energy technologies effective and cost-\ncompetitive.\n  The most important thing I can say is that the senior Senator from \nVirginia and the junior Senator from Virginia and I have all talked \nabout this subject before. I think we see there is a great deal of \nconsensus in this body about some steps we can take on clean energy. So \nwhat Senator Webb and I are hoping to do with this framework is to see \non a one-on-one basis whether it is the kind of framework that will \npermit us to work with other Senators who expressed an interest in \nnuclear power and energy research and development. And while we are \ncontending about economy-wide cap and trade, we could move ahead with \nthese steps that have to do with clean energy, clean air, climate \nchange, low-cost, reliable energy.\n  In other words, this is a piece of legislation that you can support \nif you are for an economy-wide cap and trade or if you are against an \neconomy-wide cap and trade. There are some things we can do to help our \ncountry that also help us deal with climate change.\n  In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Senator McKellar, the \nTennessean who chaired the Appropriations Committee, to hide $2 billion \nin the appropriations bill for a secret project to win World War II. \nSenator McKellar replied:\n\n       That should be no problem, Mr. President. I have just one \n     question: Where in Tennessee do you want me to hide it?\n\n  That place in Tennessee turned out to be Oak Ridge, one of the three \nsecret cities that became the principal sites for the Manhattan Project \nthat split the atom and built a bomb before Germany could. Nearly \n200,000 people worked on the project in 30 different sites in 3 \ncountries.\n  President Roosevelt's $2 billion appropriation would be $24 billion \ntoday.\n  After World War II, in 1947, ADM Hyman Rickover came to Oak Ridge for \ntraining that led to the nuclear Navy that helped to defend our country \nfor half a century. Shortly thereafter, in December 1953, President \nEisenhower proposed his Atoms For Peace Program that has grown into the \nworld's most effective supplier of large amounts of reliable, carbon-\nfree, low-cost electricity.\n  The rest of the world has a new interest in this American success \nstory, as countries seek energy independence, clean air, cheap energy \nfor job creation, as well as carbon-free energy to deal with global \nwarming. The Chinese are starting a new nuclear powerplant every 2 or 3 \nmonths. The Japanese obtain a third of their power from nuclear plants \nand build new reactors from start to finish in less than 4 years. \nFrance gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and, as a \nresult, has among the lowest electricity rates and carbon emissions in \nWestern Europe. Russia plans to double its nuclear power capacity. The \nUnited Arab Emirates is planning three new reactors by 2020, and just \nlast week the United Kingdom announced it will build 10. Yet the \ncountry that invented this remarkable technology, the United States of \nAmerica, has not started a new nuclear powerplant in 30 years even \nthough we still get 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity and 19 \npercent of all our electricity from 104 reactors built between 1970 and \n1990.\n  It is true that there are other promising forms of low-carbon and \ncarbon-free renewable energy, but the stark reality is that there is a \nhuge gap between this renewable electricity we would like to have and \nthe reliable, low-cost electricity that a country that uses 25 percent \nof all the energy in the world has to have.\n  Today, despite heavy subsidies, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass \nrenewable energy produce only 3 percent of U.S. electricity. The Energy \nInformation Administration forecasts a 22-percent increase in U.S. \nelectricity demand during the next 20 years. For that much electricity, \nour country simply cannot rely solely on conservation, on windmills and \nsolar panels or even on natural gas. We are fortunate to have a new, \nmassive natural gas set of discoveries in the United States, but a \nnatural gas powerplant still produces about half as much carbon as a \nnew coal plant. And if too many natural gas plants are built, today's \nlow prices could mean high prices tomorrow for farmers, homeowners, and \nmanufacturers.\n  Add to that a recent Nature Conservancy scientific paper that warned \nof a coming renewable energy sprawl, especially from biofuels, biomass, \nand wind turbines, that would consume an area the size of West \nVirginia. A biomass plant, for example, that would produce as much \nelectricity as one nuclear reactor on 1 square mile would require \ncontinuously deforesting an area about 1.5 times the size of the Great \nSmoky National Park. Producing 20 percent of our electricity from 50-\nstory wind turbines, as some have suggested, would require covering an \narea the size of West Virginia and building 19,000 miles of new \ntransmission lines.\n  When these are strung along scenic ridgetops, coastlines, or other \ntreasured landscapes, we will be destroying the environment in the name \nof saving the environment. Solar and wind installations require between \n30 and 270\n\n[[Page S11387]]\n\nsquare miles to duplicate the output of just one nuclear reactor on 1 \nsquare mile. Moreover, these energy sources must be backed up by other \ngeneration since they only produce power when the wind blows or the Sun \nshines, and that electricity cannot be stored in large amounts. There \nis only one wind farm in the entire Southern United States because the \nwind doesn't blow enough. In the Tennessee Valley Authority region, \nsolar costs at least four to five times as much as other electricity \nthat TVA buys.\n  As for green jobs, according to the Department of Energy, there will \nbe 250,000 construction jobs for 100 new nuclear plants. This would \ncompare with 73,000 jobs to construct the 180,000 wind turbines needed \nto produce 20 percent of our electricity from wind. Of course, \nproducing a lot of cheap, reliable energy is the best way to produce \nnew jobs.\n  Think of it this way. If we were going to war, we wouldn't mothball \nour nuclear Navy and start subsidizing sailboats. If climate change, as \nwell as low-cost, reliable energy are national imperatives, we should \nnot stop building nuclear plants and start subsidizing windmills. I am \non the side of those who say we need to deal with climate change. The \nnational academies of 11 industrialized countries, including the United \nStates, have said humans probably have caused most of the recent global \nwarming.\n  If fire chiefs of the same reputation said my house might burn down, \nI would buy fire insurance, but I would buy insurance that worked and \nthat was not so expensive that I couldn't pay my mortgage or my \nhospital bill.\n  Fortunately, there are two steps that will benefit our country in \nmultiple ways--namely, cleaner air; more energy independence; more \nreliable, low-cost power--and will also help fight global warming. The \nfirst is to double production of electricity from carbon-free nuclear \npower, which would mean building 100 new plants as we did between 1970 \nor 1990 or a larger number of the new, small, and modular reactors now \nbeing discussed. The second is to apply to the promising new \ntechnologies, such as the renewable technologies, the same discipline \nand resources we did with the original Manhattan Project in order to \nmake them effective and cost competitive.\n  That is why the bill Senator Webb and I are introducing today, the \nClean Energy Act of 2009, proposes the following: No. 1, loan \nguarantees: $100 billion to encourage startup of all forms of carbon-\nfree electricity production, expanding the $47 billion loan guarantee \nprogram that exists today, and $18 billion of those funds are currently \navailable for nuclear projects.\n  Secretary Chu has suggested it should be in the forties. I believe \nthat number should be closer to the sixties or the seventies. But the \npurpose of this is to get the first few nuclear plants up and running, \nand then the money is paid back. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates this could cost up to $10 billion but might cost much less. \nNew reactor designs, $1 billion over 5 years to enable the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission to review new designs such as the generation 4 \nreactors that don't isolate plutonium and, therefore, help solve the \nused nuclear fuel problems, and small modular reactors that can be \nbuilt in U.S. factories and assembled on site such as LEGO blocks. No. \n3, nuclear workforce, $1 billion over 10 years to ensure a supply of \nnuclear engineers, operators, and craftsmen such as welders and pipe \nfitters. Americans have a generation gap in these skilled personnel. \nNo. 4, more power from existing reactors. This would be $500 million \nover 10 years to increase the efficiency and develop longer lifetimes \nfor our existing 104 reactors. If we did both of these things, we might \ncreate the equivalent production of 20 or 30 more reactors. Then, \nfinally, the five new, what we call mini-Manhattan Projects for clean \nenergy.\n  Here are the five mini-Manhattan Projects: $750 million per year over \n10 years for research and development on, No. 1, carbon capture \nemissions from coal plants. In many ways that is the holy grail of \nenergy R If we can find a way to do that, we can have all of the \nlow-cost, clean electricity we can use. No. 2, develop advanced \nbiofuels from crops that we don't eat; No. 3, improve batteries for \nelectric cars so instead of taking us 100 miles without recharging, \nthey might take us 300 or 400 miles; make solar power more cost \ncompetitive.\n  That has the most promise in terms of renewable energy because we \nhave rooftops on which to put the panels. They just cost too much \ntoday. Then recycling used nuclear fuel in a way that doesn't isolate \nplutonium, that reduces by 99.9 percent the radioactive life of what is \nleft, and by 97 percent the mass we have to deal with. The cost to \ntaxpayers over 20 years would be no more than $20 billion. There would \nbe no new energy taxes or mandates. This $20 billion would compare with \n$170 billion we would spend in taxpayer subsidies, if we were to \nproduce 20 percent of our electricity from wind, not counting the \nbillions more for transmission lines.\n  By my computation, if we actually did build 100 nuclear plants in 20 \nyears, as well as electrify half our cars and trucks in 20 years, which \nwe should be able to do without building one new powerplant if we \nplugged them in at night, we would come close to reaching the 1990 \nKyoto global warming protocols without expensive new energy taxes. \nReaching that goal is even more likely if some of our mini-Manhattan \nProjects produce results we hope for from new technologies.\n  The world nuclear power revival is well underway. With our Clean \nEnergy Act of 2009, that revival might finally reach American shores \nwhere it began. The lessons of the Manhattan Project could advance the \ndays when more nuclear power and new forms of clean energy can make us \nmore energy independent, clean our air, help fight global warming, and \nproduce large amounts of reliable, low-cost, clean electricity that \nwill keep American jobs from going overseas looking for cheap energy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a one-page \nsummary of the Alexander-Webb legislation, called the Clean Energy Act \nof 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Alexander-Webb--Clean Energy Deployment Act of 2009\n\n       To create the business and regulatory environment to double \n     nuclear production in 20 years and establish 5 Mini-Manhattan \n     projects to make advanced clean energy technologies effective \n     and cost-competitive\n       1.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to be cosponsoring this \nlegislation with the senior Senator from Tennessee. This is a strong \nattempt by both of us to go toward the area of problem solving rather \nthan political rhetoric that surrounds a lot of this issue when we \nexamine the pieces of legislation that are before us that are making an \nattempt at solving climate change issues. They are, in some cases, in \ncontradiction to what our energy needs are at large.\n  On the one hand we stopped building nuclear powerplants 30 years ago \nbecause of widespread fears among people who were in the political \nprocess about the technology that was involved. On another level we \nstopped drilling for oil offshore after some incidents, now 40 years \nago. Then on another level, we heard repeatedly that coal was too \ndirty.\n  At the same time we consume more and more energy, rightfully so, \ngiven the productivity of the country and the state of our economy. But \nwe are in contradiction in terms of what we need versus what we fear. I \nbelieve the time has come for us to focus on those areas in terms of \nenergy production that we know are achievable, that we know are safe, \nwhere we know we are good and which also can contribute positively in \nthe area of climate change.\n  We have an enormously complex climate change bill that was passed in \nthe House. We have another enormously complex climate change bill that \nmay be before the Senate. We can't predict whether those bills will \npass. If they do pass, we know there are some detriments. What Senator \nAlexander and I are trying to do on a bipartisan basis, hopefully, with \nthe support of our colleagues, is to put a simple piece of legislation \nforward that will address the areas that are achievable, that can give \nus an end result and get this legislation passed, while all of these \nother issues continue to be examined.\n  Senator Alexander outlined the major points of this legislation. I \nwould like to emphasize a couple. One is that we will be able to \nprovide $100 billion in loan guarantees, but that is not $100 billion \nin money. That is $100 billion in guarantees. It depends on the success \nrate. The basic projection on this is that it will be between 1 and 10 \npercent of that $100 billion that our taxpayers actually would be \nrequired to pay. So we are going to be able to bring at least a dozen \nnuclear powerplants online.\n  When I say ``nuclear powerplants,'' I mean the electrical generation \ncapability of a traditional nuclear powerplant. We may have more than \nthose given the miniaturization of nuclear power that is now underway.\n  We are going to be able to develop a nuclear workforce. Let me stay \non this point for a minute. Senator Alexander was a former Secretary of \nEducation. I have spent all of my life, since I was 18 years old, in \nand around the naval service from which our nuclear power programs \nfirst began. One of the great benefits of the nuclear power program in \nthe United States has been quality individuals whose talents are \nunmatched around the world.\n  I first watched this when I was at the Naval Academy many years ago, \nwhere among the brightest people at the Naval Academy, many were \nselected for the nuclear power program. They went through intensive \ntraining. But also among the enlisted sailors, the quality of the \ntraining was unsurpassed. We would like to see this take place in terms \nof workforce development in the United States.\n  We want to put $100 million a year in over a 10-year period to \ndevelop superb craftsmen as well as nuclear engineers.\n  We are looking at many mini-Manhattan Projects for alternate energy. \nThis doesn't simply narrow the focus to nuclear energy. But we do know \nright now, even though we haven't built a new nuclear powerplant in the \nUnited States for 30 years, that 70 percent of the carbon-free \nelectrical power in the United States comes from nuclear energy.\n  This is a good match for what people are trying to do in the area of \nclimate change. I believe the way we have designed this legislation is \nfocused. I am comfortable with the fact that the expansion of nuclear \npower as an alternate energy is doable. It is reasonable in scope and \nin cost. It will go a long way toward our eventual goal of dramatically \nreducing carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, this is legislation \nthat will be beneficial to our economy, to our national health, to our \nposition around the world.\n  I hope colleagues will join us in moving this legislation forward. We \ncan do it in a timely manner, and we know the results are there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, for his \nleadership. He brings a special knowledge to this because of his \nbackground in the Navy as an engineer and as Secretary of the Navy. \nThousands of our sailors have lived on top of reactors for 50 years \nsafely. This is an idea that has broad support on both sides of the \naisle, I believe. We have gotten so stuck on arguing about the economy-\nwide cap and trade that we have failed to notice the areas where we may \nbe able to agree. We certainly agree on energy research and \ndevelopment.\n  The President has strongly supported that. We certainly agree on \nelectrification of cars and trucks. The President also strongly \nsupports that.\n  I believe there is more agreement on nuclear power than we have seen \nbefore. So we are going to work with Democratic and Republican Senators \nwho have already expressed such an interest and others who may be \nthinking about it over the next few weeks to see if this will form a \nframework for that kind of discussion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2777. A bill to repeal the American Recovery Capital loan program \nof the Small Business Administration; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the current recession has caused \nunemployment to balloon to 10.2 percent and with small businesses \ncreating over \\2/3\\ of all net new jobs, the road to recovery leads \nthrough our Nation's small businesses. For this recovery to occur, we \nmust ensure that our small businesses have access to affordable credit \nso that they can keep their doors open and start hiring some of the \n15.7 million Americans who are currently unemployed.\n  The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship has been \nextremely active on this issue,\n\n[[Page S11389]]\n\nand I thank Chair Landrieu for her leadership. The Committee has held a \nseries of hearings on the credit crunch, to explore topics from \nalternative sources of credit to what policies government can enact \nthat will help small businesses create jobs and weather this recession. \nIn these hearings, the one constant message we have heard is that small \nbusinesses need access to capital. This message is borne out by the \nmost recent Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey which \nshows that banks continue to tighten access to credit for small \nbusinesses--and have since the start of this recession.\n  To help small businesses access credit I have introduced two bills, \nthe 10 Steps for a Main Street Economic Recovery Act, and the Next \nSteps for a Main Street Economic Recovery Act, which contain provisions \nthat would reduce fees for small business borrowers and lenders, allow \nrefinancing of 7(a) and 504 loans; create a lender platform to give \nsmall business borrowers more lending options, and to increase the \nmaximum amount borrowers can take out in 7(a), 504, and microloan loan \nsizes to give small businesses who have capital needs in excess of the \nSmall Business Administration's current loan sizes more borrowing \noptions.\n  Many of the key provisions of my 10 steps bill were included in the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARRA, most notably, fee \nreduction for 7(a) and 504 loans. This provision, along with increasing \nthe guarantee rate on 7(a) loans to 90 percent, has been credited with \nincreasing small business lending by over 70 percent since the passage \nof the ARRA. I was also pleased that President Obama recently announced \nhis support for the loan limit increases in my Next Steps bill as a \npart of his plan to expand access to capital for small businesses.\n  These provisions have helped cushion the shock of the credit crisis \nfor small business borrowers; however, I am concerned with one \nprovision which has not lived up to its initial promise.\n  The American Recovery Capital, ARC, loan program was included in the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act as a result of a combined effort \nfrom both the Chairs and the Ranking Members of the House and Senate \nwith the laudable goal of extending a lifeline to small business \nborrowers. The program allowed viable small businesses that were having \ndifficulty paying their existing debts to access a 100 percent SBA-\nguaranteed bank loan to repay these debts. These small business \nborrowers would receive payments for up to 6 months, and then have a 1-\nyear grace period before repayments on their ARC loan began.\n  However, since its implementation in June, the ARC loan program has \nbeen plagued with difficulties, most notably, the Office of Management \nand Budget has estimated that based on the underwriting requirements \nput forth by the administration, 60 percent of borrowers utilizing this \nprogram may default on their loans.\n  The ARC program was intended to assist viable small businesses that \nwill be able to repay the loan, not to add additional debt to those who \nwill not. Proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars demands that we put a \nstop to any Federal program which does not achieve its stated goals. \nARC loans are one such program. My legislation immediately suspends the \nARC loan program and returns all unobligated funds back to the \nTreasury.\n  We must ensure that above all else, taxpayer funds are protected.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Works and Economic Development \nAct of 1965 to reauthorize that Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am joining some of my colleagues \nfrom the Environment and Public Works Committee in introducing a bill \nto reauthorize the Economic Development Administration, EDA. EDA works \nwith partners in economically distressed communities to create wealth \nand minimize poverty by promoting favorable business environments to \nattract private investment and encourage long-term economic growth.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of EDA. I believe the agency does \nan outstanding job of providing relatively small grants that help \nsecure significant amounts of private investment in distressed \ncommunities across the country. Contrary to what some people would say, \nthe government itself does not--frankly, cannot--expand the economy and \ncreate long-term jobs. That is the role of the private sector.\n  What the government can do, however, is help provide the right \nconditions for private sector investments to flourish. EDA does this in \na myriad of ways, but primarily through infrastructure investments. I \nonly wish more of the so-called ``stimulus'' bill enacted earlier this \nyear had been dedicated to programs like EDA that are truly successful \nat spurring economic development.\n  Unlike the majority of the spending in the so-called ``stimulus'' \nbill, EDA investments actually provide economic benefits. In fact, \nstudies show that EDA uses federal dollars efficiently and effectively, \ncreating and retaining long-term jobs at an average cost that is among \nthe lowest in government.\n  In my home State of Oklahoma, for example, EDA has worked long and \nhard with many communities in need to bring in private capital \ninvestment and jobs. Durant, Clinton, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Seminole, \nElk City, Muskogee, Woodward, Shawnee, Claremore, Miami and Elgin are \njust some of the Oklahoma communities that have made good use of EDA \nassistance. In fact, over the past seven years, EDA grants awarded in \nmy home state have resulted in more than 9,000 jobs being created. With \nan investment of about $33 million, we have leveraged another 32.7 \nmillion in State and local dollars and more than 625 million in private \nsector dollars. I would call that a wonderful success story.\n  Authorization of FDA's programs expired on September 30, 2008. I had \nintroduced a reauthorization bill in July, 2008, and the EPW Committee \nreported a bipartisan bill in September 2008. Unfortunately the bill \nwas not enacted. I again introduced my own reauthorization bill in \nFebruary of this year. Today I am happy to join my colleagues in \nintroducing a similar bill that I hope will be approved by the \nCommittee and the full Senate in the very near future. Particularly in \nthese difficult economic times, we should be doing all we can to ensure \nthe continuation of successful economic development programs, and EDA \nreauthorization is an important step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/16/senate-section/article/S11389-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11389-S11390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2781.
