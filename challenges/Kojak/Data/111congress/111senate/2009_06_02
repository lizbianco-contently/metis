Mr. President, yesterday I noted that all of us wish \nto reform health care but that we need to do so without sacrificing \nwhat Americans like about our current system. They like the freedom, \nthey like the choice, they like the quality of care, they like the \noptions, and they like the efficiency. I also noted that the kind of \ngovernment takeover of health care that some of our Democratic friends \nare contemplating could lead to a decline in every one of those things. \nThis morning, I wish to explain in a little greater detail how it could \nhappen.\n  The first point I wish to make is that the very concept of a \ngovernment option is itself misleading. What starts out as an option \ncould quickly become the only option. This is clear to anyone who \nrealizes that, unlike market-based health plans, any government-run \nplan would have unlimited access to taxpayer money and could use that \nmoney to subsidize the cost of services, and artificially lower prices \nwould make the government-run plan more attractive to individuals and \nbusinesses. Some say this could be avoided by creating ``safeguards'' \nto ensure a level playing field for the market-based insurers and a \ngovernment plan. But no safeguard could create a truly level playing \nfield, and any safeguard could easily be eliminated once a government \nplan is enacted. A government plan would also be able to operate at a \nloss--a loss the taxpayers would have to cover one way or another.\n  Government could also keep health care costs artificially low by \npaying providers less than private insurers do, just as it already does \nwith both Medicare and Medicaid. At first blush, that\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\nmay actually sound appealing, but as we know, there is no such thing as \na free lunch. Let me explain.\n  Right now, doctors and hospitals make up the difference between what \na procedure costs and what the government is willing to pay for it by \npassing those costs on to private insurers. But doctors and hospitals \nwould likely get even less under a new government health plan, so they \nwould shift even more costs on to private insurers, who would then \nraise rates for individuals and businesses even higher than they were \nbefore. Once these higher rates take effect, employers would be all but \ncertain to start encouraging workers to enroll in the government-run \nplan.\n  As a result of all of this, it is easy to see how private market \nhealth plans would become more and more expensive and thus less and \nless affordable and accessible. At some point, private health plans \nwould likely be crowded out altogether, and government care would be \nthe only option left. That is where the delays and the denied care \nwould begin to kick in. Under a government system, Americans would have \nno choice but to accept all the bureaucratic hassles and the endless \ntime spent on hold waiting for a government service representative to \ntake their calls. They would also have to deal with all of the \nrestrictions of care that inevitably follow. What is being advertised \nas an option will eventually lead to delays--delays in testing, delays \nin diagnosis, and delays in treatment.\n  So the question Americans need to ask themselves is whether this is \nthe reform they really want. Do we really want a government takeover of \nhealth care, because that is what a so-called government option would \nlead to in very short order. Americans need to realize that when \nsomeone says ``government option,'' what could really occur is a \ngovernment takeover that soon could lead to government bureaucrats \ndenying and delaying care and telling Americans what kind of care they \ncan have.\n  The irony in all of this is that as a result of a government takeover \nof health care, the private plans tens of millions of Americans \ncurrently enjoy will eventually only be available to just a very few \nwealthy Americans--to those who are able to pay for more health care \nthan they currently have and like. According to a recent study, 119 \nmillion Americans would lose the private coverage they currently have \nas a consequence of a government plan. The best options would only \nremain available to a select few.\n  Over the last few months, we have seen government getting involved in \nvirtually every aspect of our economy. Washington is suddenly running \nthe banks and the auto companies. Now it is thinking about running \nAmerica's health care. The results, I am afraid, would not lead to the \nkinds of reforms Americans really want in their health care. Instead, \nit would lead to a system that most Americans would deeply regret.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5912-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 97, the \nnomination of Hillary Chandler Tompkins to be Solicitor of the \nDepartment of the Interior; that the nomination be confirmed; that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that no further motions be \nin order; that any statements related to the nomination be printed in \nthe Record; that upon confirmation, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill have to object, I would just say to my friend from New Mexico, we \nhave not been able to get that nomination cleared yet on this side, but \nwe will be consulting with the Republican colleagues and at some point \nlet him know whether it is possible to go forward. Therefore, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me briefly describe the \ncircumstances that caused me to make this unanimous-consent request. I \nam obviously disappointed there has been an objection raised to the \nconfirmation of Ms. Tompkins. I am advised that one or more Republican \nMembers have placed an anonymous hold on her nomination.\n  The Solicitor of the Department of the Interior--the office to which \nthe President has nominated Ms. Tompkins--is one of the most important \nposts in the Department of the Interior and one of the most important \nlegal positions in our government. The Department of the Interior has \nbroad authority over the administration and care of our public lands \nand natural resources. Its many offices and bureaus face daily a broad \nrange of legal issues requiring special expertise in public land law, \nmining law, water rights law, Indian law, and wildlife law. The \nSolicitor is the Department's general counsel. She is solely \nresponsible for the legal work of the Department. By law, all the legal \nwork of the Department is performed under the supervision and direction \nof the Solicitor. She is responsible for the interpretation and \napplication of the legal authority affecting all of the actions taken \nunder the Department of the Interior's programs and operations.\n  The job requires a deep knowledge of the law, professional \nexperience, and sound judgment. In my view, the President has nominated \nsuch a person--a person with demonstrated ability and stature in this \nfield in the person of Hillary Tompkins. She earned a law degree at \nStanford University Law School in 1996. She served as a trial attorney \nin the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Department of \nJustice, as a special Assistant U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, as an \nassociate in Sonosky Chambers, one of the Nation's leading law firms \nspecializing in Native American law, as chief counsel to the Governor \nof New Mexico, and as an adjunct law professor at the University of New \nMexico Law School.\n  As chief counsel to Governor Bill Richardson, Ms. Tompkins \ndemonstrated her ability to lead and manage a team of lawyers, to \noversee the general counsels of multiple agencies, and to render sound \nlegal advice and counsel.\n  She will bring to the Solicitor's office considerable expertise in \nthe areas of environmental, natural resources, water, and Indian law, \nas well as experience in the areas of constitutional law, \nadministrative law, and the legislative process.\n  In addition, Ms. Tompkins has a compelling personal story. She was \nborn on the Navajo reservation, and although she was raised in New \nJersey, she has not lost touch with her Navajo heritage. If confirmed, \nshe will be the first Native American, and only the second woman, to \nhold the office of Solicitor.\n  It is unclear to me why anyone would object to confirming Ms. \nTompkins. She is clearly well qualified for the position. At her \nhearing in April and in the weeks since then, Senators on the other \nside of the aisle have expressed their concerns about departmental \npolicies, over which Ms. Tompkins has had no control and no \nresponsibility. Secretary Salazar has bent over backwards to address \nthose concerns, and it is my understanding all of those concerns now \nhave been addressed.\n  In any event, Senators had chosen to place holds on David Hayes's \nnomination to be the Deputy Secretary of the Interior, rather than on \nMs. Tompkins' nomination, pending resolution of their concerns. The \nholds on Mr. Hayes's nomination were lifted before the recess, and he \nand all of the other Department of the Interior nominees have now been \nconfirmed. Only Ms. Tompkins' nomination is still being blocked.\n  Many of the most pressing problems facing the Department of the \nInterior\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\nare legal ones. During its final weeks, the previous administration \ntook a number of controversial actions. In its rush to lock in those \nactions before it left office, the previous administration failed to \ngive adequate consideration to various legal requirements. As a result, \nseveral of those actions have been overturned by the courts.\n  Secretary Salazar has inherited this legacy and is doing his best to \naddress these problems. But he needs a Solicitor. More than 4 months \ninto the new administration, the Department of the Interior should not \nstill be without its top legal officer. And Ms. Tompkins should not \nstill be the victim of anonymous holds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5913-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEATH OF ANASTASIOS ``TASS'' HATJIKIRIAKOS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my concerns \nregarding the nomination of Regina McCarthy to be the Administrator for \nthe Office of Air and Radiation in the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  For the past few weeks, I have been seeking responses from the \nnominee and the administration on their efforts to use the Clean Air \nAct to regulate climate change.\n  I have put a hold on her because I have serious concerns about the \nEPA using the Clean Air Act to regulate climate change.\n  I want to know the plan that the nominee will implement. I want to \nknow how she will protect businesses, farms, hospitals, and nursing \nhomes from the effects of the EPA's endangerment finding.\n  As you know, the endangerment finding designates CO2 as a \nharmful pollutant to public health under the Clean Air Act.\n  The finding's effects on the Clean Air Act will require EPA to \nregulate any building, structure, facility or installation that emits \nmore than 250 tons of a CO2 in a year.\n  The result would be thousands of lost jobs, with no environmental \nbenefit to show for it.\n  Hospitals, schools, farms, commercial building and nursing homes will \nbe required to obtain preconstruction permits for their activities. EPA \nsays this will not occur, that they will use discretion and good \njudgment.\n  According to legal scholars, the statutory language in the Clean Air \nAct is mandatory and does not leave any room for EPA to exercise \ndiscretion or create exceptions.\n  The only jobs that will be created are in law firms as the litigation \nbonanza begins. EPA will be sued by environmental groups wanting to \neliminate exempted sectors. The EPA will also be sued by industries not \nexempted.\n  It will, as Democrat Congressman John Dingell stated, be a glorious \nmess.\n  I have nothing personal against Mrs. McCarthy. I simply wanted an \nanswer to a question, the same question Americans all across our \ncountry want answered: How are you going to protect them?\n  I still do not have a credible answer to this question. I am tired of \nthe stonewalling.\n  Mrs. McCarthy believes that she can not answer the question until she \nis confirmed by the Senate. That answer, I believe, is not good enough.\n  She has also stated that she wanted to be informed of any potential \nlawsuit. She stated she wanted to discuss the issue with the litigants \nin the hopes of convincing them not to sue.\n  Government officials can't go around the country trying to convince \nevery litigant, whether it be a national environmental group or a local \ngroup, not to sue.\n  I have also posed this same question to the EPA Administrator in the \nhopes that she could provide EPA's plan on behalf of Ms. McCarthy.\n  EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson says that she can target what she \nregulates. She claims she will only target cars and trucks.\n  That is setting the precedent of picking winners and losers. We do \nnot know what standards will be applied to make those decisions. We do \nnot know what role politics will play in these decisions.\n  Administrator Jackson's statement also ignores the regulatory cascade \nthat the endangerment finding and the motor vehicle emission standards \nwill certainly trigger.\n  Litigators and courts will drive much of this job-killing regulation.\n  We have a nominee to head up the EPA's Air Office, Ms. Regina \nMcCarthy. We have an Administrator of the EPA and we have a climate and \nenergy czar who is supposed to coordinate climate change policy for the \nadministration.\n  Carol Browner, the climate and energy czar has not been confirmed by \nCongress. We do not know who is developing a roadmap for how to use the \nClean Air Act to regulate climate change.\n  What jobs in what industries will be kept? Which industries will be \npenalized? Who will be held accountable for making these decisions?\n  The economic consequences of the ticking timebomb will be \ndevastating.\n  By the EPA's own estimate, the typical preconstruction permit in 2007 \ncost each applicant $125,000 and 866 hours to obtain.\n  Ranchers or private nursing homes have no background in this area. \nThey will need to hire lawyers. They will need to hire experts. They \nwill be taking time out of their day to figure out all this redtape.\n  This will create such a fog of uncertainty with investors and small \nbusinesses. This makes small businesses even riskier to lend money to; \nnobody will know how much this will cost their business.\n  With lending having already ground to a halt, this is hardly the \nright move to help our economy.\n  According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, there are 1.2 million \nschools, hospitals, nursing homes, farms, small businesses, and other \ncommercial entities that would be vulnerable to new controls, \nmonitoring, paperwork, and litigation.\n  If even 1 percent of the 1.2 million have to get preconstruction \npermits, that would mean 12,000 new preconstruction permits a year.\n  By the EPA's own analysis, if permitting is increased by just two to \nthree thousand, this would impose ``significant new costs and an \nadministrative burden on permitting authorities.''\n  According to the EPA, this ``could overwhelm permitting \nauthorities.''\n  The net result of all of this will be thousands of jobs lost.\n  As I have stated previously on the floor, if the administration can \nnot tell us by what legal authority they can pick winners and losers, \nif the administration can not provide economic certainty to lenders and \nbusinesses, if the administration does not know how they will deal with \nall the thousands of new preconstruction permits, they should take this \njob killing option off the table.\n  There appears to be such a frenzy of political pressure from special \ninterests to pass something on climate change.\n  The pressure has reached the point where enacting any climate change \npolicy before Copenhagen is more important than addressing its \naftermath.\n  The thinking is, just get something done on climate change. We will \ndeal with the impacts later.\n  That's not how you make good policy.\n  But that is exactly what is going on here.\n  The President's own attorneys, from a host of Federal agencies, have \nexpressed concerns with this approach.\n  Their concerns were contained in a memo.\n  This memo is a well thought out, scientific and legal critique of \nusing the Clean Air Act to regulate climate change by the Obama \nadministration.\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\n  It confirms the fears of every small business owner, every farmer, \nschool and hospital administrator, both large and small, that the Obama \nadministration knows that using the Clean Air Act to regulate climate \nchange is bad for America.\n  They know it, but for political reasons, they have ignored the \nscience, the consequences to our economy and the impact to the American \npeople.\n  The memo states, ``Making the decision to regulate CO2 \nunder the Clean Air Act for the first time is likely to have serious \neconomic consequences for regulated entities throughout the U.S. \neconomy, including small businesses and small communities. Should EPA \nlater extend this finding to stationary sources, small businesses and \ninstitutions would be subject to costly regulatory programs.''\n  The document also highlights that EPA undertook no ``systemic risk \nanalysis or cost-benefit analysis'' in making their endangerment \nfinding.\n  The White House legal brief questions the link between the EPA's \nscientific technical endangerment proposal and the EPA's political \nsummary.\n  EPA Administrator Jackson said in the endangerment summary that \n``scientific findings in totality point to compelling evidence of \nhuman-induced climate change, and that serious risks and potential \nimpacts to public health and welfare have been clearly identified . . \n.''\n  But the Obama administration's memo states that this is not accurate.\n  The memo actually questions the science behind designating \nCO2 as a health threat stating the scientific data on which \nthe agency relies are ``almost exclusively from non-EPA sources.''\n  The memo goes on to say the essential behaviors of greenhouse gases \nare ``not well determined'' and ``not well understood.''\n  This memo confirms that the administration has so far ignored its own \nadvice.\n  What is somewhat surprising is that those who express these concerns \nare ridiculed or, even worse, attacked by administration officials.\n  In one instance, attempts were made by administration personnel to \nsmear the reputation of a career employee at the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  This was a person who offered a reasonable and thoughtful critique of \nthe impact the endangerment finding has on small business.\n  This is unacceptable behavior by the administration.\n  Strangely enough, not just the authors of the Obama administration \nlegal brief, but also environmental groups, disagree with EPA \nAdministrator Jackson's position that a targeted approach under the \nClean Air Act is legal and appropriate.\n  The Sierra Club's chief climate counsel stated last year that ``the \nClean Air Act has language in there that is kind of all or nothing if \nCO2 gets regulated and it could be unbelievably complicated \nand administratively nightmarish.''\n  I have warned the administration that groups such as these will sue \nthe EPA if the EPA does not capture both large and small emitters. She \nhas dismissed such threats. This is despite the Wall Street Journal \nreport last month that a representative of the Center of Biological \nDiversity stated her group is prepared to sue for regulation of smaller \nemitters, such as farms, schools, hospitals, and nursing homes, if the \nEPA stops at simply the large emitters.\n  I have asked for a plan from the administration on how she will \naddress losing court cases if the agency is sued for picking winners \nand losers. Her response in a committee hearing 3 weeks ago is she \ncould not share with me any such plans in that forum.\n  I have posed the question to the administration: If you can't share \ninformation with the elected representatives of the 50 States, then in \nwhat forum, if not a Senate hearing, can you share the information?\n  I am confident the majority believes they have a strong chance at \npassing something along the lines of the Waxman-Markey bill this \nCongress regarding climate change. They are hopeful they can get \nsomething to the President for him to sign. If hope alone could pass \nlegislation, we could all adjourn early. But hope is not certainty. The \nnegative effects of the endangerment finding on the American economy is \ncertain.\n  The bottom line is that the nominee, as well as Lisa Jackson and the \nadministration, appears to have no credible plan to use the Clean Air \nAct in a way to regulate climate change.\n  There is only one responsible choice for us to make. Let us take this \nregulatory ticking timebomb off the table. This is why I plan to \nintroduce a bill very soon that will take the Clean Air Act out of the \nbusiness of regulating climate change.\n  I wish to give every Member an opportunity to join me in giving the \nSenate and the American people the time we need to forge a sound energy \nand climate strategy, a strategy that makes energy as clean as we can--\nand I am talking about American energy--as clean as we can, as fast as \nwe can, without raising energy prices for American families.\n  Let's develop all of our energy resources--our wind, our solar, our \ngeothermal, hydro, clean coal, nuclear, and natural gas. We need an \n``all of the above'' strategy to address our Nation's needs. As Lisa \nJackson, the EPA Director, stated on a recent trip to my home State of \nWyoming, ``As a home of wind, coal, and natural gas, Wyoming is at the \nheart of America's energy future.'' That is because Wyoming has it \nall--coal, wind, natural gas, oil, and uranium for nuclear power. We \nhave it all, and we need it all. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues, as well as Ms. Jackson, to make that happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5914-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5914-S5916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              EPA POLICIES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak about Regina McCarthy's \nnomination but not about the nominee or her qualifications. Rather, I \nwill highlight a few concerns I have with the EPA and the burdens being \nplaced on those in rural areas and agriculture because of EPA actions.\n  A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of joining President Obama for \nlunch. While the purpose of the lunch was to discuss health care \nreform, I took the opportunity to bring up a few concerns I have with \nEPA and agriculture. In particular, I raised four issues where EPA \npolicies are causing tremendous concern and are burdening family \nfarmers. The issues I raised to the President are indirect land use \nattributed to biofuels; second, fugitive dust; three, greenhouse gases \nand livestock producers; and, four, point source pollution permits.\n  Since that meeting with the President, I have had follow-on meetings \nwith Nancy Sutley, chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and \nalso the President's legislative staff. They heard me out. They seemed \nsympathetic to the concerns I raised. However, I am not sure the \nmessage is being relayed to the EPA bureaucrats.\n  The first issue pertains to a component of the new Renewable Fuels \nStandard that requires various biofuels to meet specified lifecycle \ngreenhouse gas emission reductions. The law specifies that lifecycle \ngreenhouse gas emissions are to include direct emissions and \nsignificant indirect emissions from indirect land use.\n  In the proposed rule changes released by EPA last week, they rely on \nincomplete science and inaccurate assumptions to penalize U.S. biofuels \nfor so-called indirect land-use changes. The fact is, measuring \nindirect emissions of greenhouse gases is far from a perfect science. \nThere is a great deal of complexity and uncertainty surrounding this \nissue. Because of this uncertainty, the EPA has committed to an open \nand transparent review by the public.\n  The EPA compiled a system of models to analyze land-use impacts of \nU.S. biofuels policies. They have indicated that these models have been \npeer reviewed and that they stand up to scientific scrutiny. That is \ntrue for the models independently, but--and a big but--it is not true \nfor the way the EPA has overlaid and integrated their models. In \naddition, the models are not publicly accessible. There is inadequate \ndata in how the models and data have integrated.\n  As it stands, stakeholders are unable to replicate the EPA's results. \nSo this process is neither open nor is it transparent.\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\n  Under the EPA's analysis, ethanol produced from corn reduces \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 16 percent compared to gasoline. However, \nif you remove the murky science of emissions from indirect land-use \nchanges, corn ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 61 percent \ncompared to the gasoline. So one can see that sound science plays a \nvery important role in whether ethanol is more environmentally positive \nor less environmentally positive.\n  The EPA's models conclude that international land use contributes \nmore in greenhouse gases than the entire direct emissions of ethanol \nproduction and use--from the growing of their crops, the production of \nethanol at the refinery, up to and including tailpipe emissions. The \nripple effects are greater than the direct effects. Wouldn't you think \nyou ought to take more into consideration for the direct effects? The \nfact is, the model the EPA has cobbled together to measure indirect \nland use is far from scientific. It is more like a guess.\n  The rule indicates that itself by including the word ``uncertainty.'' \nUnderstand, this is an EPA rule that talks about the science of \nindirect land-use calculation, and it uses the word ``uncertainty'' \nmore than 60 times.\n  Even larger in this debate is the role of common sense. It defies \nlogic that the EPA would try to blame a farmer in my State of Iowa for \nthe actions of farmers or developers in Brazil. Do they think \nBrazilians are waiting to see what I am going to plant on my farm, for \ninstance, before they plant their crops in Brazil? It does not pass the \ncommonsense test. The facts do not support it either.\n  During the past 5 years, when biodiesel and ethanol production in the \nUnited States ramped up, Brazilian soybean acres decreased and corn \nacres remained unchanged. See, there is no relationship.\n  Amazon deforestation has also fallen in the past 5 years. A recent \nstudy indicated that the primary reason for land clearing was for \ntimber production and land grabbing, followed by cattle farming, not \nbecause of ethanol production in the United States. So nowhere on the \nlist--we are talking about a list from a study--was U.S. biofuel \nproduction.\n  I think this debate comes down to a few simple questions: Do we want \nmore production of green fuels or less production? Do we want greater \ndependency on Iran and Venezuela for energy needs or less dependence? \nDo we want to increase our national security by reducing foreign \ndependence on energy?\n  I don't think the people at EPA get the big picture, and I am pretty \nsure they don't understand how American agriculture works. While the \nEPA's actions have a significant impact on the rural economy and the \nagriculture industry, it is clear the EPA has a lack of understanding \nof American agriculture. I know this to be the case regarding the \nindirect land use.\n  Margo Oge, the Director of the office in charge of this rule, \nadmitted during a committee hearing in the House of Representatives \nlast month that she has never been on a farm in the United States. How \ncan regulators with such a great impact on the agricultural industry \nhave so little understanding of the industry they are regulating? We \nneed to encourage some commonsense thinking in EPA. So I have invited \nAdministrator Lisa Jackson and a number of EPA officials to come to \nIowa to visit a farm, to see firsthand how the agricultural industry \nworks.\n  I have also invited Regina McCarthy, who should be confirmed by the \nSenate today. She will be Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air \nand Radiation. I have also invited Margo Oge, the Director I referred \nto, the Director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, the \noffice that wrote these regulations on indirect land-use changes.\n  Another issue I brought up with the President that I am concerned \nabout is EPA's attempt to regulate particulate matter.\n  In 2007, the EPA published the ``Clean Air Fine Particle \nImplementation Rule'' in which the EPA inappropriately opted for the \nadministrative convenience of regulating all particles that fall within \nthe fine PM size range the same, including dust.\n  Instead they should have appropriately based the regulation on \nparticle composition.\n  Essentially, this rule treats dust as though it were cigarette smoke, \ncausing the same adverse health issues.\n  There are no scientific studies that show this to be the fact. \nControlling dust from combining soybeans, gravel roads, and feedlots is \nimpossible.\n  When it comes to a rule in the EPA that you have to keep dust on your \nfarm within the property lines of your farm, think how nonsensical that \napproach is. Only God determines when the wind blows and only God \ndetermines when soybeans have 13 percent moisture and they have to be \nharvested immediately. We cannot make decisions based on EPA rules of \nwhen the wind blows or doesn't. God makes that decision.\n  Compliance with the more stringent fine PM standard will be \nunattainable for many farmers and ranchers.\n  The fine PM standard is health-based and must be met at the property \nline of each individual operation regardless of cost.\n  This could essentially require farmers to sell some of their cattle, \ncombine wet crops, or wall in their roads and driveways.\n  This would be a ridiculous way to regulate agriculture.\n  The next concern I have with the EPA is their decision not to appeal \na Sixth Circuit decision which vacated an EPA rule that exempted \npesticides applied under the Clean Water Act.\n  The EPA rule in question had exempted pesticides applied near or into \nwaters of the United States from obtaining permits when applied in \naccordance with the Federal Insecticide Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.\n  In vacating the rule, the court issued an opinion declaring that \nagricultural sprayers and nozzles are point-source conveyances and that \nall residues and excesses of chemical pesticides that remain in water \nafter the beneficial use is completed are ``pollutants'' under the \nClean Water Act.\n  I share concerns of many who represent agricultural states as to how \nthe EPA is going to implement the new permitting process without \ncreating a burden on our farmers.\n  Producers could face legal liability if a permit is not issued \nquickly, yet the farmer needs to spray immediately.\n  I urge the EPA to draft a flexible rule that does not impede a \nproducer's ability to apply pesticides and allows emergency application \nto be done expeditiously.\n  If they don't, we are going to have major problems on our farms when \nbugs, weeds, and disease show up.\n  The final issue is related to some of Senator Barrasso's concerns \nwith the nominee we are considering. That is, the direction the EPA is \nheading toward regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.\n  While this could have wide ranging, unforeseen effects on all sorts \nof small businesses, I want to talk about how agriculture could be \naffected.\n  The Clean Air Act was designed for more traditional types of \npollution that can have a direct negative effect on human health and \nthe environment in relatively small quantities.\n  Given the emissions thresholds in the law, a family farm cattle \noperation, for example, could be considered an emitter just like a \nfactory smokestack, with all the red tape and costs that entails.\n  And, at the end of the day, how are you going to get cows to stop \npassing gas?\n  Nancy Sutley assured me that EPA has no desire to regulate livestock \nemissions in this way.\n  However, Senator Barrasso raises some good points about what would \nhappen should environmental groups follow through on their threats to \nsue EPA to force them to regulate sources as small as family farms.\n  Rather than rely on EPA's assurances, I would like these questions \nanswered before EPA goes any further down this road.\n  I am hoping that a visit to the heartland will help them better \nunderstand the real world implications of some of their decisions.\n  They owe it to the hardworking farmers and ranchers to get a better \nunderstanding of how U.S. agriculture works.\n  Hopefully, they will realize a little common sense will go a long way \nwhen making broad policy decisions that affect the farmers who put food \non their table.\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about an agreement we have \nreached with Senator Rockefeller regarding today's planned \nconsideration of the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act. Before \ndescribing our agreement, I would like to say a few words about this \nlegislation.\n  We believe this legislation is essential to restoring competition to \nthe Nation's crucial freight railroad sector. Freight railroads are \nessential to shipping a myriad of vital goods--everything from coal \nused to generate electricity to grain used for basic foodstuffs. But \nfor decades, the freight railroads have been insulated from the normal \nrules of competition followed by almost all other parts of our economy \nbecause of their outmoded and unwarranted antitrust exemptions. Our \nlegislation is designed to eliminate the obsolete antitrust exemptions \nthat protect freight railroads from competition.\n  This bipartisan legislation has 11 cosponsors, including members of \nboth the Judiciary Committee and Commerce Committee, and was reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee on a unanimous 14-to-0 vote in March.\n  The railroad industry's obsolete antitrust exemptions resulted in \nhigher prices to millions of consumers every day. Consolidation in the \nrailroad industry in recent years has resulted in only four class I \nrailroads providing nearly 90 percent of the Nation's freight rail \ntransportation. Three decades ago, by contrast, there were 42 class I \nrailroads. A 2006 GAO report found shippers in many geographic areas \n``may be paying excessive rates due to a lack of competition in these \nmarkets.''\n  The ill-advised effects of these consolidations are exemplified by \nthe high prices paid by captive shippers; namely, industries served by \nonly one railroad. A recent study by the Consumer Federation of America \nfound that rail shipping rates for captive shippers are $3 billion \nhigher than they would be if the market were competitive. These \nunjustified cost increases cause consumers to suffer higher electricity \nbills because a utility must pay for the high cost of transporting \ncoal, results in higher prices for goods produced by manufacturers who \nrely on railroads to transport raw materials, reduces earnings for \nAmerican farmers who ship their products by rail, and raises food \nprices paid by consumers.\n\n  Repeal of the railroad antitrust exemption is supported by the \nattorneys general of 20 States and a wide range of consumer \norganizations and leading industry trade organizations, including the \nAmerican Public Power Association, the American Chemistry Council, the \nNational Farmers Union, the American Corn Growers Association, and the \nNational Industrial Transportation League, as well as many more.\n  Once their outmoded antitrust exemptions are removed, railroads will \nbe subject to the same laws as the rest of the economy. Government \nantitrust enforcers will finally have the tools to prevent \nanticompetitive transactions and practices by railroads. Likewise, \nprivate parties will be able to utilize the antitrust laws to deter \nanticompetitive conduct and to seek redress for their grievances. On \nthe Antitrust Subcommittee, we have seen that in industry after \nindustry, vigorous application of our Nation's antitrust laws is the \nbest way to eliminate barriers to competition, to end monopolistic \nbehavior, and to keep prices low and quality of service high. The \nrailroad industry is no different. All those who rely on railroads to \nship their products deserve the full application of the antitrust laws \nto end the anticompetitive abuses all too prevalent in this industry \ntoday.\n  That is why I am so pleased by the agreement that I have reached \ntoday with Senator Rockefeller. He has agreed to include this necessary \nrepeal of the railroads' unwarranted antitrust exemption in his \ncomprehensive bill to reform the freight rail industry and the Surface \nTransportation Board when that bill is introduced in the coming weeks. \nSenator Rockefeller has also agreed that his comprehensive rail reform \nbill will address a specific railroad practice that is of great concern \nto me--a practice known as paper barriers. He has pledged that his \nlegislation will give the STB enhanced power to address this issue so \nthat shippers are not denied the benefit of competition in relation to \nthese arrangements. With this agreement, we have avoided a potentially \ndivisive floor debate and we have the solid support of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee for repealing the \nantitrust exemption and addressing paper barriers.\n  I thank my friend from West Virginia for his compromise as well as \nhis support for the need to reform the freight rail system in the \nUnited States in the interest of all parties, including rail shippers \nand consumers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, I look forward to the Senate's vote this morning on \nthe confirmation of Regina McCarthy to be Assistant Administrator of \nthe Office of Air and Radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency. \nI am happy to report to the Senate that my ranking member, Senator \nInhofe, supports her as well, and he wanted to make that point.\n  The Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation plays a crucial \nrole in developing and improving programs that better protect public \nhealth and the environment, and she also will help address critical \nthreats to our families and our communities. Regina McCarthy is very \nqualified to be Assistant Administrator. She comes to this position \nwith a stellar record of achievement. During her hearing before the \nEPW, she impressed us all with her deep firsthand knowledge of clean \nair policy. She has three decades of experience in public service. She \nhas a unique record of accomplishments in addressing air pollution at \nthe State level in Massachusetts as well as Connecticut.\n  Here is the thing: She will bring a spirit of bipartisanship to this \ncritical EPA office that is focused on protecting public health and the \nenvironment. In Massachusetts, Regina McCarthy served under Governors \nCellucci and Romney, both Republicans. She served as Assistant \nSecretary for Policy at the Office of Environmental Protection and \nDeputy Secretary of the Office of Commonwealth Development. In 2005, \nRepublican Governor Jodi Rell of Connecticut--another Republican--\nappointed Regina to be Commissioner of Connecticut's Department of \nEnvironment. So Regina's ability to work with people on both sides of \nthe aisle is clear. She wants to solve the serious air pollution \nproblems facing our families and communities, and I believe her \nexperience in a bipartisan world will greatly help her.\n  California faces some of the most dangerous air pollution in the \ncountry. My State is a magnificent State, but it has its problems \nbecause we have the busiest ports in the Nation. We actually are \nresponsible for taking care of 40 percent of the Nation's imports, and \nthose goods are brought into our ports by ships that, unfortunately, \nstill use--many of them--a highly polluting fuel called bunker fuel. \nAnd when we look at the rates of cancer across this Nation, you see \nclusters of cancer at all of our ports, and a lot certainly at our \nports in California.\n  I worry very much about those families. We have been able to work in \na bipartisan way--although not quickly enough, in my view--to make sure \nthat these ships get away from this bunker fuel, and actually we are \nworking very hard with the Obama administration, as we did with the \nBush administration, on international treaties to move us away from \nthis very polluting bunker fuel. So we are making great progress there, \nbut we still have a lot of the trucks at our ports. We are working \nclosely with, in this case, Los\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\nAngeles, where they have a very cutting edge program to move away from \nthe dirty trucks, and we are fighting hard to get that program to move \nforward.\n  So we look at the ports and we know there are problems, and we look \nat the highways, and we know there are problems. In my State, and other \nStates, where we have valleys, the dirty air is trapped into those \nareas. So as a Senator from California, I welcome Regina McCarthy to \nthis job, because, frankly, we need to do much more about the quality \nof the air, or lack of same, across the country.\n  The California Air Resources Board estimates that diesel emissions \ncontribute to 2,000 premature deaths each year, and that the health \ncosts of diesel emissions are billions of dollars each year. So I want \nto say again, we are talking about 2,000 premature deaths each year \nwhen we talk about dirty air. We are not just saying we are upset \nbecause you can start to see the air and it looks terrible; we are \nsaying that this dirty air is being breathed in by our kids, by our \ngrandkids, by pregnant women, by people with disabilities, and only the \nstrongest survive on this. So we know it is a problem, and Regina \nMcCarthy gets it. Her job isn't to be a robot, her job is to understand \nthat the situation is dire here--2,000 premature deaths a year because \nof dirty air. And that is just from diesel emissions. So we need an \nassistant administrator on air who has the experience, the expertise, \nand the ability to work with communities large and small, to work with \nindustry, and to work with government to find lasting solutions.\n  One of the opportunities we have here, separate and apart from the \nenforcement of the Clean Air Act--which will be under her domain--is to \npass global warming legislation which will move us away from the dirty \nsources of fuel toward clean energy and, by the way, create long-\nlasting clean energy jobs which will stay here and boost our economy \nforward.\n  We have a lot of work ahead of us on this committee which I am so \nprivileged to chair, and certainly right here in the Senate, and we are \ngoing to call on Regina McCarthy. She is well qualified, she has the \nability to work with communities and industry, and she is the right \nperson for this job.\n  I am disappointed that we had a colleague of ours hold her nomination \nup, you know, week after week after week. It should have been done. But \ntoday it looks good that we are moving forward. I hope we can do it by \nvoice vote, and again I want to point out that in terms of Regina \nMcCarthy's nomination, Senator Inhofe, the ranking member on the \ncommittee, supports her for this job, as do I. And I think that is the \nbest thing I could say for a nominee, because oftentimes we find \nourselves at loggerheads. But in this case, we are together.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, I urge approval of her, and I hope we \ncan do this by voice vote.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I have had the \nopportunity to work with and get to know Ms. McCarthy during her tenure \nas the commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Environmental \nProtection. Ms. McCarthy has worked tirelessly to make Connecticut's \nair, land and water cleaner, which in turn has made Connecticut the \nwonderful place it is today to live, work and raise a family.\n  Among her achievements, I would like to highlight Ms. McCarthy's \npioneering work to address climate change in New England. She is widely \nrecognized as a chief engineer of the very successful Regional \nGreenhouse Gas Initiative. Since her appointment in 2004, Ms. McCarthy \nhas worked to dramatically improve Connecticut's environment. She has \nrestored and defended the integrity of many of Connecticut's most \ncherished natural treasures. She devoted herself to protecting Long \nIsland Sound, a source of nourishment and recreation to the millions \nwho live and work along its coastline. As commissioner, Ms. McCarthy \ndevised strategies for dealing with our State's solid waste, and she \nworked to improve Connecticut's air quality. She also made great \nstrides to reinvigorate our parks and open spaces.\n  Gina arrived in Connecticut with a wealth of experience after holding \na number of health and environmental positions in Massachusetts at the \nlocal, State and Federal levels. She worked for the Stoughton Board of \nHealth and Conservation, Massachusetts' Hazardous Waste Facility Site \nSafety Council, the Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Program and the \nNew England Governor's Environment Committee. Ms. McCarthy also served \nas the under secretary of policy at the Massachusetts Executive Office \nof Environmental Affairs and as the deputy secretary of operations to \nthe Office for Commonwealth Development where she oversaw the \ndevelopment and implementation of Massachusetts' first Climate \nProtection Action Plan.\n  We have been lucky to have Gina in Connecticut and I am excited that \nthe entire country will now benefit from her talents at the EPA. In her \nnew position, Ms. McCarthy will be responsible for developing national \nprograms, technical policies and regulations to control air pollution \nand prevent exposure to radiation. She will continue her work to \naddress climate change and improve energy efficiency--a double charge \nthat is both timely and imperative to the continued health of our \nplanet. She will also develop strategies to reduce industrial and \nvehicle-generated air pollution as she works to improve indoor and \noutdoor air quality. I am excited to have someone of Ms. McCarthy's \ncharacter and credentials leading these essential efforts and I am \nfilled with confidence in her ability to address them productively.\n  I strongly support the nomination of Gina McCarthy to head the EPA's \nOffice of Air and Radiation and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of \nRegina McCarthy to be Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation at \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. I would also like to thank \nChairman Boxer and the members of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for their support of this excellent and deserving nominee. \nWhile I think it is regrettable that her confirmation was delayed for \nso long, I am glad that she will soon be able to get to work on finding \nsolutions to the many important environmental issues facing our nation.\n  I congratulate President Obama on nominating such a remarkably \nqualified, energetic, and passionate individual to serve as Assistant \nAdministrator. Commissioner McCarthy has 25 years of experience working \nat all levels of local and State government and has a depth and breadth \nof knowledge on environmental issues that few can rival. She has also \nserved under both Democratic and Republican Governors, in Massachusetts \nas well as my home State of Connecticut. In both States and in all \ncapacities, Gina has been universally recognized as a uniquely talented \nenvironmental advocate.\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\n  As commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Environmental \nProtection since 2004, Gina has amassed an impressive record of \naccomplishments. She spearheaded the ``No Child Left Inside'' \ninitiative in Connecticut and nationwide, which combines environmental \neducation with numerous outdoor programs to promote physical activity \nwhile teaching kids to become good stewards of the environment. She has \nalso been a key proponent of sustainable economic development in \nConnecticut, has worked tirelessly to reinvigorate our State park \nsystem, and has been a terrific advocate for open space and \nconservation initiatives.\n  Perhaps most prominently, Commissioner McCarthy was one of the \ndriving forces behind the creation of the Regional Greenhouse Gas \nInitiative, RGGI, the Nation's first mandatory cap and trade program, \nwhich was adopted by 10 States in the Northeast to address the grave \nthreat of climate change. The commissioner's work on the issue of \nclimate change has been recognized and lauded nationally, and her \nexperience will be invaluable when she is confirmed as Assistant \nAdministrator for Air and Radiation. President Obama has made it clear \nthat addressing climate change is a top priority for his \nadministration, and as Assistant Administrator, Gina will play a vital \nrole in developing and implementing policies to control greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  In my view, this incredible list of accomplishments does not do \njustice to the qualities Gina will bring to her new position once she \nis confirmed. Across my State she has a well-deserved reputation for \nher boundless energy, incredible passion and determination, and \nwillingness to speak frankly in order to address challenges head on.\n  Indeed, she has made such an enormous impact that on March 14, the \nHartford Courant ran an editorial entitled ``DEP Chief Gina McCarthy a \nHard Act to Follow,'' which praised both her passion for the issues and \nher pragmatic approach. The Courant specifically noted her ability to \nrevitalize a department which had lost the public's trust and engage \npeople across the State in preserving Connecticut's landscape and Long \nIsland Sound.\n  Once again, I congratulate Gina McCarthy and strongly urge all my \ncolleagues to support her nomination. Connecticut's loss is a win for \nour Nation. And, while we are sad to see her leave Connecticut, I am \nconfident that Gina will continue to be the outstanding advocate for \nthe environment and public health she has always been and I look \nforward to working with her in her new capacity at the EPA.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of Regina McCarthy, of \nMassachusetts, to be an Assistant Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nmotion to reconsider is laid upon the table, and the President will be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5918-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

All we are voting on today is whether we \nare going to get to debate, not whether we are going to have FDA \nregulation of tobacco. But if this vote does not get 60 votes, we will \nnot have the opportunity in this Congress to see whether we can take \nreal steps to curb tobacco use.\n  Whether you are for this bill or against it, I urge you to support \ncloture on the motion to proceed. We cannot get to substantive \namendments and improvements to the bill until we have cloture on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  I will have a number of amendments to improve this bill and fight the \nscourge of tobacco use and its deadly health consequences. In order to \nget to offer my amendments, I will support cloture on the motion to \nproceed, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent, the mandatory \nquorum call has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 1256, the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 84, the nays are \n11. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 982, the Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the matter that is before \nthe Senate. This bill would give the Food and Drug Administration the \nauthority to regulate the tobacco industry and put in place the tough \nprotections for families that for too long have been absent when it \ncomes to how cigarettes are marketed to our youngest citizens--our \nchildren.\n  This is an issue that many in this Chamber have worked on for a long \ntime. For those who have been here for some time, this issue is not a \nnew issue. It has been before the Congress now for over a decade, and \nfor various reasons along the way--the other body has adopted this bill \nor we have adopted the bill but not at the same time the other Chamber \nhas; the committees have acted but never in the same year or in the \nsame Congress--so we have had sort of a disjointed process that has \nnever brought the other Chamber and this one together around the \nimportance of this legislation.\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\n  So once again we are here, this time I think with the greatest \nopportunity to do something I believe most Members--I cannot believe \nanyone in this Chamber could be adverse to the notion we ought to do \neverything in our power to limit the 3,000 to 4,000 children who every \nday--every single day--begin smoking in the United States.\n  Madam President, 400,000 of our fellow citizens die every year \nbecause of smoking-related illnesses. We are about to begin, in a few \nweeks, a debate on health care. One of the major provisions of that \neffort will be in the area of prevention. There are a lot of divisions \nI suppose about how we ought to proceed with health care, but as I have \nlistened over the last number of months to our colleagues talk about \nhealth care reform, one issue--one issue--enjoys almost unanimous \nsupport; and that is, what can we do to reduce chronic illness in the \ncountry? How do we do a better job of having a health care system, not \na sick care system? How do we prevent people from acquiring or \ncontracting these illnesses that are so debilitating and so costly? One \nof them is, obviously, smoking-related illnesses and the 400,000 who \ndie every year.\n\n  The one certain way is to try to limit the number of people who begin \nsmoking every day; that is, our youngest citizens, our children. That \nis what this bill is all about. It comes down to simply that. We will \nhave a long debate about various provisions in this bill, but in the \nfinal analysis, we will have to decide in the coming day or two \nwhether, for the first time--the very first time--the Food and Drug \nAdministration of our Nation will have the power and the capability to \nregulate tobacco products and begin to restrain--to restrain--the 3,000 \nto 4,000 who begin smoking every single day. So even in the 2 or 3 days \nwe will debate this bill, keep in mind that during those 2 or 3 days, \nclose to 10,000 children will begin smoking, 1,000 of whom will become \naddicted every day, and of that 1,000, anywhere from 300 to 500 will \ndie. I have 76,000 children in my small State of Connecticut today who \nare going to die because of smoking-related illnesses, because they are \nalready hooked and addicted to tobacco products. So there are a lot of \nthings we debate and discuss and there is a lot of rhetoric and talk \nabout protecting our children and protecting families, but here is an \nopportunity we have, as Democrats and Republicans coming together in \ncommon cause, to make a difference for literally millions of people in \nour country for years and years and years to come.\n  When the Supreme Court struck down the FDA's tobacco rule in 2000, it \nbecame very clear that legislation was going to be necessary in order \nto protect our children and the public health from deadly tobacco \nproducts. Eight years ago, I introduced comprehensive children's \nlegislation that included, with the help of my good friend Senator \nHarkin, the Kids Deserve Freedom From Tobacco Act to give the authority \nto the FDA over these products. In the 108th Congress, our colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, who has been a champion on this issue--who has been \nthe leader and champion on this issue for literally years and years and \nyears, Senator Kennedy, and who is the major sponsor, by the way, of \nthis legislation--was able to take this issue to the next level. He \nworked out a bipartisan bill called the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act with our colleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine, \nRepresentatives Henry Waxman, and Tom Davis of the other body and the \nother party, and other members of the HELP Committee on a bipartisan \nbasis. The bill we consider today is virtually the same legislation \nthat Senator Kennedy and Senator Mike DeWine, Henry Waxman and Tom \nDavis worked on before. It has a long history, having passed each \nChamber, but never at the same time.\n  So allow me to share a little of that history with my colleagues as \nwe enter this debate. In July of 2004, the Senate voted 78 to 15 to add \nit as an amendment to another bill; that is, this tobacco bill. \nUnfortunately, the language was removed in conference between the House \nand the Senate. Three months later, Senators Kennedy and DeWine \nreintroduced the legislation and it was passed by unanimous consent, \nbut the other body did not consider it at that time. Refusing to give \nup, of course, as he always does--he never gives up--Senator Kennedy \nreintroduced the bill in the 109th and the 110th Congresses. In August \nof 2007, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, on which \nSenator Enzi and I serve, reported out this bill by a vote of 13 to 8. \nIn July of 2008, the House passed a very similar bill by a margin of \n326 to 102. Although the Senate version had 60 cosponsors, there was \nnot enough time left in that year for the Senate to pass the House-\npassed legislation.\n  On April 2 of this year, the other body--the House--once again passed \nits version of this legislation, with very minor changes, by an \noverwhelming vote of 298 to 112.\n  The point I wish to make to my colleagues is simply this: Over the \nyears, this bill has been reviewed, it has been vetted, it has been \ndebated over and over. I think all of us, I would hope, agree that the \ntime has come to act with uniformity in both Chambers, with the \nPresident committed to this issue to protect our Nation's children and \npass this legislation into law.\n  Frankly, we can't afford to wait any longer. Every day, as I \nmentioned at the outset of these remarks, another 3,500 to 4,000 \nchildren are ensnared by tobacco companies that target them with \nimpunity as they try smoking for the first time--every single day. One \nthousand of these children who will start today--that close to 4,000 \nacross our country--will be addicted probably for life as smokers, and \na third of that number will eventually die--if not more--from smoking-\nrelated diseases.\n  The tobacco industry is well aware of these numbers. They know that \nif they can't bring children into the process, then they won't have any \nmore smokers. If you lose 400,000 people a year who lose their lives \nfrom smoking-related illnesses, then you have to replenish those \nnumbers somehow. You can't lose 400,000 people every year, year after \nyear, from smoking-related illnesses and not replenish the numbers. How \ndo you do it? You do it by drawing in children, by getting kids to \nstart smoking. That is why they have been so successful. When you get \n3,000 to 4,000 every day--every day starting--40,000 in a 10-day \nperiod, then do the math yourself and you see what happens very \nquickly. You begin to replenish those numbers. If a quarter of that \nnumber remains addicted for life, you make up that 400,000 rather \nquickly and that doesn't include, by the way, the foreign sales of \ntobacco products. That is just right here in our country.\n  I would suspect that if you have been a smoker or are a smoker--and \nlet me say in truth in everything, I was a smoker and I know how \ndifficult it is to give up tobacco products. Anyone who tells you it is \neasy doesn't know what they are talking about. It is hard. It is \ndifficult. It is extremely difficult. But even people who smoke, I will \ntell my colleagues, the one thing they pray every day is that their \nchildren will not begin it. In fact, I suspect some of the strongest \nadvocates of this legislation are the people who have been hooked on \ntobacco products and they would tell you that the one thing they pray \nand hope is that their children don't become addicted to this product \nbecause they know how damaging it is. They know what it does to them. \nThey know the potential harm to themselves and to their families. So \nthis is not an issue, in my view, that ought to cause any division \namong parents and family members when it comes to what happens to their \nchildren.\n  Tobacco companies, as I say, are well aware of all of this. Almost 90 \npercent of smokers begin as children, and that is an astonishing \nfigure. Equally astonishing is the fact that smoking kills more \nAmericans every year than alcohol, AIDS, car accidents, illegal drug \nuse, murders, and suicides combined. Take all of those causes of death \nin our Nation, combine all of them, and they don't equal the number of \npeople who lose their lives as a result of tobacco-related illnesses.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, more than one in five high school \nstudents smokes. Every year, 15,000 children in my State try cigarettes \nfor the fist time and another 4,600 become regular smokers. Absent \naction from our Congress, of course, more than 6 million children who \nare alive today will die from smoking, including the 76,000 I mentioned \nin my small State of Connecticut. This ought to be entirely \nunacceptable to all of us.\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\n  Here we are soon to begin a debate, as I said a few minutes ago, on \nhealth care, with the common cause of trying to create a health care \nsystem, not a sick care system, where prevention is going to be a major \nfocus of our attention. I can't think of a more significant step we \ncould take on the eve of dealing with the health care debate than \nhaving this Congress stand up with an overwhelming vote and say we are \ngoing to begin an effort here to reduce that 90 percent who end up \nbeginning smoking over a lifetime--that is our children--and that is \nwhat this bill is designed to do.\n  If ever there was a moral obligation to act, I think it is at this \nmoment. No one suggests that any law is going to stop every child--of \ncourse it won't--from lighting a cigarette or beginning that process. \nObviously, parents have to do their part in educating their children, \nas do others. But we shouldn't be making it harder on them than it \nalready is, which is precisely what we are doing every second that we \nfail to act on a bill such as this.\n\n  So the purpose of this historic public health legislation is very \nsimple: It is to protect our children and give them a longer, healthier \nfuture--the future they deserve. It will give the Food and Drug \nAdministration the authority to prevent the sale and marketing of \ntobacco to children, require changes to cigarettes to make them less \nharmful, and protect the public health, and to prevent tobacco \ncompanies from using misleading marketing practices to encourage \ntobacco use. It would accomplish this by prohibiting outdoor \nadvertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground. Parents ought \nnot to live in fear that their children are being marketed cigarettes \nwhen they are at school every day. It would limit advertising in \npublications with significant youth readership to a black-on-white, \ntext-only format; no pictures, mascots, or other eye-catching logos. It \nwould restrict promotions that appeal to children and adolescents, and \nstop illegal sales of tobacco products to children and adolescents. \nLastly, it would prohibit tobacco product vending machines except in \nadult-only facilities.\n  For this first time, the bill would regulate tobacco products, \nrequiring all tobacco product manufacturers to register with the Food \nand Drug Administration and to provide that agency with a detailed \nproduct list. The legislation would assess user fees on manufacturers \nto pay for the cost of the FDA tobacco regulation. And it would mandate \nlarger and far more informative health warnings on tobacco products, \nincluding prohibiting misleading terms such as ``light'' and ``mild'' \non products that offer no health benefits whatsoever, and instead are \nintended to kill.\n  This bill is supported by over 1,000 organizations, including every \nmajor public health group in the United States: the Campaign for \nTobacco Free Children, the American Cancer Society, the American Lung \nAssociation, the American Heart Association, and many others. Thirty \nnational faith organizations and over 800 State and local organizations \nsupport this bill. In addition, former Secretaries of Health and Human \nServices, both Democrats and Republicans, including Tommy Thompson and \nDonna Shalala; former Surgeon Generals, Republicans and Democrats, \nDavid Satcher and Richard Carmona; David Kessler, the former FDA \nCommissioner; and Julie Gerberding, the former CDC Director, have all \nexpressed their support of the legislation now before us.\n  In its 2007 report, ``Ending the Tobacco Problem: A Blueprint for the \nNation,'' the Institute of Medicine urged Congress to: ``Confer upon \nthe Food and Drug Administration broad regulatory authority over the \nmanufacture, distribution, marketing and use of tobacco products.''\n  That is precisely what we give them in this bill. It deals with the \nmanufacture, the distribution, and the marketing of tobacco products, \nparticularly to our children.\n  Again, I hope my colleagues will gather behind this.\n  Lastly, let me say we would not be here on the cusp of winning this \nfight without the tireless efforts of our committee chairman, Senator \nTed Kennedy of Massachusetts, who has made the public health the cause \nof his lifetime. It has been his passion over the past 40 years that he \nhas been involved in his public career. This bill is but one more \nexample of good policy he has shepherded through the Congress which \nputs children and their families and the public first. All of us ought \nto thank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  Passing this bill will be a historic victory for our Nation's \nchildren--protecting children from aggressive marketing by tobacco \ncompanies and establishing sound manufacturing practices of tobacco \nproducts. It will be an historic step for parents who have enough to \nworry about in today's day and age without having to be concerned that \ncigarettes are being marketed directly to them, or tobacco products \ndesigned in ways to be specifically appealing to the youngest of our \ncitizens in this country. Parents deserve peace of mind when it comes \nto how dangerous tobacco products are being marketed. With this \nlegislation, that is precisely what we are trying to do.\n  I will emphasize again, this is not going to stop all of the problems \nof children starting smoking every day, but if we can make a difference \nand cut those numbers down. Then we will have achieved a great deal for \nour Nation. This is an opportunity to do so.\n  I should point out as well, I am not unsympathetic at all to the \ntobacco States--the States that grow tobacco where literally thousands \nof farms, their livelihood, and jobs depend upon this industry. This \nbill takes into account the needs of those small family farmers to \nprovide help to them as they transition. All of us know what it is like \nto be in a State where there are certain things that occur, products \nthat are made, services provided where they could be adversely affected \nby changes through no fault of their own. This bill tries to \naccommodate, to the extent possible, the industries and the businesses \nin those States that would be adversely affected, obviously, by the \nreduction in the use of tobacco products by our citizenry as a whole. I \nthink all of us here, and again particularly parents, whether you are a \nsmoker or a nonsmoker--you ask any parent in this country whether they \nwould like to see their children begin smoking--ask them that simple \nquestion. I don't care where you live, the last thing you want to see \nis your child begin a lifetime of use that you know is going to put \ntheir life in jeopardy from the moment they start. So if nothing else, \nas you think about this bill and you think about these amendments \ncoming along, many of which may be appealing on a certain level, \nremember, we have tried for 10 years and we have failed. Think about \nhow this bill might have made a difference 10 years ago, if it had been \nadopted, and how many young children might not have started because of \nthe inclusions and the provisions in this bill.\n  We cannot wait for another Congress, another 2 or 4 or 5 years to get \nback to this again. This is the moment. This is the hour. This is the \ntime when we can accomplish that kind of achievement. We have a chance \nto do something in a meaningful way, and I urge my colleagues to join \nus in this effort.\n  Let me also say this to my friend and colleague from Wyoming, who is \na champion on this issue and cares deeply about it. We had a very good \nand extensive markup of the bill a couple of weeks ago. There are some \noutstanding amendments Senator Enzi has raised, and our staffs are \nworking together to try to resolve those matters, as I promised we \nwould, before we get to offering a substitute that may include some of \nthe provisions we are in the business of trying to resolve. I thank him \nfor his cooperation, and also the members of the committee, who stayed \n2 days to mark up this legislation.\n  I commend my friend from Wyoming for his diligence in all of this, as \nhe always demonstrates, and our colleagues on both sides of the \ncommittee, who worked on this legislation; I am grateful to them as \nwell. I look forward to a good, healthy, and vibrant debate, with the \nfinal conclusion being strong support for this bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to talk against the deadly \nscourge of tobacco. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of \ndeath in the United States. We have to take some dramatic steps to \nreduce smoking.\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\n  Smoking killed my dad, my mom, and my mother-in-law, and secondhand \nsmoking conclusively affected me. This isn't political; this is about \nthe health of all Americans. This bill comes out of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Dodd, mentioned that we don't want kids to start. We don't want \nanybody to start. There is enough information out there that can tell \nyou that this will kill you. So don't do something that will kill you. \nYes, it is a slow death; it may take a number of years, but it will \nkill you. Cancer is one of the big results of smoking.\n  I wish to share a little bit from a contract that an oncologist--a \nperson who deals strictly in solving cancer and providing cancer \ntreatment--makes his patients sign before he will treat them because if \nthey keep smoking, they are adding to the problem, causing recurrences \nof the problem. It starts off this way:\n\n       Tobacco is a dangerous substance. It contains 50 \n     carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) and is a Group A \n     Carcinogen in the same class as asbestos and radon. It has \n     many toxic substances besides cancer-causing agents; among \n     these are insecticides which are used on the tobacco plant. \n     In some parts of the country, tobacco is used as an \n     industrial insecticide because of this composition. Tobacco \n     use is considered the number 1 preventable cause of death in \n     the world. On average, tobacco users live 35 years less than \n     non-tobacco users.\n\n  I go on to quote:\n\n       Tobacco has been found to cause a multitude of cancer \n     types, whether it is smoked or used in a smokeless fashion. \n     Tobacco is the number one cause of cardiovascular disease \n     leading to heart attack and strokes. Emphysema, chronic \n     bronchitis, and many other diseases are a consequence.\n       When I care for patients, I expect them to be involved in \n     the healing process, no matter what disease they are \n     afflicted by. If they continue to smoke, they do not want to \n     improve their health. Because of this, they can either \n     discontinue tobacco and continue under my care, or find \n     another health care provider.\n       Any tobacco user followed in our clinic will be given the \n     opportunity for tobacco cessation (quitting the habit).\n\n  They work with them on that.\n\n       Tobacco users must discontinue tobacco use within 2 weeks \n     of the initial consultation.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire contract be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Tobacco Policy\n\n                      (By Philip C. McMahill M.D.)\n\n       Tobacco is a dangerous substance. It contains 50 \n     carcinogens (cancer causing substances) and is a Group A \n     Carcinogen in the same class as asbestos and radon.

If someone refuses nicotine \n     testing on any given day, that counts as a positive urine \n     nicotine. If a patient has a positive urine test and is on \n     treatment, the treatment will be delayed for one week. Do not \n     use nicotine products, such as patches or gum that may cause \n     a positive urine test.\n\n       Patient Signature\n       Date\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I did notice that in the last couple of \nweeks, a Federal appeals court has even looked at a landmark ruling \nthat found that the Nation's top tobacco companies were guilty of \nracketeering and fraud for deceiving the public about the dangers of \nsmoking. A three-judge panel of U.S. courts of appeals in Washington \nunanimously upheld requirements that manufacturers change the way they \nmarket cigarettes. The requirements, which have been on hold pending \nappeal, would ban labels such as low tar, light, ultra light, or mild, \nsince such cigarettes have been found to be no safer than the others. \nThat is one of the requirements in this bill--that they cannot use that \nkind of false advertising.\n  I wish to share some facts with you. The Senator from Connecticut \nshared some with you. These are from the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention. Among current U.S. adult smokers, 70 percent report \nthey want to quit completely. In 2006, an estimated 19.2 million adult \nsmokers had stopped smoking for at least 1 day during the preceding 12 \nmonths because they were trying to quit. That is more than 44 percent \nof the smokers. Think about it--70 percent of smokers want to quit, and \n44 percent of them are trying each year. Unfortunately, not enough of \nthem succeed. I know what a terribly addictive thing it is. I watched \nmy parents deal with it. The numbers are even more shocking when we \nconsider youth smokers. Nearly one in five young people smokes, but \nmore than 54 percent of current high school smokers in the United \nStates tried to quit smoking during the preceding year.\n  We need to get people to stop smoking or, better yet, never start. I \nsupport incentives to quit smoking--for example, offering incentives to \nlower health insurance premiums for those who stop smoking or, better \nyet, who never start. That becomes a continuing cost to us. The cost of \nhealth care is out of control. There seems to be support in the context \nof health care reform.\n  Full, fair, and open debate is critical to the democratic process. I \nam pleased to have the opportunity this week to offer amendments to \nthis bill to help lessen the toll tobacco takes on our society. Senator \nDodd mentioned the committee action. We have a committee that works a \nlittle differently from some of the others. We look at that opportunity \nof the committee process to see what the key concerns are and to see \nhow they can be incorporated into making a better bill. That is what \nCongress is about. That is why we have 100 people here and 435 on the \nother end of the building, so that we get a lot of backgrounds, \nopinions, and ideas, so that can avoid unintended consequences and \ntighten up processes so that what we are trying to do can actually get \ndone.\n  I appreciate the way this bill has been worked on. One of the things \nwe did, of course, was leave about six amendments to be worked on in \nthe interim, before we actually get to amendments on this bill. I am \nhopeful those can be worked out so they will tighten up the bill a \nlittle bit more.\n  This Congress does have a unique opportunity to have an impact on \nsmoking and health consequences. My record is clear when it comes to \ntobacco. I am no friend of big tobacco. I have never taken a dime of \ntobacco company money for my campaigns, and I don't intend to start \nnow. I have ideas to make a real impact on the public health and win \nthe war on tobacco.\n  I thank the Senator and all those on the other side of the aisle for \nthe serious consideration they are giving the bill and the opportunity \nnow to have the floor debate. I am hoping we will stick to germane \nissues so that it will stay a tobacco bill. That is the only way we \nwill actually reach a conclusion on it.\n  I hope the ideas presented with the goal of making this a better bill \nwill get serious consideration. I am sure they will. I encourage people \nto bring those ideas forward and, if they will, talk to us a little bit \nbefore they put them in to see if they are already under consideration \nas opposed to already in the bill.\n  I am thankful for this opportunity. I am glad that the bill is being \nbrought to the floor and that it went through the regular process. I \nhope something good can come out of this. We need to make sure what we \nare doing will stop smoking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                             Nuclear Power\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 1 year ago I went to the Oak Ridge \nNational Laboratory in Tennessee to propose a new Manhattan Project to \nput America on the path to clean energy independence. The project would \nfocus on seven grand challenges: plug-in electric cars and trucks, \ncarbon capture from coal plants, making solar power cost competitive; \nrecycling used nuclear fuel, advanced biofuels from crops we don't eat, \ngreen buildings, and fusion. Last week I went back to Oak Ridge, spoke \nto a gathering, a summit of people from several States who were meeting \nto talk about how to attract and keep high technology jobs. I proposed \nthat the United States should build 100 new nuclear plants during the \nnext 20 years, while scientists and engineers figure out the grand \nchallenges I discussed 1 year ago. This would double America's nuclear \npowerplants which today produce 20 percent of all of our electricity \nand 70 percent of our pollution-free, carbon-free electricity. This is \nan aggressive goal. But with Presidential leadership, it could happen. \nI am convinced it should happen. Conservation and nuclear power are the \nonly real alternatives we have today to produce enough low-cost, \nreliable, clean electricity to clean the air, deal with climate change, \nand keep good jobs from going overseas. Climate change may be the \ninconvenient problem of the day, but nuclear power is, for many \nskeptics, the inconvenient answer. These nuclear skeptics cite \nregulatory delays and past problems with safety. They appoint \ncommissions to slow walk decisions about recycling used nuclear fuel. \nThey point to the shortage of welders for new plants. They complain \nthat Japan and France are building most of the essential equipment for \nnew nuclear plants. No surprise, since Japan is building 1 nuclear \nplant a year, and France is producing 80 percent of all of its \nelectricity from nuclear powerplants. The skeptics say that carbon from \ncoal plants contributes to climate change, which is true, and so they \noffer their solution: operate our big complex country, which uses 25 \npercent of all of the energy in the world, on electricity generated \nfrom the wind, the sun, and the Earth. One day that might be possible. \nBut today there is a huge energy gap between the renewable electricity \nwe wish to have and the reliable, low-cost electricity that we must \nhave. My guess is, it will be 30 or 40 or 50 years before these new \nsources of electricity are cheap enough and reliable enough to supply \nmost of the power to our electric grid.\n  The nuclear skeptics in Congress, urged by the President, reported \nlast month an energy and climate change bill that would require 20 \npercent of our electricity to be made from a very narrow definition of \nrenewable energy. My visit to Oak Ridge was to a gathering to discuss \nhow to attract and keep high tech jobs in the region. I tried to paint \na picture for those attending about how this legislation would affect \nthose who attended.\n  To put things in perspective, the Tennessee Valley Authority produces \nan average of about 27,000 megawatts of electricity for industrial and \nhousehold customers in our seven-State region. Sixty percent comes from \ncoal, 30 percent from nuclear, 8 percent from hydroelectric power, and \n1 percent from natural gas. Across the country, it is 50 percent coal, \n20 percent nuclear, 20 percent natural gas, and 6 percent hydroelectric \npower. Nationally, only about 1\\1/2\\ percent of electricity comes from \nthe Sun, the wind, and the Earth. Almost none of the TVA's power does. \nBut the 40 percent of TVA power that comes from nuclear and hydro \nplants is just as clean as these narrowly defined renewables. It is \nfree of pollution that dirties the air, and it is free of carbon that \ncontributes to global warming. In that sense, TVA is the sixteenth \ncleanest utility in the country already.\n  Here is another yardstick. The new nuclear powerplant at Watts Bar in \nTennessee can produce 1,240 megawatts of electricity. The Bull Run coal \nplant produces about 870 megawatts; the Fort Loudoun Dam, 150 \nmegawatts. All three operate almost all the time. This is called base \nload power, which is important since large amounts of power can't be \nstored. Some forget that solar power is only available when the Sun \nshines and wind power is only available when the wind blows.\n  So how much renewable electricity is available in our region? The new \nsolar plant our Governor Phil Bredesen has proposed in Haywood County \nwould cover 20 acres but produce just 5 megawatts. The 18 big wind \nturbines atop Buffalo Mountain, a few miles away from where I made my \nspeech, have the capacity to produce 29 megawatts but actually produce \nonly 6 megawatts. It may be also possible to squeeze a few hundred \nmegawatts from turbines in the Mississippi River. The Southern \nCompany's new biomass plant in Georgia--biomass is sort of a controlled \nbonfire of waste wood products--would produce 96 megawatts. All this \nfor a utility that needs 27,000 megawatts to operate at any given time.\n  Each of these sources of renewable energy consumes a lot of space. \nFor example, the big solar thermal plants in the western desert where \nthey line up mirrors to focus the Sun's rays take more than 30 square \nmiles--that is more than 5 miles on a side--to produce the same 1,000 \nmegawatts that one can get from a single coal or single nuclear plant \nthat sits on one square mile. Or take wind, to generate the same 1,000 \nmegawatts with wind, one would need 270 square miles. That is 16 miles \non a side. An unbroken line of wind turbines 50 stories high from \nChattanooga to Bristol would give us only one-fourth of the electricity \nwe get from one unit of the Watts Bar nuclear powerplant which fits on \none square mile, and we would still need the nuclear powerplant for the \ntimes when the wind doesn't blow. There is good reason why there is \nonly one wind farm in the entire southern United States. In our region, \nthe wind blows less than 20 percent of the time. Much of that time is \nat night when TVA already has several thousand megawatts of unused \nelectricity.\n  Biomass will be a renewable source that we will emphasize in the \nSouth, we are told. That's a good idea. It might reduce forest fires, \nand it will conserve resources. The National Forest Service told us \nlast week that there are 2 million tons of wood scraps and dead trees \nin Tennessee's forests, and pulp and paper companies might produce \nanother 2 million tons. That sounds like a lot. But let's not expect \ntoo much. We would need a forest the size of the entire 550,000-acre \nGreat Smoky Mountain National Park to feed a 1,000-megawatt biomass \nplant on a sustained basis. That is a plant that would produce as much \nelectricity as one nuclear power unit.\n  Think of the energy it is going to take to haul this around. Georgia \nSouthern says it will take 160 to 180 trucks a day to feed biomass into \na 96-megawatt electrical plant. Remember, TVA uses at least 27,000 \nmegawatts of electricity every day.\n  Of course, conservation and efficiency are the places to start when \nlooking at America's and, especially, Tennessee's electricity futures. \nTennesseans use more electricity per person than residents of any other \nState. If we reduced our use to the national\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\naverage, it would equal the electricity produced by four nuclear \npowerplants. We might still have to build some new powerplants, because \nour history and that of the country is that conservation only limits \nelectricity growth. It usually doesn't reduce it. For example, 20 years \nago we never would have guessed that computers would be using nearly 5 \npercent of our electricity. One can see we will need some \nbreakthroughs, something like a new Manhattan project, before we can \nrely very much on renewable electricity.\n  Of all these forms of electricity in our region, solar has the most \npromise. It takes up massive space, but we can use rooftops. It only \nworks when the Sun shines, but the Sun shines during peak times of \nelectricity use. I believe our Governor is exactly right to try to make \nTennessee a hub for solar power. The first grand challenge of my \nproposed Manhattan project is to try to make solar power cost \ncompetitive. According to TVA, in our region, it is far from that \ntoday. Solar costs four to five times as much as the base load \nelectricity that TVA now produces. Wind power, on the other hand, can \nsupplement electricity on the Great Plains and perhaps offshore. But \nfor our region, it would be a terrible mistake.\n  In Tennessee it is a waste of money, and it destroys the environment \nin the name of saving the environment. The turbines are three times as \ntall as Neyland Stadium, which is our great big football stadium in \nKnoxville. In our region they only work on mountaintops where the winds \nare strongest, and they barely work there. I haven't mentioned the new \ntransmission lines that will be necessary from the mountaintops through \nbackyards in Tennessee.\n\n  Someone asked Boone Pickens if he would put any of these turbines on \nhis 68,000-acre ranch in Texas. ``Hell no,'' he said. ``They're ugly.'' \nWell, if Boone doesn't want them on his ranch because they are ugly, \nwhy would we want them on the most beautiful mountaintops in America, \nin North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, \nall the way up to the White Mountains of New Hampshire?\n  Some of the jobs that we will be growing and attracting to our region \nand across the country are so-called green jobs, created as scientists \nand engineers work on the grand challenges I propose. Please remember \nthat nuclear power is also green. Electric cars and trucks are green. \nOne-third of Tennessee's manufacturing jobs are auto related. Even \ngreen jobs need low-cost electricity. The two new polysilicon plants \nlocated in Cleveland and Clarksville, TN manufacture polysilicon for \nsolar panels that go on roofs. Together these two plants use 240 \nmegawatts of electricity, about one-fifth of the production of the new \nnuclear unit at Watts Bar. Don't forget about places like the Aluminum \nCompany of America in my hometown, which has closed its smelter and \nwon't open until it can get a 20-year, low-cost electricity contract \nfrom TVA, or the steady stream of regional manufacturers who have been \nto my office saying that electric rates are already too high for them \nto keep jobs in our region.\n  The point is, if we care about jobs of any color, the cost of \nelectricity matters. Which is why it is especially galling to see \nFrance, a country we usually don't like to emulate, using the \ntechnology we Americans invented to give themselves some of the lowest \nelectric rates and lowest carbon emissions in the European Union.\n  So why is it that nuclear energy, perhaps the most important \nscientific advancement of the 20th century, was invented in America and \nyet we stopped taking advantage of it just when we most need it? \nShortly after World War II, Glenn Seaborg, the great American Nobel \nPrize winner, said that nuclear energy had come along just in time \nbecause we were reaching the limits of fossil fuels. He was right. The \nsucceeding decades proved that fossil fuels are not unlimited, and \ntheir supplies could seriously compromise energy independence. And that \ndoesn't even address global warming.\n  Yes, I do believe global warming and climate change are problems we \nmust address. We can't go on throwing 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide \ninto the atmosphere every year without running into some kind of \ntrouble. Every session I have been in Congress, I have introduced \nlegislation to cap carbon emissions from coal powerplants. But the way \nto deal with global warming and to keep our jobs is to encourage what \nhas been called the ``Nuclear Renaissance'' and start making nuclear \nenergy the backbone of a new industrial economy.\n  Right now there are 17 proposals for 26 new reactors in licensing \nhearings before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. That is a start. I \nthink we need to go well beyond that.\n  I propose that from the years 2010 to 2030 we build 100 new nuclear \nreactors to match the ones we are already operating. That is what we \ndid from 1970 to 1990. During that 20-year interval, we built almost \nevery one of the 104 reactors that now provide us with 20 percent of \nour electricity. If we build another 100 by 2030, we will be able to \nprovide well over 40 percent of our electricity from nuclear power. \nClean hydropower provides 6 percent of our electricity today, and with \nthe electrification of small dams around the country, we may be able to \nexpand that to 8 percent. With diligent conservation, and some \nrenewable resources, we can add another perhaps 10 or 12 percent. Then, \nmy friends, we will really be talking about a clean energy economy.\n  Still, that is only the beginning. The second largest source of \ncarbon emissions--and the biggest source of our energy instability--is \nthe 20 million barrels of oil we consume every day to run our cars and \ntrucks. I believe we should make half our cars and trucks plug-in \nwithin 20 years. That would reduce by one-third the oil we import from \nforeign sources. The Brookings Institution scholars estimate we can \npower those cars and trucks by plugging them in at night without \nbuilding one new powerplant. Let me repeat that. If we electrify half \nour cars and trucks in America, we can plug them in at night without \nbuilding one new powerplant because we have so much unused electricity \nat night.\n  As our fleet of electric vehicles grows, the most logical option for \nplugging in will be supplied by clean nuclear power. Until we make \ngreat advances in storage batteries, it cannot be electricity that is \nsometimes there and sometimes not. We cannot have Americans going to \nbed every night praying for a strong wind so they can start their cars \nin the morning.\n  Still, when it comes to nuclear power, a lot of people worry about \nsafety. They say: Well, nuclear power sounds great to me, but I am \nafraid one of those reactors is going to blow up and cause a holocaust.\n  Well, let's make a few things clear. As Oak Ridgers--where I was last \nweek--know better than almost anyone, a reactor is not a bomb. It \ncannot blow up. That is impossible. There is not enough fissionable \nmaterial there.\n  What a nuclear reactor can do is overheat if it loses its cooling \nwater, just the way your car engine can overheat and break down if it \nloses its antifreeze. It is called a meltdown. Nuclear scientists have \nwarned about this from the beginning and take many precautions so it \nwill not happen.\n  Nuclear skeptics like to bring up Three Mile Island, so let's talk \nabout that. What happened at Three Mile Island was basically an \noperator error. A valve failed, and when the automatic safety mechanism \nkicked in, the operators overrode it because of a mass of flashing \nlights and sirens on the control panel, which confused them about what \nwas happening.\n  Three Mile Island completely changed the nuclear industry. The Kemeny \nCommission, appointed by President Carter, analyzed the problems and \nmade many recommendations, most of which were put into practice. The \nvalve that started the whole thing had failed nine times before in \nother reactors and the manufacturer had tried to keep it a secret. \nPeople in the nuclear industry were not talking to each other.\n  Now all of that has changed. Nuclear operators train for 5 years \nbefore they can take over control rooms. They spend 1 week of out of \nevery 5 in a simulator honing their skills. The nuclear companies have \nspecial SWAT teams that can be dispatched anywhere in the country at a \nmoment's notice in case anything goes wrong. A Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission inspector practically lives on the site. What is more, every \nreactor in the country is on the\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nhook for $100 million if something goes wrong at another reactor. As \nyou can imagine, they watch each other very closely.\n  And it shows. Our entire nuclear fleet--104 reactors--is now up and \nrunning 90 percent of the time. There has only been one year-long \nshutdown for safety problems in the last decade. We have added the \nequivalent of 29 new reactors since 1990 by doing a better job of \nrunning the ones we already have. If the rest of America ran as well as \nthe nuclear industry, we would be sitting on top of the world.\n  ``But what about Chernobyl?'' someone will say? ``Wasn't that a \nnuclear catastrophe?'' Well, the Soviets did things very differently at \nChernobyl than we know how to do in this country. For instance, they \ndid not put a containment structure around the reactor, which is like \nnot putting a roof on your house and then acting surprised when it \nrains and you get wet. In addition, they did something no American \npower reactor has ever done: They surrounded the core with carbon in \nthe form of graphite. That is like building your reactor in the middle \nof a charcoal grill. When the graphite caught fire, it spewed \nradioactive smoke all over the world. That could never happen at an \nAmerican reactor--and it will not happen again in Russia since they \nhave made a lot of changes over there and now they are building \nreactors in the same way we build reactors.\n  So let's build 100 new nuclear reactors during the next 20 years. Our \nnew reactors have even better safety features--although it is never \ngood to be overconfident. We have learned how to run the current fleet \nat its full potential. Most reactors are making close to $2 million a \nday. The attorney general of Connecticut proposed a windfall profits \ntax a few years ago when fossil fuel prices went through the roof. He \nsaid it was not fair that reactors could run so cheaply. So why not \nexpand on our winnings? Why not build another generation of reactors?\n  Well, a lot of people say it cannot be done. They say we do not \nmanufacture anything anymore in America. We have to import all our \ngoods from China. They say we do not have the nuclear engineers to \ndesign the new generation. They say we do not have the specialty \nwelders to put them together on site. They say we cannot manufacture \nthe steel vessel heads anymore, and our steel forges are not big \nenough. Right now, the only forge in the world big enough to make a \nreactor vessel is Japan Steel Works, and they are backed up. People say \nour new plants will spend a decade standing in line behind the 34 other \nreactors that are already under construction in the world, mostly in \nAsia. And you know something. They are right. They are right because \nall the things they are saying here are true. We do not have a nuclear \nconstruction industry. But then, they do not know America. America can \nrespond to a challenge. Just as we rose to the occasion in 1943 when we \nbegan the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge and at other sites in our \ncountry, so can we rise to the occasion today to build a new generation \nof nuclear reactors that will provide clean, reliable power for America \nfor the rest of this century.\n  It is not going to be easy. What we are talking about here is \nessentially a rebirth of Industrial America, and it is already starting \nto happen. Westinghouse is opening a school for training welders who \ncan knit together a containment structure strong enough to protect both \nthe environment from the reactor and the reactor from outside threats. \nAlstom, a French company, is investing $200 million in Chattanooga, in \nmy State, to manufacture heavy turbines for nuclear plants.\n  We also have to train nuclear engineers to take the place of the \ngreat generation that embraced the technology in the 1960s and 1970s, \nonly to see their dreams come to naught when the Nation turned away \nfrom nuclear power. We have to find a steel manufacturer somewhere in \nthis country that is willing to step up and say: ``Here, we can do \nthose forgings right here in Pennsylvania or Ohio or Michigan or \nIllinois. We do not have to stand in line in Japan.'' And we have to \nfind investors who are willing to put up their money and say: ``Yes, I \nhave faith in America. I have faith in technology. I am ready to invest \nin building a cleaner, safer, more prosperous world.''\n  With Presidential leadership, we could add more loan guarantees to \naccelerate construction, and could streamline the permit system to \nensure that new reactors do not become ensnared in regulatory mazes or \ncombative lawsuits. But we cannot sit on our hands because in America \nwe do not sit around waiting for the Government to do things for us. We \ndo things for ourselves.\n  So the task we face here today is no less formidable than the task \nthe Oak Ridge pioneers faced when they first arrived in Tennessee in \n1943. They were trying to save the world from Japanese militarism and \nNazi totalitarianism. Now we are trying to save the world from the \npending disaster of dwindling energy supplies, the uncertain dangers of \na warming planet, and the stagnation and decay that can only follow if \nwe do not revive American industry.\n  So I propose today that we work together across the aisle, with the \nPresident, in the task of bringing about a Nuclear Renaissance in \nhelping to generate the Rebirth of Industrial America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I come to the floor because the Senate this \nweek is considering a new regulatory bill for the tobacco industry and \nthere will be Members who will come to the floor to say: We have tried \nto do this for 10 years. This is well past due.\n  Well, in part they are right. This bill was produced 10 years ago. It \nhas not changed. It is exactly what was produced. But let me try to \nfill in some history for the Members of the Senate.\n  In 1998, we passed the FDA Modernization Act. I was the lead sponsor \nof that bill in the House of Representatives. We spent 2\\1/2\\ years \ndeveloping a bill to modernize the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Most Americans do not even realize what the Food and Drug \nAdministration is. It is an agency in the Federal Government that \nregulates 25 cents of every dollar in our economy. It is what assures \nevery American that when you go to the pharmacy and you get a drug, \nthere is a Federal agency that has determined that drug is, one, safe, \nand, two, effective; or that when you go to a hospital or a doctor's \noffice, and they take a medical device--maybe it is something that \npermits them to go inside your body without cutting you open--that \ndevice has gone through an extensive review by the FDA.\n  In some cases, pharmaceutical products take up to 12 to 14 years for \napproval--the amount of clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy \nthat we go through, not just on animals but on humans--but it assures \nevery American that the gold standard in the world exists right here in \nthe United States of America. We put manufacturers and their products \nthrough a test at the FDA like no other country does. As a matter of \nfact, when the European Union was created and there were efforts to try \nto harmonize our approval process in the United States with that of \nEurope, what we found was that Europe's adoption, then, of 15 countries \nwas that they take any of the 15 countries' approval process. What we \nfound in the United States was it was hard for us to find one country \nthat had as rigid a requirement as the United States of America; \ntherefore, we didn't harmonize. For that reason, there are drugs that \nare approved in the European Union that are not approved in the United \nStates because they either haven't met the test of the FDA or they have \nchosen not to go through the test.\n\n  The reason I share all of that with my colleagues is that for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, there were two focuses of those of us who worked on FDA \nmodernization: one was to make sure we had an agency that could perform \nits task of efficiency, and two, that we did nothing to change the gold \nstandard--the assurance the American people had that every time they \ngot a prescription, every time there was a device, that the gold \nstandard was intact, that it was safe and effective.\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\n  It says on the FDA's Web site--and this is just part of their mission \nstatement:\n\n       The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by \n     assuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and \n     veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our \n     Nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit \n     radiation.\n\n  For the most part, I think we would agree that we do set the gold \nstandard on the approval of products. We do have some questions about \nthe Nation's food supply. This body has taken up three or four \ndifferent pieces of legislation because of the fact that the FDA has \nnot had the preview process they needed, and because of that, there \nhave been contaminated foods--some produced here in the United States, \nsome things were shipped in from out of the country, but it was FDA's \nmission to make sure that did not happen. Well, when we passed that \npiece of legislation, we all of a sudden accelerated the application \nprocess, the review process of drugs and pharmaceuticals. In the next \nyear, we approved 81 new applications because that FDA Modernization \nAct was in place but, more importantly, the gold standard was still in \nplace.\n  I wish to ask my colleagues, what are we here today to do? The \nlegislation that is on the floor is to give the FDA the jurisdictional \nresponsibility of regulating tobacco. I want my colleagues to think \nhard about this. The FDA's responsibility is for protecting the public \nhealth--well, tobacco is bad for the public health; it causes disease \nand it causes death--``by assuring the safety and effectiveness.'' \nWell, how in the world can you certify that tobacco is safe? It can't \nbe done.\n  So to say we are going to allow the FDA to become the agency of \nregulatory jurisdiction is to say to an FDA reviewer: We would like you \nto do this on drugs, we would like you to do this on devices, we would \nlike you to do this on foods, and we would like you to do this on \ncosmetics and products that emit radiation, but when it comes to \ntobacco, we don't want you to hold tobacco to the core mission \nstatement of the FDA. We want you to ignore that it kills people, we \nwant you to ignore that it causes disease, and we want you to just \nregulate it based upon how Congress said regulate it.\n  It is not making much sense to people who are listening. Why would \nyou do this? You could find any agency or create an agency to do \nexactly what Congress laid out in law. But no, we are laying it out in \nlaw and we are saying to the FDA: We want you to take that on as your \njurisdiction, as your responsibility.\n  But what is the likelihood of this, that by putting this new burden \non the FDA and surging reviewers who are currently working through \napplications on drugs and devices, working on food safety, and we surge \nthem over to this new area of responsibility called tobacco, that we \nare going to put more junior employees working on applications of \ndrugs? It might be the next lifesaving drug that is on the marketplace. \nIt might be a device that is actually a device that is inserted into \nyour body, and maybe a young reviewer either delays the approval of \nthat device or that pharmaceutical or makes the wrong decision because \nthe senior reviewer has gone over to do tobacco.\n  Some will come to the floor and claim that tobacco has to be in the \nFDA. The FDA, since its inception, has never, ever regulated tobacco. \nWe regulate it through what was the ATF, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; \nthe Federal Trade Commission has regulated the labeling; and the \nindustry on its own eliminated most of the concerns the American people \nhad when they had a master settlement with States years ago.\n  We are going to be debating this for days. I am going to be down here \nfrequently until this debate is over with because what I want is for \nthe Members of the Senate and the American people to understand that it \nis not as black and white as what some people would come to the floor \nand say: Just give it to the FDA and let them handle the \nresponsibility. Feel comfortable doing that if you are willing to \njeopardize drug safety, food safety, and device safety because they \ncan't prove the safety and efficacy of this product. As a matter of \nfact, the bill that is being considered by the Senate doesn't do \nanything to regulate existing products that are on the marketplace. \nThink about that. Think of all of the cigarette brands you see behind \nthe counter. The Kennedy bill actually says they are grandfathered. You \ncan't touch them. You have to allow them to continue to be sold. But to \na new product, one that might be a reduced-risk product, meaning less \nharm to the user, the pathway to try to be approved through the FDA is \nimpossible.\n  It is estimated that without doing anything, we will have a 2-percent \nreduction in cigarette usage per year in this country. That is a \nstatistic the CBO came out with. But if we enact this bill, according \nto the--excuse me, CBO estimated that it is currently being reduced at \n2 percent annually. According to the Centers for Disease Control, \nsmoking rates declined among Americans annually at 2 to 4 percent. \nThink about this: CBO says this bill will reduce cigarette smoking by 2 \npercent annually. CDC says we are currently reducing cigarette smoking \nuse 2 to 4 percent in the United States. In essence, what CDC says is, \nif you do nothing, we are going to reduce it more than what this bill \nis going to do. Why? Because CDC--the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention--realizes that when you grandfather all of these products, \nwhere FDA has no ability to go in and say, do this, do that, what you \nare doing is you are locking in the American people. When you say to \nthe FDA: Have this jurisdiction, but we are not going to give you any \nreal way to bring reduced-risk products or reduced-harm products to the \nmarketplace, all you are doing is assuring that people are going to \ncontinue to smoke cigarettes.\n  The marketplace at least has brought smokeless tobacco into the \nmarketplace, and through that smokeless tobacco, it has generated a 2-\npercent reduction in smoking. We can make the claim that smokeless \ntobacco is not good for the American people. It is certainly not good \nfor our youth. But the statistics show it is not as bad as smoking. You \ndon't have the degree of death and disease from smokeless tobacco. We \nwill get into that because there are studies around the world, many of \nthem done in the country of Sweden, where we find exactly that, that \nthey have been able to reduce smoking drastically in Sweden by allowing \nnew, reduced-harm products to come to the marketplace, and through the \nability of the public to decide that they would like to switch, they \nhave drastically gotten off of cigarette products.\n  No, that is not the course we are going to take. We are going to take \none that is typical Washington. We are going to pick an agency and we \nare going to say: Let's dump this responsibility on them, no matter \nwhat the cost is. We forget the fact that the FDA is the gold standard. \nIt is responsible for protecting the public health. How are you \nprotecting the public health when you grandfather every cigarette \nproduct that is currently on the marketplace to exist just as it is? \nHow do you prove safety and efficacy? How can this be effective?\n  We are headed in the wrong direction. As one of the authors of the \n1998 act, this troubles me greatly because I spent 2\\1/2\\ years trying \nto figure out how not to change the gold standard, that balance at the \nFDA that assured every American that it had gone through a grueling \nprocess of review, that it had passed every test that had been set to \nprove safety and efficacy. Why would we jeopardize this? Why would we \nrisk the fact that we might change this gold standard?\n\n  These are the questions that are going to be asked over the next \nseveral days. They are questions I hope to answer for people, not with \nwhat I believe but with the facts, with the truth about what is going \non around the world, why we are headed in the wrong direction, and why \nwe can have an effective regulatory entity in Washington without \njeopardizing the future of drug and device safety, food safety, \ncosmetics, and products that emit radiation. These are things we need \nto take very seriously.\n  I will make this last request, as I see my colleagues are headed to \nthe floor and wish to speak as well. I only asked one thing a week and \na half ago of the committee members, and that was to read the bill. \nWell, the fact that attitudes haven't changed much, that we are on an \naccelerated pathway, I can just about assure my colleagues they\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\ndidn't do what I asked. I didn't expect them to. I think the American \npeople believe we read every bill before it is considered. I think most \nMembers attempt to do that through staff or themselves. This is one \nthat, quite frankly, had they read it, we wouldn't be here today. We \nwouldn't be doing what we are attempting to do.\n  This is not about a quest of 10 years. In 1998, when we opened the \nFood and Drug Administration to do the Modernization Act, we opened the \nentire thing. Every Member of Congress had an opportunity to amend that \nbill in the House and the Senate at the time and to give the FDA \njurisdiction over tobacco. No Member exercised that ability. So in \n1998, there were no Members who thought it was important enough to put \nthat responsibility in the FDA.\n  We have seen steady reductions in smoking among adults and, more \nimportantly, smoking among youth. Youths are always the ones we point \nat and we say we have to make sure we do this because children \nshouldn't have cigarettes. They are right. They shouldn't. That is why \nwe have age limits and advertising limitations.\n  Can we do better? Yes, we can. Let me assure my colleagues, I will \noffer a substitute that not only is effective regulation, but it will \nprotect the gold standard of the Food and Drug Administration. It won't \nput in jeopardy what we have established as the most crucial regulatory \nbody we have that controls or regulates 25 cents of every dollar of our \neconomy. I don't believe that is responsible of the Members of the \nCongress. They have already made the mistake in the House. I hope we \ndon't make the mistake in the Senate. We can come up with effective \nregulation but not doing it through the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about health care and where \nwe are going on the issue of health care here as a government and as a \nnation. The health care train is beginning to leave the station, so to \nsay. I wish to make sure it is on the right track, that it not be on \ntracks which will lead it over a cliff. So I want to lay out a few \nfundamental tests that I believe need to be passed for health care \nreform to be effective.\n  First, everybody needs to be covered. Everybody should have the right \nto get insurance in this country. That is a reasonable request, and it \nis a reasonable thing to do. The fact that some people don't have \nadequate health care coverage is not acceptable.\n  Secondly, we need to have a system which encourages the marketplace \nto produce better products, more quality, better health care. We also \nneed a system that doesn't let the government become too intrusive into \nthe health care administration so that we don't end up with the \ngovernment between you and the doctor and we have a system where the \ngovernment basically creates such a top-down bureaucracy that you end \nup with rationing or significant delays in the delivery of health care, \nas occurs in some of our sister countries such as Canada and England.\n  Thirdly, we have to have a system that encourages innovation and \ngives those creative minds out there in the health care field who are \ndiscovering new drugs and new ways to treat very serious illnesses the \nopportunity to do that, to get a reasonable reward for what they are \ndoing, both monetarily and, of course, the great satisfaction of \nhelping to cure people.\n  We also need a health care system which says to the American people: \nYou are going to get quality health care when you go to get health \ncare, and you are going to get it at a reasonable price.\n  So these conditions, these standards are things we should follow.\n  As this train starts to leave the station, we are seeing a great deal \nof talk around here about how any health care that is proposed, if it \nis coming from the other side of the aisle, must be heavily laden with \nnew government restrictions and new government directions, the most \nsignificant of which is something called a public plan. A public plan--\nno matter how it is dressed up or what costume is put on it--has the \nsame effect. It is a statement by the government that it is going to \ncompete in the marketplace with the private sector for the delivery of \nhealth care insurance in this country.\n\n  That is not fair competition. There is no way the private sector will \nbe able to compete with a public plan; we know that. What we know is \nthat a public plan is essentially a stocking horse for a single-payer \nplan. It is more than the camel's nose under the tent, it is the \ncamel's neck, and probably front legs, under the tent on the effort to \nproduce a singer-payer plan.\n  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for us to go into a single-payer \nplan, which is essentially nationalizing the health care system. We \nhave seen neighboring nations have this experience, and their \nexperience is not good. In your nationalized health care systems, such \nas in England, for example, about 78 percent of the women who get \nbreast cancer survive. Here that percentage is around 92 percent. The \ndifference is because in the United States detection occurs early. In \nEngland, unfortunately, because they have a public health care system, \nwhich essentially involves delay in the ability to get treatment, \npeople are not determined to have that illness early enough to cure it \neffectively. You see that with all sorts of diseases.\n  In Canada, you may not be able to get hip surgery if you are over a \ncertain age--certainly not in time to have your lifestyle improved. The \nsimple fact is, a single-payer plan inevitably leads to delay in the \ndelivery of care and also rationing. In addition, of course, it leads \nto massive bureaucracies, inefficiency, and a reduction in quality. It \ndrives out of the market people who create new products, the new \nresearch, the new drugs, because you are basically setting a fixed \nreturn on what a person can make if they invest in producing a new \ndrug, and the production of new drugs is a very expensive business. It \ncosts almost $1 billion and 12 years to bring a new drug to the market. \nIt is extremely expensive. If you cannot get a reasonable return on \nyour money, you are not going to be able to get investors. If your \ninvestors are looking at that and saying the government may step in and \nfix my return and change the years of exclusivity and create a \nformulary to determine how and what drugs can be sold and who can buy \nthem and ration those drugs, that does not work. It reduces research, \nand therefore quality, and it reduces the ability to get good health \ncare.\n  A public plan should be a nonstarter. It should never happen. I have \nproposed--and I think we should be proposing formal ideas; we have not \nheard formal ideas from the other side of the aisle yet and I hope we \nwill get some soon--I have sat on a number of bipartisan groups, which \nhave been constructive, especially the Baucus group has been very \nconstructive, but we still don't have anything formal coming out of \nthat group. The same is true with the HELP Committee, under Senator \nKennedy--and from the administration, for that matter, we do not have \nanything formal.\n  I think we have an obligation to lay down the specifics on what we \nwant to do. I proposed ``CPR.'' That is the title I have given the \nproposal: Coverage, Prevention, and Reform. Essentially, it will set up \na system where every American will be required to get health insurance, \nand we will have affordable health insurance for low-income Americans, \npeople under 300 percent of poverty or less. They will have assistance \nto get health insurance. The insurance will be focused on the biggest \nconcern for most Americans, which is when someone in your family gets \nsick or has a severe accident and your entire economic lifestyle has \nchanged and, in fact, maybe you are wiped out and bankrupted by that \nevent. Essentially, this proposal will make sure everybody in this \ncountry has meaningful health insurance, so they cannot be wiped out by \na medical event.\n  Secondly, this proposal is focused aggressively on the issue of \nprevention. It changes the HIPAA rules so employers can put more money \ninto giving people incentives to live healthy lifestyles.\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\nThat is critical to our society. We have diseases in this country that \ncan be addressed through improving lifestyles. We have seen that, and a \nlot of companies have been successful in this area--in the area of \nobesity, which is a severe problem, and with diabetes and other huge \ncosts to society, we can change the impact of those costs and those \nvery detrimental health problems through a better lifestyle. We should \nincentivize that--monetarily incentivize that. That is what my proposal \ndoes.\n  In addition, the proposal incentivizes people to take preventive \naction relative to screenings and to getting early health care \nintervention, rather than late health care intervention. It does it \nthrough financial incentives. That is the best way to do things--pay \nmoney for being thoughtful and healthy.\n  Third, it looks at the system of reimbursement and says this is a \nchaotic system in this country, where we have stovepipes branching off \neverywhere. We need to have a system that reimburses, first, for \nquality, rather than simply for procedures, and one that says if you \nare delivering quality care, you will be reimbursed--especially if you \nare delivering quality care at less of a cost, and you are going to get \na benefit for that--the providers will. We have seen study after study, \nnow over a period of 20 years--most done by the group at DARPA--which \nhas shown us it is not an issue of cost that produces quality, it is an \nissue of those who are performing the procedures.\n  We know, for example, that in some parts of the country it can cost \n50 percent more to get a certain procedure, and you will have 20 \npercent less of an outcome than if you go to other parts of the \ncountry. For example, if you go to Mayo Clinic, it will cost less to \nget one procedure, and you will get a better outcome than if you go to \na hospital in southern California, where it costs more and you get less \nof an outcome. It is the same if you compare Florida and Washington \nState. If we incentivize quality and reasonable costs, we know we will \nget better quality and lower costs.\n  We also know we have a haphazard procedure around here on how we have \ndeductibles relative to Medicare and the various parts of it. Nobody \nknows what their deductible is because it changes depending on what \ntype of treatment you are getting--Part A, B or D, whatever. We should \nstandardize those and get more efficiency into the health care system.\n  How do we accomplish this? If you are going to get everybody in the \nsystem, you have to basically require that everybody be in the system. \nWe have 47 million uninsured people. Of that number, 20 million can buy \ntheir insurance. They have incomes up to $75,000 or more. But they \nchoose, as a matter of lifestyle, not to insure themselves. A fair \namount of people--the other 27,000 people--either don't have the \nwherewithal or they are with companies that are so small they don't \nhave the wherewithal to supply health care.\n  What I am suggesting is that everybody in America has to buy health \ninsurance--the coverage I talked about--meaningful health insurance, \nwith a heavy emphasis on prevention and reform. If you cannot afford \nit, then we will help you buy it. But you have to buy it. It is an \nindividual mandate. This is an approach that I think will work. It \ndoesn't require that we throw the baby out with the bathwater. It \ndoesn't require that we entirely rewrite our health care system in this \ncountry to satisfy those who want to run the health care system out of \nthe government.\n  It is not a nationalization of the health care system, not a single-\npayer or a public plan system. There will be innumerable competing \ninsurance products out there for people to buy in order to meet these \nstandards of coverage--innumerable. They will be settled by the \nmarketplace. People will have choices. States will have an exchange \nprogram, and you will be able to see everything available to you and \nquickly decide what is best for you as a family or an individual. It is \nnot an attempt to totally rewrite the health care system. It is an \nattempt to build on the present system, and it recognizes we have \nweaknesses, such as the fact that 47 million people are not covered and \nthat we actually disincentivize preventive medicine and a healthy \nlifestyle under HIPAA and such that we have a reimbursement system that \nmakes no sense and is chaotic and has grown up, over the years, as a \nresult of the bureaucratic machine that would make Rube Goldberg seem \nsimple. Take the strength of our system--we have private sector \ninitiatives going on that are creating better health care, which \ndoesn't cause people to have to suffer massive delays and doesn't \ncreate rationing in the marketplace, depending on your age, and doesn't \nput the government between you and your doctor. That is a good health \ncare system, and we should not throw it out by going to a public plan, \na single-payer system. We should build on the health care system we \nhave and bring those who are not covered into it and bring all of us \ninto an attitude of living healthier lifestyles and focusing on \nprevention, quality, and reform; thereby promoting research and better \nhealth care.\n  That is my proposal. I don't expect this proposal to win the day, but \nI hope it will be listened to as we go down the road because this is a \nhuge issue. Seventeen percent of the American gross national product is \nspent on health care. We don't need massive amounts of money in health \ncare. We spend 6 percent more of our gross national product than the \nnext closest nation. There is a huge amount of money moving around in \nour system. We need more quality at a more reasonable cost.\n  In addition, a lot of people are quite happy with their health care \nsystem, with what they are provided by their employer--usually. Why \nshould we throw them out the door too? Let's address that. What we need \nis to look at the system we have, its strengths, and build on those \nstrengths. We need to look at its weaknesses and reform them. I know my \nproposal will help accomplish that, and I hope it will be taken \nseriously.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know we are on the 30 hours postcloture \non the legislation that is the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \nControl Act. I support that legislation. I applaud our colleague \nSenator Kennedy for his leadership on this issue. It gives the FDA the \nauthority to regulate tobacco, including ingredients in tobacco \nproducts and tobacco marketing, which I think is an important step for \nour Nation's health.\n  We talked a lot about this in the past. The fact is that smoking and \nthe use of tobacco is dangerous to one's health. We know that. I had a \ndoctor once say there are three things that will give you pretty good \nodds for a longer life. One is wear a seatbelt. The second is keep your \nweight down. And the third is don't smoke. Pretty sound advice. The \n``don't smoke'' piece is about the health consequences of smoking.\n  We know especially the issue of marketing and marketing to children \nis a pernicious activity. We also know the best way you can get \nsomebody hooked on cigarettes is to get them when they are kids, get \nthem when they are young. Do you know of anybody who at age 35 is \nsitting in a La-Z-Boy recliner watching a color television set \nruminating about life and thinking to themselves: What on Earth have I \nmissed in life? What can I do to enhance my life? What should I be \ndoing that I so far have been unable to do and they decide: I have to \ntake up smoking. That just doesn't happen. If you don't get them when \nthey are kids, you don't get them. That is why we pay a lot of \nattention to addiction to nicotine, marketing to children, and so on.\n  Let me say again the leadership of Senator Kennedy and so many others \non a bipartisan basis on this issue I think is very important. It deals \ndirectly with the issue of the health of the American people.\n  I do want to say, however, that I intend to offer an amendment \ntomorrow when we get on the bill itself. I want to describe why I am \noffering an amendment and what the amendment does.\n  The amendment is called the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\nSafety Act. This underlying bill deals with the FDA. So, too, will my \namendment deal with the FDA. I will offer the amendment with Senator \nSnowe from Maine, the Dorgan-Snowe bill which we worked on for a long \nwhile. It has very wide support in this Chamber from Ted Kennedy, John \nMcCain, Chuck Grassley, Debbie Stabenow. So many others in this Chamber \non a bipartisan basis have supported this concept.\n  Let us give the American people the opportunity that comes with the \nworldwide economy and the ability in the free market to choose your \nproducts. And here is the reason it is important to do that.\n  The American people at this point understand the value of \nprescription drugs. They are enormously valuable, and I commend all of \nthose who produce prescription drugs. Yes, the pharmaceutical \nindustry--good for them. Yes, the National Institutes of Health and in \nso many other areas with public funding as well that develop the \napproaches that result in lifesaving prescription drugs. I commend all \nof them, including the pharmaceutical industry.\n  But it is also the case that the pricing mechanism the pharmaceutical \nindustry uses in this country is fundamentally flawed. They have a \npricing mechanism that in most cases for major brand drugs, the \nAmerican people are told: You get to pay the highest prices in the \nworld. You, the American people, get to pay the highest prices in the \nworld for the same pill put in the same bottle made by the same \ncompany. And it is not fair.\n  I have an example of that, and I ask unanimous consent to show them \non the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is the drug called Lipitor. Most \npeople understand what Lipitor is. It is a drug that is used to lower \ncholesterol. This happens to be made in Ireland and sent all over the \nworld. These two bottles were sent to two different places--one to the \nUnited States and one to Canada. The United States consumer got to pay \ntwice as much as the Canadian consumer. It is the same bottle, same \npill, same company, FDA approved, and the American people are charged \ntwice as much. And it is not just Lipitor. It is drug after drug.\n  The question is, why? Why should that be the case? It is not just \nCanada, it is virtually every other country in the world as well that \nenjoys lower cost prescription drugs, when, in fact, we pay a much \nhigher cost for the identical drug.\n  This happens to be the price--$4.47 per 20 milligram tablet of \nLipitor to a U.S. consumer, and just north of the border, $1.82 for the \nsame drug. I could have used other countries. It would have shown the \nsame result.\n  I have taken a busload of North Dakotans to Canada because I live in \na State that borders Canada. In a one-room drugstore at Emerson, \nCanada, I saw individuals buy their prescription drugs and saw the \nsavings drug by drug. I sat in a farmyard one summer afternoon with an \nold codger in his eighties from North Dakota. He was talking about \nhealth care. He said: You know, my wife has been fighting breast cancer \nfor 3 years. He said: For 3 years every 3 months we have driven to \nCanada to buy Tamoxifen to fight her breast cancer. Why did we drive to \nCanada? Because we couldn't afford it in the United States. We couldn't \nafford to pay for the drugs for my wife's fight against breast cancer. \nIt was 80 percent less costly for the identical drug just north of the \nborder. That is not fair.\n  Again, it is not just Canada. It is virtually every other \nindustrialized country where drugs are sold for a fraction of the price \nthey are sold in the United States. These are FDA-approved drugs, made \nin FDA-approved facilities, and sent all around the world. The only \ndifference is pricing. We are charged the highest prices in the world.\n  The Wall Street Journal had a piece on April 15 of this year, quoting \nsome experts:\n\n       These kinds of price increases--\n\n  Speaking of prescription drugs--\n\n     are way out of line with what's being experienced in the rest \n     of the economy.\n\n  Said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer \nhealth care advocacy organization.\n  Credit Suisse's Catherine Arnold said drug companies have increased \nprices so aggressively in recent months to wring sales out of products \nbefore any health care cost-cutting efforts eat into profits.\n  That is not fair. One might ask: How can they do it? They can do it \nbecause there is something in law that prevents the importation of \nprescription drugs, even FDA-approved drugs, prevents the importation \ninto this country by anybody except the drug manufacturer itself. That \nmeans the American people are not given the same opportunity to shop \nworldwide for an FDA-approved drug. It means it is a free-trade economy \nexcept the American people cannot participate in that free trade.\n  What we propose to do is to offer a piece of legislation that gives \nthe American people the opportunity to access FDA-approved drugs, the \nsame drug made in the same place marketed differently but priced higher \nin the United States to access those same drugs. Do we do this because \nwe want Americans to buy their drugs from other countries? No, that is \nnot the point. The point is if they can access that same FDA-approved \ndrug sold for a fraction of the price in another country, it will force \nthe pharmaceutical industry to reprice their drugs at a lower cost in \nthis country in a manner that is fair to the American people.\n  The estimates of what this will save are $50 billion in 10 years--$50 \nbillion in savings in this country. That is not insignificant at all.\n  One of the things that is always raised by those who support the \npractice of the pharmaceutical industry is this is going to cause all \nkinds of safety concerns. Can you imagine the counterfeit drugs that \nwill come across?\n  I just described this drug Lipitor. This is not made here. It is made \nin Ireland and then shipped in. How do we know this is real? The \nprovisions in the legislation that we have created actually provide \nsafety requirements that exceed those that now exist with respect to \nbatch lots and pedigrees and all kinds of new resources for the FDA to \ndo more audits than they now do, to do more inspections than they now \ndo.\n\n  Don't anybody come to the floor of the Senate raising those kinds of \nissues because they do not exist. This legislation is legislation that \nhas very stringent safety requirements and will provide an opportunity \nfor the American people for some basic fairness.\n  Here is a quote from Mr. Hank McKinnell, former Pfizer CEO. He said:\n\n       Name an industry in which competition is allowed to \n     flourish--computers, telecommunications, small package \n     shipping, retailing, entertainment--and I'll show you lower \n     prices, higher quality, more innovation, and better customer \n     service. There's nary an exception. OK, there's one. So far, \n     the health care industry seems immune to the discipline of \n     competition.\n\n  That is exactly why the pharmaceutical industry can decide this \nafternoon behind a closed door: Here is what we are going to do to our \nprices, and if you don't like it, tough luck, because we have the \ncapability to make it stick.\n  I don't come to the floor of the Senate as someone who has some sort \nof grief against the pharmaceutical industry. As I said when I started, \nthe pharmaceutical industry plays a very important role in health care \nin this country. I have a grief against their pricing policy, however.\n  I held hearings on this issue long ago. A group of us on the floor of \nthe Senate--Republicans and Democrats--has tried for some long while \nonly to be blocked to pass legislation that would give the American \npeople the opportunity to access the identical prescription drugs that \nare sold for a fraction of the price in the rest of the world and do it \nin a manner that is fair to the American people. We have been blocked \nin that opportunity.\n  This is an FDA bill on the floor of the Senate. This is the place to \noffer this amendment.\n  I visited with my colleagues this morning, Democrats and Republicans. \nI talked with Senator Stabenow, Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, and many \nothers this morning about this amendment to this bill. On a bipartisan \nbasis, we believe this will help the American consumer. It is long \noverdue. And at a time and during a year in which there is a lot of \ndiscussion about health care issues and the problems confronting this \ncountry in health care, one of the most significant problems is this \ndramatic march of price increases in health care.\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\n  Look, we spend more money per person on health care than any other \ngroup. We spend more money than any group of people in the world per \ncapita by far, and we rank 41st in life expectancy. Something is not \nworking out quite so well there. One of the areas of these price \nincreases in health care that leads the pack is the issue of \nprescription drugs. Prescription drugs allow us to manage disease, in \nmany cases keep people out of an acute care bed, which is very \nexpensive. We know the ability to manage health care conditions through \nthe use of prescription drugs has been very helpful and has been \nlifesaving to many Americans and people around the world. We understand \nthat completely.\n  Those who oppose the amendment I am proposing would say: Look, all \nthat will do then is shut down or at least reduce the revenue that the \ndrug companies have, pharmaceutical companies have and, therefore, they \nwill do less research and, therefore, have less opportunity to unlock \nthe mysteries of these dreaded diseases and find the very next cure for \nParkinson's, Alzheimer's, or some other disease.\n  It is interesting to me that the costs or the amount of funds spent \nfor marketing and promotion by the pharmaceutical industry, at least \nfrom information I have, exceed the amount of money they spend on \nresearch. How many people in the morning have a little television set \nsomewhere near while they are brushing their teeth getting ready for \nwork. The television set is on, and there is a voice on the television \nset and a really interesting picture and it is describing some awful \nsymptom that you have that you want to get rid of, and they are \ndescribing the symptom and describe the 85 things that could go wrong \nif you take the pill they are pushing. Then they say: Go to your doctor \nand ask him if the purple pill is right for you. I don't know what the \npurple pill does; I don't know what it is about, but the commercials \nare so intriguing and so persuasive, you almost want to go ask someone \nif the purple pill is right for you.\n\n  There is so much advertising relentlessly pushing prescription \nmedicine at consumers--who can only get it if a doctor prescribes it in \nthe first instance--how about cutting back on some of that advertising? \nSo don't tell me that if they have to charge a price that is \ncompetitive with other prices around the world for the prescription \ndrugs they sell in the United States that somehow it will injure their \nresearch.\n  Let me say that a fair amount of the research goes on here at the \nFederal Government level through the National Institutes of Health and \nthe contracts all across the country, and we are substantially \nincreasing that investment. I believe in that and I support it. I am \none of those who has pushed and pushed because there are so many things \nthat we can unlock with respect to these mysterious diseases, and we \ncan make this a much better future if we invest in the research \nnecessary.\n  When we find the capability and research to address these diseases, \nvery often we see that research available to pharmaceutical industry \ncompanies that then market a pill or market some medicine as a result \nof it. And they do some research themselves--not insignificant, by the \nway--and find opportunities in their own companies as well to introduce \nand provide life-saving medicines. So my hat is off to all of them. It \nis just that I insist on fair pricing for the American people, and that \nhas not been the case for a long time.\n  I am offering an amendment that is going to save this country $50 \nbillion over the next 10 years. My colleague, Senator Snowe, and I, \nalong with many other colleagues, have introduced this piece of \nlegislation--with more than 25 colleagues now, but we have had far more \nthan that many in previous Congresses--and we are impatient. This has \nbeen a long tortuous trail and we are impatient to get this done on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  I wanted to come today, even during the 30-hour postcloture period, \nto say that when we are on the bill tomorrow, I intend to offer this \nlegislation and to do it in a way that advantages the American consumer \nto be able to access the same quality prescription drugs that other \nconsumers around the world are accessing for similar prices. At the \nmoment that is not the case. We are overcharged. The drugs are \noverpriced. It is unfair to the American consumer, and it is past \ntime--long past the time--for this Congress to do something about it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, as I stated earlier today, I will be back \ntime and time and time again to help my colleagues, one, understand \nwhat bill is being considered this week in the Senate but, more \nimportantly, the ramifications of doing the wrong thing.\n  I think most Americans would agree that we should do everything we \ncan to regulate tobacco products as relates to the youth of our \ncountry. By the same standard, I think that we have an obligation as \nMembers of the Senate to make sure we don't in fact limit the choice of \nadults who choose a tobacco product. I believe that you don't limit \nthat if you responsibly regulate the product. I believe you do limit it \nif in fact to make something fit you design a regulatory scheme that by \ndefault limits the future options adults might have.\n  I left off earlier talking about the core mission of the Food and \nDrug Administration being to protect the public health by ensuring the \nsafety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, biologics, medical \ndevices, cosmetics, and the food supply. God knows we have been \nchallenged over the last couple of years with the food supply. Whether \nyou talk about contaminated peanut butter or spinach in California, a \nnumber of things have come into play, and I think many of us would \nagree the Food and Drug Administration has been deficient in the area \nof food safety. As a matter of fact, the people now authorizing bills \nto dump on the FDA the responsibilities for tobacco were very critical \nof the FDA as it related to their food safety oversight, so it \nshouldn't shock any of us that I think they are misguided in where they \nhave chosen to focus their efforts toward regulating this industry.\n  Let me add to that the former--just recently former with the change \nin administration--FDA Commissioner's statements about this bill.\n\n       The provisions in this bill would require substantial \n     resources, and FDA may not be in a position to meet all of \n     the activities within the proposed user fee levels. As a \n     consequence of this, FDA may have to divert funds from its \n     other programs, such as addressing the safety of drugs and \n     food, to begin implementing this program.\n\n  This is not something I have schemed up. This comes from the former \nCommissioner of the FDA, who says that within the framework of the \nKennedy bill, the user fee levels alone may not be enough for us to set \nup this regulatory framework and, therefore, we might have to divert \nfunds from other programs, such as addressing the safety of drugs and \nfood to begin this program.\n  Let me explain. To implement this program, it will cost $787 million \na year--$787 million a year. I will propose, along with Senator Hagan, \na substitute--that when HHS was asked to tell us how much they needed \nto absolutely fund that new entity to regulate the tobacco industry \nthey told us they would need $100 million. So there is already an \noption on the table that allows us to take user fees from the industry \nto fund a $100-million-a-year program to regulate the entirety of \ntobacco; or we can choose to put it at the FDA, where we are basically \ngoing to do the same thing and the former FDA Commissioner said the \n$787 million devoted to user fees may not be sufficient to meet the \nregulatory requirements set forth in this legislation.\n  It is actually a little bit worse than that, because the CBO stated \nthat before the Kennedy plan can be implemented--which is paid for by a \nshell game of requiring military servicemembers to mandatorily \nparticipate in TSP, the savings plan, the 401(k) of the Federal \nGovernment--to pay for the program you have to come up with $200 \nmillion to kick the program off. You know, it is a catch-22. The \nKennedy program can't even be implemented from the shell game of \nfunding they\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\nhave set up, but more importantly it is going to cost almost eight \ntimes more than if we were to regulate tobacco in a separate entity \nunder the guidance of the Secretary of Health and Human Services--the \nsame person who has the guidance of the FDA; the same Secretary.\n  What we are going to propose is that we set up a new agency to in \nfact regulate the tobacco product, but not get it confused with other \ncore missions, such as the safety and efficacy of drugs and biologics \nand devices. That would be a huge mistake, I believe.\n  Let me, if I could, quote Jack Sullum's April 2008 op-ed in Reason \nMagazine in talking about the Kennedy bill. He said:\n\n       A consumer protection bill that reduced competition, raised \n     prices, restricted choice, blocked information, and made \n     products more hazardous could not really be counted as a \n     success. The act imposes new regulatory burdens and \n     advertising restrictions. The compliance costs and reduced \n     competition are likely to raise prices. The bill not only \n     authorizes the prohibition of safer tobacco products in \n     the censorship of potentially lifesaving information about \n     relative risks; it gives the FDA permission to make \n     cigarettes more dangerous by ordering reductions in \n     nicotine content. Such a mandate aimed at making \n     cigarettes less attractive to new smokers would force \n     current smokers to absorb higher levels of toxins and \n     carcinogens to obtain their usual doses of nicotine. \n     According to supporters, this bill, backed by the biggest \n     tobacco company, will enable the FDA to protect smokers \n     from big tobacco. But who will protect smokers from the \n     FDA?\n\n  That doesn't come from Richard Burr or any other Member, this comes \nfrom an individual who has had an opportunity to read the bill, \nsomething a majority of the Members in the Senate have not done. If \nMembers of the Senate read the Kennedy bill, they would never put the \njurisdiction of tobacco with the FDA. They would never jeopardize the \nsafety of drugs, of cosmetics, of devices and biologics. In fact, the \nKennedy bill authorizes the prohibition of safer tobacco products.\n  Let me say that again, because I don't think everybody realizes what \nI said. The bill prohibits safer tobacco products and the censoring of \npotentially lifesaving information about relative risks among tobacco \nproducts. But this is being sold as a public health bill. This is being \nsold as a bill that reduces youth access, youth usage of tobacco \nproducts.\n  Let me tell you what we did in 1998. It really wasn't what we did. We \nwere, I guess, smart enough to stay out of it. The tobacco companies, \nunderstanding that there was a tremendous health cost that resulted \nfrom their products, came up with a settlement with all the States. It \nwas called the Master Settlement Agreement--the MSA--and we will talk \nabout the MSA a lot over the next few days. How much was the MSA? It \nwas a guaranteed award of $280 billion over a period of time, and every \nyear the companies make that payment to the States. These funds were to \nbe used for health care costs and programs associated with tobacco use, \nmainly cessation programs. The industry was actually paying States to \nrun cessation programs to get people to stop smoking--to stop using \ntobacco products.\n  If States spent the MSA money the way the CDC recommended to them \nevery year, trust me, we wouldn't be here today. We would not be \ntalking about the FDA taking over the jurisdiction of the regulatory \nresponsibilities of tobacco, because had States used the money that was \ndevoted for these cessation programs, the reduction in smoking would \nhave been dramatic.\n  Let me add that, according to the CDC, smoking rates among Americans \ndecline annually 2 to 4 percent currently--2 to 4 percent a year. The \nCBO, when looking at the Kennedy bill, estimated that, when \nimplemented, this legislation would only decrease smoking by 2 percent \nannually. In other words, doing nothing versus the Kennedy bill, we \nhave a trend line that gets us to a 15.97 percent usage of tobacco \nproducts in the year 2016; under the Kennedy bill, as scored by CBO, \nyou would have a usage of cigarettes--of smoking products--of 17 \npercent in 2016. That is almost a 2-percent difference--a 2-percent \nadditional decline, if we do nothing. And I am not here proposing that \nwe do nothing. I am here proposing we do a new regulation, but we don't \ndo it in a way that necessarily jeopardizes the safety, the gold \nstandard of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  I think it is shocking in talking about the MSA, the $280 billion \nover these number of years designed to help States with their health \ncare costs and with cessation programs. What have the States been \ndoing? Let me pick a few of them, if I could. Of the amount the CDC \nrecommended to the State of Connecticut that they spend on cessation \nprograms--programs designed to get people to stop using tobacco \nproducts--how much did Connecticut spend? It is easy, 18.9 percent of \nwhat the CDC recommendation was--18.9 percent. I don't know whether \nthey built sidewalks or highways or paved roads or what they did with \nit, but they certainly didn't do it to try to get people to quit \nsmoking.\n  It is easy to come up here and pass something that you can turn \naround and say: Well, this should work, rather than to actually devote \nmoney to actually doing something that matters. As a matter of fact, \nlet me say that the smoking prevalence among youth in Connecticut is \n21.1 percent.\n  The alcohol prevalence in youth in Connecticut is 46 percent. The use \nof marijuana prevalence among youth is 23.2 percent. The use of \nmarijuana in youth in Connecticut is 23.2 percent; alcohol, it is 46 \npercent; of tobacco, it is 21.1 percent. Why aren't we addressing the \nreal problems? Alcohol usage prevalence among youth is twice what \ntobacco is. Marijuana is 2 percent higher than tobacco.\n  Illinois. Of the CDC recommended amount to go to cessation, how much \ndid they spend of the recommended amount? Mr. President, 6.1 percent--6 \npercent of what CDC said they ought to be spending of the FSA money on \nprograms to reduce the rate of smoking. They used 6 percent. And 19.9 \npercent of the prevalence among youth in the use of tobacco; 43.7 \npercent of alcohol; 20.3 percent of marijuana. Again, alcohol and \nmarijuana are higher in youth prevalence than tobacco usage. Six \npercent of the CDC recommendation devoted to programs to try to reduce \nthe use of tobacco products.\n  Massachusetts. Of the CDC recommendation as to how much should go to \nprograms to get people to stop the use of tobacco products, 15 percent; \n85 percent devoted to something else--building sidewalks, filling in \nbudget gaps--but not to reduction in the use of tobacco products.\n  But this is such a prevalent issue, we are going to spend a week or \nlonger of the Senate's time talking about how we jeopardize the gold \nstandard of the FDA when States that have had the funds since 1998 to \nreduce the problem chose to use them on something else because it \nwasn't a big deal.\n  In Massachusetts, 17.7 percent prevalence in youth usage of tobacco \nproducts; 46.2 of alcohol; 24.6 of marijuana.\n  Missouri. Of the CDC recommendation for cessation programs, how much \ndid they spend? They spent 3.7 percent. For 96-plus percent, they said: \nWe are not going to spend this on what the CDC recommended that we do \nto reduce tobacco consumption. We are going to spend it on what we \nwant. Mr. President, 23.8 percent youth prevalence of tobacco usage; 44 \npercent for alcohol; 19 percent of marijuana usage. Thank goodness \nmarijuana usage in Missouri is lower in the rate of prevalence among \nyouth than tobacco.\n  Nevada. Of the CDC recommendation of how much they devote in Nevada \nto reduce tobacco usage, 12.6 percent. And 13.6 percent youth \nprevalence--they do a tremendous job with making sure the usage by \nyouth is minimal, 13.6 percent; 37 percent for alcohol; 15.5 percent \nfor marijuana.\n  New Hampshire. Of the CDC recommendation, they spent 5.7 percent on \nprograms to get people to stop smoking. Nineteen percent youth \nprevalence for smoking; 44.8 percent youth prevalence for alcohol; 22.9 \npercent youth prevalence for marijuana.\n  New Jersey. Of the CDC recommendation, 8.5 percent; 19.8 percent for \nsmoking prevalence in youth; 46.5 percent alcohol prevalence for youth; \n19.9 percent marijuana prevalence for youth.\n  Ohio. How much of the CDC recommendation for programs to actually \nreduce consumption of tobacco products? It is 4.9 percent. Tobacco use \nprevalence among youth, 21.6 percent; alcohol, 45.7 percent; marijuana, \n17.7 percent.\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\n  Texas. Of the CDC recommendation, 4.7 percent. Over 95 percent of the \nrecommendation of the CDC, if you wanted to reduce youth prevalence of \nsmoking, 95 percent went somewhere else. Twenty-one percent prevalence \nin youth smoking; 48 percent alcohol; and 19 percent in marijuana.\n  This is a sampling for now 11 years during which they have had the \nfunding to do the programs. They have seen a greater need in the \nStates, a greater need to the tune in some cases of 96-plus percent \nthat they were going to devote to something else because the prevalence \nof youth smoking wasn't that big a concern to those States. They \ndiverted the money. Now, all of a sudden, this is such a pressing issue \neven though the trendline says doing nothing actually reduces the use \nof tobacco products, of smoking, more than the bill that is being \nconsidered. If we did nothing, it would do better, but all of a sudden \nwe have religion in the Senate.\n  Here is an opportunity to actually pass something and to go home and \nsay: Here is what we have done. Ten years ago, we promised you the FDA \nwould have jurisdiction, and we didn't do it.\n  What they forget is, 11 years ago, when we passed the FDA \nModernization Act, we opened up the entirety of the FDA as we \nredesigned how they functioned, and no Member of Congress offered an \namendment to give the FDA--11 years ago--the responsibility for \ntobacco. Every Member focused, over 2\\1/2\\ years in crafting that \nlegislation, on making sure that this mission statement, the \nresponsibility for protecting the public health by assuring the safety \nand efficacy of drugs, devices, cosmetics, food safety, that we didn't \ndo anything to diminish this. Now, all of a sudden, 11 years later, we \nare claiming that for 10 years we actually wanted FDA to have \njurisdiction of tobacco, and we are willing to jeopardize the mission \nof FDA on drugs, devices, biologics, and food safety just because we \nwant to give them this new jurisdiction.\n  Read the bill. Actually spend the time to sit down and read the bill. \nYou will find out how we are jeopardizing the future of the American \npeople relative to drug safety.\n  Let me quote from the American Association of Public Health \nPhysicians in its white paper on the case of harm reduction. We will \ntalk about reduced-risk products and harm reduction a lot of over the \nnext several days.\n  From the white paper:\n\n       Tobacco harm reduction is taken to mean encouraging and \n     enabling smokers to reduce their risk of tobacco-related \n     illness and death by switching to less hazardous smokeless \n     tobacco products. In practical terms, enhancement of current \n     policies based on the premise that all tobacco products are \n     equal risk will yield only small and barely measurable \n     reductions in tobacco-related illness and death. Addition of \n     harm reduction components, however, could yield a 50 to 80 \n     percent reduction in tobacco-related illness and death over \n     the first 10 years and a likely reduction of up to 90 percent \n     within 20 years.\n\n  That is from the American Association of Public Health Physicians. \nThat basically says what you are getting ready to do is a huge mistake. \nYou are getting ready to grandfather every tobacco product on the \nmarket today and you are ruling out these new products that might come \nto market in the future that would have a devastating impact on the \nreduction of death and illness among the American people, which has a \ndirect impact on health care costs.\n  From the Royal College of Physicians in Sweden:\n\n       In Sweden, the available low-harm smokeless products have \n     been shown to be an acceptable substitute for cigarettes to \n     many smokers, while ``gateway'' progression from smokeless to \n     smoking is relatively uncommon.\n\n  Why is this important? You will hear people say these new smokeless \nproducts shouldn't come to the marketplace because that is an \nopportunity for youth to get hooked on nicotine and then to turn to \nsmoking. Smokeless product has an age limit, just like cigarettes. As a \nmatter of fact, I quoted the numbers on marijuana prevalence for youth. \nMarijuana is illegal. It does not have an age limit to it. It is \nillegal. Yet, for most of the States I referenced, the prevalence among \nyouth of marijuana usage was higher than that of tobacco. Where is the \noutrage?\n  Dr. Coburn will come to the floor at some point before the end of \nthis debate. He will offer a recommendation that we give the \njurisdiction to the FDA for smoking marijuana. Why? Because smoking \nmarijuana does more health hazard to one's lungs than smoking tobacco. \nI will let him make the case because he is a doctor and deserves the \ncredibility of his profession.\n  There are 14 doctors in the 111th Congress, with two of those doctors \nin the Senate: Dr. Coburn and Dr. Barrasso.\n  One of the House M.D.s, Michael Burgess, a member of the Health \nSubcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, felt \ncompelled to explain why he voted against this bill in the House, a \ndoctor who voted against the companion bill to the Kennedy bill. He \npracticed medicine in North Texas for 25 years and lost both parents to \ntobacco-related illness. He said:\n\n       The FDA is a beleaguered agency that cannot do what we \n     currently require it to do with food and drugs. Agency \n     officials have stated the FDA is badly understaffed and \n     underfunded. Yet, with this bill, we are giving the agency an \n     entire new group, tobacco. This is hardly a logical \n     rationale, let alone safe for the American public. Until the \n     agency is able to demonstrate on a consistent basis that they \n     have the capacity to do all we currently require them, we \n     should not give them additional responsibilities.\n\n  That is a doctor of 25 years who is basically looking at the work of \nthe FDA and saying: Nobody in their right mind, especially a medical \nprofessional, would consider this to be a wise thing, to offer the FDA \nadditional jurisdiction.\n  Until they can prove that they understand the responsibility of the \nFDA, which is to protect the public health by assuring the safety and \nefficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological \nproducts, medical devices, our Nation's food supply, cosmetics, and \nproducts that emit radiation, until they do that, why would we even \nconsider giving them any more?\n  That is a medical doctor of 25 years making that statement when he \nvoted against this bill in the House.\n  This bill is going to pass, make no illusions about that. Why? \nBecause Members haven't read it. If they did, there is no way they \nwould vote for it. The truth is, this is going to be popular at home. \nThey will go home and say: I gave the FDA regulation of tobacco \nproducts. They will not go home and say: We had an opportunity since \n1998 to reduce youth usage of tobacco and our State decided not to even \nmeet the recommendations of the CDC, much less the others. We thought \nit was more important to build sidewalks or fill budget gaps than to \nmeet these new targets. Now we have the answer to it because giving it \nto the FDA, no child will ever smoke again. Baloney. If they are under \n18 today, they are finding some way to buy tobacco. It is illegal, but \nit should not surprise us when we look at marijuana usage, where we \nhave a product that is not age limited, it is illegal, and more youth \nuse marijuana than use cigarettes.\n  We really have to focus on this, if, in fact, we want to make sure we \ndon't do the wrong thing.\n  Let me, at this time, cite part of a letter from Elizabeth Whelan. \nDr. Whelan is the president of the American Council on Science and \nHealth. This letter was sent to Congressman Steve Buyer and Congressman \nMike McIntyre in the House. She writes:\n\n       (H.R. 1256) will not only fail to reduce the ravages of \n     cigarette induced disease and death--it will likely worsen \n     it. The new regulation of tobacco additives will not lower \n     the toxic and carcinogenic mixture induced by the combustion \n     and inhalation of cigarette smoke. The enhanced restrictions \n     on lower risk tobacco products such as smokeless tobacco and \n     clean nicotine which have been shown to assist addicted \n     smokers in quitting will condemn the over 40 million addicted \n     smokers to the same old quit or die pair of options.\n\n  Limit 40 million addicted smokers to the same old quit or die \noptions.\n  We are going to see, over the next several days, people come to the \nfloor and say this is about public health, this is about reducing youth \nusage, this is about addressing the health risks of tobacco. Yet every \nprofessional who has written on this issue has said: What we are \ngetting ready to do in the Senate is the worst thing we could do. It is \ngoing to make the problem worse. It is going to raise the cost of \nhealth care, not lower it. It is going to lock more people into \nchoosing cigarettes\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\nversus smokeless products or other nicotine products that might get \nthem off of cigarettes as an addiction.\n  In addition to not advancing the public health, I firmly believe this \nbill will further overburden the FDA and doom the FDA at its core \nmission of safety and efficacy of drugs and devices and biologics and \nfood safety.\n  Again, Mr. President, I plan to visit the floor a lot, as will some \nof my colleagues, over the next several days as we have an opportunity \nto continue to talk about this bill but also to offer amendments on \nthis bill.\n  The FDA grew out of a single chemist in the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture in 1862 to a sprawling agency today of nearly 10,000 \nemployees comprising chemists, pharmacologists, physicians, \nmicrobiologists, veterinarians, pharmacists, lawyers, and many others. \nLet me assure you, they are some of the most talented people we have in \nthis country--the most dedicated professionals--to make sure this core \nmission is met every day. The worst mistake we could make is to give \nthem something that does not fit in the mission of FDA because I do not \ncare how much you try, you just cannot prove that tobacco is safe and \neffective. It just cannot happen.\n  If the effort is to get more Americans to make the choice of giving \nup the habit, then do not create a system that does not allow new \nproducts that Sweden and other countries have experienced reduce the \namount of usage. Certainly, do not fall prey to the belief that if we \npass this legislation we are going to reduce drastically the use of \ntobacco products. As a matter of fact, as CDC proved, doing nothing \nreduces the use of tobacco products 2 percent more than if we pass the \nKennedy bill. CBO estimate for the Kennedy bill; CDC estimate if we do \nnothing.\n  If the effort is to get it right, one would suggest we are doing it \nwrong. If the effort is to make sure we address public health to reduce \nthe prevalence of youth usage, not to limit the choice of adults, why \nin the world would you give it to an agency, jeopardizing its core \nmission by prescribing to the agency an impossible task of bringing \nnew, reduced-risk products to the marketplace?\n  Where would you create a new regulatory body where you grandfathered \nevery product that currently contributes to death and disease and say: \nIf new products are created that reduce the risk, that reduce the harm, \nwe are going to make it unbelievably difficult for you to be able to \nmarket those products. I do not think that is what the term ``only in \nAmerica'' was meant to portray. The insanity of what this institution \nis getting ready to do--why, the American people, they must think we \nare crazy by now. If they do not today, they will by the time this bill \npasses.\n  Again, Mr. President, I will be on the floor frequently between now \nand then. I am committed to not only point out the difficulties and \nchallenges of the legislation that serves as the base bill but am \ncommitted early on to present a substitute bill that brings every bit \nas much regulatory oversight and responsibility to the tobacco industry \nbut will allow new, less harmful products to come to the market that \nwill allow adults--people of legal age--to choose to use those \nproducts, if they choose to, and especially to use them if they are \ntrying to reduce their dependency on smoking. That is the way you \nreduce the risk of death and disease. You reduce the cost of health \ncare in this country. It is not necessarily by allowing the FDA to have \njurisdiction. If I was wrong, I would not point to these States that \nunderfunded the commitment needed to successfully do cessation programs \nthat were paid by the tobacco industry and in most cases found that the \nprevalence of marijuana use among youth is higher than the prevalence \nof tobacco use. Marijuana is illegal. Tobacco does have an age \nlimitation.\n  Our belief that we can just wave a magic wand, give it to a new \nagency, and that youth numbers are going to go down--well, we might be \nlucky enough to get them to go down, probably not more than they are \nnaturally going down. I wish we were here debating why the prevalence \nof marijuana use--an illegal drug--is higher among America's youth than \ntobacco is. I think the country would be better served if that were the \ndebate we were having on the Senate floor and not a debate about how we \njeopardize the safety and efficacy of drugs and devices and cosmetics \nand food safety in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. This legislation has been a \nlong time coming, and for millions of Americans affected each day by \ntobacco addiction and the hazards of secondhand smoke, for hundreds of \nthousands diagnosed each year with lung or throat cancer, it provides \npotentially lifesaving protections that are long overdue.\n  I wish to commend Senator Kennedy for his leadership of the HELP \nCommittee in crafting this comprehensive bill. It will give the U.S. \nFood and Drug Administration the legal authority to regulate tobacco \nproducts, curb sales to children, and restrict misleading tobacco \nadvertising.\n  For many years, the Federal Government has known about the addictive \nnature of tobacco products and the damaging effects of cigarettes on \nsmokers. We have seen the seductive and deceptive advertisements that \nhave targeted children, women, minorities, and even smokers suffering \nfrom tobacco-related illnesses. We have read the evidence spelling out \nthe numerous carcinogens added over the years to increase consumers' \ndependency on cigarettes. Despite overwhelming data showing the \nproducts' destructive effects, the industry's representatives, under \noath, refuted well-documented scientific findings about the additives \nin their products and concealed their own internal research reports.\n  So far, the Federal Government has been powerless to effectively \nregulate the industry. The bill before us tackles this obstacle head-on \nand gives the FDA the power it has lacked in years past to make \nAmericans aware of tobacco's dangers and to reduce tobacco use. It is a \nmuch needed and responsible approach to the epidemic of smoking \naddiction in this country.\n  The toll taken by tobacco use in our Nation is devastating. State \ndata compiled by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids outlines the \neffects in my own State of Maryland. More than one in seven Maryland \nhigh school students smoke cigarettes, and each year 22,000 Maryland \nchildren try cigarettes for the first time. Of these, 6,600 become new \ndaily smokers each year. Although the sale of cigarettes to those under \n18 is illegal, 12.5 million packs of cigarettes are smoked by children \nin my State each year. It is clear that better tools and stronger \nenforcement of our laws are needed.\n  The mortality data shows why we must be alarmed by these numbers. \nMore than 6,800 Marylanders die each year from their own smoking, and \n780 nonsmokers die each year from exposure to secondhand smoke. For \nevery person in Maryland who dies from smoking, approximately 20 more \nMarylanders are suffering from serious smoking-caused diseases and \ndisabilities or other tobacco-caused health problems.\n  The Senate will begin to consider health reform legislation this \nmonth. A major goal of that effort will be to reduce health care costs \nin this Nation. Well, the legislation on the floor today is a good \nplace for us to start.\n  It is estimated that the annual health care expenditures in Maryland \nthat are directly caused by tobacco use totals almost $2 billion, and \nexpenditures from secondhand smoke exposure another $79 million. Our \nState's Medicaid budget alone spends $476 million each year to address \ntobacco-related illnesses. We can save health care costs and save lives \nby passing a strong tobacco regulation bill and sending it to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Perhaps the best case I can make for the passage of this bill comes \nfrom Ms. Geraldine Lloyd, who lives in nearby Frederick, MD. She is a \ncourageous woman who has asked that her story be shared with Congress \nso we can take the necessary actions to protect the\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\nAmerican people. Geraldine started smoking at the age of 15 and became \na pack-a-day smoker within the first year. Geraldine spent 15 years \ntrying to quit smoking but was unable to do so.\n  Finally, Geraldine was diagnosed with throat cancer. After radiation \nand 17 surgeries, she has been left speechless and has to breathe \nthrough a hole in her neck. After 11 years of not smoking, she was \ndiagnosed with lung cancer in 2004. In her own words, this is her \nstory:\n\n       I was born in 1943, into generations of smokers. Both my \n     grandfathers were North Carolina tobacco farmers, and my \n     mother's father was a lobbyist for Liggett & Myers Tobacco \n     Company. Although they died before I was born of heart \n     disease and lung cancer, they remained vivid symbols of my \n     roots, until four years ago, when I discovered that my \n     mother's grandfather coined the term ``I'd walk a mile for a \n     Camel'' and was paid royalties for the slogan until he died. \n     It was also the last cigarette I smoked.\n       I'm absolutely certain that I was addicted as a child to \n     secondhand smoke. I was constantly sick with chest infections \n     and spent the best years of my life coughing and struggling \n     to breathe. I loved sports, but never had the lung capacity \n     to participate because I was in a futile cycle of withdrawal. \n     I found no relief until I started smoking at the age of 15, \n     escalating to a pack a day within a year.\n       I didn't try to quit until my mother died in 1975 from \n     brain and lung cancer. But I couldn't. My father died four \n     short years later, from cancer of the throat and the lung. \n     They were both pack-a-day smokers.\n       Witnessing what smoking had done to them, I was determined \n     to stop. I spent the better part of 15 years trying to quit, \n     using every imaginable over-the-counter treatment as a way of \n     escape. I underwent hypnosis, therapy, acupuncture, patches, \n     gum, and could never remain abstinent for more than a few \n     weeks. Each and every time I quit and began again, the \n     addiction became more ruthless, leaving me less and less \n     capable of coping without them.\n       I was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1993, and through the \n     next four years I underwent radiation and surgery, and \n     sixteen subsequent surgeries to save my esophagus. Lengthy \n     stays in hospitals, and the stress of breathing through a \n     stoma (a hole in my neck), relieved me of the physical \n     addiction. Looking at myself in the mirror took care of the \n     rest.\n       Since then, I have been speechless, with the aid of \n     electro-larynx, and dedicated to helping children understand \n     addiction to nicotine. In 2004, after a lengthy recovery, and \n     11 years of not smoking, I was diagnosed with another cancer, \n     in the lung.\n       I'm in remission, but my life has been drastically changed. \n     The compromised life I lived while smoking was a vacation \n     compared to the life I've been forced to live since surviving \n     cancer.\n       The collective and unspeakable horror of allowing an \n     industry to run with a free license to kill is finally being \n     heard. We represent lives of freedom and happiness robbed \n     from nicotine addiction due to an industry that remains \n     unregulated, with rampant freedom to manipulate their product \n     to suit their greed. I have survived, but so many do not. \n     Sometimes survival is the cruelest joke against tobacco's \n     victims. The tobacco industry has been laying down a genetic \nmap of pain, suffering, sorrow, and unconscionable human injustice for \ndecades, and it is time for it to stop.\n\n  Mr. President, I want Geraldine Lloyd to know we have heard her \nmessage and we take it to heart. It is time to empower the Federal \nGovernment, through the FDA, to put an end to the tobacco industry's \nlongstanding practices and to begin to eliminate the threat of tobacco-\nrelated illnesses that have taken so many American lives and harmed so \nmany others.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it overwhelmingly. We owe it to our children, we \nowe it to our Nation, and we owe it to Geraldine Lloyd.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I know we are going to have a lot to say \nabout the pending business, the FDA tobacco bill, over the course of \nthe week. I have a number of amendments, and I know many of my \ncolleagues also have amendments they wish to offer as well.\n  Those amendments and the specific concerns they seek to address we \nwill have an opportunity to discuss when we get to that stage of the \nprocess. For the moment, I simply want to lay out some of my general \nconcerns about this legislation.\n  This broad, sweeping legislation will have a devastating impact on \nthe economy in my State of North Carolina and on the lives of many of \nmy constituents. In my State, we have 12,000 tobacco farmers. We also \nhave over 65,000 jobs in North Carolina tied to the tobacco industry. \nNorth Carolina generates about $587 million annually in farm income \nfrom tobacco. The economic impact of tobacco in North Carolina is $7 \nbillion.\n  As you know, we are in the midst of an economic crisis, and the bill \nbefore us today is further going to devastate our economy in North \nCarolina by putting thousands of people out of work and exacerbating \nthe already high level of unemployment throughout the State.\n  First, we are going to hear about how this bill will prevent youth \nfrom taking up smoking. I fully support that goal. In fact, I know that \nevery day probably about 3,500 youth across the United States try their \nfirst cigarette, and another thousand become regular, daily smokers. \nClearly, we have to do something to prevent youth smoking.\n  But the bill before us goes much further than that. It grants the FDA \nextremely broad authority to take actions that it considers to be in \nthe interest of public health. That is an interesting standard--\nespecially when you consider that cigarettes, when used as intended, \nare a dangerous, unhealthy product. I know that and you know that.\n  Given that cigarettes are an unhealthy product, asking the FDA to \ntake actions in the interest of public health puts them in a very \ndifficult position. It creates a practically unprecedented regulatory \nconundrum for the FDA that will require them to go much farther than \nthe stated mission of reducing youth smoking.\n  Another issue is the product standards. Under the bill we are going \nto be considering this week, not only can the FDA take actions that \nreduce smoking, but they would also have the authority to change what \nactually constitutes a cigarette. I will discuss that point in more \ndetail later, but I will state now that, unequivocally, this bill gives \nthe FDA the authority to set standards for tobacco products, whether or \nnot the technology actually exists today to meet those changing \nstandards.\n  If we are, one, asking the FDA to set standards in the interest of \npublic health and, two, we are giving them the authority to require the \nremoval of harmful components from tobacco products--including \ncomponents that are native to the tobacco leaf itself--and, three, if \nwe are allowing them to move forward with these regulations even if the \ntechnology doesn't exist today, what do we expect the FDA to do? What \nwould any of us do if we were in that position? This legislation puts \nthe FDA in an impossible situation.\n  I will close by saying that I have many friends in North Carolina who \nare wonderful tobacco farmers. Many of their families have been growing \ntobacco for generations. I am very concerned about the impact this bill \nwill have on their livelihood. I think that a reasonable compromise can \nbe found on this bill, and I look forward to discussing some of the \nways this legislation can be improved as we move forward in the \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment that \nmy friend from Kansas, Senator Brownback, and I will be introducing at \nthe appropriate time, to this very important underlying bill that we \nhave in front of us. I want to particularly thank our majority leader \nfor supporting this effort, given the important timing of this \nparticular legislation to the economy and to those involved in our auto \nindustry--our dealers in communities across the country. I thank him \nfor allowing us to put this forward and hopefully have the support of \ncolleagues to be able to place this on this bill so it can be moved to \nthe President as quickly as possible. Timing is very much of the \nessence on this amendment.\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\n  I also thank Senators Durbin, Voinovich, Levin, Brown, Mikulski, \nLieberman, and others who are cosponsoring the legislation we have \nintroduced, and those who are cosponsoring this amendment as well.\n  This is the Drive America Forward Act. It will save jobs in America. \nIt will help our dealers across the country, both those who are going \nforward as dealers and those who, under Chrysler and GM bankruptcies, \nhave been told that they will have to either liquidate or look for \nother options as business people. It will help stimulate the economy. \nThis is very much a stimulus. It will save money for consumers. And it \nwill also lower carbon emissions--all of that in one amendment. We are \nvery hopeful that we will have a strong bipartisan vote at the \nappropriate time when this amendment comes forward.\n  Under the program that we are outlining in our amendment, consumers \nmay trade in their older vehicles and receive vouchers worth up to \n$4,500 toward the purchase of a new vehicle that is more fuel \nefficient, a car or truck that is, in fact, more fuel efficient.\n  I thank colleagues in the House who have done terrific work on this \nparticular piece of legislation. Chairman Waxman and Congressman \nMarkey, and Congressman Stupak and Congressman Dingell from Michigan, \nworked together through the Energy and Commerce Committee in the \ncontext of the bill that was reported out a couple of weeks ago from \nEnergy and Commerce on energy and climate change. They had this \nprovision in their legislation. I thank them.\n  We have taken their language, working with them every step of the \nway. We have addressed some issues to allow dealers to make sure this \nis operationally going to work best in terms of the administrative side \nof it. We have combined those efforts into this amendment. It is \ncritical that we pass it at this time.\n  It goes, really almost without saying, when we look at what happened \nyesterday with General Motors, when we look at what happened in terms \nof Chrysler--and we are looking for some very good news either by the \nend of this week or next week on Chrysler, hopefully to come out of \nbankruptcy--wouldn't it be a wonder that, as they do, we have in place \nan incentive program for purchasing new vehicles, turning in older \nvehicles and purchasing new ones?\n  We will get people back into these dealerships. We will be able to \nhelp communities across the country, neighborhoods, large and small, \nwhere the local dealership is, where, because of the economy, because \nof the lack of financing for too long--and we appreciate President \nObama and the auto team in helping create the financing mechanisms for \npeople to finance the purchasing of a vehicle and for dealers to \nfinance their floor plans--for too long everyone was hit by the global \ncredit crisis, the economy and the economy at large. We found an \nextremely difficult situation for dealers as well as the automakers and \nsuppliers.\n  Obviously, there are still many challenges. We know that thousands of \ndealerships across the country are currently in peril. This is an \nopportunity to immediately stimulate auto sales, to bring people back \ninto the dealerships, to turn in vehicles that are worth $4,500 or \nless--and this is a program where you are taking the old vehicle off \nthe road, so we know we are not talking about somebody turning in a \nvehicle that is worth $10,000 or $15,000 for a $4,500 voucher--older \nvehicles, vehicles that we know are less fuel efficient, to turn those \nin, get them off the road, buy a new vehicle and, at the same time, \nhave the other benefits that go with it.\n  We know that across the country it is not only the automakers about \nwhich I care deeply, as do others, and the great suppliers of the \nindustry but the dealers, and from sales to administrative staff, to \nadvertising outlets, to the local suppliers. Many dealerships are being \nforced to close or cut back because vehicle sales are down. This will \nhelp immediately. It couldn't come at a more important time.\n  The Drive America Forward Act will send buyers back to showrooms, \nkeep people working in cities and towns across America.\n  President Obama called on us yesterday to pass a fleet modernization \nbill, to increase demand and get buyers back into the showrooms. Our \nbill does exactly that. Sometimes it is called cash for clunkers. \nSometimes it is called fleet modernization. We call it a good old-\nfashioned jobs bill. This is Drive America Forward. That is exactly \nwhat we want to do with this amendment. It will stimulate the economy.\n  New vehicle sales are down nearly 40 percent compared to last year \ndue, in large part, to the credit crisis, to job losses, and dwindling \nconsumer confidence. It has affected every automaker, not only GM, \nFord, and Chrysler, which I am very proud to have as part of Michigan's \neconomy, but every single automaker has been affected which is why \nother countries have responded with similar plans.\n  If we look right now, auto sales are down 40 percent from last year. \nIf we look at January to May of this year and January to May of last \nyear, there is a 40-percent reduction. Imagine a dealer, an automaker \nor supplier trying to keep the doors open and 40 percent of their \nbusiness is down. GM is down 41.8 percent; Toyota, 39 percent; Ford, \n36.8 percent; Chrysler, 46.3 percent; Honda, 34.4 percent. We could \nkeep right on going across the board as we look at auto companies and \nwhat is happening. This would be available to all the dealers, all the \nauto companies.\n  At this point, we want to make sure we are providing stimulus across \nthe board in the economy. The average dealership employs 53 people, so \nwe are talking truly about small businesses. That is almost 160,000 \npeople nationwide, more than the combined workforce of GM and Chrysler. \nThat is how many people work for dealerships. This is about getting \npeople into the dealership, getting people back into a position to buy \nautomobiles and to keep those folks working and keep the economy going \nin communities across the country. Moreover, local dealerships have cut \nspending on advertising, as companies have, which hurts newspapers and \nradio and television revenue at a time when local businesses are \nsuffering. We know the stories. We have heard of the ripple effect. We \nhave heard from those dealerships that are being given notice about \nclosing, the impact of that.\n  I have said before, I grew up in one of those dealerships. My dad and \ngrandfather, in a community of about 2,500 people in Clare, MI, had the \nOlds dealership. We were very proud of that. One of the side benefits \nfor me is I always had an automobile to drive. That made me pretty \npopular among my friends, although they only let me drive the old ones. \nBut the reality is, this is a part of the fabric of America. When we \ntalk about my dad and grandpa's dealership, they were the ones \nsponsoring the Little League team and buying the ads in the newspapers \nand the nonprofits that were doing fundraising drives and so on. This \nbill, the Drive America Forward Act, will help places such as my dad's \nand grandpa's. That is what this is all about.\n  It is going to save money for consumers. The Department of Energy \nestimates that a consumer who drives a vehicle that gets 30 miles per \ngallon will save approximately $780 a year compared to a vehicle that \ngets 18 miles per gallon. We are saying under this program that if you \nhave a car that gets 18 miles per gallon or less, you qualify. You turn \nit in, you can get a higher mileage vehicle and get from $3,500 to \n$4,500. We are saving consumers money by that.\n  In Michigan right now, everybody I know who is in Michigan could find \na lot of ways to use $780 more as a result of that savings.\n  In addition to saving jobs, the program will save fuel. As buyers \nturn in their older, less-efficient cars, more fuel-efficient vehicles \nwill take their place, and the fuel savings could exceed 1 billion \ngallons per year.\n  Finally, the bill helps lower carbon emissions. If the program \nremoves 10 percent of the V-8 engines from the road, carbon dioxide \nemissions will be reduced by tens of millions of metric tons annually. \nIt can take up to 20 years to replace most cars on the road today with \nnew, more efficient cars. That could take longer because of the \neconomic downturn. People are waiting to buy a new car. Automotive \npurchases are way down, about 40 percent. This will turn that around. \nThis will help incentivize turning that around.\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\n  The oldest cars on the road are also the ones that pollute the most. \nThe dirtiest 10 percent of the cars account for more than 50 percent of \nthe smog and carbon monoxide. The dirtiest one-third of the fleet \naccounts for more than 80 percent of the pollution. The dirtiest one-\nthird of the automobiles account for 80 percent of the pollution. I \ntalk about these issues because they are very important. I also go back \nto the beginning. This is about a stimulus. This is a terrific thing, \nthat we are adding cost savings and fuel economy savings and getting \nrid of carbon pollution. This is all very good. There will be others \nwho talk about other ways to do this that would have more savings on \nthat end. Unfortunately, it would sacrifice our ability to help the \nauto industry.\n  Right now what we have is the ability to do both. It is critically \nimportant that whatever we do, we make sure our American automakers can \nbenefit. We have to make sure we are not putting in place something \nwhere the fuel efficiency standards, the goals are so high or written \nin a way that creates an incentive for foreign automakers, while \ncurbing those folks right now who need our help the most.\n  This is a balanced bill. This gives us the ability to benefit from \nincreased fuel efficiency. It gives us the ability to deal with cost, \nto deal with carbon pollution. But it does so in a way that, at the end \nof the day, treats American automakers fairly and gives them the \nopportunity fully to participate, so the Chrysler dealers we have been \nhearing from, the GM dealers, as well as the great Ford Motor Company \nwill be able to benefit as much as the other companies. That is what \nthis does. That is why there has been a tremendous effort put into \nthis. It doesn't seem like it would take that much to put this \ntogether, but in order to make sure we are complying with our trade \nlaws, so we were allowing any company to participate under our trade \nlaws but making sure we were being fair to our own companies that have \nbeen here and created the middle class of this country and are going \nthrough so much right now, every single line has been reviewed and \ndiscussed and reviewed again.\n  The House did terrific work, putting together language that is fair \nfor everybody. That is what this bill is all about.\n  In the context of talking about all the hard work, I thank my key \nstaff person, Colleen Briggs, who has lived and breathed this issue for \nseveral months. I told her I would name this after her, at least in my \noffice, because there has been so much work that has had to go into \nthis effort. I thank her for her hard work. I thank also the White \nHouse auto task force that has been so committed to doing whatever we \ncan to support jobs here, manufacturing jobs, auto jobs, and every way \nwe can to incentivize, whether it is being able to get the financing \none needs, supporting the industries as they go through the bankruptcy \nprocess or this incentive. I thank them for their support in doing \nthat.\n  I also, once again, thank my friend from Kansas who has been a \nstalwart on this issue. We have had a true partnership on this which I \nappreciate very much. I very much appreciate that both of us are \nleading this effort, as well as other colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who are cosponsoring this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague \nfrom Michigan in support of this bill. This is the right way forward. \nShe has outlined most of the provisions, and I will add a few points, \nif I may.\n  It is a humbling time for auto manufacturers globally. She went \nthrough the figures for all auto manufacturers, and there has been a \nhuge falloff in the market. As the global credit crisis has impacted \nthe world, maybe the industry hit the most has been automobile \nmanufacturing on a global basis. We saw the numbers in the United \nStates. One of the ways other countries have responded is with what \nthey call scrappage programs. We have heard it referred to in different \nterms but several countries have looked at doing a type of scrappage \nprogram. It has been very successful. I was looking at the numbers. In \nMarch, Germany, France, and China saw increases in car sales--all three \ndid scrappage programs--of 40 percent, 8 percent, and 8 percent, \nrespectively.\n  During the same period of time, the United States and the United \nKingdom did not have scrappage programs, and we saw declines in car \nsales of 37 percent here and 30 percent in Great Britain. That is the \ndifference these programs are making on a global basis because the \ncredit crisis has hit this industry the most. A lot of things one has \nto buy on a regular basis. We have to buy gasoline, food, shoes for the \nkids. But often, for a lot of people, they look at their car or pickup, \nand they say: I am not sure what is going to take place. I will hold \noff on this one. So they hold off and the sales tank. That is what has \ntaken place. People say: I am not sure what is going to take place; \ntherefore, I am going to hold off.\n\n  I have a brother who is a veterinarian who was saying to me the other \nday--he has an old pickup in his business. He is doing just fine in his \nbusiness. He said: I am just going to wait a while. I said: No. This is \nthe time we need you in the marketplace. This gets him back to the \nmarketplace. It has been proven effective in other countries to get \npeople back in the marketplace. It has worked in other places. We now \nsee that the United Kingdom--that did not do the scrappage program--has \nenacted their own scrappage program. That is another reason why I think \nwe should do that one here.\n  There is another point, and I think it is an important one to make. \nIt is often very difficult to find ways to support manufacturing \nwithout breaking international trade rules because we have a number of \ninternational trade rules that restrict what governments can do to help \na particular industry.\n  As to the World Trade Organization, this is a legal and consistent \nway for us to help automobile manufacturing without breaking any trade \nrules. That is important because we cannot be getting into some sort of \ntrade sanctioning or there being offsets to it. This one is consistent \nwith that.\n  Another thing I think is very important--and my colleague from \nMichigan was very good to talk about this--this is a balanced approach \nthat helps the environment, helps the economy, and helps our energy \nsector as well with us being more efficient with energy.\n  I think as we move forward with concerns about CO2, \nconcerns about the environment, concerns about the economy, concerns \nabout domestic energy production and the need for domestic energy \nproduction, we have to balance the three Es: energy, the environment, \nand the economy. This bill does that. So here you are stimulating the \neconomy, reducing your energy demand, and improving your environment--\nall at the same time.\n  And this bill--and this, to me, as a fiscal conservative, is the key \npoint--also uses funds that have already been appropriated. There is no \nnew money on this bill. These funds have been appropriated. They are \ngoing to be reprogrammed. I believe they will be reprogrammed. We are \nbeing told by the Obama administration that if this passes, this will \nbe implemented with reprogrammed funds. So those funds--having already \nbeen approved by the Congress--would be used in a more effective way \nfor a consumer-driven economic stimulus that helps the local \ndealerships, that helps the car manufacturers, that helps the \nenvironment, that helps our energy dependency in a very positive way.\n  It has worked around the world. It will work in the United States. It \nwill get people such as my brother back in the showroom, I hope. I am \ncertainly going to push him to do that, as all of us will. We have seen \nan unprecedented falloff in car sales. It helps in a State such as mine \nwhere there are a lot of work trucks being used. This voucher program \nis targeted for use and utility by businesses that use trucks, and they \ncan use that on this one as well. It works, and it helps out there.\n  For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It \nis balanced. We have worked a long time on it.\n  Senator Stabenow recognized her staff member. I have had Landon \nFulmer in my office working for some period of time on this issue to \nget it to where it would work. It would be simple, it would be direct, \nit would hit, and it would hit quickly. He has\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\nworked to do that, as her staff has. I think we have got a good product \nhere, and it is not any new appropriated money.\n  I would say particularly to my colleagues on my side that I am very \nconcerned about where our deficit and debt is going. This is no new \nappropriated money to do this, which I think is key.\n  For those reasons, I urge the backing of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.\n  Let me be clear from the outset. Thanks to public information \ncampaigns that have been waged for decades, the 45 million Americans \nwho smoke already know that cigarettes are dangerous. If you smoke, \nchances are you could die from smoking.\n  This legislation does little, if anything, to change that. The \nproponents of the bill say it is public health legislation that will \nlower the cost of medical care. That is a very noble goal. Everyone is \nin favor of saving lives and bringing down health care costs.\n  But this bill will not accomplish that. Instead, it engages in \noverregulation with no practical effect on smoking rates. The \nCongressional Budget Office says it would only result in a 2-percent \nreduction in smoking rates over 10 years and would have a minimal \nimpact on health care savings.\n  Meanwhile, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, smoking rates are already declining an average of 2 to 4 \npercent over that same period of time. So according to the CDC, if we \ndo nothing, we will still have a decline in smoking rates equal to or \ngreater than what CBO says this bill will do.\n  The goal of any Federal tobacco regulation should be to keep children \nfrom smoking or using tobacco products and to help adult users stop or, \nat a very minimum, to use a less harmful product. But the bill does \njust the opposite. If this bill passes, cigarette manufacturers such as \nPhilip Morris and Reynolds America will be prevented from using the \nterms ``light'' and ``low tar.'' That means their cigarettes will still \nbe on the market but under different names, not leading to fewer \nsmokers, but leading to consumer confusion.\n  Just as bad is the overregulation that this bill will put on the \nalready beleaguered tobacco farmer, in effect, helping put those who \nare left out of business. It would allow the FDA to enter just about \nany tobacco farm in the country. And it would indirectly require \ntobacco manufacturers to dictate production methods to farmers. It \nwould also require the development of a new, unnecessary regulatory \nprocess at the FDA to set pesticide residue tolerances. This would \nduplicate a process that already exists at the Environmental Protection \nAgency. It makes no sense to pile these new responsibilities onto the \nFDA since the agency is barely able to keep up with its present duties.\n  Oddly, under this bill, the FDA--an agency that is designed with \nensuring the safety of drugs--would be given regulatory authority over \nan inherently dangerous product.\n  Again, cigarettes will kill you. We have known that for decades. Even \nif the FDA managed to cut smoking-related deaths in half, it would \nstill be vested with regulating a product that kills 200,000 people \neach year.\n  The American Association of Public Health Physicians has said that \neven if the FDA has the authority to remove some harmful ingredients in \ncigarettes, changing the chemical nature of tobacco itself or lowering \nnicotine levels will not measurably reduce tobacco-related illness and \ndeath.\n  This bill is slated to spend $5.4 billion taxpayer dollars to provide \neven more Federal regulation which will have no real effect. About a \nquarter of that money will be raised off the backs of our men and women \nin uniform, who will be forced into a mandatory thrift savings plan \nprogram to pay for yet another Government program that simply does not \nwork.\n  This legislation mandates TSP participation for new Government and \nmilitary personnel. This may sound good in theory, but even with an \nopt-out provision--which the legislation does call for--it is bad \npolicy for our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, and marines, who, at \njunior ranks, frankly, earn very little money and are often under 20 \nyears of age. That is why the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nopposes this provision and says if you are going to have any revenue-\nraising money, it should be an opt-in provision with respect to TSP for \nour military men and women.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Admiral \nMullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                      Chairman of the Joint Chiefs\n\n\n                                                      of Staff\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 2009.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for your letter of concern \n     regarding H.R. 1256, the Family Smoking Prevention and \n     Tobacco Control Act.\n       I have reviewed the legislative language and the Services' \n     views on the pending legislation. I disagree with the \n     language contained in H.R. 1256, Division B, Title I, Section \n     102(a)(2)(E)(ii). While this language allows for Services to \n     suspend automatic enrollment, which is the preference of the \n     Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, I disagree with placing \n     the onus on the Service Secretaries to ``opt-out'' of \n     automatic enrollment.\n       My recommendation is that the language should be written to \n     reflect that the Service Secretaries must ``opt-in'' if they \n     desire to make enrollment in TSP automatic for Service \n     members.\n       Thank you for your concern regarding the financial well \n     being of our Service members. I am sure you will agree with \n     me that financial education by our senior leaders is \n     paramount, and I have every confidence in their abilities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     M. G. Mullen,\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, we may not like smoking, and we should \ndo everything we can to keep cigarettes away from children. But adults \nin this country have a choice, and many of them, aware of the inherent \ndangers, still choose to smoke. Spending billions of taxpayer dollars \non an ineffective program to convince them otherwise, while regulating \nour farmers out of business, and taking away more of our troops' \npaychecks, is not good policy. It is more shortsighted government.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wish to speak for a few minutes on the \nbill we are proceeding toward and to ask a few questions of the \nAmerican public.\n  We have a bill that is going to regulate tobacco, and I am OK with us \nregulating tobacco. I do not have any problems with it. I think we \nshould do it. What we should be doing is banning tobacco. Nobody up \nhere has the courage to do that. It is a big business. There are \nmillions of Americans who are addicted to nicotine. And even if they \nare not addicted to the nicotine, they are addicted to the habit.\n  But we have a bill, we are trying to do something positive, and we \nfind ourselves constrained by our own shortsighted vision. We have an \nagency called the Food and Drug Administration. I have had a lot of \nexperience with them. I manufactured medical devices in the 1970s and \nhad several investigational new drug permits under them. I know the \nrigors under which INDs are managed and the care that is put forth by \nthe employees of the Food and Drug Administration, as well as their \nadvisory councils, as we go through that.\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\n  But if we go back and look at the charge of what the Food and Drug \nAdministration is, the Food and Drug Administration is about safety and \nefficacy--``safety,'' meaning they are responsible to make the judgment \nthat if we are going to approve this medicine or this device that is \nwithin an acceptable risk--there is always going to be down sides to \nanything they approve, but within an acceptable risk, in total, it is \ngoing to be better for the country.\n  In this bill, we allow existing tobacco products not ever to be \neliminated. So we are going to take products that we know are not safe \nand we know are not efficacious and we are going to apply the resources \nof an agency that is having trouble meeting its demands right now, as \nwell as meeting the demands of food safety right now, and we are going \nto take resources and put them there.\n  The first problem with that is we send a totally mixed message to the \nFood and Drug Administration: Your job is no longer about safety and \nefficacy; your job now is to warn everybody about the downside of \ntobacco.\n  We know that. What we have to do is stop new addiction. We know that. \nIf we really want to make a difference in health and we want to \neliminate dependence on tobacco, what we have to do is to stop the \naddiction. We have had all of these lawsuits through the years where \nbillions of dollars have gone into attorneys' coffers, and about 40 \npercent of it has gone into, supposedly, stop-tobacco-use programs, and \nwe are going to say to the Food and Drug Administration: Your job is \nabout safety and efficacy, making sure that what it says it does, it \ndoes, and we are going to turn them into a different kind of agency. I \nbelieve that is where this bill is misdirected.\n  We ought to have an agency that does control tobacco, that does \nheavily regulate its advertising in terms of the warnings on the \npackages, in terms of limiting what young people can get to, so we can \nactually stop this trend toward addiction. But to do it in the Food and \nDrug Administration sends a mixed message: No longer is our job \nefficacy, no longer is our job safety; our job is to control \nadvertising, we are going to control packaging, we are going to control \nand have them report to us on the contents of all of these thousands of \nbad products that are associated with tobacco, that are in tobacco--not \njust nicotine and not just the effects of the tobacco, whether it be \ninhaled or chewed or sucked on. The fact is, we are going to change the \ndirection of the agency.\n  So what should we do? We should regulate tobacco. We should set up a \nway for us to do that which will effectively stop new addiction, \nespecially among young people because that is where it starts. It \nstarts with the young, and there are certain personality types as well \nas certain genotypes that, even with some of the medicines we have \ntoday, cannot wean themselves from the addiction to nicotine.\n  So why wouldn't we go another way? We have the Department of Health \nand Human Services, of which FDA is a part. Why wouldn't we create a \nsmaller agency that is just about tobacco, just about regulating \ntobacco, so that we can see clearly--and we can also do it, by the way, \nfor about a fourth of the cost of what it is going to cost to do it \nunder the FDA. So for one-fourth of the cost, we can create a new \nagency within HHS that will be solely focused on this and this only, \nthat will have one primary objective, and we will force and guide and \ndirect and measure whether they are accomplishing their purpose. \nInstead, we are going to hide it in another agency that is struggling \ntoday.\n  We are at $400 million to get a new drug through the FDA right now. \nThat is the cost of processing. That doesn't even talk about the \nresearch costs, but the new drug. That is just the cost to get it \nthrough the trials and get it through the FDA. We have all of these \ndrugs today that aren't approved, that could be saving people's lives, \nbecause we can't get it through the FDA. And now, what are we going to \nplace on the FDA? We are going to place the regulation of tobacco on \nthe FDA.\n  Tobacco is not safe. In no way is it efficacious for any individual. \nYet we are going to put a segment within the FDA and say: Run it the \nway you are running the rest of the business. It makes absolutely no \nsense to me. It doesn't mean that the goal behind this legislation \nisn't a good goal. It is. It is a good goal, but how we are doing it \nand where we put the control of this is totally counterintuitive.\n  I think if you would ask anybody in America, you want the people who \nare approving the drugs that are good for you to also control--why \ndon't we put alcohol under them? Why don't we put the DEA under them, \nunder the FDA? If, in fact, we want a controlling agency, then let's \nmove it to the DEA--the Drug Enforcement Agency--or Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms, right? Why don't we put it in ATF? We already have other \nagencies. But to put it in the FDA, when the total goal of the FDA is \nto approve new products for our benefit, our safety, and to cure health \nneeds--tobacco creates health needs; it doesn't cure them. The only \nthing I know that it cures is if you get a wasp or a red hornet sting \nand you take some chewing tobacco and put it on the sting, it takes the \npain away. I experienced that a lot as a young boy. My grand dad would \npull it out and put that plug right there, and the pain would go away \nvery quickly. That is the only efficacious thing I know about tobacco.\n  So I would just ask my colleagues to think again about what we are \ndoing. Let's do the intent of the bill, but let's do it in a way that \nmakes sense, that doesn't send a cross signal, and either put it into \none of the other organizations we already have that is handling \nproducts that are bad for Americans--not products that are good for \nAmericans--or let's put it into a separate agency where we can see it \ntransparently and clearly.\n  I wish to make one other point. Inside this bill is the banning of \nany new nicotine products. I wish to tell my colleagues that is totally \nshortsighted. If you are a smoker today and we could get you off of \nsmoking even though we still give you nicotine and we can do that \nthrough a new product, such as a dissolvable flavored lozenge, where we \nsupply the nicotine addiction to your body but you are no longer \ncreating lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bolus \nemphysema, or increasing your chances for heart disease and \nhypertension, markedly increasing your chances for lung cancer, if we \ncould convert that to something that would satisfy the demand yet \nwouldn't harm the rest of your body--we ban that in this bill. We stop \nall positive movement through commercial products to create a nicotine \nsource that is other than chewing tobacco or cigarettes or cigars.\n  So why would we want to do that, especially if, in fact, we could \ntake these millions of smokers today who, most of them, their habit \nis--there are two addictions they have. One is the nicotine craving \nthat actually hits at the intercellular level. It is called a \nnicotinergic interface in terms of receptors on certain parts of the \nbody. If we could do that in a way that would allow us to put nicotine \nin there to solve it but not cause all of the other disease, why would \nwe say with this piece of legislation that we are never going to let \nthat happen? Yet we are. I don't understand it. We could do that in a \nway where that could be highly restricted to only people who had a \nprescription, where they were already nicotine addicted.\n  So there are things we are missing in here from a general health \nstandpoint that are going to be very harmful because what we are saying \nis: You can use the nicotine patch, you can take some of the new drugs \nthat work in the brain to relieve the nicotine addiction, but rather \nthan supply something in a harmless way that has no other ill health \neffects--I don't understand why we would not do that.\n  So I would appreciate my colleagues considering my comments. I \nbelieve the FDA is the last place we ought to put this. I think we \nought to do it. We ought to change some of the things on how we are \ngoing to do it. We ought to create a capability to have nicotine \nsupplied other than through chewing tobacco or cigars or cigarettes so \nthat we can take the effects of it that we know are very harmful today \nand lessen them for the citizens who are addicted to nicotine.\n  My hope is that we wake up before we pass this bill because what we \nare really going to do is we are kind of shooting ourselves in the \nfoot. If we really want to stop and help those people who are already \naddicted and really want to prevent new addictions, then\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\nwe have to allow for some of these new products, and we ought to do it \nat an agency that doesn't have purposes counter to what the charge of \nthat agency is.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my friend from Oregon. I also thank \nhim for being so kind to allow me to go first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, let me tell \nthe distinguished Senator from Oklahoma that I very much appreciate \nworking with him on health care legislation. We did it in the House, \nand we are going to do it again. I think this time the Senate is going \nto make history and have comprehensive health reform, and I look \nforward to working with my colleague on it.\n  I come here today to express my strong support for the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act. The lead sponsor of this \nlegislation is, of course, Senator Kennedy. I say ``of course'' because \nthe fact is, for four decades Senator Kennedy, often against great \nodds, has consistently come back again and again to lead the fight to \nimprove health care for the people of our country. Sometimes it was for \nchildren. Sometimes it was for seniors. Sometimes it was for the \ndisabled. Sometimes it was for those who have suffered mental illness. \nI could go on and on, and we would be here until breakfast time if I \nwere to try to itemize all of the major pieces of health reform \nlegislation Senator Kennedy has authored over the last four decades. It \nis very appropriate that he is the lead sponsor of this legislation. \nThe fact is, after Congress passes this important bill and takes steps \nto improve public health, we will be very fortunate that Senator \nKennedy is going to lead the Senate once more on comprehensive health \nreform. I wish to make clear as a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee that I am very much looking forward to Senator Kennedy's \ninvolvement in this issue and his championing of the cause of fixing \nAmerican health care. He has been the leader on this issue for four \ndecades.\n  I come to this topic with I think a personal perspective that also \naffects my role as a policymaker. In 1994, when I was a Member of the \nHouse, I served on the Health and Environment Subcommittee. It was \nchaired by Henry Waxman, a great champion of trying to protect children \nagainst the dangers of tobacco. Chairman Waxman had the CEOs of major \ntobacco companies before his subcommittee. He put all of the CEOs under \noath, and as expected, Chairman Waxman did a tremendous job in terms of \nlaying out the case for public health. In fact, he was so effective, \nthat by the time it came to my turn, I was hard-pressed to find a \nquestion he hadn't already asked the tobacco CEOs. Just as I was \nthinking about packing up, I turned to some of Chairman Waxman's staff, \nwho are wonderful public servants, and I asked whether any of the \nmembers of our committee had asked the tobacco executives if they \nthought nicotine was addictive. The staff all told me nobody had. They \nsaid: You ought to ask them. I wish to take a minute to lay out that \nhistorical record of what happened.\n  I asked each one of the tobacco executives that day back in April of \n1994 whether they thought nicotine was addictive. The president of \nPhilip Morris spoke first and said:\n\n       I believe nicotine is not addictive, Yes.\n\n  Then the chairman and CEO of Reynolds Tobacco Company spoke and said:\n\n       Mr. Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not \n     meet the classic definition of addiction. There is no \n     intoxication.\n\n  Then the president of U.S. Tobacco spoke. He said:\n\n       I don't believe that nicotine or our products are \n     addictive.\n\n  The chairman and CEO of Lorillard said:\n\n       I believe that nicotine is not addictive.\n\n  The chairman and CEO of the Liggett Group said:\n\n       I believe nicotine is not addictive.\n\n  The chairman and CEO of Brown & Williamson said:\n\n       I believe nicotine is not addictive.\n\n  Finally, the president and CEO of American Tobacco said:\n\n       I, too, believe that nicotine is not addictive.\n\n  I made a vow after I had asked that question that during the time I \nwould have the honor of serving in the House and later the Senate, to \nmake an effort to do everything I could to hold tobacco companies and \nother companies that mislead the American people accountable. Today, we \nare able to do that because of the outstanding leadership of Chairman \nKennedy. He is giving us the opportunity to hold accountable the \ntobacco companies that mislead the public with respect to their \nmarketing practices and with respect to advertising. The Kennedy \nlegislation is, in my view, very much needed to protect the public \nhealth--particularly the health of our young people--because it will \ngive us the authority to hold the tobacco companies accountable for \ntheir actions.\n  This is also relevant to the next major health bill that we will be \ndealing with in the Senate which will take the form of comprehensive \nhealth reform--health reform that ensures all Americans have good, \nquality, affordable coverage and, particularly, does so in a way that \nholds costs down.\n  I, gratefully, had a chance to meet with the President today at the \nWhite House. The President, who has clearly signaled this will be a top \npriority for him, has now sent the message that history, to a great \nextent, is going to judge us on our ability to hold down runaway health \ncosts and cut costs for American families.\n  In my home State alone, $1.1 billion in health care costs are \ndirectly attributed to smoking per year, and it costs the Oregon \nMedicaid Program nearly $287 million per year. Nationwide, $96 billion \nin health care costs are directly attributed to smoking. This includes \n$24.7 billion in smoking-caused Medicare expenditures.\n  There are enormous financial costs specifically associated with \npeople at an early age getting addicted to tobacco use. Then, of \ncourse, there is the extraordinary loss of life that comes about as a \nresult of tobacco. According to the Centers for Disease Control, in the \nUnited States, over 400,000 deaths each year are directly attributable \nto tobacco use. The FDA has given the authority to regulate food and \nprescription drugs, and it certainly makes sense that the FDA regulates \ntobacco, which is responsible for the death of over 400,000 Americans \nper year.\n  The Senate, because of the leadership of Senator Kennedy, has the \nunique opportunity to reduce the financial and human toll of tobacco. I \nwished to recount, briefly, that hearing in 1994, because ever since \nthat time, when the tobacco executives said under oath that nicotine \nwasn't addictive, I have wished to be part of an effort to hold the \ntobacco companies accountable when they mislead the American people. As \na result of the outstanding leadership of Chairman Kennedy, it is \npossible for the Senate to finally hold these companies accountable by \npassing this legislation. I hope that Senators on both sides of the \naisle will join me and Chairman Kennedy in supporting this long overdue \nbill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this week the Senate takes up a bill \nthat is long overdue. It is a historic opportunity for us to finally \nprotect our children in this country from tobacco addiction. I didn't \nrealize, when I was elected to the House of Representatives, in 1982, \nthat the issue of tobacco would be a major part of my congressional \nactivity. My family, similar to virtually every family in America, has \nbeen touched with tobacco death. My father died when he was 53 years \nold of lung cancer. I was 14 years old. He smoked two packs of Camels a \nday back in the 1950s, when even doctors were saying in magazines how \nsafe it was to smoke. His cough was a sound I will carry to the grave \nin my memory. When I hear that smoker's cough, I can pick it out of a \ncrowd. As a kid, I heard it over and over, night after night, day after \nday, until he passed away on November 13, 1959. That is my story on \ntobacco. Every family in America has a story to tell.\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\n  Tobacco products are some of the deadliest products sold in America \nbut, unfortunately, the least regulated.\n  The tobacco industry has been successful in keeping tobacco products \noutside the regulatory authority of the FDA. They said it is not food \nand it is not a drug; therefore, we are exempt. That specious argument \ncontinues until this day, when we are finally facing reality. Tobacco \nis, in fact, a carrier of a drug--nicotine--which is addictive. That \naddiction is what leads to more smoking, more tobacco exposure, and \nmore death.\n  The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act is a strong \nbill that will protect the public health and reduce tobacco use, \nespecially among kids.\n  Forty-three million American adults currently smoke. That is one in \nfive. Ninety percent of them started smoking in their teenage years, \nbefore they were adults. You wonder why. Well, I remember, when I was a \nkid, the first time my cousin, Mike Peterson, and I decided to sneak \nout behind the garage with cigarettes and try them out. It was an \nadventure. We were being like the grownups whom we wanted to be like \nsomeday. Luckily, for me, I stopped. Mike didn't. Mike passed away 10 \ndays ago. He was a year younger than I, but, unfortunately, the ravages \nof tobacco and the addiction lead to cancer, COPD, and ultimately cost \nhim his life at the age of 63. That happens a lot. Some kids quit, some \nkids don't quit; those who don't quit get addicted. Their addiction can \nlead to death, as it did for my cousin and childhood friend, Michael \nPeterson.\n  Every day in the United States more than 3,500 kids try smoking for \nthe first time. A thousand of them become regular daily smokers.\n  In Illinois, almost 20 percent of the kids smoke, and together they \nconsume about 34 million packs of cigarettes a year. We know tobacco is \nthe largest preventable cause of death in America. For the longest \ntime, the tobacco lobby held Congress in the grip of its hands. It \nwould not allow the passage of any significant legislation. It was too \npowerful.\n  We knew their power meant they would be able to continue to sell \ntheir products, leading to devastating results. A few years back, I \ndecided to take them on. It wasn't to get even for my own family \ncircumstance, but I thought there was an unfair and unjust situation. \nIt resulted in a change in the law, which changed a lot of things in \nthis country. Mine was the first bill to pass the ban smoking on \nairplanes. At the time, it was considered a fool's errand to try to \ndefeat the tobacco lobby. When I offered the bill in the House of \nRepresentatives, it was opposed by the leadership on both sides of the \naisle, Democrats and Republicans. Somehow or another, through faith and \ngood luck and the help of people such as former Senator and Congressman \nClaude Pepper of Florida, I was able to bring this matter to the floor \nfor a vote, and I won, to my great amazement. We banned smoking on \nairplanes for flights of 2 hours or less.\n  Eventually, Senator Lautenberg picked up the issue in the Senate, and \nhe showed amazing leadership in passing it in the Senate. The two of us \nmanaged to make this the law of the land. I don't want to take too much \ncredit, but once people started thinking: If secondhand smoke is unsafe \nin an airplane, why is it safe in a train or in a bus or in an office \nor in a school or in a hospital or in a hallway? Pretty soon, the \ndominoes started falling across America. Laws were passed--local, \nState, and Federal laws--which have made smoking the exception in \nclosed quarters and have changed the way we look at smoking today, from \nthe time just 15 or 16 years ago, when it was considered to be the \nnormal thing to do and objecting to it was considered out of normal.\n  That has changed, but still there is a lot to do. The tobacco \nindustry hasn't stopped. They are still selling and marketing their \nproduct. As they do, more and more people become addicted, get sick, \nand many of them die. Tobacco companies, it was found in 2006 by Judge \nKessler in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia, \nissued a final opinion finding that the tobacco companies had engaged \nin a decades-long scheme to deceive and defraud the American public.\n  Last month, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia issued a unanimous opinion upholding Judge \nKessler's finding of liability. Let's review some of Judge Kessler's \nfindings. He found the tobacco industry falsely denied, distorted, and \nminimized the significant adverse health consequences of smoking for \ndecades. The tobacco companies were aware that smoking and nicotine are \naddictive, but they publicly denied it.\n  Just 15 years ago, the CEOs from seven major tobacco companies stood \nbefore a committee of the House of Representatives, raised their hands, \nand swore under oath that nicotine was not addictive. That was the \ndeath knell of their credibility. People knew better. I knew better. My \ndad died from lung cancer. He couldn't stop smoking. My friend Mike \nPeterson died of COPD. He smoked a cigarette the night before he died. \nHe just couldn't stop. It is a terrible addiction.\n\n  The tobacco industry falsely denied that they can and do control the \nlevel of nicotine delivered in order to create and sustain addiction. \nThey knew they were piling that chemical into their product, and they \nknew that as long as they could, they had you hooked and it would be \ndarn tough to quit.\n  Tobacco companies falsely marketed so-called light and low-tar \ncigarettes. They turned out to be just as harmful as the others.\n  From the 1950s to the present day, tobacco companies have \nintentionally marketed to kids. Of course you want to convince kids to \nsmoke because they are not mature enough to make the right judgment. If \na kid waits until he becomes an adult to decide to smoke, he is not \ngoing to do it. He will be a lot smarter. He will not be addicted. \nTobacco companies track youth behavior and preferences and use \nmarketing themes that resonate with kids.\n  The list goes on and on and clearly demonstrates that this industry \ncannot be trusted to do the right thing. That is why we need the bill \nthat is on the floor of the Senate.\n  The tobacco industry has a long and disturbing history of marketing \nits products to kids and young people. The financial reasons are \nobvious. Ninety percent of adult smokers began smoking cigarettes when \nthey were teenagers or younger.\n  In the 1980s, R.J. Reynolds was looking for a way to revitalize its \nCamel brand, which was primarily popular with older smokers. To \nincrease Camel's appeal to younger smokers, it created the Joe Camel \ncartoon character. Joe Camel became as recognizable as Mickey Mouse \nwith a lot of kids--just what the folks who made Camel cigarettes \nwanted. While Joe Camel is no longer around, the problem of marketing \nto young people still remains.\n  Tobacco companies doubled their marketing expenses between 1998 and \n2005. They now spend over $13 billion a year on marketing. They claim \nthey don't market to kids, but just look at this ad. How about this \none: Great Camel cigarettes. They are offering a back-to-school \nspecial. That certainly is marketing to kids. We know as parents and \nadults exactly what they are trying to do. This picture was taken from \na shop in Camden Wyoming, DE. They knew what they were trying to do--\nlure these kids into tobacco at an early age--and their advertising did \nits best to draw them in. These companies are not going to waste a \npenny advertising on groups they don't think they can win over. So they \ngo after the kids.\n  This bill recognizes the importance of curbing marketing to kids. It \nwould empower the Food and Drug Administration for the first time to \nestablish reasonable marketing restrictions that adhere to our first \namendment guarantees under the Constitution. For example, the bill bans \noutdoor advertising near schools and playgrounds, prohibits colorful \nand alluring images used to appeal to young people. It limits ads to \nonly black-and-white text in newspapers and magazines with significant \nteen readership. It ends incentives to buy cigarettes by prohibiting \nfree giveaways with the purchase of tobacco products. Remember all the \nstuff they used to peddle in the name of cigarettes? Backpacks and \ncaps--you name it. That kind of stuff is going to end. It gives the FDA \nthe authority to respond to the inevitable innovative attempts by \ntobacco companies to get around these restrictions. It strengthens \nrestrictions on youth access to tobacco\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\nproducts by requiring retailers to verify the age of all over-the-\ncounter sales of tobacco products and prohibits vending machines and \nself-service displays unless they are in adult-only facilities.\n  In addition to restricting marketing and youth access, the bill lifts \nthe shroud of secrecy the tobacco industry has used to hide the \ncontents of its products for decades. For virtually all other consumer \nproducts, manufacturers are required to disclose what is in their \nproduct. Walk into any grocery store, take a product off the shelf, and \nyou will see a list of ingredients. But cigarettes and other tobacco \nproducts, some of the most dangerous products American consumers can \nbuy, do not have to follow the same rules as other consumer products. \nThe tobacco industry does not want you to know what is in its products, \nand for good reason.\n  Cigarettes are not just tobacco leaves rolled up in paper; they are \nsophisticated, highly engineered products. In addition to tobacco leaf, \ncigarettes contain additives and chemicals that increase the kick of \nnicotine and mask the harshness of tobacco smoke. The act of lighting a \ncigarette creates a toxic soup of more than 4,000 known chemical \ncompounds, all carefully added to that little cigarette in the hope \nthat you will enjoy it so darn much you will become addicted for life. \nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, there are 69 known and \nprobable carcinogens in cigarette smoke. Is it any wonder people \ndevelop cancer from smoking?\n  Researchers at Harvard University School of Public Health have also \ndiscovered that tobacco companies increased nicotine levels in \ncigarettes by nearly 12 percent between 1997 and 2005. They were \npumping nicotine into these cigarettes knowing it was more addictive, \nknowing they had these folks hooked for life.\n  This bill ends the special treatment of the tobacco industry by \nrequiring manufacturers to disclose to the FDA the ingredients, \nincluding substances in the smoke, of each brand of tobacco product. It \nrequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish a list \nof harmful and potentially harmful constituents in each brand of \ntobacco products and requires tobacco companies to provide information \nthey have on the health effects of existing and future tobacco \nproducts. Why did it take us so long to do this? We knew for decades \nwhat was going on here. But the tobacco companies were just too \npowerful. They stopped us. Now we have a chance to change that. This \nbill on the floor will finally give consumers across America the \ninformation they need, the information which researchers need to stop \nthis insidious addiction.\n  For a product as deadly as tobacco, public disclosure of ingredients \nis not enough. The FDA should be able to require the industry to reduce \nor eliminate harmful ingredients or additives to protect the public \nhealth. For decades, the industry has manipulated its products at the \nexpense of American consumers. No other industry in America is allowed \nto freely choose the types and amounts of toxic substances that are in \ntheir products--only tobacco companies, and that is going to end with \nthis bill. This bill gives the Food and Drug Administration the \nauthority to set standards to reduce these harmful ingredients, to \nreduce nicotine levels, and to ban those candy and fruit-flavored \ncigarettes popular with kids.\n  Another long overdue reform is to establish a credible process for \nensuring that health claims about tobacco products are scientifically \nproven. Almost as soon as cigarettes became a widely used product, \ncompanies started making false claims.\n  In the 1920s, Lorillard came up with a slogan: ``Not a Cough in a \nCarload.''\n  In the 1930s, Philip Morris said smoking their cigarettes was less \nirritating than other brands and ran ads advising the public to ``Ask \nYour Doctor About a Light Smoke.''\n  In the 1940s, R.J. Reynolds ran an ad campaign for Camel cigarettes \nwith the slogan ``More Doctors Smoke Camels than Any Other Cigarette.''\n  In the 1950s and 1960s, tobacco companies introduced ``light'' and \n``low tar'' cigarettes to ease the growing concern about the harmful \neffects of smoking. The marketing of these light and low-tar cigarettes \nwas so successful that they quickly dominated the market. Some \nadvertisements explicitly encouraged smokers to switch to these new \nproducts instead of quitting. But the tobacco companies never had to \ndemonstrate these new products would actually reduce harm. In fact, \nscientific evidence has shown light and low-tar cigarettes have not \nlowered health risks.\n  Tobacco companies continue to develop new products and make health \nclaims that cannot be validated. This bill will prohibit tobacco \ncompanies from using misleading descriptors such as ``light,'' \n``mild,'' and ``low'' to describe their products. It gives the FDA \nauthority to review a product before it can be marketed as a ``reduced \nharm'' product to ensure sound science is behind that claim. These are \nreasonable requirements for any product in America and certainly for a \ndeadly product such as cigarettes and tobacco.\n\n  The warnings currently displayed on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco \nproducts are more than 20 years old. Let's be honest about this. The \nwarnings on cigarette packages are widely ignored. They have been \nvirtually the same for decades. People don't even read them or pay \nattention to them. But that is going to change. This legislation \nrequires large, clearly visible warning labels on 50 percent of the \nfront and back of a pack of cigarettes, with graphic and textual \nmessages such as ``Warning: Cigarettes Cause Cancer.'' You will not be \nable to miss it. You may miss some of the advertising and colorful \nphotographs, but the message is going to be clear for anyone who can \nread. Warning messages are to comprise at least 20 percent of an \nadvertisement. That is a big change.\n  This is something we introduced 20 years ago to finally change these \nwarning labels. Congressman Henry Waxman has been a great champion and \nadvocate on this subject. We just could not pull it off. The tobacco \ncompanies were too powerful. Now we have a chance to beat them with \nthis bill on the floor. These reforms will start to reduce the terrible \ntoll tobacco has taken on families across the Nation.\n  I used to say from time to time when I would reflect on this and \npeople would say: You are going too far, Durbin, just too much \nregulation, I have yet to meet the first parent who has said to me: I \nhave great news. I just learned last night that my daughter started \nsmoking. I never heard that said. We know intuitively as adults it is a \nterrible thing when a child takes up smoking and use of tobacco. It can \nlead to an addiction that can harm them.\n  The FDA is the right agency to do this. It is the only agency with \nthe science, the regulatory experience, and the public health mission \nto get this job done. Through a user fee on the industry, the bill \ngives the agency the funding it needs to get this job done.\n  This is a strong public health bill and a bipartisan bill. After more \nthan 10 years and, in my case, more than 20 years, we have never been \nso close to giving the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products. \nI urge my colleagues to resist efforts to weaken this bill or to add \nprovisions that jeopardize its enactment. FDA regulation of tobacco \nproducts is long overdue. The time for Congress to act is now.\n  I would like to say in closing that it is a shame that my colleague \nand friend, Teddy Kennedy, is not here. He is recovering, as we know, \nfrom his own battle with a brain tumor. I talked with him a couple \nweeks ago, and he sounded just great. I wish he could be on the floor \nwith us because I know how much this bill means to him personally. \nTeddy Kennedy, on this issue and so many others, stood there and fought \nthat lonely battle, faced rollcall after rollcall when he could never \nget enough votes. And now the moment is at hand to come up with the \nvotes necessary. In his name and in the name of all the people over the \nyears who have fought so valiantly for tobacco regulation, people such \nas Congressman Mike Synar of Oklahoma and Teddy Kennedy--all of them \ndreamed of the day when this would pass. We now have a chance, this \nSenate in this Congress this year, to finally do something to start \nsaving lives across America and bring the kind of sensible regulation \nof tobacco that has been long overdue.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SUGAR\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Thomas O. Sugar, \nwho has served as one of my most valued and trusted aides in the U.S. \nSenate and in the Indiana Governor's office. I am proud to have this \nopportunity to recognize Tom for the remarkable service he has rendered \non behalf of the people of Indiana.\n  Tom is a native of Kokomo, IN, an auto town in the heart of our proud \nmanufacturing State. Tom never forgot where he came from, and he has \nbeen a faithful and passionate emissary of the hard-working, middle-\nclass Hoosiers who inspired him to enter public service in the first \nplace.\n  Tom's career in government and politics began when he served as a \ncampaign field organizer for Jim Jontz, who represented Indiana's fifth \nCongressional District. Throughout his 7 years of service for \nCongressman Jontz, Tom held a variety of positions, culminating in his \nascension to chief of staff in 1991.\n  I was fortunate to have Tom join my staff as director of \ncommunication and planning during my second term as Indiana Governor. \nAmong his many achievements, Tom orchestrated a successful conference \non promoting responsible fatherhood that brought together leaders of \nthe most successful fatherhood programs in the country. He also helped \nplan the Governor's adoption initiative, heralding needed reforms in \nIndiana's adoption system.\n  Tom served as my campaign manager for my first Senate race in 1998 \nand then took over as my chief of staff, a position he has held for \nover a decade. Tom has carried out this demanding role with unceasing \nskill, diplomacy, and determination. His portfolio has been \nconsiderable. Tom has been a top adviser on a range of significant \npolicy issues, helping to improve our Nation's educational system, \nsupporting working families, strengthening national security, and \nexpanding volunteer opportunities for Americans to serve their country.\n  In addition to playing a crucial role on policy issues, Tom has \nserved as a leader and a mentor to members of my staff in both my \nIndiana and Washington offices. Tom had a knack for discovering new \ntalent, and he helped hone the professional development of countless \npublic servants.\n  Most importantly, Tom is a devoted father to his sons, Jackson and \nCarter, and a loving husband to his wife Nancy. Tom cares about the \npeople he works with and treats his colleagues like extended family. \nTom was always ready with a kind word during times of plenty and an \nunderstanding ear during periods of personal difficulty and loss.\n  This week, Tom leaves my office to pursue a new opportunity helping \nlower income students finish their college and postsecondary education. \nThe newly formed National Consortium for College Completion is \nextraordinarily lucky to have Tom as a part of their organization. \nWhile I will deeply miss having Tom on my Senate staff, I look forward \nto hearing about the work he will do on behalf of students in need \nacross our country.\n  Tom is a trusted aide, a dear friend, and a true-blue Hoosier whose \ncontributions to the State of Indiana are immeasurable.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize Tom's extraordinary \ncontributions to this body, and I wish him the best of luck in his \nfuture pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5941-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING ERNEST P. KLINE\n\n Mr. CASEY. Madam President, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \nrecently lost a distinguished former lieutenant governor and a life-\nlong Pittsburgh sports fan, Ernest P. Kline. Ernie passed away of \ncongestive heart failure after a life that tells the story of a \nPennsylvanian with the determination to reach his goals, a love of \npublic service, and a devoted father and grandfather. Today I honor his \nmemory.\n  Ernest P. Kline was lieutenant governor of the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania from 1971 to 1979. During his 8 years of public service, \nhe worked to advance the causes of women and older citizens. After his \ncareer in public service, Ernie was president of Kline Associates in \nPalmyra, PA. His story is a Pennsylvania story of hard work and deep \nabiding commitment to help people.\n  Ernie and his two brothers were raised by a single mother in Webster, \njust outside of Pittsburgh. It was the love and support of his extended \nItalian-American family, his teachers, and his devout Catholic faith \nthat would shape him into the statesman he came to be. Ernie was the \nstarting quarterback of his Rostraver high school football team. He \nattended Duquesne University but had to drop out early due to financial \nconstraints. He became a radio-news broadcaster. While working with the \nradio station in Charleroi, he met his beloved wife Josephine. They \nwould have celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary June 25th.\n  When covering a Beaver Falls city council meeting for WBVP-AM, Ernie \nrealized that he wanted to enter public service. He went home, told his \nfamily, and was elected to the city council of Beaver Falls, PA, in \n1955. Nine years later, Ernie was elected to the senate of \nPennsylvania, later becoming the youngest Democratic floor leader ever. \nAfter 7 years in the State senate, he was elected lieutenant governor \nof the Commonwealth.\n  His life of public service continued after he left elected office \nthrough volunteering with different nonprofit organizations such as the \nRonald McDonald House and the United Way. He continued supporting \nDemocratic politics his entire life. Ernie also loved to fish and root \nfor the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n  He and Josephine raised 7 children and they were blessed with 12 \ngrandchildren. Ernie was a loving father and devoted grandfather who \ninstilled in his family a love of Pennsylvania and the value of a life \nin public service. More importantly, he was a dad who made sure the \nkids did all of their homework and all of their chores.\n  Ernie Kline was a person of integrity and compassion. He never forgot \nwhere he came from and the values that guided his life. I extend my \nsincere condolences to Josephine and the Kline family for their loss. \nHis life story will continue to inspire his family and many others to \ndevote their lives to public service and to the poor and the \npowerless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5941-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5941-S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUDGE COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, shortly before the recess, \nU.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly completed her service as \npresiding judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. By law, \nafter serving for a maximum of 7 years, judges of the FISA Court, who \nare designated from the U.S. districts courts by the Chief Justice of \nthe United States to serve on the FISA Court in addition to their \nregular judicial responsibilities, are not eligible for redesignation.\n  Now that Judge Kollar-Kotelly has completed her distinguished service \non the FISA Court, it is fitting to take note of the admirable service \nshe has rendered as the presiding judge of an institution that is \ncentral to our Nation's commitment to conduct foreign intelligence \nwithin the rule of law.\n  Judge Kollar-Kotelly was appointed in 1984 to serve as an associate \njudge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. In 1997, she \nwas appointed by President Clinton to serve on the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Columbia. In 2002, Chief Justice William H. \nRehnquist designated her to be presiding judge of the FISA Court. Her \nability to earn the trust of two Presidents and a Chief Justice is \nnoteworthy in itself.\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\n  The period of Judge Kollar-Kotelly's service as presiding judge, from \n2002 to 2009, has been, of course, a period of enormous challenge for \nthe FISA Court. The work of the court, apart from limited releases of \nstatistical information and the rare case in which a redacted opinion \nhas been released publicly, occurs in secrecy. But while little is \npublicly known about her service as presiding judge, from the vantage \npoint of the Senate Intelligence Committee I can say with confidence \nthat the American people should be very grateful for her leadership of \nthis most important court.\n  Congratulations, Judge Kollar-Kotelly, and thanks for a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5942-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING THE GEORGE WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2009\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Only about 5 \npercent of the adults in the surrounding community have attended \ncollege.\n  I am especially proud of what the students, teachers, and families of \nWashington High School are achieving because the school and community \nhave played a big role in my early career and in the life of my family. \nMy grandfather, Thomas L. Green, lived on the West Side of Indianapolis \nnear Washington High School. Although he had only a fifth-grade \neducation, he established Thomas L. Green and Company, a food machinery \nmanufacturing firm, in a factory near the high school.\n  When I returned to Indianapolis in 1960 after my Navy service, I \njoined my brother, Thomas R. Lugar, in managing the food machinery \nbusiness. Many of our employees and interns came from the neighborhood \nsurrounding George Washington High School. Thanks to the leadership of \nPrincipal Cloyd Julian and others, we joined the George Washington \nBusiness club, through which we met frequently with the students and \nteachers.\n  In late 1963, a delegation from the West Side came to my office at \nthe factory to encourage me to run for the Indianapolis Board of School \nCommissioners. They felt that schools on the West Side were being \nneglected, and they wanted to ensure that the perspective of our \ncommunity was heard. I accepted their challenge and won a seat on the \nboard in May of 1964. This responsibility deepened my involvement in \nthe affairs of George Washington and other schools in our neighborhood.\n  I was elected mayor of Indianapolis in 1967 and continued to stay \nclosely involved with the school. During this period, George Washington \nhad developed a legendary basketball program that was followed closely \non the West Side. The school won the Indiana High School Basketball \nState Championship in 1965 and 1969. We attended every tournament game \nand any pep rallies. It was wonderful to see the high school as a \nleader politically, academically, and athletically.\n  I take a moment to recount this cherished history because George \nWashington is a prime example of how a school can succeed through the \nhard work of its students and teachers, the support of the community, \nand the expectation of achievement. These students have dedicated \nthemselves to setting an example for their younger siblings and the \nclasses that will follow them at George Washington. The teachers never \nstop preaching about the advantages of going to college and never let \nthe students assume that their education ends with high school. And \nparents have supported these students, even if the experience of \ncollege is a new one for their families.\n  The most fundamental element of American competitiveness and progress \nis the quality of education that our children receive. We must make \nsure that all of our young people are educated 100 percent of them. We \ncannot afford to be satisfied with less. George Washington High School \nclearly has embraced this challenge.\n  I am privileged to recognize this marvelous school and the students \nwho are graduating and going to college, for this signal achievement. \nIt is clear that the students at George Washington have the vision and \ninspiration to move ahead, which is so important to their lives but \nalso to the success of our great country. I look forward to following \ntheir achievements and supporting their dreams in the years ahead.\n  Below is a complete list of the remarkable George Washington High \nSchool Class of 2009:\n\n       Edgardo Aboytes, Megan Adams, Armando Alejo, Mauricio \n     Arreola, Salvador Arteaga, Jose Arteaga, Louis Aumann, Imelda \n     Benitez-Vasquez, Sarah Boles, Devon Brogan, Dawn Caffery, \n     Sebastiana Campos, Aloric Carson, Ariel Casillas, Katherine \n     Cook, Erik Cook, Cheris Drotz-Smith, Joyce East, Luis \n     Escatel, Petra Felder.\n       Edith Flores, Anthony Fuller, Manuel Gil, Dorthea Glenn, \n     Noe Gonzalez, John Graves, Christopher Hall, Katey Hicks, \n     Kaela Hunt, Kathryn Hunter, Tiffany Ingalls, Alma Jimenez, \n     Dujuan Johnson, Cleveland Johnson, Charles Lile, James Locke, \n     Adelmer Lopez, Rubi Lopez, Daniel Luckett, Karina Magallanes.\n       Jessica Martinez, Joshua Masters, Angela McClure, Ashley \n     McClure, Patrick McDonald, Frederick McKnight, Keith \n     McLemore, Adem Meftah, Shantina Moore, Fernando Mora, James \n     Morris, Felicia Moy, Nohemi Ocampo, Rick Owens, Andrew \n     Parsley, Julian Peters, Kiara Ragland, Miguel Ramirez, Tisha \n     Ramirez, Daniel Rangel.\n       Matthew Reeves, Jeffery Riley, Tiffany Riley, Brittney \n     Ritchie, Marcos Rivera, Marvin Rodriguez, Maria Rodriguez, \n     Fernando Rojas, Marcus Ross, Emanuel Ruiz, Loniqua Smith, \n     Erica Snyder, Gregorio Soto, Brittany Spears, Jason Stark-\n     Jines, DeVaughn Stokes.\n       India Tinsley, Samantha Turner, Maria Valdez, Kenneth \n     Valentine, Cassandra Vest, Sherry Whitescarver, Brandy \n     Whitescarver, Victoria Wilcox, Calvin Williams, Rodshied \n     Williams, William Wilson, Cassandra Wilson, Jose \n     Zelaya.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5942-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5942-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5942-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following bill was discharged from the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs by unanimous consent, and referred as \nindicated:\n  S. 1007.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nprograms to increase the number of nurse faculty and to increase the \ndomestic nursing and physical therapy workforce, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nLincoln to introduce the Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education \nAct of 2009. This legislation will help to address the critical \nshortage of nurse faculty and physical therapists that is facing our \nNation. The nationwide nursing shortage is growing rapidly, because the \naverage age of the nursing workforce is near retirement and because the \naging population has increased health care needs. The shortage is one \nthat affects the entire Nation. A 2006 Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, HRSA, report estimated that the national nursing \nshortage would more than triple, to more than one million nurses, by \nthe year 2020. The report also predicts that all 50 States will \nexperience nursing shortages by 2015. Quite simply, we need to educate \nmore nurses, or we, as a Nation, will not have enough trained nurses to \nmeet the needs of our aging society.\n  One of the biggest constraints to educating more nurses is a shortage \nof nursing faculty. Almost three-quarters of nursing programs surveyed \nby the American Association of Colleges of Nursing cited faculty \nshortages as a reason for turning away qualified applicants. Although \napplications to nursing programs have surged 59 percent over the past \ndecade, the National League for Nursing estimates that 147,000 \nqualified applications were turned away in 2004. This represents a 27 \npercent decrease in admissions over the previous year, indicating the \nneed to scale up capacity in nursing programs is more critical than \never.\n  I know that in my home State of New Mexico, nursing programs turned \ndown almost half of qualified applicants, even though HRSA predicts \nthat New Mexico will only be able to meet 64 percent of its demand for \nnurses by 2020. With a national nurse faculty workforce that averages \n53.5 years of age, and an average nurse faculty retirement age of 62.5 \nyears, we cannot and must not wait any longer to address nurse faculty \nshortages.\n  Nursing faculty are not the only segment of the population that is \naging. As the baby boom generation ages, there will be an increased \nneed for nurses to care for the elderly. However, less than one percent \nof practicing nurses have a certification in geriatrics.\n  The Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education Act will amend the \nPublic Health Service Act, to help alleviate the faculty shortage by \nproviding funds to help nursing schools increase enrollment and \ngraduation from nursing doctoral programs. The act will increase \npartnering opportunities between academic institutions and medical \npractices, enhance cooperative education, support marketing outreach, \nand strengthen mentoring programs. The bill will increase the number of \nnurses who complete nursing doctoral programs and seek employment as \nfaculty members and nursing leaders in academic institutions. In \naddition, the bill authorizes awards to train nursing faculty in \nclinical geriatrics, so that more nursing students will be equipped for \nour aging population.\n  By addressing the faculty shortage, we are addressing the nursing \nshortage.\n  The aging population will also require additional health workers in \nother fields. Physical therapy was listed as one of the fastest growing \noccupations by the U.S. Department of Labor, with a projected job \ngrowth of greater than 36 percent between 2004 and 2014. The need for \nphysical therapists is particularly acute in rural and urban \nunderserved areas, which have three to four times fewer physical \ntherapists per capita than suburban areas. To address this need, the \nbill also authorizes a distance education pilot program to improve \naccess to educational opportunity for both nursing and physical therapy \nstudents. Finally, the bill calls for a study by the Institute of \nMedicine at the National Academy of Sciences which will recommend how \nto balance education, labor, and immigration policies to meet the \ndemand for qualified nurses and physical therapists.\n  The provisions of the Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education \nAct are vital to overcoming workforce challenges. By addressing nurse \nfaculty and physical therapist shortages, we will enhance both access \nto care and the quality of care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1161\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse \n     Faculty and Physical Therapist Education Act of 2009''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) has \n     helped to support students preparing to be nurse educators. \n     Yet, nursing schools nationwide are forced to deny admission \n     to individuals seeking to become nurses and nurse educators \n     due to the lack of qualified nurse faculty.\n       (2) The American Association of Colleges of Nursing \n     reported that 42,866 qualified applicants were denied \n     admission to nursing baccalaureate and graduate programs in \n     2006, with faculty shortages identified as a major reason for \n     turning away students.\n       (3) Seventy-one percent of schools have reported \n     insufficient faculty as the primary reason for not accepting \n     qualified applicants. The primary reasons for lack of faculty \n     are lack of funds to hire new faculty, inability to identify, \n     recruit and hire faculty in the competitive job market as of \n     May 2007, and lack of nursing faculty available in different \n     geographic areas.\n       (4) Despite the fact that in 2006, 52.4 percent of \n     graduates of doctoral nursing programs enter education roles, \n     the 103 doctoral programs nationwide produced only 437 \n     graduates, which is only an additional 6 graduates from 2005. \n     This annual graduation rate is insufficient to meet the needs \n     for nurse faculty. In keeping with other professional \n     academic disciplines, nurse faculty at colleges and \n     universities are typically doctorally prepared.\n       (5) The nursing faculty workforce is aging and will be \n     retiring.\n       (6) With the average retirement age of nurse faculty at \n     62.5 years of age, and the average age of doctorally prepared \n     faculty, as of May 2007, that hold the rank of professor, \n     associate professor, and assistant professor is 58.6, 55.8, \n     and 51.6 years, respectively, the health care system faces \n     unprecedented workforce and health access challenges with \n     current and future shortages of deans, nurse educators, and \n     nurses.\n       (7) Research by the National League of Nursing indicates \n     that by 2019 approximately 75 percent of the nursing faculty \n     population (as of May 2007) is expected to retire.\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\n       (8) A wave of nurses will be retiring from the profession \n     in the near future. As of May 2007, the average age of a \n     nurse in the United States is 46.8 years old. The Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics estimates that more than 1,200,000 new and \n     replacement registered nurses will be needed by 2014.\n       (9) By 2030, the number of adults age 65 and older is \n     expected to double to 70,000,000, accounting for 20 percent \n     of the population. As the population ages, the demand for \n     nurses and nursing faculty will increase.\n       (10) Despite the need for nurses to treat an aging \n     population, few registered nurses in the United States are \n     trained in geriatrics. Less than 1 percent of practicing \n     nurses have a certification in geriatrics and 3 percent of \n     advanced practice nurses specialize in geriatrics.\n       (11) Specialized training in geriatrics is needed to treat \n     older adults with multiple health conditions and improve \n     health outcomes. Approximately 80 percent of Medicare \n     beneficiaries have 1 chronic condition, more than 60 percent \n     have 2 or more chronic conditions, and at least 10 percent \n     have coexisting Alzheimer's disease or other dementias that \n     complicate their care and worsen health outcomes. Two-thirds \n     of Medicare spending is attributed to 20 percent of \n     beneficiaries who have 5 or more chronic conditions. Research \n     indicates that older persons receiving care from nurses \n     trained in geriatrics are less frequently readmitted to \n     hospitals or transferred from nursing facilities to hospitals \n     than those who did not receive care from a nurse trained in \n     geriatrics.\n       (12) The Department of Labor projected that the need for \n     physical therapists would increase by 36.7 percent between \n     2004 and 2014.\n       (13) The need for physical therapists is particularly acute \n     rural and urban underserved areas, which have 3 to 4 times \n     fewer physical therapists per capita than suburban areas.\n\n                 TITLE I--GRANTS FOR NURSING EDUCATION\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nthe Automated Defibrillation in Adam's Memory Act; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nreauthorization of\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\nthe Automated Defibrillators in Adam's Memory Act, or the ADAM Act. \nThis bill is modeled after the successful Project ADAM that originally \nbegan in Wisconsin, and will reauthorize a program to establish a \nnational clearing house to provide schools with the ``how-to'' and \ntechnical advice to set up a public access defibrillation program.\n  Every 2 minutes, someone in America falls into sudden cardiac arrest. \nBy improving access to AEDs, we can improve the survival rates of \ncardiac arrest in our communities.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, as in many other states, heart disease \nis the number one killer. Nationwide, heart disease is the cause of one \nout of every 2.8 deaths. Overall, heart disease kills more Americans \nthan breast cancer, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS combined.\n  Cardiac arrest can strike anyone. Cardiac victims are in a race \nagainst time, and unfortunately, for too many of those in rural areas, \nEmergency Medical Services are unable to reach people in need, and time \nruns out for victims of cardiac arrest. It's simply not possible to \nhave EMS units next to every farm and small town across the nation.\n  Fortunately, recent technological advances have made the newest \ngeneration of AEDs inexpensive and simple to operate. Because of these \nadvancements in AED technology, it is now practical to train and equip \npolice officers, teachers, and members of other community \norganizations.\n  Over 163,000 Americans experience out-of-hospital sudden cardiac \narrests each year. Immediate CPR and early defibrillation using an \nautomated external defibrillator, AED, can more than double a victim's \nchance of survival. By taking some relatively simple steps, we can give \nvictims of cardiac arrest a better chance of survival.\n  Over the past 9 years, I have worked with Senator Susan Collins, a \nRepublican from Maine, on a number of initiatives to empower \ncommunities to improve cardiac arrest survival rates. We have pushed \nCongress to support rural first responders--local police and fire and \nrescue services--in their efforts to provide early defibrillation. \nCongress heard our call, and responded by enacting two of our bills, \nthe Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act and the ADAM Act.\n  The Rural Access to Emergency Devices program allows community \npartnerships across the country to receive a grant enabling them to \npurchase defibrillators, and receive the training needed to use these \ndevices. This program is entering its ninth year of helping rural \ncommunities purchase defibrillators and train first responders, and I \nam pleased to say that grants have already put defibrillators in rural \ncommunities all over the country, helping those communities be better \nprepared when cardiac arrest strikes.\n  Approximately ninety-five percent of sudden cardiac arrest victims \ndie before reaching the hospital. Every minute that passes before a \ncardiac arrest victim is defibrillated, the chance of survival falls by \nas much as 10 percent. After only eight minutes, the victim's survival \nrate drops by 60 percent. This is why early intervention is essential--\na combination of CPR and use of AEDs can save lives.\n  Heart disease is not only a problem among adults. A few years ago I \nlearned the story of Adam Lemel, a 17-year-old high school student and \na star basketball and tennis player in Wisconsin. Tragically, during a \ntimeout while playing basketball at a neighboring Milwaukee high \nschool, Adam suffered sudden cardiac arrest, and died before the \nparamedics arrived.\n  This story is incredibly tragic. Adam had his whole life ahead of \nhim, and could quite possibly have been saved with appropriate early \nintervention. In fact, we have seen a number of examples in Wisconsin \nwhere early CPR and access to defibrillation have saved lives.\n  Seventy miles away from Milwaukee, a 14-year-old boy collapsed while \nplaying basketball. Within three minutes, the emergency team arrived \nand began CPR. Within five minutes of his collapse, the paramedics used \nan AED to jump start his heart. Not only has this young man survived, \ndoctors have identified his father and brother as having the same heart \ncondition and have begun preventative treatments.\n  These stories help to underscore some important issues. First, \nalthough cardiac arrest is most common among adults, it can occur at \nany age--even in apparently healthy children and adolescents. Second, \nearly intervention is essential--a combination of CPR and the use of \nAEDs can save lives. Third, some individuals who are at risk for sudden \ncardiac arrest can be identified.\n  After Adam Lemel suffered his cardiac arrest, his friend David Ellis \njoined forces with Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to initiate Project \nADAM to bring CPR training and public access defibrillation into \nschools, educate communities about preventing sudden cardiac deaths and \nsave lives.\n  Today, Project ADAM has introduced AEDs into several Wisconsin \nschools, and has been a model for programs in Washington, Florida, \nMichigan and elsewhere. Project ADAM provides a model for the nation, \nand now, with the enactment of this new law, more schools will have \naccess to the information they seek to launch similar programs.\n  The ADAM Act was passed into law in 2003, but has yet to be funded. I \nhave been very proud to play a part in having this bill signed into \nlaw, and it is my hope that the reauthorization of the Act will quickly \npass through the Congress and into law, and that funding will follow. \nIt would not take much money to fund this program and save lives across \nthe country.\n  The ADAM Act is one way we can honor the life of children like Adam \nLemel, and give tomorrow's pediatric cardiac arrest victims a fighting \nchance at life.\n  This act exists because a family experienced the tragic loss of their \nson, but they were determined to spare other families that same loss. I \nthank Adam's parents, Joe and Patty, for their courageous efforts and I \nthank them for everything they have done to help the ADAM Act become \nlaw. Their actions take incredible bravery, and I commend them for \ntheir efforts.\n  By making sure that AEDs are available in our nation's rural areas, \nschools and throughout our communities we can help those in a race \nagainst time have a fighting chance of survival when they fall victim \nto cardiac arrest. I urge Congress to pass this reauthorization, and to \nfund the ADAM Act and the Rural AED program at their full levels. We \nhave the power to prevent death--all we must do is act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AMENDMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Section 312 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     244) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)(6), after ``clearinghouse'' insert \n     ``, that shall be administered by an organization that has \n     substantial expertise in pediatric education, pediatric \n     medicine, and electrophysiology and sudden death,''; and\n       (2) in the first sentence of subsection (e), by striking \n     ``fiscal year 2003'' and all that follows through ``2006'' \n     and inserting ``for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2014''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1165. A bill to promote the development of health care \ncooperatives that will help businesses to pool the health care \npurchasing power of employers, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator \nCollins from Maine, I am reintroducing legislation to help businesses \nform group-purchasing cooperatives to obtain enhanced benefits, to \nreduce health care rates, and to improve quality for their employees' \nhealth care.\n  High health care costs are burdening businesses and employees across \nthe nation. These costs are digging into profits and preventing access \nto affordable health care. Too many patients feel trapped by the \nsystem, with decisions about their health dictated by costs rather than \nby what they need.\n  Nationally, the annual average cost to an employer for an individual \nemployee's health care is $3,983. For a\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\nfamily, the employer contribution is $9,325. We must curb these rapidly \nincreasing health care costs. I strongly support initiatives to ensure \nthat everyone has access to health care. It is crucial that we support \nsuccessful local initiatives to reduce health care premiums and to \nimprove the quality of employees' health care.\n  By using group purchasing to obtain rate discounts, some employers \nhave been able to reduce the cost of health care premiums for their \nemployees. According to the National Business Coalition on Health, \nthere are nearly 60 employer-led coalitions across the U.S. that \ncollectively purchase health care. Through these pools, businesses are \nable to proactively challenge high costs and inefficient delivery of \nhealth care and share information on quality. These coalitions \nrepresent over 7,000 employers nationwide.\n  Improving the quality of health care will also lower the cost of \ncare. By investing in the delivery of high-quality health care, we will \nbe able to lower long term health care costs. Effective care, such as \nhigh-quality preventive services, can reduce overall health care \nexpenditures. Health purchasing coalitions help promote these services \nand act as an employer forum for networking and education on health \ncare cost containment strategies. They can help foster a dialogue with \nhealth care providers, insurers, and local HMOs.\n  Health care markets are local. Problems with cost, quality, and \naccess to health care are felt most intensely in the local markets. \nHealth care coalitions can function best when they are formed and \nimplemented locally. Local employers of large and small businesses have \nformed health care coalitions to track health care trends, create a \ndemand for quality and safety, and encourage group purchasing.\n  In Wisconsin, there have been various successful initiatives that \nhave formed health care purchasing cooperatives to improve quality of \ncare and to reduce cost. For example, the Employer Health Care Alliance \nCooperative, an employer-owned and employer-directed not-for-profit \ncooperative, has developed a network of health care providers in Dane \nCounty and 13 surrounding counties on behalf of more than 160 member \nemployers. Through this pooling effort, employers are able to obtain \naffordable, high-quality health care for their more than 80,000 \nemployees and dependents.\n  This legislation seeks to build on successful local initiatives, such \nas the Alliance, that help businesses to join together to increase \naccess to affordable and high-quality health care.\n  The Promoting Health Care Purchasing Cooperatives Act would authorize \ngrants to groups of businesses so that they could form group-purchasing \ncooperatives to obtain enhanced benefits, reduce health care rates, and \nimprove quality.\n  This legislation offers two separate grant programs to help different \ntypes of businesses pool their resources and bargaining power. Both \nprograms would aid businesses to form cooperatives. The first program \nwould help large businesses that sponsor their own health plans, while \nthe second program would help small businesses that purchase their \nhealth insurance.\n  My bill would enable larger businesses to form cost-effective \ncooperatives that could offer high-quality health care through several \nways. First, they could obtain health services through pooled \npurchasing from physicians, hospitals, home health agencies, and \nothers. By pooling their experience and interests, employers involved \nin a coalition could better address essential issues, such as rising \nhealth insurance rates and the lack of comparable health care quality \ndata. They would be able to share information regarding the quality of \nthese services and to partner with these health care providers to meet \nthe needs of their employees.\n  For smaller businesses that purchase their health insurance, the \nformation of cooperatives would allow them to buy health insurance at \nlower prices through pooled purchasing. Also, the communication within \nthese cooperatives would provide employees of small businesses with \nbetter information about the health care options that are available to \nthem. Finally, coalitions would serve to promote quality improvements \nby facilitating partnerships between their group and the health care \nproviders.\n  By working together, the group could develop better insurance plans \nand negotiate better rates.\n  This legislation also tries to alleviate the burden that our Nation's \nfarmers face when trying to purchase health care for themselves, their \nfamilies, and their employees. Because the health insurance industry \nlooks upon farming as a high-risk profession, many farmers are priced \nout of, or simply not offered, health insurance. By helping farmers \njoin cooperatives to purchase health insurance, we will help increase \ntheir health insurance options.\n  Past health purchasing pool initiatives have focused only on cost and \nhave tried to be all things for all people. My legislation creates an \nincentive to join the pools by giving grants to a group of similar \nbusinesses to form group-purchasing cooperatives. The pools are also \ngiven flexibility to find innovative ways to lower costs, such as \nenhancing benefits--for example, more preventive care--and improving \nquality. Finally, the cooperative structure is a proven model, which \ncreates an incentive for businesses to remain in the pool because they \nwill be invested in the organization.\n  We must reform health care in America and give employers and \nemployees more options. This legislation, by providing for the \nformation of cost-effective coalitions that will also improve the \nquality of care, contributes to this essential reform process. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this proposal to improve the \nquality and costs of health care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care spending in the United States has reached \n     16.2 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United \n     States, yet over 46,000,000 people remain uninsured.\n       (2) After nearly a decade of manageable increases in \n     commercial insurance premiums, many employers are now faced \n     with consecutive years of double digit premium increases.\n       (3) Purchasing cooperatives owned by participating \n     businesses are a proven method of achieving the bargaining \n     power necessary to manage the cost and quality of employer-\n     sponsored health plans and other employee benefits.\n       (4) The Employer Health Care Alliance Cooperative has \n     provided its members with health care purchasing power \n     through provider contracting, data collection, activities to \n     enhance quality improvements in the health care community, \n     and activities to promote employee health care consumerism.\n       (5) According to the National Business Coalition on Health, \n     there are nearly 60 employer-led coalitions across the United \n     States that collectively purchase health care, proactively \n     challenge high costs and the inefficient delivery of health \n     care, and share information on quality. These coalitions \n     represent more than 7,000 employers, and approximately \n     25,000,000 employees and their dependents.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to build off of \n     successful local employer-led health insurance initiatives by \n     improving the value of their employees' health care.\n\n     SEC. 3. GRANTS TO SELF INSURED BUSINESSES TO FORM HEALTH CARE \n                   COOPERATIVES.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary''), \n     acting through the Director of the Agency for Healthcare \n     Research and Quality, is authorized to award grants to \n     eligible groups that meet the criteria described in \n     subsection (d), for the development of health care purchasing \n     cooperatives.

Res. 164\n\n       Whereas the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon \n     the United States (hereinafter referred to as the ``9/11 \n     Commission'') conducted a lengthy review of the facts and \n     circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, including those relating to the intelligence \n     community, law enforcement agencies, and the role of \n     congressional oversight and resource allocation;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission found that \n     congressional oversight of the intelligence activities of the \n     United States is dysfunctional;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission further \n     found that under the rules of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives in effect at the time the report was \n     completed, the committees of Congress charged with oversight \n     of the intelligence activities lacked the power, influence, \n     and sustained capability to meet the daunting challenges \n     faced by the intelligence community of the United States;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission further \n     found that as long as such oversight is governed by such \n     rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the \n     people of the United States will not get the security they \n     want and need;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission further \n     found that a strong, stable, and capable congressional \n     committee structure is needed to give the intelligence \n     community of the United States appropriate oversight, \n     support, and leadership;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission further \n     found that the reforms recommended by the 9/11 Commission in \n     its final report will not succeed if congressional oversight \n     of the intelligence community in the United States is not \n     changed;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission \n     recommended structural changes to Congress to improve the \n     oversight of intelligence activities;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission further \n     recommended that the authorizing authorities and \n     appropriating authorities with respect to intelligence \n     activities in each house of Congress be combined into a \n     single committee in each house of Congress;\n       Whereas Congress has enacted some of the recommendations \n     made by the 9/11 Commission and is considering implementing \n     additional recommendations of the 9/11 Commission; and\n       Whereas the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 445 in the \n     108th Congress to address some of the intelligence oversight \n     recommendations of the 9/11 Commission by abolishing term \n     limits for the members of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, clarifying jurisdiction for intelligence-\n     related nominations, and streamlining procedures for the \n     referral of intelligence-related legislation, but other \n     aspects of the 9/11 Commission recommendations regarding \n     intelligence oversight have not been implemented: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this resolution are--\n       (1) to improve congressional oversight of the intelligence \n     activities of the United States;\n       (2) to provide a strong, stable, and capable congressional \n     committee structure to provide the intelligence community \n     appropriate oversight, support, and leadership;\n       (3) to implement a key recommendation of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (the \n     ``9/11 Commission'') that structural changes be made to \n     Congress to improve the oversight of intelligence activities; \n     and\n       (4) to provide vigilant legislative oversight over the \n     intelligence activities of the United States to ensure that \n     such activities are in conformity with the Constitution and \n     laws of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 2. INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT.\n\n       (a) Authority of the Select Committee on Intelligence.--\n     Paragraph (5) of section 3(a) of Senate Resolution 400, \n     agreed to May 19, 1976 (94th Congress), is amended in that \n     matter preceding subparagraph (A) by striking the comma \n     following ``authorizations for appropriations'' and inserting \n     ``and appropriations,''.\n       (b) Abolishment of the Subcommittee on Intelligence.--\n     Senate Resolution 445, agreed to October 9, 2004, (108th \n     Congress), is amended by striking section 402.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am introducing today, along with \nSenators Burr, Bayh, Snowe and McCain, a resolution that will implement \na key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission--\n\n[[Page S5951]]\n\nthe granting of appropriations authority to the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. This effort to reform and improve congressional oversight \nhas a long bipartisan history. It began as an amendment offered by \nSenator McCain to the 2004 reorganizing resolution that accompanied the \nintelligence reform bill. And, in the last Congress, this resolution \nwas introduced by Senator Burr. It should also be noted that it has the \nsame bipartisan set of cosponsors as it did last year, despite the \nchange of administration. This underscores the principle that effective \ncongressional oversight is neither a partisan nor political issue and \nthat it has nothing to do with who the President is. It is about \nensuring that the Intelligence Community is keeping America safe, \ncomplying with the Constitution and laws of our country, and using \ntaxpayer dollars in an appropriate manner.\n  Next month will mark the 5th anniversary of the release of the 9/11 \nCommission's report. The country is by now familiar with the many \nrecommendations of the Commission that have been implemented, including \nthe establishment of the DNI and the National Counterterrorism Center. \nYet, the Commission stressed that, ``Of all our recommendations, \nstrengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult \nand important.''\n  In November 2007, Lee Hamilton, the former Vice Chairman of the \nCommission testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee on behalf of \nhimself and former Chairman Tom Kean and again emphasized what needs to \nbe done. He testified that:\n\n       The single most important step to strengthen the power of \n     the intelligence committees is to give them the power of the \n     purse. Without it, they will be marginalized. The \n     intelligence community will not ignore you, but they will \n     work around you. In a crunch, they will go to the \n     Appropriations Committee. Within the Congress, the two bodies \n     with the jurisdiction, time and expertise to carry out a \n     careful review of the budget and activities of the \n     Intelligence Community are the Senate and House intelligence \n     committees. Yet all of us have to live by the Gold Rule: That \n     is, he who controls the Gold makes the Rules.\n\n  The testimony of the former Chairman and Vice Chairman highlighted \nthree practical examples of why this particular reform is so critical. \nFirst, if and when the U.S. goes to war, the decision will ride largely \non intelligence--and oversight is critical to ensuring that the \nintelligence community gets it right. Second, oversight is necessary to \nsafeguard the privacy and civil liberties of Americans in an age of \nenhanced collection capabilities and data mining. Third, the success of \nintelligence reform requires sustained congressional oversight.\n  Vigorous, effective, independent congressional oversight is \nfundamental to the checks and balances of our constitutional system. In \nrecent years, we have seen outright contempt for this oversight, \nparticularly as the previous administration sought to hide the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation and the NSA's warrantless wiretapping \nprograms from Congress. But the inauguration of a new president has not \nremoved all impediments to effective oversight, nor is it a guarantee \nthat serious abuses won't occur in the future. That is why the \nimplementation of this reform is just as important as ever and why this \nresolution has bipartisan support.\n  In the end, this reform is not just about our constitutional system, \nas important as that is. It is about how best to protect the American \npeople. As Lee Hamilton testified, ``the strong point simply is that \nthe Senate of the U.S. and the House of the U.S. is not doing its job. \nAnd because you are not doing the job, the country is not as safe as it \nought to be, because one of my premises is that robust oversight is \nnecessary for a stronger intelligence community.''\n  The implementation of this reform is long overdue. It has been more \nthan seven and a half years since the attacks of 9/11, almost 5years \nsince the 9/11 Commission made this recommendation, and a year and a \nhalf since the Senate Intelligence Committee heard directly from former \nChairman Hamilton and former Vice Chairman Kean. There should be no \nmore excuses, or delays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5951-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 165--TO ENCOURAGE RECOGNITION OF 2009 AS THE ``YEAR \n                        OF THE MILITARY FAMILY''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Mr. \nGraham) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 139\n\n       Whereas in January 1947, the communist Democratic Bloc \n     party seized control of the Polish Parliament in a rigged \n     election orchestrated by the Government of the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, from 1947 to 1952, the communist Government of \n     Poland prosecuted, imprisoned, and executed many individuals \n     who fought as part of the wartime Underground Resistance, an \n     organization that valiantly supported the Allied struggle \n     against Nazi Germany as part of the largest resistance \n     movement in occupied Europe;\n       Whereas in July 1952, the passage of a new constitution \n     formally created the communist People's Republic of Poland \n     and outlawed any non-communist candidate from seeking office \n     to represent the people of Poland;\n       Whereas during the ensuing years of communist rule, the \n     people of Poland suffered severe hardships because of the \n     communist-led government's failure to provide for the basic \n     economic needs of its people;\n       Whereas under communist rule, Polish intellectuals, \n     religious leaders, labor officials, students, and reformers \n     were imprisoned and exiled for speaking out against a \n     succession of increasingly corrupt, inefficient, and \n     repressive pro-Soviet puppets;\n       Whereas despite the harsh repression of the communist-led \n     government and the great personal risk they faced, the Polish \n     people struggled for freedom by staging strikes, publishing \n     underground newspapers, organizing street protests, and \n     speaking out against the economic and political failures of \n     the communist regime;\n       Whereas in August 1980, in the wake of a shipyard workers' \n     strike in Gdansk, the Solidarity Movement was created as the \n     first free trade union in the Soviet Bloc nations;\n       Whereas ultimately 1 in 4 Polish citizens became members of \n     the Solidarity movement, which served as the driving force \n     for Poland's liberation from communist rule;\n       Whereas, on June 4, 1989, the Solidarity Party secured an \n     overwhelming victory over the existing communist government \n     in the first open election in Poland since the end of World \n     War II, marking the fall of pro-Soviet rule in Poland; and\n       Whereas this victory inspired a succession of similarly \n     peaceful transitions from communism to democracy in other \n     former Soviet Bloc nations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 20th anniversary of the end of communist \n     rule in Poland;\n       (2) expresses its admiration for the people of Poland for \n     their bravery and resolve in the face of economic hardship \n     and political oppression under communist rule;\n       (3) congratulates the people of Poland for their \n     accomplishments in the years since the end of pro-Soviet \n     communist rule in building a free democracy, and for their \n     contributions as international partners;\n       (4) expresses its appreciation for the close friendship \n     between the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of Poland; and\n       (5) urges the Government of the United States to continue \n     to seek new ways to enhance its partnership with the \n     Government of Poland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5981-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5981-S5982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING FOUNDING OF BREAD FOR THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 165, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 165) to encourage the recognition of \n     2009 as the ``Year of the Military Family.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, there are more than 1.8 million family \nmembers of active duty servicemembers and an additional 1.1 million \nfamily members of reserve component members. Every one of these \nfamilies makes sacrifices each and every day along with their \nservicemember and plays a very significant role in serving our country.\n  Military families often face unique challenges and difficulties \nthroughout their loved one's career, including frequent relocations to \nbases across the country and overseas as well as the various demands \nstemming from continued deployments of members from every service. The \nNation must ensure that all the needs of military dependent children \nand spouses are being met. The life of a military family member has \nnever been an easy one, but in our 8th year of war, families are facing \neven more hardships.\n  Deployments are an undeniable strain on families. While a \nservicemember is away, spouses are often forced into the role of a \nsingle parent--juggling employment, child care, and household duties \neach and every day, all the while living with the pressure of having a \nfamily member deployed to a combat zone. Families are an integral part \nof the force, and stress on the force affects overall readiness.\n  Servicemembers will experience less stress in the field if they are \nassured their families are well taken care of back home. And it is \nimperative that families remain as resilient as possible in order to \nprovide a stable environment for loved ones when they return home from \nthose deployments. Families are often the first line of defense against \nposttraumatic stress and suicide, but may be experiencing similar \nfeelings themselves. We must ensure that families and servicemembers \nhave timely access to mental health resources and programs. We must \nmake every dependent aware of the resources available to them to assist \nin everything from finances to job placement to health care and \ncounseling.\n  Thousands of military family members have taken it upon themselves to \nconfront these challenges by volunteering to provide critical \nassistance during deployments to servicemembers, their spouses, and \nchildren, as well as giving vital support to families relocating to a \nnew area. And sadly, many families have made the ultimate sacrifice in \nthe loss of a servicemember who proudly defended our Nation.\n  We in Congress have tried to do our part to help, and have made \nfamily support programs and initiatives a priority. In recent bills we \nhave called for: the establishment of a Department of Defense Military \nFamily Readiness Council; education, training, and tuition assistance \nto help spouses maintain careers; respite care for parents caring for \nchildren on their own due to deployments; authorized increased levels \nof Impact Aid for military dependents' education; and established and \nsupported the nationwide expansion of the Department's Yellow Ribbon \nReintegration Program which is aimed at helping members and families of \nthe Guard and Reserve. But there is still more to do.\n  With President and Mrs. Obama placing the support of our military \nfamilies among their top priorities, we must take this opportunity to \nrenew our commitment and express our deepest appreciation to military \nfamily members who bravely serve this Nation alongside their \nservicemembers. It is my hope that this Year of the Military Family \ninspires us, the Department of Defense, the military Services, and \nAmericans everywhere to commit to helping military families and \nservicemembers in any way we can, and to ensure that these strong men, \nwomen, and children are given the recognition, appreciation, and \nsupport that they so truly deserve.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is my privilege to support S. Res. \n165, a resolution encouraging the recognition of 2009 as the ``Year of \nthe Military Family.'' I am honored to be an original cosponsor of this \nresolution, along with my colleagues on the Committee on Armed \nServices, Senator Levin, Senator Ben Nelson and Senator Graham.\n  Our Nation is honored by the brave men and women who selflessly risk \ntheir lives for our freedom, and by their families, who accept risks, \nboth known and unknown, in support of their country and loved ones who \nserve. The programs and resources our Nation provides must match the \nquality of the service and sacrifice of military families. That is why \nI and others fought so hard to include a special provision in the post-\n9/11 G.I. bill to allow career service members the opportunity to share \nthe educational benefits that they earn with their immediate family \nmembers.\n  Many military families are distinguished by generations, who have \nserved, from the American Revolution, to the American Civil War, World \nWars, Korea, Vietnam, the first gulf war and recent conflicts. The \nresolution before us today recognizes the contributions and resilience \nof all military families, and especially those who have endured \nmultiple deployments, or the loss of a loved one who answered the call \nto service and paid the ultimate price in defense of our Nation.\n  SFC Kimberly Hazelgrove was serving as an intelligence expert in the \nU.S. Army when she received the news on January 23, 2004, that her \nhusband, Army CW2 Brian Hazelgrove, had died. His helicopter crashed on \nits return from a combat mission in northern Iraq. On that tragic day, \nKimberly Hazelgrove became a survivor of an American hero. But, like so \nmany whose spouses have died as a consequence of their service to our \nNation, she is also a hero in her own right. Kimberly had to abandon \nher own promising military career to care for four young children. She \nstruggled, with the help of family and friends, to start over--to \ntransition to civilian life, to find employment in which to apply her \nmilitary skills, and return to school--and with courage and \ndetermination she succeeded. Today she balances a new career with the \nneeds of the children that she and Brian had planned to raise, and has \nnever abandoned her selfless advocacy on behalf of survivors of the \nfallen. Kimberly Hazelgrove represents the essence of service and \nsacrifice of military families, and I salute her.\n  Not all military families are defined only as the service member, a \nspouse,\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\nand children. Many of the young men and women serving our country are \nunmarried and identify as a family with their parents and siblings. My \nfriend 1LT Andrew Kinard graduated from the Naval Academy in 2005 and \nchose to lead Marines in Iraq. Andrew deployed as a platoon leader with \nthe Second Marine Division in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in \nSeptember 2006. He was gravely wounded by an IED attack while leading a \nsecurity patrol in Al Anbar Province. His father Harry immediately left \nhis surgical practice so that he could buoy Andrew's spirit through \ndozens of surgeries that followed. His mother, Mary, remained with \nAndrew for 5 more months after her husband returned to his medical \npractice. The separation that Andrew's parents and siblings endured \nrepresents a family's selfless sacrifice, to support Andrew and his \nquality of life even as he faced many surgeries and grueling physical \ntherapy. Andrew Kinard is now a retired marine and will enter Harvard \nLaw School in the fall. The Kinard family represents the unifying, \nsupportive force of a military family that helps a service member \nsurvive the most grievous wounds of war, and then get back to the \nimportant work of citizenship. I salute them.\n  MAJ Brian Love is a Green Beret. His family accompanied him to \nassignment in Germany where, in 2004, their son Patrick was diagnosed \nwith autism. Today Brian and his wife Naomi apply the unique problem \nsolving skills of military special forces to the daily challenge of \nmeeting Patrick's complex needs--a challenge compounded by the rigors \nof a career as a military leader, and the uncertain limitations of \nFederal, State and local programs. Major Love has deployed to Iraq \ntwice since 2005. He believes that he is a better leader--that his \nfamily relationships are stronger--for having seen the world through \nthe eyes of a child with special needs. Brian is now preparing to \nassume command of an Army special forces unit and faces the possibility \nof future deployments. His service, and that of his wife Naomi, honors \neach of us. Because of their service, and thousands like them, we can \nall view our victories differently. As an emblem of the dedicated \nservice of military families and to their children, I salute them.\n  Finally, Mary Scott modestly asserts that hers is a ``normal military \nfamily.'' Her father was killed in 1972 in Vietnam; her husband served \nfor 30 years in the U.S. Army; each one of their six children serves \ntheir nation in the military today. Kate is an Army captain and lawyer \nand now serves in Iraq; Karoline, an Air Force captain and public \naffairs officer; Andy, an Army captain and lawyer who has also deployed \nto Iraq; 1LT Kerney Scott pilots an Army Blackhawk in Korea; 2LT Alec \nScott is a newly commissioned officer in the Army Chaplain Corps, and \nCadet Adam Scott, followed his family's well worn path to the U.S. \nMilitary Academy. ``It's not unusual,'' Mary says, ``for kids to go \ninto the family business.''\n  All of those whom I have described and their families, live the \nvalues of military service, and enrich us all. They volunteer and \nadvocate on behalf of causes greater than their own. They support one \nanother during challenging times, and find that even in difficulty they \nare bound more closely together.\n  I rise in support of the resolution encouraging the recognition of \n2009 as the ``Year of the Military Family.'' I salute all military \nfamilies, and it is to their service that I dedicate my own.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements related to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 165) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the tobacco \ncontrol act. It has been said over and over--and I want to reassert--\nthat tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the \nUnited States. It kills more than 400,000 Americans each year. That is \nstaggering. We think of all the deaths by automobiles. Here tobacco is \nkilling close to half a million people a year. An additional 50,000 a \nyear are dying because of exposure to secondhand smoke.\n  I will never forget, when I was a kid, flying on airplanes. It was \nback in the days that people smoked on airplanes. I would come off of \nthe airplane, and I would smell the sleeve of my coat, and it would be \ntotal tobacco smoke.\n  Breaking it down for my State of Florida: 28,000 people die each year \nin my State alone from tobacco-related illnesses. Despite the risk \ninvolved with tobacco consumption, 20 percent of Americans--that is \nalmost 40 million people--still smoke cigarettes. It is tough to break \nthe habit. Fortunately, I have never been a smoker, but I understand \npeople who are. One of them is our President. It is tough to break the \nhabit. I was with him a lot during the campaign, because he was in my \nState campaigning. He would break out that pack of Nicorette chewing \ngum. He would go to work on that chewing gum. And more power and more \ncredit to the President for breaking this habit. It is tough.\n  Here is what is sad. Nearly 90 percent of smokers began as children, \nand they got addicted by the time they were adults. It is estimated \nthat 3,500 children try cigarettes for the first time each day, and \neach day 1,000 children become regular smokers. It would really be \nsomething if we could change that. Look at what it would save us in \nhealth care costs. We are getting ready to mark up in this month, in \nthe Finance Committee and in the HELP Committee, the big health reform \npackage. Think how much money we could save if we didn't have all of \nthese deaths because of tobacco usage. And of course, the health care \ncost resulting from tobacco use amounts to $96 billion a year, more \nthan $54 billion of which is borne by the Federal Government. We can \nsee that would be staggering, if we had a magic wand and we could stop \nthis health care cost to the country. No wonder our health care costs \nare so high, if you look at that and the addiction to alcohol and all \nof the health care costs.\n  Yet tobacco products are largely an unregulated product. It basically \nis exempt from requirements to disclose product ingredients and exempt \nfrom undergoing product testing. On top of that, manufacturers are able \nto advertise and market products to youth without the necessary \nrestrictions. At least we have stopped magazine advertisements and TV \nadvertisements. But have my colleagues seen this new kind of candy that \nis being marketed that is basically to addict children to nicotine? \nWhen are we going to put an end to this?\n  There are a bunch of us who are cosponsoring this bill to give the \nFood and Drug Administration the authority to regulate the \nmanufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. This \nlegislation would try to restrict youth smoking by restricting access \nto tobacco products and prohibit marketing campaigns that specifically \ntarget children. If this is such a bad thing and a consequence on the \nfinancial condition of the country, isn't that something we ought to \nstop, targeting children to get them hooked?\n  What we find is, so many adults were hooked when they were children. \nThis legislation is also going to try to put a bead on consumer safety \nby requiring full disclosure of the product ingredients--that would \nhave to be disclosed to the Food and Drug Administration--and for the \nFDA to mandate the elimination of certain ingredients and additives \nthat are going to be put out there for consumers. This bill is going to \ntry to make sure we get adequate and accurate information out to the \npublic by giving the Food and Drug Administration the authority to \nrestrict tobacco marketing, to require stronger warning labels and to \nregulate the manufacturers' claims about certain products having fewer \nhealth risks.\n  Tobacco use costs us billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of \nlives. When are we going to learn? Now is the time for us to step up \nand try to help protect the public from dangerous products and the very \nsubtle tactics used to get young people addicted to tobacco.\n  I sure hope we are going to be able to pass this bill and pass it \nfairly quickly this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/02/senate-section/article/S5984-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
