The majority will control the first block \nand Republicans will control the next. Senators will be permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  I expect the House of Representatives to send a conference report to \nthe Senate this afternoon. When it arrives, we will consider it. If \ncloture needs to be invoked, the Senate will have to be in session this \nweekend for a Saturday vote and a Sunday vote in order to complete \naction on these bills. This bill includes the bills we have tried to \ncomplete. We have been held up by the minority on these bills, but we \nhave made progress. The first will be the Transportation appropriations \nbill, Commerce-Justice-Science, Military Construction, Labor-HHS, \nfinancial services, and State-Foreign Operations. That would leave the \nonly remaining bill to be the Defense appropriations bill, which we \nwill do sometime before the end of the year. We hope we can get word \nfrom the Republicans today what they want to do. Whatever they want to \ndo, it is in their hands.\n  Everyone should understand that procedurally, no one can stop us from \nmoving to the appropriations bills. It is bipartisan. We have worked \nclosely with Republicans on this matter. We automatically go off the \nhealth care bill when we get on this. We are waiting for the score to \ncome back from the Congressional Budget Office. There isn't a lot we \ncan do until we get that done, which would be next week. So no time is \nlost on health care. We have to complete our work for the year anyway. \nSo we have to do this bill.\n  Whenever we hear from the Republicans, Senators will know what their \nschedules can be. We could complete our work today and come back and \nwork something out so that we can have a Monday vote. But whatever the \nRepublicans want, we will be happy to cooperate with them--I shouldn't \nsay whatever they want.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/10/senate-section/article/S12836-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3590, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3590) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the case \n     of members of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal \n     employees, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 2786, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 2793 (to amendment No. 2786), to \n     provide for the importation of prescription drugs.\n       Crapo motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance \n     with instructions.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11 a.m. shall be equally divided and controlled by the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, let me \nlay out today's program. It has been 3 weeks since the majority leader \nmoved to proceed to the health care reform bill. This is the 11th day \nof debate. The Senate has considered 18 amendments or motions. It has \nconducted 14 rollcall votes. Today, the Senate will continue debating \nthe amendment by the Senator from North Dakota on prescription drug \nreimportation, we will continue debating the motion by the Senator from \nIdaho on taxes, and we will continue debate on the bill. Under the \nprevious order, the time until 1 p.m. today will be for debate only, \nwith the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees. Beginning at 11 o'clock, Republicans will control the \nfirst half hour, and the majority will control the second half hour. We \nwill continue discussions to try to find a way forward.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the statistics the Senator from \nMontana cited about how long we have been debating this and how many \namendments we have done. That is how few amendments we have done, \nactually. The majority is now filibustering their own bill. I have no \nidea why that is happening. We have been calling for votes on both of \nthese amendments that have been proposed so far and haven't been able \nto get the votes. I don't understand how they can talk about how many \namendments are being done.\n  I also have to voice some other frustration. I don't know how many \ntimes I have heard the exact same speech by the Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin, on this floor talking about the amount of hours that have \nbeen spent together working on these bills in the HELP Committee and \nthe Gang of 6 in the Finance Committee. It isn't about how many hours \nwe spend together. It isn't about how many hours we spend on the floor. \nIt is whether we are accepting ideas. I understand the other party won \nthe last election, but somehow they will have to get over this attitude \nthat they won the election, they get to write the bill, they don't have \nto take any ideas from anybody else.\n  In the HELP Committee, I keep pointing out that most of the things we \nturned in were kind of punctuation corrections and spelling \ncorrections. Any ideas we actually had that appeared to be accepted to \nbe in the bill were ripped out of the bill before it was actually \nformally printed, without talking to us. What kind of bipartisan deal \nis that?\n  Another thing with the HELP Committee, we have only had 10 days of \ndebate on this. We did more than that in the HELP Committee when we \nwere marking up the bill.\n  But we are having, in the words of Yogi Berra, deja vu all over \nagain. When we were having that markup, the majority withheld a \nsignificant part of the bill, a big part of the bill. It was the \ngovernment-run option part of the bill. They wouldn't give us the \nwording on that. I think they were still writing it. Maybe that is what \nis happening right now too. But we couldn't get the text we were going \nto write amendments on so that we could deal with the bill. I think \nAmerica noticed that in August. People said: How come everybody isn't \nreading the bill? You can't read what you don't have.\n  The point I am making is, right now the newspapers are full of \ninformation--well, speculation; it has to be speculation--about what \nthis new Medicare expansion does. I haven't run into anybody who has \nseen the text of that. I have asked some of the media, and they didn't \nsee the text. They got a briefing. We haven't even had a briefing. The \nmajority side has had a briefing, but our folks who have talked to \nthose folks said: Wow, that was pretty general. How could you make up \nyour mind on whether you are going to support it based on the little \nbit of information you received? That is not the way to run any kind of \nan organization, especially if you want bipartisan votes.\n  You can't write the bill in secret, which is what was done with this \nbill. There wasn't a Republican involved in the behind-the-door stuff \nLeader Reid did to put together the bill we have now. That is not \nbipartisan. There\n\n[[Page S12837]]\n\nhasn't been a single person from the Republican side briefed on this \nnew proposal that is going to save the world.\n  Actually, I noticed that the American Medical Association suddenly \nleft the bill and said: This will be the worst thing that could happen \nto us. The hospital associations, which have been strong supporters of \nthe bill, have also said this won't work, particularly the Mayo Clinic, \nwhich we have been holding up as one of the prime examples of the way \nto do health care, saying: If this Medicare expansion happens, it will \ncost us millions. We won't be able to provide the kind of care we have \nbeen providing.\n  What is the deal around here? When are we going to actually get to \nsee something? When is the majority actually going to share with us \nthis marvelous idea they have had? What kind of a way to run a business \nis that?\n  Are we going to recess for the weekend? I don't want to recess for \nthe weekend. I am conscious of the 11 days we have been debating, and \nwe have only covered 14 amendments. We have a lot of important \namendments that either will be a part of the bill or will help the \npeople in this country to understand what is being thrust on them. \nThere has never been a bill of such importance as this one from the \nstandpoint of how many people it affects. We are talking about \nreforming health care in America. That is everybody. That is every \nsingle individual, every single provider. Every single business will be \naffected by this bill.\n  We talk about 2,074 pages, which seems like a lot. It would be for a \nnormal bill that you could debate in a limited period, which is what we \nare being asked to do. But 2,074 pages isn't nearly enough to cover \nhealth care for America.\n  So why is it only 2,074 pages? There are hundreds of references in \nthere to how the Secretary of Health and Human Services is going to \nsolve all the problems. The things we aren't able to put into detail in \nthere we just assign to her, and she will magically be able to solve \nthe problems for American health care. After all, it is her Department. \nBut that is not going to happen. You can't give that many assignments \nto any agency, any department, any group of people and expect them, in \na reasonable amount of time, to come up with solutions, solutions that \nought to be decided on by this body, the elected officials--not \nappointed officials but elected officials. That is not going to happen \nwith this bill.\n  The only way that could happen is if we took significant parts of it \nand put it up one piece at a time and solved it. That is what seniors \nare asking for. They are asking for us to take the Medicare part and \ngive them some assurance that when we are through, it will work. We are \nnot even getting to see a significant part of it. We have been pointing \nout how taking $464 billion out of Medicare will break it, will ruin \nit. You just can't steal $464 billion out of Medicare and have it come \nout good. The majority recognizes that. That is why they put in the \nspecial commission that is going to come to us each and every year and \nsuggest the kinds of cuts we ought to make to keep that solvent.\n\n  The biggest thing we ought to do is take these cuts that are provided \nand make them actually apply only to Medicare. But how are you going to \nfund the expansion of Medicare now down to age 55? How do you do that? \nI guess you charge a premium to those people. That is kind of the rumor \nthat is out there. How big of a premium? How big of a premium are you \ngoing to thrust on those people? I suspect it is going to be the older \nand the sicker people in that 55- to 64-age category who are going to \nwant to shift over to Medicare.\n  If it is a higher premium so the system stays solvent--having nothing \nto do, of course, with age, because we cannot do that under the bill, \nor sickness, because we cannot do that under the bill--and those are \ngood ideas--but those better be up in that range of the high-risk pools \nthat the States already have.\n  People come to me and say: You have to do something about health care \nbecause we cannot afford that high-risk pool; it is too expensive. \nWell, how much more are we going to expect the young people to pitch in \nin their paycheck? That is where the Medicare money comes from right \nnow. They deduct a portion of the paycheck from every single working \nAmerican, and that goes into Medicare, and gets paid out right away to \nMedicare recipients, none of whom or hardly any of whom are the ones \npaying into the system. They are hoping that system is going to be \nthere when they get older.\n  What I am asking for is for the majority to show us the paper and \ngive us a reasonable time to look at it and give America a reasonable \ntime to look at it. I do not think it is unreasonable for that to be on \nthe Internet. That is a significant part of the bill. That would be a \nsignificant bill all by itself. It was held from our view when the HELP \nCommittee did it. Incidentally, that HELP Committee bill--that was put \ntogether in 2 weeks without our help and put on us--parts of it were \nwithheld, as this has been withheld, until the last minute and then \nthrust in.\n  That is what created this enormous outrage across America of: Did you \nread the bill? How can you read the bill if you have not seen anything \nin it, if it has not been given to you? I do not think it is intended \nto be given to us until we have to shuffle this thing through at the \nend.\n  The anticipation was to get this done by Christmastime, and the \nmajority side keeps talking about getting this done by Christmastime. \nWill we have time to read it before Christmastime? Will we have a \nchance to do any amendments on it before Christmastime? I am willing to \nstay around and work through the weekend and keep doing amendments, but \nI would like to see this marvelous idea that is going to solve the \nwhole problem. If it was that marvelous and that good of an idea, I \nthink it would be shared already.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally charged against both \nsides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, commenting on the budget process in the \n1980s, former CBO Director Rudy Penner said:\n\n       The process is not the problem; the problem is the problem.\n\n  The chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee have proposed \nanother new budget process. No one has shown greater zeal in taking on \nthe budget deficit than the chairman and ranking Republican Member of \nthe Budget Committee. I commend their good intentions. They work hard. \nBut we should reject this process. Instead, we should solve the \nproblem.\n  In their press release yesterday, Senators Conrad and Gregg said that \n``Everything needs to be on the table, including spending and \nrevenues.'' That is a quote: ``Everything needs to be on the table, \nincluding spending and revenues.'' But why stop there?\n  If Congress is going to outsource its core fiscal responsibilities, \nwhy stop with those responsibilities? Why not cede to this Commission \nall of the legislation in the next Congress? Why don't we outsource the \nentire year's work and then adjourn for the year?\n  Come to think of it, if we do cede all of our powers to this \nCommission, what is to stop them from inserting any and all business \nfor the next Congress into the Commission's one, nonamendable, omnibus \nvehicle? No restrictions. They could put anything they want into it.\n  There is the rub. For if the Commission were merely a farce, then we \ncould be satisfied with ridiculing it. But this Commission and its new \nfast-track process are truly dangerous. If we were to cede all of our \nresponsibilities to this Commission, and we were to tie our hands so we \ncould not amend its recommendations, then we would risk setting in \nmotion some truly terrible policy.\n  Under the proposed fast-track procedures, we would not be able to \namend the proposal. What if we did not like\n\n[[Page S12838]]\n\nthe Commission's recommendations? We would not be able to replace the \nCommission's recommendations with our own.\n  It is clear from their press release that Senators Conrad and Gregg \nhave painted a big red target on Social Security and Medicare. That is \nwhat this Commission is all about. It is a big roll of the dice for \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  Advocates of the task force say the regular order is not working. \nThey say we need a new process to address our long-term fiscal \nchallenges. But they are wrong. The regular order is working. We are \nenacting health care reform. And serious people know that controlling \nthe costs of health care is the central path to addressing our long-\nterm budget challenges.\n  The lion's share of the reason why deficits are projected to grow so \nmuch in the long run is the enormous increase in the costs of health \ncare. We are doing something about it. We are doing it the right way. \nWe held open hearings. We legislated in committee. We are voting on \namendments. We are legislating. We are doing what our people back home \nsent us here to do.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that health care reform will cut \nthe deficit $130 billion in the first 10 years and $650 billion in the \nsecond 10 years. That is nearly $800 billion in CBO-certified deficit \nreduction in health care alone. And next year we will legislate \nfundamental tax reform.\n\n  But some appear to want to throw in the towel. Some want to punt our \nresponsibilities away. I can see that a commission may be attractive to \nsome. After all, it is an easy way out. It takes away our \naccountability for what we do. Senators can blame it all on the \nCommission. Senators could say: The Commission made me do it.\n  But this is no time to abdicate responsibility. This new Commission \nand this Congress are less than a year old. We should not shirk our \nresponsibility. Rather, we should do the job our constituents sent us \nhere to do.\n  Luckily, we already have a process to address the budget. It is \ncalled the congressional budget process. Here is a novel idea: Why \ndon't we use the budget process to address the budget deficit? If the \nchairman and ranking Republican Member of the Budget Committee are in \nsuch broad agreement on their goals, why don't they skip the Commission \nand go straight to their recommendation? That is exactly why Congress \ncreated the budget resolution and the reconciliation bill in the first \nplace.\n  We do not need a new commission to do our work. We do not need a new \nprocess to solve the problem. To solve the problem, we just need to \nsolve the problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this Commission idea. Let's get back \nto solving the problem. Let's get back to enacting real health care \nreform.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am fascinated by the speech we heard. \nThere has been a bipartisan proposal. The chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee have proposed \na commission, and that bipartisan deal is being chastised here. So we \nare on the bill, where 64 percent of the amendments that have been \nfiled so far were filed by the Democrats, and I keep wondering why they \nare filibustering their own bill.\n  Then when something bipartisan does come up, they are opposed to that \ntoo. I know they think the only good ideas come from the other side of \nthe aisle, and I do get frustrated with that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that one point? \nJust on that one point, will my good friend from Wyoming yield, on our \ntime?\n  Mr. ENZI. Certainly.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The question is this: Doesn't the Senator agree--it is \nkind of a hard question to ask--that this Senator spent an inordinate \namount of time in the last year trying to get a bipartisan solution to \nhealth care reform; that is, in our committee, in the Finance \nCommittee, having an open process, fully consulting on both sides of \nthe aisle? Then we had that other group called the Group of 6, of which \nthe Senator is a part. I think we had 130--I have forgotten how many \ndays and meetings we had, how many hours we met.\n  But isn't it true that at least this Senator tried as hard as he \ncould to get a bipartisan solution?\n  Mr. ENZI. I cannot fault the Senator from Montana for his efforts to \nget a bipartisan solution. As I have said many times, I am sorry he had \nto be cut off by phony time deadlines that kept us from reaching that \nkind of a solution, and then winding up with things that are in this \nbill we are talking about that were not a part of our discussions--\nagain, the things that were proposed by people on this side of the \naisle that are not in that bill.\n  There were some possibilities for solutions. But we wound up with \nthat same situation of: We won the election, we get to write the bill, \nand it has to be done quickly. So I am disappointed in the whole \nprocess.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. ENZI. I will.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I certainly respect that the Senator from Montana worked \nvery hard to have a bipartisan initiative here, but this bill we are \ndealing with has no bipartisanship to it at all. Was this not written \nin camera behind closed doors for 8 weeks by the majority leader? Was \nthere a Republican in that room at any time? And we have now been on it \nfor what, 8 days or something, while they wrote it for 8 weeks. And \nfurthermore, is there not rumored to be floating around this Congress \nsomewhere, in some room, again--that we have not been invited to--a \nmajor rewrite of this bill called the managers' amendment, which \nsupposedly is going to expand coverage to people under Medicare to 55 \nyears of age, with Medicare already being bankrupt, and already cannot \nafford the people they have on Medicare? It is going to expand it. We \nhave not seen it. Yet this is going to change this bill fundamentally \nand change health care fundamentally.\n  Is that bipartisan? I ask the Senator from Wyoming if that is the \ncase? Was this bill written in a bipartisan manner? Were any \nRepublicans in the room? Did it go through a committee process? Was it \namended? Did it not take 8 weeks to write it, and it has now been on \nthe floor for 8 days, and all of our amendments are being pushed to the \nside? And are we not hearing about a massive--a massive--rewrite of \nthis bill that is going to appear deus ex machina from the majority \nleader's office and fundamentally change the way health care is \ndelivered in this country? Is that going to be bipartisan?\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator is absolutely right. We have not even seen this \nnew piece. Nobody wants to show us the new piece. They keep talking \nabout it. They have leaked it to the newspapers, but they will not show \nit to us, and then they keep talking about how this bill is going to \nsolve the deficits for this country; that there is $157 billion or \nsomething saved in the first 10 years. That is only--only--if you use \nthe phoney accounting they are using. It is only if you don't do the \ndoc fix. It is only if you don't solve the myriad of other things we \nhave brought out.\n\n  We have a bill they keep talking about as being the solution. America \nhas figured it out, but the Democrats haven't figured it out.\n  I see the leader is on the Senate floor. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues for \ninterrupting their conversation. Hopefully, it can continue upon \ncompletion of my remarks, and I may well wish to join in.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the American people have seen what \nDemocrats in Congress plan to do with seniors' health care. They have \nlooked on in disbelief as almost every Democrat in the Senate voted \nagain and again and again to slash Medicare. Now they are watching in \ndisbelief as Democrats float the idea of herding millions more--\nmillions more--into this nearly bankrupt program as part of a backroom \ndeal to force their plan for health care on the American people by \nChristmas.\n  Every day it seems we hear new revelations about secret conference \nroom deliberations where Democrats are\n\n[[Page S12839]]\n\nfrantically working to get their 60 votes by Christmas. And every day \nwe hear about some new idea they have come up with for creating a \ngovernment plan by another name. This week's version would have the \nOffice of Personnel Management running the program, an idea that was \nshot down almost as soon as it was announced by the former OPM Director \nwho said it couldn't be done.\n  This is what he said: ``I flat out think that OPM doesn't have the \ncapacity to do this type of role.''\n  This is precisely the kind of approach Americans are tired of in \nWashington, and this is precisely the kind of health care plan \nAmericans did not want.\n  Seniors thought they could expect lower costs. What they are getting \ninstead is an assault on their Medicare. Small business owners thought \nthey could expect lower costs. What they are getting instead are higher \ntaxes, stiff fines, and costly mandates. Working Americans thought they \nwould get more efficiency, less fraud, cheaper rates. What they are \ngetting instead are new bureaucracies and higher costs.\n  Business leaders from across the country enthusiastically support the \nidea of health care reform. They know better than anyone that costs are \nout of control and that something needs to be done. But they have read \nthe bill Democrats in Congress have come up with and they are telling \nus this isn't it. This isn't it, they are saying. Not only won't this \nbill solve the problem, they say, it makes the existing problems \nactually worse.\n  The Vice President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was here \nyesterday. He said there is a desperate need for reform--reform that \nbends the cost curve down. He said, unfortunately, this bill fails the \ntest. He says this bill will only lead businesses to lower wages, \ndecrease working hours, reduce hiring, and cut jobs. He said it adds to \nthe deficit; it adds to the debt. It includes massive new spending \nprograms and entitlements and incredibly, as I have noted, it also \nborrows from existing entitlement programs. It borrows from existing \nentitlement programs that are already in trouble.\n  Businesses look at this bill and they see $\\1/2\\ trillion in new \ntaxes, as many as 10 million employees at risk of losing coverage, and \ncrushing new mandates. This is not reform. This bill doesn't solve our \nproblems, it spreads them. That is why seniors don't like this bill. \nThat is why job creators don't like this bill. That is why public \nopinion has dramatically shifted against this bill.\n  Americans want reform, but this is not the one they asked for. This \nbill is fundamentally flawed and it can't be fixed. There is no way to \nfix this bill.\n  Americans want us to stop, they want us to start over, and they want \nus to get it right. Democrats should stop talking at the American \npeople and start listening to them.\n  Now, Republicans are prepared to provide a platform for the debate as \nlong as it takes--as long as it takes. The majority leader said we \nwould be working every weekend. We take him at his word. We expect to \nbe here this weekend, and we look forward to it. Republicans are \nconvinced there is nothing more important we could do than to stop this \nbill and start over with the kind of step-by-step reforms Americans \nreally want.\n  We have amendments. We want votes. We have been waiting since Tuesday \nto have more votes. We are eager to continue the debate.\n  Here is what my good friend, the majority leader, said when we \nstarted the debate on November 30:\n\n       Debating and voting late at night. It definitely means the \n     next weekends--plural--we'll be working. I have events I'll \n     have to postpone, some I'll have to cancel. There is not an \n     issue more important than finishing this legislation. I know \n     people have things they want to do back in their States, and \n     rightfully so. I know people have fundraisers because they're \n     running for reelection. I know there are other important \n     things people have to do, but nothing could be more important \n     than this, and we notified everybody prior to the break that \n     we would be working weekends.\n\n  We took the majority leader at his word when we started this debate \non November 30 that we would be working weekends. Actually, it is a \nweek later--this past Monday of this week--he said, ``It appears we \ncertainly will be here this weekend again.''\n  My Members understood we would be here on the weekends. We don't \nthink there is anything more important we can do, and we are a little \nbit upset--maybe more than a little bit--that we were not able to vote \non an amendment yesterday. We have been prepared to vote for several \ndays. There are amendments that have been offered that we can't seem to \nget a vote on. The American people are expecting us to vote on this \nbill, and we are here and prepared to do it. We would like to get \nstarted voting on amendments today.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. Leader, if I might ask a question through the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. On that last point, it does seem there is a slowdown \noccurring on amendments. As I understand it, we have four or five very \nsubstantive amendments dealing with taxes, dealing with employer \nmandates, that we are ready to go to, and we are ready to vote on; is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from New Hampshire, that is \nabsolutely the case. We waited around all day to get a vote on the \namendment by the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo. We were told there \nwould be a side-by-side, and it mysteriously has not yet appeared. But \nwe are here ready to work. We share the view of the majority leader \nthat this is an extremely important issue, and we want to vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I hope at some point today maybe we should propound a \nunanimous consent setting those four items up for votes on Saturday and \nSunday.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, I think that is a good idea. Of course, we would \nprefer to vote today. We are going to be voting Saturday and Sunday \ntoo. I think the sooner the better. The American people are actually \nexpecting us--they thought we were here voting and debating amendments \non this bill, and we are going to continue to press forward and try to \nget that done.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, could I inquire of the Chair before the \nSenator from North Dakota speaks how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 14 minutes, and the \nRepublicans have just under 8.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would ask, is the Senator from North \nDakota recognized under an order of a colloquy at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair simply recognized the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, was there a time reserved for a colloquy \nbetween myself and the Senator from New Hampshire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the reason we are here on the floor is our \nunderstanding was we had time reserved at 10:30 for a colloquy between \nthe Senator from New Hampshire and myself.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 20 \nminutes equally divided between myself and the Senator from North \nDakota at this time. I see the Senator from Connecticut obviously \nwishes to speak also.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was not a party to the request, but I am \ncertainly prepared to yield 10 minutes of our time to our colleagues \nfor a colloquy and whatever time the Republican side may want to yield \nto Senator Gregg from their time remaining for that purpose as well. Is \nthat satisfactory?\n  Mr. GREGG. Do we have time remaining on our side?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 10 minutes of \nour time be allocated to Senator Conrad for the purpose of a colloquy \nor whatever other purpose he may have.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Do the Republicans have 10 minutes remaining for Senator \nGregg?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is my understanding the leader spoke \nunder leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ENZI. So we should have an adequate 10 minutes to allocate to the \nSenator.\n\n[[Page S12840]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenators may engage in a 20-minute colloquy.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank our colleagues. I especially \nthank our colleague, the Senator from Wyoming, and our colleague from \nConnecticut. Thank you for your courtesy. We appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. President, this is a headline from Newsweek, December 7. In fact, \nit was the cover story: ``How Great Powers Fall. Steep Debt, Slow \nGrowth, High Spending Kill Empires--and America Could Be Next.''\n  If you go to the story--by the way, interestingly enough, this was on \nDecember 7, Pearl Harbor day. If you go into the story that is in the \nmagazine, it says:\n\n       This is how empires decline. It begins with a debt \n     explosion. It ends with an inexorable reduction in the \n     resources available for the Army, Navy, and the Air Force. If \n     the United States doesn't come up soon with a credible plan \n     to restore the Federal budget to balance over the next 5 to \n     10 years, the danger is very real that a debt crisis could \n     lead to a major weakening of American power.\n\n  All we have to do is look at the facts. This shows the debt of the \nUnited States from 2001 projecting to 2019. Obviously, the first half \nof this chart is not a projection. It has already happened. We are \napproaching a debt that is 100 percent of the gross domestic product of \nthe United States, the highest the debt has been since after World War \nII and the only time in our Nation's history it has been that high. The \nprojection is by 2019 the debt will be high. The projection is by 2019 \nthe debt will be 114 percent of the gross domestic product of the \nUnited States.\n  More alarming, the long-term outlook of the Congressional Budget \nOffice says we will have a debt that will reach 400 percent of the \ngross domestic product of the United States by 2050 on the current \ntrend line. No one believes that is a sustainable circumstance. We have \nhad testimony from the head of the General Accounting Office, the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve all saying this is a completely \nunsustainable circumstance.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said this in June of 2009:\n\n       The difficulty of the choices notwithstanding, CBO's long-\n     term budget projections make clear that doing nothing is not \n     an option.\n\n  Doing nothing is not an option.\n  The National Journal, in an article entitled ``The Debt Problem is \nWorse Than You Think'' said this in a story just weeks ago:\n\n       Simply put, even alarmists may be underestimating the size \n     of the debt problem, how quickly it will become unbearable, \n     and how poorly prepared our political system is to deal with \n     it.\n\n  I hope people are listening. I hope they are paying attention. I hope \nour colleagues are.\n  Yesterday a group of us introduced legislation to confront this debt \nthreat head on. There are now 31 cosponsors of that legislation: 19 \nRepublicans, 12 Democrats. This legislation offers the following: to \naddress the unsustainable long-term fiscal imbalance; that a task force \nshould be created with everything on the table. It would consist of 18 \nMembers: 8 Republicans from the Congress, 8 Democrats from the \nCongress, and 2 representatives of the administration.\n  All task force members must be currently serving in Congress or the \nadministration so they are accountable to the public. If 14 of the 18 \nMembers could agree on a report, that report would come to Congress for \na vote.\n  There would be no filibustering, a straight up-or-down vote on the \nrecommendations. The report would be submitted after the 2010 election \nto insulate it from politics. And, the vote would be designed to occur \nbefore the end of the 111th Congress. It would receive fast-track \nconsideration in the Senate and the House. There would be no \namendments. It would be a straight up-or-down vote. A supermajority of \nthe House and the Senate would have to vote for it, and the President \nwould retain his ability to veto.\n  This is legislation that is designed to get to the floors of the \nHouse and the Senate, legislation to deal with our long-term debt \nthreat, to face up to it. All of us know that with a problem, the \nsooner you deal with it, the less draconian the solutions need to be. \nFor those who say this poses a threat to Social Security and Medicare, \nthe opposite is true. A failure to act is what threatens Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  The trustees of Medicare have told us Medicare will go broke in 8 \nyears. They have also told us Medicare is cash negative today. That \nmeans more money is going out than is coming in. The same is true of \nSocial Security today. It is cash negative.\n  Now is the time. We are the ones who have an opportunity to help our \ncountry face up to a critical threat to the economic security of \nAmerica. Some suggest the bill before us on health care is an example \nthat the regular order will deal with this problem. Again, I believe \nthe reverse is true.\n  I believe the health care bill before us does modestly deal with the \ndeficit and debt--modestly. But it doesn't come close to dealing with \nthe debt bomb I have outlined. In fact, the reality is, we are on a \ncourse that is absolutely unsustainable. It is our responsibility to \nface up to it.\n  In our past, we have chosen special processes, commissions, a summit, \nor some other special process to deal with fiscal challenges because we \nhave learned, in our history, that going through the regular process \nand regular order is simply not going to succeed.\n  I have been here 23 years. I am on the Finance Committee. I am \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I have been on those committees for \nmany years. If there is one thing that is absolutely clear to me, it is \nthe regular order cannot and will not face up to a crisis of this \ndimension. It is going to take a special process, a special commitment \nof the Members and representatives of the administration to develop a \nplan that gets us back on track. It is going to take a special process \nto bring that plan to this floor for a vote up or down. That holds, I \nbelieve, the best prospects for success.\n  I believe this is a defining moment for this Chamber, for this \nCongress, for this administration. It is imperative that we find a way \nto deal with this debt threat. It poses one of the most dramatic \nchallenges to American economic strength that we have confronted in the \nhistory of this country. It is time to stand and be counted.\n  Thirty-one of us have sent forward a proposal--a bipartisan \nproposal--that would assure a vote on a plan to bring America back from \nthe brink. Let's give it a chance.\n  I thank the chair, and I especially thank the ranking member, Senator \nGregg, for his energy, his commitment, and his devotion to facing up \nto, I believe, one of the greatest challenges confronting America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am privileged to join the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee, on this initiative. \nWe have worked on it for a while, and we have come to a position of \nhaving a piece of legislation that accomplishes the goal as outlined by \nthe Senator from North Dakota. That is good news.\n  The outpouring of support in the Senate--over 31 cosponsors in just a \nbrief period of time--is a sign that there is a willingness to move in \na bipartisan way. That is good news.\n  Right now, for this country, after the possibility of a terrorist \ngetting a weapon of mass destruction and using it against us in the \nUnited States, the single biggest threat we have as a nation is the \nfact that we are on course toward fiscal insolvency. You cannot get \naround it. If we continue on the present course, this Nation goes \nbankrupt. We are already seeing the early signs of it. The early signs \nare devastating enough. We are seeing some of the nations who lend to \nus--and remember we are a debtor nation now of massive proportions--\nsaying: Hold on, you folks are not being responsible, especially about \nyour outyear debt.\n  Two days ago, we saw one of the rating agencies, Moody's, say England \nand the United States now are going to be put into a special category \nrelative to the rest of the industrialized world because their fiscal \nsituation is in such risk, and they are not managing their fiscal house \ncorrectly.\n  We know, as the Senator from North Dakota has outlined so correctly, \nthat within 10 years--maybe sooner--we are\n\n[[Page S12841]]\n\ngoing to get to a point where our debt has gotten so large we simply \ncannot pay it or, if we have to pay it, we are going to have to do some \nextraordinary things to do that, such as inflating the currency or \nraising taxes to a level where we reduce productivity and the \nopportunity for jobs. It is akin to a dog chasing its tail when you get \nyour debt to a certain level. When you have spent so much more than you \nhave taken in and you have promised so much more than you can afford to \npay and your debt gets to such a level, as a nation, you only have two \nchoices: You inflate the currency and destroy the quality of people's \nlives, destroying the value of their savings, and you put in an \ninflation economy, which is one of the worst things that can ever \nhappen to a country or you have to radically increase your tax burden \nto levels that are simply going to choke off the capacity of the Nation \nto create prosperity because people will not be able to be productive. \nYou will start to lose tax revenues as a result of that.\n  This is not a theoretical case. This is no longer something that is \nover the horizon. This problem is directly in front of us. We are \nhearing it from the people who lend us money, from the rating agencies, \nand we know it from intuitive common sense. Most Americans know this is \nan extraordinary problem.\n  We talked about this for a long time and we worked on it for a long \ntime. Yes, regular order should take care of this, but we know it will \nnot because we have seen what happens. When you put an idea on the \ntable to deal with major entitlement programs that affect so many \npeople, in such a personal way, immediately, those ideas are attacked \nand savaged, misrepresented, exploited, exaggerated, and hyperbolized \nby the interest groups that populate this city and other parts of the \ncountry for the purpose of making their political agenda move forward \nor their money-raising formula move forward.\n  When substantive, good ideas have been put on the table to try to \ncorrect this fiscal imbalance by dealing with questions of Social \nSecurity and Medicare or tax policy, we get clobbered on the policy \nside. We came to the conclusion from the right and the left that it is \nequally outrageous and equally destructive of constructive public \npolicy. We came to the conclusion that the only way you can do this is \nto create a process that drives the policy, rather than put the policy \non the table first, saying here is the policy and everybody jumps on it \nand kicks it and screams at it and so it never even gets to the \nstarting line. We decided let's get to a process that leads to policy \nand leads to an absolute vote.\n  The theory is, basically, threefold: One, the process has to be \nabsolutely fair and bipartisan. Nobody can feel they are being gamed. \nThe American people will not allow major policy to occur in these areas \nunless they are comfortable the policy is bipartisan and fair. So this \nprocess we have set up is a bipartisan affair. There will be 18 people. \nWe decided to go with people who actually have a responsibility for \nmaking decisions and understand the issues intimately; 16 from the \nCongress, as was mentioned--8 Republicans and 8 Democrats--and the 2 \nfrom the administration, with a supermajority to meet, to report, and \nthere will be cochairmen from each party. That gives us the bipartisan \nnature.\n  The second part that is critical to the exercise is that it be real \nand that it not end up being a game. We have seen so many commissions \nend up being just commissions. They put their report out and it ends up \non a shelf somewhere.\n  Something has to happen. What happens is, when this Commission \nreports with a supermajority and comes to Congress, by supermajority it \nmust be voted up or down. So there is an absolute right to a vote, and \nthe vote occurs on the policies proposed. That is critical. It is much \nalong the lines of what we did for base closures, for many of the same \nreasons. You couldn't close bases politically, so we did it by fast-\ntrack approval.\n  Third, there will be no amendments. Why? Amendments allow Members to \nhide in the corners. It is that simple: Somebody throws an amendment \nup--even if it is well intentioned--and people vote for the amendment \nand then say it didn't pass or I will not vote for the final product. \nYou have to have a policy put forward, and it will either attract a \nbipartisan supermajority and be a fair policy or it is not. If it \ndoesn't attract a bipartisan supermajority, clearly, it wasn't well \nthought out.\n  That is the process we have come to. The amount of sponsors we have \nreflects the fact that it is viable and that it is bipartisan. We have \n12 Democratic sponsors already and 19 Republicans. What else around \nhere has that with serious legislation? This is it.\n  I congratulate the Senator from North Dakota for his efforts. I am \nhopeful we can get a vote on it. Then, I hope it can pass, and I am \nhopeful we can get White House support and House support to do this.\n  We are running out of time. If we don't accomplish this fairly soon, \nthe outcome is very simple: We will pass on to our children less \nopportunity, a lower standard of living, and a weaker Nation than we \nreceived from our parents. No generation in American history has done \nthat. But that is what we are going to do if we don't take action. That \nis exactly what is going to happen. How can one generation do that to \nanother? In American history, that has never happened. This is an \nopportunity to avoid having that occur or at least help avoid it. I \nhope it will move forward.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time remains of the 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally shared.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me sum up by saying this: I have been here 23 years. \nWe saw the debt double in the previous 8 years. We know the debt is \nscheduled to more than double over the next 8 years if we fail to act. \nThat will be a debt, as I indicated earlier, of well over 100 percent \nof the gross domestic product of the United States.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us, on the current trend line, \nwe are headed for a debt that will be 400 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct of the United States. That is absolutely beyond the pale. We \nknow, from every serious expert who advises the Congress of the United \nStates, we can't go there. We can't possibly be on a course to have a \ndebt that is 400 percent of the gross domestic product of the country.\n  The question is, What do we do about it? There are some who say: \nWell, you stick with the status quo approach. It hasn't worked so far. \nWhy is there any reason to believe it will work now? I would say the \nhealth care legislation before us is a perfect example. The President \nhad a health care summit; he had a fiscal responsibility summit. At \nthose summits, it was asserted--and I think it was well intended--that \nhealth care reform would deal with a major part of the debt projection \nfacing us. Well, here we are. My belief is, this bill does modestly \nreduce the deficit in the short- and long-term. But it in no way deals \nwith the trajectory that is headed for a debt of this country of 400 \npercent of the GDP, because when you are in this circumstance, the \nregular legislative process cannot face up to short-term pain in \nexchange for long-term gain. It will not do it. This is our \nopportunity. We must act.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 1 o'clock will be controlled \nin 30-minute alternating blocks, with the majority controlling the \nfirst block and the Republicans controlling the second 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleagues from North Dakota and \nNew Hampshire leave, let me commend them for their efforts in this \nregard. There may be debates about the details of this legislation.\n  One of the first amendments I ever offered, sitting back in the far \ncorner, as a freshman Member of this body was a pay-as-you-go budget in \nthe Reagan administration. Then I was a cosponsor of Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings back in 1985--that was 24 years ago--which was an effort to \ntry to put some restraints on the exploding process at the time.\n  While I am not prepared necessarily to sign on this morning, I would \nbe remiss if I did not thank them for their efforts. And either \nsomething like this\n\n[[Page S12842]]\n\nor a variation of it is needed so there is some process in place to \nallow us to deal with these issues.\n  Before they wandered off and we were back on the health care debate, \nI wanted to thank them for their efforts.\n  Let me once again address issues that need to be clarified. We have \ndisagreements about the health care bill.\n  I want the record to reflect the efforts that have been made for over \na year now to involve our colleagues across the spectrum, beginning \nwith my predecessor, Senator Kennedy, who would be otherwise standing \nat this very podium but for his illness and his death. My office and \nhis staff worked closely together and I want to share the details of \nthose meetings that occurred beginning about a year ago to formulate \nthe very bill we are grappling with today. I was not a participant in \nthose early meetings. Senator Kennedy was, with his staff and Members \nof the minority staff right after the elections. I began to work in his \nplace starting around the first of the year or shortly thereafter.\n  There were numerous meetings between Members from across the spectrum \nfrom the Budget Committee, the Finance Committee, the HELP Committee, \ncountless meetings of staff in all three of these committees. Many of \nthem occurred in Chairman Baucus's office, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Battling over the substance of the bill is a very legitimate process. \nThere are 100 of us representing various constituencies and various \nideas. There is nothing inherently wrong about that. In fact, it is a \nhealthy process to go through. But I cannot stand here and accept the \nnotion that people have been excluded from the process. That is not the \ncase at all.\n  There are times when the majority, who has the responsibility to pose \nideas, will meet together to formulate an idea or a series of ideas to \nbring forward. To say this is a historical, unprecedented occurrence \ndefies what anyone who has known 5 minutes of the history of this \ninstitution knows. I recall only a few years ago when the minority \nleader and others were excluded from conference meetings between the \nHouse and the Senate. If Tom Daschle showed up, the word was, the \nconference committee would be canceled. Imagine, the minority leader, a \nconferee, dealing with the House and Senate, would show up and the \nmeeting would be canceled. With all due respect, it is that old line of \nClaude Rains in the famous movie ``Casablanca,'' walking into Rick's \nCafe, looking around with Humphrey Bogart there and saying: ``Is there \ngambling going on here? Shocking.'' Is politics going on in the Senate? \nYes, it is. And it has back to 1789, to the founding of the Republic. \nPolitics has happened in this institution where people try to formulate \nideas to bring together on behalf of our constituents across the \ncountry.\n  It needs pointing out, as I will, and I will lay out and provide \nshortly every single amendment offered by the other side--hardly \ntechnical, so everybody can read them--the provisions in this bill that \nwere specifically offered by Members of the minority that were accepted \neither in our committee or in other places and are reflected in the \nsubstance of this bill.\n  Is it their bill? No. Obviously, they have not voted for it. But a \nlot of the substance in it is theirs, and to suggest otherwise is not \ntrue. The notion that people have been excluded from this process is \njust not the case at all. In fact, going back, if you will, since \nJanuary of 2007 the HELP Committee has held 30 bipartisan hearings on \nhealth care reform, with 15 alone in 2009. Taken together, the HELP and \nFinance Committees held more than 100 bipartisan meetings. Beginning in \nDecember 2008, the bipartisan leadership of the HELP Committee, the \nFinance Committee, and the Budget Committee met 10 times to discuss \nhealth care reform legislation. Staff met even more frequently. Ideas \ndiscussed in those meetings are reflected in this bill. In 2008, the \nHELP Committee held 15 bipartisan health reform staff roundtables, \nwhich included Republican and Democratic staff from the HELP, Finance, \nand Budget Committees. Over 80 stakeholders from the pharmaceutical \nindustry, the insurance industry, those who advocated single-payer \napproaches--80 stakeholder meetings were held in the health care debate \nfrom across the political spectrum. Democrats, Republicans, patients, \nproviders, employers, unions, insurers, and drug device manufacturers \ncontributed recommendations to this bill. They were not all accepted. \nThe idea that we would take everyone's idea that comes to the table is \nludicrous on its face. But certainly the opportunity to affect the \noutcome of this bill was very much an open process.\n  In addition, committee staff held regular meetings with smaller \nrepresentative groups. Since April of 2009, these meetings have \nincluded staff from Senator Enzi's office, Senator Gregg's office, and \nSenator Hatch's office. These meetings included groups from across the \npolitical spectrum who met for 2-hour sessions twice a week to provide \ndetailed and thoughtful contributions to this bill.\n  In addition to these stakeholders, hundreds of groups attended larger \nstakeholder meetings on March 13 and May 15 where further \nrecommendations on reform were heard.\n  On June 10 and 11, prior to beginning of the markup of the HELP \nCommittee bill, Members had detailed, bipartisan discussions of the \ndraft legislation, including extensive options contributed by our \nRepublican colleagues. Options provided by Republican Members were \nreflected in the legislation approved by the committee.\n  On June 22, HELP Committee Senators also met with the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf and other CBO \nstaff.\n  The markup in the HELP Committee lasted almost a month--a record for \nthat committee, by the way. The committee held 56 hours of executive \nconsideration of the legislation, stretching across 23 different \nsessions over 13 days. Taken together with the Finance Committee, more \nthan 20 days were devoted to the amendment process alone. During the \nHELP Committee markup--I have mentioned this over and over again--we \nconsidered 287 amendments, almost 300 amendments, and 161 of those 287 \nwere accepted Republican amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record all of those \namendments that were accepted and the description of those amendments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12843]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE09.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S12844]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE09.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S12845]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE09.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S12846]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE09.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S12847]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE09.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S12848]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE09.006\n\n\n\n[[Page S12849]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE09.007\n\n\n\n[[Page S12850]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS10DE09.008\n\n\n\n[[Page S12851]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, specific pages in this bill and the language \nof these amendments or a synopsis of the language is included. These \nwere not just technical amendments. Let me mention some that were \nincluded.\n  Our colleague from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, offered an amendment \nthat subjects the public option to the same laws and requirements as \nprivate plans. This discussion that they were not involved in the \npublic option--here are amendments offered by Republicans accepted in \nthe committee dealing with the public option. Did we take all of them? \nOf course not. Of the 287 amendments, 161 of them, as you will now \nread, are reflected in these efforts.\n  Follow-on biologics: A bipartisan, Enzi-Hatch-Hagan--Hagan, a \nDemocrat, and Hatch and Enzi, Republicans--amendment establishes the \npathway for biosimilar biological products. This Republican amendment \nis reflected in the bill on page 1859.\n  Long-term care: Senator Gregg ensured that the new voluntary program \nto approve long-term care options would remain solvent for 75 years--\nthe CLASS Act--reflected on page 1931 of the bill.\n  Prevention--again, a bipartisan amendment offered by Senator Gregg \nand Senator Harkin that expands and strengthens the incentives \navailable for participation in workplace wellness programs, reflected \nin the bill on page 80.\n  The Murkowski of Alaska amendment will allow insurance companies to \noffer discounts for those who do not smoke. This is a Republican \namendment reflected on page 80 of the bill.\n  Coverage: Several amendments were offered by Senators Enzi, Coburn, \nRoberts, and others to make certain that nothing in the legislation \nwould allow for rationing of care and that no one would be denied care \nbased on age, disability, medical dependency, or quality of life. That \nis reflected as well on page 105 of the bill.\n  My colleague from Wyoming, the ranking member of the committee, had \n41 amendments that were included in the bill. For instance, in Title I, \nEnzi amendment No. 241 appears on page 185 of the marked-up bill. Line \n22: to ensure that individuals enrolled in the community health service \noption have access to all services. Senator Enzi's amendment is \nincluded in the bill. He offered amendments on page 272 to prevent \ndenial of care based on patient age, disability, medical dependency, \nquality of life, and antirationing proposals; follow-on biologics; \namendments to protect and ensure that data and prevention programs \ninclude rural populations. Again, I will provide a list of the 41 \namendments so my colleagues and others can read a synopsis of those \namendments--hardly punctuation marks in the bill. We may not agree with \nevery one. We accepted them. I thought they contributed to the bill, \nmade a better bill. I did not decry them; I welcomed them.\n  So the suggestion that this somehow has been jammed down the throats \nof people, with secret meetings going on--I don't think people ought to \nengage in that. You can vote against the bill if you want, but don't \nsuggest to me this process denied people a chance to be heard, to be \ninvolved, to be engaged. I went out of way my in the markup of that \nbill to stay for as many hours as people wanted to, for as long as they \nwanted to, to offer as many amendments as they wanted to. Staff worked \nall during the weekends of that process to go through these amendments. \nI remember on one occasion, after work over one weekend, I proposed \naccepting 40 amendments. I offered to accept all 40 of them, and my \nRepublican friends objected to a request to accept their amendments in \nthe committee.\n  So the notion we marked up titles of this bill without adequate \nnotice of language is false. Titles of the bill had to be scored by \nCBO. The idea that we would markup our bill without notice of language \nor CBO scores again is false. The markup dates were postponed by me to \nallow more time to read language and to ensure that CBO scores were \ndistributed to all Members as well.\n  As someone who has been around here a number of years, I know when \nthere is a true willingness to have a bipartisan effort and I know when \nthere is one that is not going to happen. Senator Kennedy understood \nthat as well. I have had numerous bipartisan agreements with my \ncolleagues on committees I have served on over the years. It is \ncertainly far better when you can achieve that, I don't deny that at \nall, but I will not accept the notion that there has been a refusal to \naccept or willingness to listen to bipartisan ideas as part of this \nbill.\n  Again, there is a debate that I know is going on on the other side as \nto whether to have amendments or not have amendments, whether Rush \nLimbaugh is controlling the show, or the Republican leader. Those \nthings happen. I understand that. But the fact is, we have a bill here, \nfar from perfect--I will be the first to acknowledge it. It is not a \nbill I would have written on my own. But we serve in a body of 100 \ncoequals who bring to our debate and discussion various backgrounds, \nexperiences, and viewpoints. It is not an easy task.\n  Every Congress going back to the 1940s to one degree or another has \ntried to deal with this issue. Every administration, from Harry Truman \nthrough every Republican and Democratic administration since the 1940s, \nhas, to one degree or another, grappled with this issue of health care. \nTo a large extent, everyone has failed or has not tried because it has \nbeen so monumental an undertaking that it has been daunting. Certainly, \nwe are seeing that as we grapple with it in our hour of watch. Those of \nus who are privileged to be here serving with an administration that \nhas made this a priority have been challenged to do what no other \nCongress and no other administration has been able to achieve over the \npast 70 years. We are close to achieving a major beginning, and it is a \nbeginning. Anyone who suggests otherwise does not understand the \ncomplexity or the largeness of this undertaking--a beginning, to begin \nto change and bring down costs, increase access, and affordability, as \nwell as the quality of something that ought to be a basic right in the \nUnited States of America, and that is health care.\n  I am excited and optimistic about the possibility of achieving that. \nIt is less than what I wished we could have done, but it is far more \nthan has ever been achieved by others.\n  The product we have before us, while it is not one that has been \nendorsed on a bipartisan basis, reflects a lot of good contributions \nmade by all Members. In fact, every single member of the HELP \nCommittee--every single member--offered amendments that were adopted as \npart of our product--every single one. Substantive amendments were \noffered as well. I find it somewhat intriguing, that people claim to \nfeel excluded from the public option idea. I had no idea they were \ninterested in one. It is exciting to know they have some ideas on the \npublic option. The reflection that occurred during our debate was they \nwere totally opposed to any public option in this bill. So we adopted \none as part of the HELP Committee process, under the leadership of \nSherrod Brown and Sheldon Whitehouse and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, \nwho sat together and, working with others outside, came up with an \noption that we thought would appeal on a bipartisan basis. It did not, \nand we are very much involved in that debate as we speak.\n  Anyway, I wanted to respond to these earlier suggestions, and I will \nleave them as suggestions, that somehow this product and process has \nbeen totally written on a partisan basis. It is anything but that, and \nI want the Record to reflect that, hence the decision to include the \nspecific amendments, the pages on which they exist in our product, and \nthe substance of the ideas that were contributed by our Republican \nfriends.\n  Mr. President, I saw my colleague from Montana a moment ago, who may \nbe interested in addressing some of these ideas and thoughts as well \nthat are coming before us. But while I wait for him to come to the \nfloor, let me say that, again, I hear constantly this talk about \nMedicare and the cutting of Medicare. Let me reflect on how false those \nallegations are.\n  Again, what we are trying to do is to reduce the overpayments under \nthe Medicare Advantage Program. That is what has happened here. These \nprivate plans--and that is what they are--operating under Medicare \nAdvantage have two options: They can cut benefits or reduce their \nprofits. We have to bring down these costs when you have an average of \n14 percent overpayments occurring in the country that are being\n\n[[Page S12852]]\n\nborne by 80 percent of Medicare recipients.\n  We talk about the numbers. I have a number: 96,000 people in the \nState of Connecticut who utilize the Medicare Advantage plan. I am not \nopposed to that. I think it is a wonderful option for people. But the \nfact is 470,000 other people in my State, who are Medicare recipients, \nare paying $90 extra in order to subsidize the Medicare Advantage plan \nand they are getting none of the benefits for it. So there is a huge \npercentage--about 80 percent of the elderly in this country--who are \nwriting a check every year to subsidize private health care plans. \nThese plans are profiting at the expense of people who never get a \nbenefit from it.\n  What Senator Baucus and others have suggested is let's reduce these \noverpayments. It is up to the plans to decide what they want to do with \nthat. They can decide to cut the benefits or take less profit. These \nare for-profit plans that are doing this. Maybe they don't want to take \nless profit. That might be a part of the motivation. But traditional \nMedicare, the guaranteed benefits under that--a nonprofit operation--\nare not touched in this bill--not a single guaranteed benefit. For over \na week now I have challenged any Member in this body to identify a \nsingle guaranteed benefit under Medicare that is affected by this bill. \nNot one. Eliminating the overpayments under Medicare Advantage are, \nclearly, because we don't think that 80 percent of the population who \nqualify for Medicare ought to bear the financial burden of financing a \nbenefit they never get.\n  None of us are opposed to Medicare Advantage, but we are opposed to \nthe idea that these for-profit companies can play the game by \nsuggesting they don't want to take less profit, they don't want to \nreduce any benefit, so they want to leave it exactly as it is. You want \nto know why Medicare is in trouble? That is why. If you want to put it \non a solid footing for an additional 5 years, then take the proposal we \nhave in the bill to reduce these overpayments. In the absence of doing \nthat, the very people who are worried about the solvency of Medicare \nare going to be correct, because Medicare will be in financial jeopardy \nfar earlier if we have these amendments adopted that would jeopardize \nthe traditional Medicare Program.\n  Clarity is needed on all of this. The fact something is called \nMedicare Advantage, as I have said repeatedly, doesn't make it Medicare \nand it is certainly not an advantage. It is only an advantage for those \nprivate companies that are benefitting in terms of the profits they \nmake. In fact, studies done by independent analysts say, that these \ncompanies have seen a 75 percent growth in profits as a result of this \nprogram. They are doing very well financially as a result of this. But \nthey shouldn't be doing necessarily that well at the expense of others \nwho are paying an additional $90, on average per couple of retirees, \nelderly people, who are contributing that amount every year without \nreceiving a single benefit under Medicare Advantage.\n  Our simple question is: Why should they be asked to pay that much \nmore? Ninety dollars a year may not sound like that much to a Member of \nCongress, but if you are a retired elderly person, living on a fixed \nincome, that $90 a year can make a huge difference. It may not be much \nto a Member of Congress, many of whom, of course, are very wealthy \nindeed, but it is if you are sitting out there across America writing a \ncheck each year for $90 to go into a program you never get a benefit \nfrom, which serves 20 percent of the senior population.\n  I don't blame the 20 percent at all. I understand how they feel. They \nwish to continue to get those benefits. And they can get them, provided \nthe companies they are getting those benefits from are willing to take \nless in profits. That is what our bill is designed to do--to provide \nthat choice. Obviously, we can't mandate that from them--although we \nwere promised early on they would be able to reduce the cost of \nMedicare. That was the original proposal when Medicare Advantage was \nadopted many years ago--a number of years ago.\n  Again, it is anything but Medicare and it is anything but an \nadvantage, except for the profit-making companies that have done very \nwell off this program. Our bill here merely restrains the overpayments. \nI know that may bother these companies. They would like to make more, \nif they could, and I respect that, from their vantage point. But we \nshould not, as the Senate, sanction and necessarily approve a proposal \nthat allows them to make more money out of the pockets of people on \nfixed incomes to support a fraction of the population at the expense of \nthe overwhelming majority. Where is the equity in that, when 80 percent \nof Medicare recipients are writing a check each year to private \ncompanies, in effect, to pay for benefits they never get?\n  I appreciate the support of organizations across the country--AARP \nand certainly the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare--and we thank them for their very strong letters. These major \norganizations, representing 43 million of our elderly in this country, \nhave taken a very strong position against the assaults on this bill \nregarding the overpayments that are occurring, and we thank them for \nit. That may not be enough for some people to appreciate, but I believe \nif they look and listen to what is going on here, they will understand \nwhat is at stake. If you are part of the 80 percent of seniors out \nthere who are writing those checks every year and getting none of the \nbenefits, those who oppose our bill want to maintain and probably \nexpand on it in the years ahead. So for you out there who are worried \nabout the cost and solvency of Medicare, our bill is a major step in \nthe direction of reducing those overpayments and providing the options \nthat ought to exist to reduce profits or extend benefits.\n  Again, I think it is important to remind our colleagues that under \nthis bill, there is $130 billion in budget reductions in the first 10 \nyears. It is the largest single reduction. We listened to our \ncolleagues from North Dakota and New Hampshire talk about deficit \nreduction. This bill provides $130 billion in deficit reduction in the \nfirst 10 years and $650 billion of deficit reduction in the second \n10 years.\n\n  We are now told by the Congressional Budget Office there are the \nmillions of people today who are paying insurance and watching the \ncosts escalate almost on an hourly basis. Even with zero inflation, we \nare watching private companies raise the cost of premiums--going up \ndramatically. There are 32 million people in the individual insurance \nmarket, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and they would \npay 14 to 20 percent less in premiums for an equivalent plan than under \nthe status quo. That is a huge reduction, potentially, in the years \nahead for 32 million of our fellow citizens in the individual market. \nIf you are in the small-group market--there are 25 million people in \nthat, according to the CBO's analysis--you are eligible for tax credits \nand would pay 8 to 11 percent less in premiums. If you work for a small \nbusiness and don't qualify for a tax credit, you would see a reduction, \npotentially, of 2 to 3 percent in premiums. If you are in the large-\ngroup market--and there are 134 million of our fellow citizens who are \nin that market, according to the Congressional Budget Office--again, \nyou could see a reduction.\n  So in any category, you have a choice here to make--and we do in the \ncoming hours. Do you want to continue the present process? And when \npeople say status quo, it is such a misnomer. The status quo might even \nbe acceptable to people if you could freeze everything. But you can't \nfreeze everything. The status quo allows for a dramatic increase in \npremiums--dramatic increase. If we don't take steps to deal with rising \ncosts, as we do in this bill, you are looking at premiums going from \n$12,000 a year for a family of four in this country to $24,000 to \n$35,000 in the next 7 to 10 years.\n  If this gets defeated--and, obviously, our Republican friends want \nthis bill defeated--the idea that we are going to jump back into this \nis a pipe dream. We will end up with dramatically increasing costs to \nmillions of our fellow citizens, which this bill restrains because of \nthe hard work done by the Finance Committee, particularly, that had to \nwork on these issues. So for those who suggest the status quo is okay, \nit is anything but okay.\n  In terms of cost reduction overall, as well as premium reduction, \nwhich is so important--and I thank my colleague from Indiana, Senator \nBayh, who was\n\n[[Page S12853]]\n\nthe one who insisted CBO give us the analysis of what the impact of \nthis bill would be on premiums--the fact is we see significant \nreductions of premium costs.\n  I see my colleague from Montana is now here, but I would give the \nexample that in Connecticut, premiums in the year 2000 for a family of \nfour were about $6,000. In the year 2009, that family of four in \nConnecticut is now paying around $12,000. So in 9 years, premiums have \njumped from $6,000 to $12,000. And those numbers continue to escalate. \nSo for those who say no to this bill, then--if you succeed in these \nefforts--prepare to answer the question why is it the premiums of those \npeople you claim you are defending around here--if they have \ninsurance--will escalate to the rates we have talked about. That is \nwhat is at stake--nothing less than that.\n  Whether it is so-called Medicare Advantage or cost reduction or \npremium reduction, this bill, with all of its imperfections, is a \nmajor, giant, positive step forward for our country. Again, I thank the \nmembers of the Finance Committee and Members of the HELP Committee, \nboth staffs, and others who have worked to include many of the ideas \nthat our friends on the other side wisely and thoughtfully made a part \nof these efforts.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to underline the huge bipartisan \neffort that this side undertook to put this bill together in many, many \nways. I very much appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nConnecticut on that point.\n  Let's go back. A year ago, I held an all-day health care summit at \nthe Library of Congress for members of the Finance Committee, \nRepublicans and Democrats. They were all there. We spent a whole day. \nIn addition, I talked to all the groups. I called them up and said: \nLook, we are all in this together--we Americans--consumer groups, \nlabor, big business, small business, the pharmaceutical industry, \nhospitals, hospice, all these CEOs. I said: We are all working together \nto get health care reform passed for our country--for all Americans.\n  So we kept that process up to keep it--and I don't like that word \n``bipartisan.'' It is more accurate to say that everybody was working \ntogether. If you don't like something, maybe you will like something \nelse somewhere else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The time of the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Just as I was getting wound up, Mr. President. I will \ncontinue when the majority's half-hour comes around.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nMontana be given 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate very much the 2 minutes from the Senator \nfrom Arizona. This could take a couple more than 2 minutes, but I very \nmuch appreciate the offer. I will just wait.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with the \nSenators from Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Tennessee, both of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are here, obviously, as we are on a \ndaily basis, to discuss the issue of health care reform. But we are in \na rather unusual situation this morning because we don't know what we \nare discussing or debating. We find ourselves in an interesting \nsituation.\n  After almost a year of consideration of health care reform, with a \nmeasure that has been--at least a couple of the outlines of it we know \nbut, frankly, we have had no details except that Medicare is going to \nbe extended, eligibility for Medicare is going to be extended to age \n55.\n  I just would quote: There was a meeting yesterday amongst Senate \nDemocrats. Many Senate Democrats emerged from yesterday's caucus \nmeeting saying they had learned little about the public option \nagreement and there were many outstanding concerns.\n  Senator Mary Landrieu called the agreement ``a very good idea.'' \nSenator Blanche Lincoln said, ``More information is needed.'' And \nSenator Ben Nelson said, ``I just want to know what the costs are.''\n  So do the rest of us. So do the rest of us. Here we have a proposal \nafter nearly a year that is being assessed by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and here we are with no knowledge of what that bill is about, \nwith the exception of some bare essentials that have been leaked.\n  What did this have to do with change? What does this have to do with \nbipartisanship? What does this have to do with anything?\n  Frankly, we have an editorial in the Washington Post this morning \nthat calls it ``Medicare Sausage?''\n  I ask unanimous consent the editorial from the Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                           Medicare Sausage?\n\n\n the emerging buy-in proposal could have costly unintended consequences\n\n       The only thing more unsettling than watching legislative \n     sausage being made is watching it being made on the fly. The \n     11th-hour ``compromise'' on health-care reform and the public \n     option supposedly includes an expansion of Medicare to let \n     people ages 55 to 64 buy into the program. This is an idea \n     dating to at least the Clinton administration, and Senate \n     Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) originally \n     proposed allowing the buy-in as a temporary measure before \n     the new insurance exchanges get underway. However, the last-\n     minute introduction of this idea within the broader context \n     of health reform raises numerous questions--not least of \n     which is whether this proposal is a far more dramatic step \n     toward a single-payer system than lawmakers on either side \n     realize.\n       The details of how the buy-in would work are still sketchy \n     and still being fleshed out, but the basic notion is that \n     uninsured individuals 55 to 64 who would be eligible to \n     participate in the newly created insurance exchanges could \n     choose instead to purchase coverage through Medicare. In \n     theory, this would not add to Medicare costs because the \n     coverage would have to be paid for--either out of pocket or \n     with the subsidies that would be provided to those at lower \n     income levels to purchase insurance on the exchanges. The \n     notion is that, because Medicare pays lower rates to health-\n     care providers than do private insurers, the coverage would \n     tend to cost less than a private plan. The complication is \n     understanding what effect the buy-in option would have on the \n     new insurance exchanges and, more important, on the larger \n     health-care system.\n       Currently, Medicare benefits are less generous in \n     significant ways than the plans to be offered on the \n     exchanges. For instance, there is no cap on out-of-pocket \n     expenses. So would near-seniors who buy in to Medicare get \n     Medicare-level benefits? If so, who would tend to purchase \n     that coverage? Sicker near-seniors might be better off \n     purchasing private insurance on the an exchange. But the \n     educated guessing--and that's a generous description--is that \n     sicker near-seniors might tend to place more trust in a \n     government-run program; they might assume, with good reason, \n     that the government will be more accommodating in approving \n     treatments, and they might flock to Medicare. That would \n     raise premium costs and, correspondingly, the pressure to dip \n     into federal funds for extra help.\n       In addition, the insurance exchanges proposal is being \n     increasingly sliced and diced in ways that could narrow its \n     effectiveness. Remember, the overall concept is to group \n     together enough people to spread the risk and obtain better \n     rates. But so-called ``young invincibles''--the under-30 \n     crowd--would already be allowed to opt out of the regular \n     exchange plans and purchase high-deductible catastrophic \n     coverage. Those with income under 133 percent of the poverty \n     level would be covered by Medicaid. The exchanges risk \n     becoming less effective the more they are Balkanized this \n     way.\n       Presumably, the expanded Medicare program would pay \n     Medicare rates to providers, raising the question of the \n     spillover effects on a health-care system already stressed by \n     a dramatic expansion of Medicaid. Will providers cut costs--\n     or will they shift them to private insurers, driving up \n     premiums? Will they stop taking Medicare patients or go to \n     Congress demanding higher rates? Once 55-year-olds are in, \n     they are not likely to be kicked out, and the pressure will \n     be on to expand the program to make more people eligible. The \n     irony of this late-breaking Medicare proposal is that it \n     could be a bigger step toward a single-payer system than the \n     milquetoast public option plans rejected by Senate moderates \n     as too disruptive of the private market.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. ``The emerging buy-in proposal could have costly \nunintended consequences.''\n  But we don't know what it is. But we know that never before in this \nentire year--I ask my colleagues--have we seen a proposal that would \nchange eligibility for Medicare down to age 55, never before.\n  The majority leader came to the floor this morning and said if we \naccept\n\n[[Page S12854]]\n\nan omnibus, a multitrillion-dollar bill by unanimous consent--by the \nway, the Omnibus appropriations bill is six bills totaling $450 \nbillion, 1,351 pages long, with 4,752 earmarks totaling $3.7 billion. \nAnd, by the way, spending on domestic programs is increased by 14 \npercent except for veterans, which is increased by only 5 percent.\n  The majority leader wants us to go out for the weekend, after keeping \nus in all last weekend. Here we have an unspecified proposal--none of \nus know the details or the cost--so I am supposed to go home to Arizona \nthis weekend and say: My friends, we have been working on health care \nreform for a year. And guess what. I can tell you nothing.\n  We need to stay in, we need to know what the proposals are, we need \nto have votes on it, and we need to tell the American people what is \ngoing on behind closed doors.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Gladly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I recall our good friend, the majority leader, telling \nus on November 30 that we would be here the next two weekends. Then I \nrecall our friend, the majority leader, saying Monday of this week we \nwould be here this weekend.\n  My assumption was we were here to deal with this important issue that \nthe majority has been indicating to everyone is so important, that we \nmust stay here and do it. We are prepared to be here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And vote. In fact, we have been trying to vote for a \ncouple of days now, and it has been difficult to vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If we are not going to have a vote, maybe we ought to \nhave a vote to table the pending amendments, at least to have the \nSenate on record.\n  Could I finally say, I know New Orleans is very nice this time of \nyear, but perhaps we ought to stay here and get this job done?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I think it is important to reflect on the season we \nhave here. A couple of nights ago, the Senator from Arizona gave an \nimpressive speech in front of the Capitol for the lighting of the \nChristmas tree. This is the Christmas season coming up, 2 weeks from \ntomorrow, a very important season. The majority leader said it is very \nimportant for us to stay through Christmas if necessary to debate this \nbill. We said: All right, that is what we will do. We will stay to New \nYear's Day. We will stay to Valentine's Day because this is indeed a \nhistoric bill and we don't want to make a historic mistake because it \naffects our children, our grandchildren, 17 percent of the economy, all \n300 million Americans.\n  None of us have ever seen our constituents more involved in an issue \nthan in this issue. So we are here ready to go to work.\n  I am wondering, as I listen to the Senator from Arizona, not only do \nwe not know what this bill is that we are supposed to enact by 2 weeks \nfrom today, our friends on the other side don't know what it is. They \ncannot tell each other what it is.\n  They came out of--they had sort of a rally yesterday. One of the \nSenators described it as sort of a ``go team, go'' rally, but they did \nnot know what they were going to. All we have heard they are going to--\nand I imagine the Senator from Oklahoma, who is a physician, who has \ndelivered many babies, seen many patients, still continues to do it, \nwould have some comment on this--all we have heard is they may try to \nexpand Medicare.\n  We heard yesterday from the executive director of the Mayo Clinic \nHealth Policy Center, I ask unanimous consent to have his letter \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Medicare Expansion Won't Get Us There\n\n\n Proposal Would Not Increase Access to Health Care Services or Control \n                                 Costs\n\n       The current Medicare payment system is financially \n     unsustainable. Any plan to expand Medicare, which is the \n     government's largest public plan, beyond its current scope \n     does not solve the nation's health care crisis, but compounds \n     it. We need to fix Medicare by moving it to a system that \n     pays for value--quality health outcomes that are affordable \n     over time--and ensure its success, before bringing more \n     people into a broken system.\n       Expanding this system to persons 55 to 64 years old would \n     ultimately hurt patients by accelerating the financial ruin \n     of hospitals and doctors across the country. A majority of \n     Medicare providers currently suffer great financial loss \n     under the program. Mayo Clinic alone lost $840 million last \n     year under Medicare. As a result of these types of losses, a \n     growing number of providers have begun to limit the number of \n     Medicare patients in their practices. Despite these provider \n     losses, Medicare has not curbed overall spending, especially \n     after adjusting for benefits covered and the cost shift from \n     Medicare to private insurance. This is clearly an \n     unsustainable model, and one that would be disastrous for our \n     nation's hospitals, doctors and eventually our patients if \n     expanded to even more beneficiaries.\n       It's also clear that an expansion of the price-controlled \n     Medicare payment system will not control overall Medicare \n     spending or curb costs. The Commonwealth Fund has reported \n     this result for Medicare overall by looking at two time \n     periods--one four-year period where Medicare physician fees \n     increased and one four-year period where Medicare physician \n     fees decreased. Overall cost per beneficiary increased at the \n     same rate during each time period. This scenario follows the \n     typical pattern for price controls--reduced access, \n     compromised quality and increasing costs anyway. We need to \n     address these problems--not perpetuate them--through health \n     reform legislation.\n       We believe insurance coverage can be achieved without \n     creating or expanding a government-run, price-controlled, \n     Medicare-like insurance model.\n       Mayo Clinic supports the proposed insurance exchange model \n     based on the Office of Personnel Management's Federal \n     Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP). This system will \n     improve access to insurance, make reforms to the current \n     insurance system that eliminate pre-existing condition \n     exclusions, and create an individual mandate where \n     individuals can purchase private insurance in various ways: \n     through employers; on the individual market; through co-\n     operatives; or through an exchange model like the FEHBP.\n       We also believe that the government should help people pay \n     for insurance premiums through sliding scale subsidies as \n     needed.\n\n                                            Jeffrey O. Korsmo,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                                 Mayo Clinic Health Policy Center.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will just read one sentence from it:\n\n       Expanding the current Medicaid system to persons 55 to 64 \n     years old would ultimately hurt patients by accelerating the \n     financial ruin of hospitals and doctors across this country.\n\n  I am very puzzled why ideas like this are being cooked up behind \nclosed doors 2 weeks before Christmas, and we do not know what they \nare, they don't know what they are, and the suggestion is we not vote \ntoday and we go home this weekend.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Not only are there questions--not only is there \nopposition from the Mayo Clinic but the American Hospital Association \nand the AMA. They have all come up steadfastly against this.\n  Could I ask my colleague from Oklahoma--and I quote from this \neditorial. Here we are supposedly going out for the weekend and the \neditorial from the Washington Post says:\n\n       Presumably, the expanded Medicare program would pay \n     Medicare rates to providers raising the question of the \n     spillover effects on a health-care system already stressed by \n     a dramatic expansion of Medicaid. Will providers cut costs--\n     or will they shift them to private insurers, driving up \n     premiums? Will they stop taking Medicare patients or go to \n     Congress demanding higher rates? Once 55-year-olds are in, \n     they are not likely to be kicked out and the pressure will be \n     on to expand the program to make more people eligible. The \n     irony of this late-breaking Medicare proposal is that it \n     could be a bigger step toward a single-payer system than the \n     milquetoast public option plans rejected by Senate moderates \n     as too disruptive of the private market.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I will answer my colleague as somebody who has practiced \nmedicine for 25 years: MedPAC, last year, said 29 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries it surveyed were looking for a primary care doctor and \nhad great difficulty in finding somebody to treat them.\n  That is now. In the State of Texas, 58 percent of the State's doctors \ntook new Medicare patients, but only 38 percent of the State's primary \ncare doctors took new Medicare patients.\n  I would make the case to you that if you delay care, that is denied \ncare. It is exacerbated in our older population because an older person \nwith a medical need is much more susceptible to the complications that \ncan come from that initial problem. So if you delay the care, you are \ndenying the care and you are actually increasing the cost.\n  There are 15 million people in this population. I have no idea if \ntheir plans include all of them. But if you add 15\n\n[[Page S12855]]\n\nmillion new people to Medicare, what you are going to have is 50 \npercent of them are not going to find a primary care physician to care \nfor them because the rate of reimbursement does not cover the cost of \ncare.\n  I think the editorial you quote is exactly right.\n  I would also note, if I may, that President Obama loves the Mayo \nClinic, and rightly so. I had a brain tumor removed the summer before \nlast by the Mayo Clinic. I am standing here on the Senate floor because \nof their expertise.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There are many who believe the Senator from Oklahoma \ncould not have a heart attack.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will ignore that comment.\n  The fact is, what Mayo says is we have to figure out how we create \nincentives in terms of how do we get people cared for at a lower cost. \nMedicare is not the way to do it.\n  As a matter of fact, I heard our colleagues talk. We have had eight \nvotes since last Saturday. We are ready to vote. This is a 2,074-page \nbill. I have 15 amendments in the queue. I want to vote on them.\n  They don't want to vote because they don't want the American people \nto hear all the bad things about what is going to happen to their \nhealth care if this bill passes. If we do Medicare, what is going to \nhappen is Medicare costs are going to skyrocket, but access is going to \ngo down.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Apparently, I would ask my colleague from Tennessee, we \ndo not know what we would be voting on because there has been a whole \nrewrite of this health care reform here after a year. We do not even \nknow what the provisions of that bill are except what has been leaked. \nApparently, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, with the \nexception of the majority leader, don't know what it is either.\n  Mr. COBURN. If the Senator will yield, there are some things we could \nvote on. President Obama outlined some very specific things that ought \nto be in this bill. We ought to vote to put them in the bill.\n  What he said he wanted and what this bill presents are two different \nthings. We ought to vote on making sure everybody has access. We ought \nto vote on making sure we are under the same plan as everybody else we \nare going to put into any new expanded health care coverage. We ought \nto vote in making sure everybody is treated fairly in this country. We \nought to vote on your prescription drug reimportation. We ought to \nvote. But what we are doing is we are getting a slowdown.\n  We heard we are obstructing the bill. We are not obstructing the \nbill. Any other bill that comes before this body that had 2,000 pages \nin it we would allot 8 weeks, 10 weeks to debate.\n  As our colleague from Maine knows, there is not a more complicated \nsubject that will affect more people that this body has ever taken up. \nWe are trying to squeeze that into 3\\1/2\\ weeks, and the last 2 weeks \nwe don't know what is in the bill.\n  Time out.\n  Mr. CORKER. I would like to thank the Senator from Arizona for his \ngreat leadership on this issue. I agree with all here. I would like to \ncontinue to discuss this, ``colloquize,'' if you will, and vote. That \nis what we need to do all weekend is talk about this issue and vote.\n  There are numbers of amendments. But the thing that is interesting to \nme, I say to the Senator from Arizona--he has been one of the great \nchampions in this country as it relates to how we live within our \nmeans. He has pointed out waste in government. He has pointed out \noverspending.\n  What has happened during this Christmas season is, for our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle Medicare has become the gift that just \nkeeps on giving.\n  I know the Senator talked about, during his campaign--and all of us \nhave--that we need to get Medicare to a point where it is solvent, \nwhere seniors actually have the ability to use the benefits later on \nthat now are in place. We have all talked about the need to make it \nsolvent.\n  What does the base of this bill do? It takes $464 billion out of \nMedicare to create a whole new entitlement. It doesn't even deal with \nthe doc fix, as we have said many times.\n  The reason, by the way, we do not know what this says is the \nleadership on the other side--this is another one of those yellow post-\nits. They are throwing it up on the wall just to see if it works. They \nare not telling us what the game plan is because they don't yet know \nwhether it works. What they are hoping to do is to solve a major \nproblem they have within their caucus, again, by taking from Medicare.\n  If you think about the fact that the Mayo Clinic, which is the model \nfor all of us, would not even take new Medicare patients, and yet our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are trying to throw a whole new \ndecade of seniors into the plan, what that means is less and less \nseniors are going to have access to care. That is what this means.\n  The other side of the aisle, I will have to say, based on history, I \nam surprised, but they continue, through their policies, to throw \nseniors under the bus.\n  I do not understand what has happened. This must be about a political \nvictory and not about health care reform. What we would do is more \nfirmly put in place, again, bad policy. The problem with Medicare today \nis physicians and providers are paid fees to do more work. So now what \nwe would be doing, instead of health care reform, which is what Senator \nCoburn and all of us have talked about for some time, we are putting in \nplace, in cement, something that works poorly, that the Mayo Clinic \nsaid is damaging to them and their patients, we would be putting it in \nplace for even more people.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership. I hope to be with him all \nweekend discussing amendments that are important and voting on those \namendments. I can't imagine a better place for all of us to be.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. May I ask the Republican leader, \nagain, to be very clear that it is his view and that of all Republican \nMembers that we will stay in for as long as it takes to get this issue \nresolved and we are prepared to vote throughout the entire weekend. If \nthe majority leader moves to the Omnibus appropriations bills, we will \nhave a conference report, and we will certainly have discussion about a \nbill that has 4,752 earmarks totaling $3.7 billion. But we should not \nget off this, should we?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend is entirely correct. I can only quote the \nmajority leader himself who said we were going to be here this weekend. \nWe expect to be here this weekend. If he tries to leave, we will have a \nvote to adjourn, and I am confident every Republican will vote against \nadjourning. This either is or it isn't as important as the majority \nsays it is. If it is that important, we need to be here. More \nimportantly than being here, equally important to being here is to \nvote. We tried to get a vote all day yesterday on a motion by Senator \nCrapo. What we heard from the other side is: We are working on a side-\nby-side. That is kind of parliamentary inside talk for delay. We are \nready to vote. As several of our colleagues have suggested, we keep \nhearing about these new iterations of this bill. It reminds me of the \nend of a football game, trying to throw a ``Hail Mary'' pass, just \nsomehow, some way find a way to pass this bill. I think it important to \nremember what happens to most Hail Marys. They fall to the ground \nincomplete. You get the impression they are far less interested in the \nsubstance of the bill than just passing something.\n  When the President came up here last Sunday, he said: Make history. \nMake history? The American people are not asking us to make history by \npassing this bill. They don't believe it is about the President. They \nbelieve it is about the substance. We are out here prepared to talk \nabout the substance of this measure, offer amendments, and we fully \nintend to do it for as long as it takes. As the Senator has suggested, \nif the majority leader pivots to a conference report, which he is able \nto do under our process, we will spend all the time it takes to deal \nwith the conference report.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I point out, again, as the Senator from Maine, Ms. \nSnowe, pointed out--and it was highlighted in the Wall Street Journal--\nno major reform in the modern history of this Senate has been enacted \nwithout bipartisan support, a reason for us to go back to the drawing \nboard.\n  I know the Senator from Texas has been heavily involved in the issue \nof\n\n[[Page S12856]]\n\nhospitalization and the American Hospital Association's reaction to \nwhat appears to be an expansion of Medicare.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Arizona. I am pleased our \nleader is standing strong to say nothing should take precedence over \nour handling of this bill and making sure it is done right. That is \nwhat the Republicans are trying to do, to make sure this is done right. \nWe talked about the Medicare expansion that is in the purported bill \nthat we have not seen yet but that Democrats appear to be putting \nforward. We have also been spending the week talking about $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in cuts to Medicare. Now we are talking about possibly \nexpanding Medicare at the same time we are cutting $\\1/2\\ trillion out \nof the care Medicare patients would get.\n  I have an amendment. It would stop the $135 billion in cuts in the \nunderlying bill to hospitals, cutting hospital reimbursements for \nMedicare patients. That is my amendment. Now we are talking about \npossibly expanding Medicare. The American Hospital Association put out \nan alarm, an action alert. It says:\n\n       Medicare pays hospitals 91 cents for every dollar of care \n     provided. Medicaid pays just 88 cents for each dollar of care \n     provided.\n\n  Medicaid, which may also be expanded, and the cuts in Medicare, which \nwe are talking about possibly expanding, would go forward. Which means \nwhat? The hospital association knows what. ``What'' is rural hospitals \nthat care for Medicare patients are going to go under. What kind of \nservices can be provided if there is no hospital in the whole county \nthat can provide care to these senior citizens? I ask the Senator from \nArizona, who has been such a leader on this, we are going to cut $135 \nbillion out of Medicare coverage for hospitals. We are going to now \ntalk about expanding the coverage of more Medicare patients, which will \nmean we will cut more from the hospitals than is even envisioned in the \nunderlying bill. Help me understand this, Senator. How would you \nsuggest that passes the commonsense test?\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I say, having stood fifth from the bottom of my class \nat the Naval Academy, I cannot explain it. But perhaps before I turn to \nthe Senator from South Dakota, maybe we could get a response from Dr. \nCoburn to that question.\n  Mr. COBURN. They are going to cut care. We are going to have more \ncomplications and worse outcomes. That is what is going to happen. \nRather than changing the payment formula, which is what we should do, \nby rewarding quality and rewarding outcome, rather than rewarding \nflipping a switch, that is what needs to happen. We are going to take \nthe same antiquated system, we are going to cut $465 billion from it, \nand then we are going to add, as my colleague from Tennessee said, it \nis 34 million people, if they include everybody from 55 to 64 in the \nsame program.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Is the Senator saying that whether you were at the \ntop of your class, such as the Senator from Oklahoma or the Senator \nfrom Tennessee or the Senator from South Dakota, or the bottom of your \nclass, as the Senator from Arizona has admitted he held down the fort, \nregardless of where you are on the quotient of where you stood in your \nclass, you know what the bottom line is.\n  Mr. COBURN. Care is going to be impacted. Here is a survey of 90,000 \nphysicians. That is more than the active practicing physicians of the \nAMA. More than 8 in 10 physicians surveyed think payment reform is best \nto improve the system for all Americans. Only 5 percent of the \nphysicians surveyed rated the current government health care program as \neffective, 5 percent.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask my colleague from Arizona if this is what happens \nwhen you end up with one-party rule, one party trying to go this on \ntheir own. This seems to be a model of dysfunction in how to come up \nwith a solution to one of the major problems facing the American \npeople, dysfunctional by Washington's twisted standards. They seem to \nbe desperately throwing things at the wall, hoping something will \nstick. Surely, there has to be a better suggestion coming from the \nother side than to expand a program that is destined to be bankrupt in \nthe year 2017. It is the equivalent of a ship that is sinking. It is \nsimilar to the Titanic. You will put more people on the deck of a \nsinking ship. Clearly, the overall objective, at least among some, and \nI think some have been very transparent about it--someone quoted \nearlier today the Congressman from New York in the other body who said \nthis is the mother of all public options. He went on to say:\n\n       Never mind the camel's nose. We have his head and neck in \n     the tent on the way to a single-payer system.\n\n  Obviously, there are people here who want to see a single-payer \nsystem, who want to see government-run health care. We don't happen to \nbelieve that is the best solution for America's health care system, but \nthe amazing thing about this proposal is, it takes a program that is \ndestined to be bankrupt in a few short years, cuts $1 trillion out of \nit over 10 years, when fully implemented, and then adds millions of new \npeople into that program. It is hard to come up with any rational \nexplanation for what is going on here, other than that they are left \nwith, in desperation, trying to throw something at the wall, hoping it \nwill stick. Is this typically what happens around here when one party \ntries to go on its own on something that is this consequential to \nAmerica? One-sixth of our economy is represented by health care.\n\n  Essentially, what they are saying is, we want to expand that part of \nthe economy that isn't working today, that is headed for bankruptcy, \nthat underreimburses doctors and hospitals, put more money into that \nfailed system, exacerbate the cost-shift problem by forcing people in \nthe private-payer market to pay higher premiums. It seems like this \ncreates all sorts of problems that make matters even worse.\n  I appreciate my colleague's leadership on this issue of pointing out \nwhat inevitably is going to happen. When you have the Washington Post \neditorial this morning even acknowledging the terrible problems this \ncreates for health care and the way this is being conducted, sausage \nbeing made here in Washington, DC. Even by Washington's twisted \nstandards, this process has become so dysfunctional, I don't know how \nthey can recover.\n  One thing they could do is decide to sit down with Republicans and \nactually figure out some things we could do that would drive health \ncare costs down, rather than making them go up.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from South Dakota. I have to say I \nhave never, in the years I have been here, seen a process such as this. \nIt is incredibly bizarre that after a year, after hundreds of hours in \nthe HELP Committee, after how many hundreds of hours in the Finance \nCommittee, products are here on our desks. Yet there is a meeting \nyesterday of the Democrats. They come out, and they don't know what the \nproposal is either. Apparently, there is only one Senator who knows \nwhat the proposal is and that is the majority leader. Also, then it is \nOK to go home for the weekend. I honestly say to my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, I have never seen anything quite like this, especially \nwhen we are talking about one-sixth of the gross national product. Of \ncourse, already from what they know, the hospitals and doctors and \nothers have come out in strong opposition to expansion of a program, as \nthe Senator points out, that is going broke.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, he made reference \ntoday to the senior Senator from Maine and her very insightful and \nthoughtful and correct speech a couple weeks ago about how an issue of \nthis magnitude was historically dealt with here and how it was not \nbeing dealt with this way. She pointed out, major domestic legislation \nin modern U.S. history was, without exception, done on a largely \nbipartisan basis. That whole process, as the Senator from Maine pointed \nout, has been entirely missing, as we have moved along toward \ndeveloping this 2,074-page monstrosity of a bill, designed to entirely \nrestructure one-sixth of our economy on a totally partisan basis.\n  I don't think that is what the American people had in mind. They want \nus here, as we have all indicated, debating, discussing, and amending \nthis proposal. That is what we would like to do for as long as it \ntakes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if the Republican leader will think \nback\n\n[[Page S12857]]\n\nwhen he first came to the Senate as a young aide in 1969, the year \nbefore I was a young aide in the Senate,\n  I can remember President Johnson, a Democrat, and Everett Dirksen, \nthe Republican leader, dealing with the open housing legislation in \n1968, a very controversial bill. How did they deal with it? The \nDemocratic President had the bill literally written in the office of \nthe Republican leader, with staff members and Senators trooping in and \nout. The country looked to Washington and said: Well, the Republican \nleader and the Democratic President both think it is important. They \nare trying to work it out. In the end, they voted for cloture. In the \nend, they got the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend from Tennessee is entirely correct. Right \nbefore we got here--right before we got here--in 1964 and 1965, the \nDemocrats had overwhelming majorities, as they do now, and the civil \nrights bill of 1964 and the voting rights bill of 1965 passed on an \noverwhelming bipartisan basis.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: On behalf of the over 240,000 surgeons \n     and anesthesiologists we represent and the millions of \n     surgical patients we treat each year, the undersigned 19 \n     organizations strongly support the need for national health \n     care reform and share the Senate's commitment to make \n     affordable quality health care more accessible to all \n     Americans. As you know, we have been working diligently and \n     in good faith with the Senate during the past year and have \n     provided input at various stages in the process of drafting \n     the Senate's health care reform bill. To this end, we have \n     reviewed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of \n     2009.\n       As you may recall, on November 4 our coalition sent you a \n     letter outlining a number of serious concerns that needed to \n     be addressed to ensure that any final health care reform \n     package would be built on a solid foundation in the best \n     interest of our patients. Since those concerns have not been \n     adequately addressed, as detailed below, we must oppose the \n     legislation as currently written.\n       We oppose:\n       Establishment and proposed implementation of an Independent \n     Medicare Advisory Board whose recommendations could become \n     law without congressional action;\n       Mandatory participation in a seriously flawed Physician \n     Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) program with penalties \n     for non-participation;\n       Budget-neutral bonus payments to primary care physicians \n     and rural general surgeons;\n       Creation of a budget-neutral value-based payment modifier \n     which CMS does not have the capability to implement and \n     places the provision on an unrealistic and unachievable \n     timeline;\n       Requirement that physicians pay an application fee to cover \n     a background check for participation in Medicare despite \n     already being obligated to meet considerable requirements of \n     training, licensure, and board certification;\n       Relying solely on the limited recommendations of the United \n     States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in determining \n     a minimum coverage standard for preventive services and \n     associated cost-sharing protections;\n       The so-called ``non-discrimination in health care'' \n     provision that would create patient confusion over greatly \n     differing levels of education, skills and training among \n     health care professionals while inappropriately interjecting \n     civil rights concepts into state scope of practice laws;\n       The absence of a permanent fix to Medicare's broken \n     physician payment system and any meaningful proven medical \n     liability reforms; and\n       The last-minute addition of the excise tax on elective \n     cosmetic medical procedures. This tax discriminates against \n     women and the middle class. Experience at the state level has \n     demonstrated that it is a failed policy which will not result \n     in the projected revenue. Furthermore, this provision is \n     arbitrary, difficult to administer, unfairly puts the \n     physician in the role of tax collector, and raises serious \n     patient confidentiality issues.\n       This bill goes a long way towards realizing the goal of \n     expanding health insurance coverage and takes important steps \n     to improve quality and explore innovative systems for health \n     care delivery. Despite serious concerns, there are several \n     provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     of 2009 that the surgical community supports, strongly \n     believes are in the best interest of the surgical patients, \n     and should be maintained in any final package. Specifically \n     these include: health insurance market reforms, including the \n     elimination of coverage denials based on preexisting medical \n     conditions and guaranteed availability and renewability of \n     health insurance coverage; strengthening patient access to \n     emergency and trauma care by ensuring the survival of trauma \n     centers, developing regionalized systems of care to optimize \n     patient outcomes, and improving emergency care for children; \n     well-designed clinical comparative effectiveness research, \n     conducted through an independent institute and not used for \n     determining medical necessity or making coverage and payment \n     decisions or recommendations; and the exclusion of ultrasound \n     from the increase in the utilization rate for calculating the \n     payment for imaging services.\n       Further, while redistribution of unused residency positions \n     to general surgery is a positive step in addressing the \n     predicted shortage in the surgical workforce, we believe that \n     the Senate should look more broadly at the issue of limits on \n     residency positions for all specialties that work in the \n     surgical setting that are also facing severe workforce \n     problems.\n       Finally, we are pleased that you have accepted our \n     suggestion and removed language which would reduce payments \n     to physicians who are found to have the highest utilization \n     of resources--without regard to the acuity of the patient's \n     physical condition or the complexity of the care being \n     provided. We thank you for making this important change.\n       While we must oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act as currently written, the surgical coalition is \n     committed to the passage of meaningful and comprehensive \n     health care reform that is in the best interest of our \n     patients. We are committed to working with you to make \n     critical changes that are vital to ensuring that this \n     legislation is based on sound policy, and that it will have a \n     long-term positive impact on patient access to safe and \n     effective high-quality surgical care.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive \n           Surgery; American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and\n\n[[Page S12858]]\n\n           Neck Surgery; American Association of Neurological \n           Surgeons; American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons; \n           American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; \n           American College of Osteopathic Surgeons; American \n           College of Surgeons; American Osteopathic Academy of \n           Orthopedics; American Society of Anesthesiologists; \n           American Society of Breast Surgeons.\n         American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery; \n           American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons; American \n           Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery; American \n           Society of Plastic Surgeons; American Urological \n           Association; Congress of Neurological Surgeons; Society \n           for Vascular Surgery; Society of American \n           Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons; Society of \n           Gynecologic Oncologists.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 December 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The undersigned state and national \n     specialty medical societies are writing you on behalf of more \n     than 92,000 physicians in opposition to passage of the \n     ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act'' (H.R. 3590) \n     and to urge you to draft a more targeted bill that will \n     reform the country's flawed system for financing healthcare, \n     while preserving the best healthcare in the world. While \n     continuance of the status quo is not acceptable, the shifting \n     to the federal government of so much control over medical \n     decisions is not justified. We are therefore united in our \n     resolve to achieve health system reform that empowers \n     patients and preserves the practice of medicine--without \n     creating a huge government bureaucracy.\n       H.R. 3590 creates a number of problematic provisions, \n     including:\n       The bill undermines the patient-physician relationship and \n     empowers the federal government with even greater authority. \n     Under the bill, (1) employers would be required to provide \n     health insurance or face financial penalties; (2) health \n     insurance packages with government prescribed benefits will \n     be mandatory; (3) doctors would be forced to participate in \n     the flawed Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) or \n     face penalties for nonparticipation; and (4) physicians would \n     have to comply with extensive new reporting requirements \n     related to quality improvement, case management, care \n     coordination, chronic disease management, and use of health \n     information technology.\n       The bill is unsustainable from a financial standpoint. It \n     significantly expands Medicaid eligibility, shifting \n     healthcare costs to physicians who are paid below the cost of \n     delivering care and to the states that are already operating \n     under severe budget constraints. It also postpones the start \n     of subsidies for the uninsured long after the government \n     levies new user fees and new taxes to cover expanded coverage \n     and benefits. This ``back-loading'' of new spending makes the \n     long-term costs appear deceptively low.\n       The government-run community health insurance option \n     eventually will lead to a single-payer, government run \n     healthcare system. Despite the state opt-out provision, the \n     community health insurance option contains the same \n     liabilities (i.e., government-run healthcare) as the public \n     option that was passed by the House of Representatives. Such \n     a system will ultimately limit patient choice and put the \n     government between the doctor and the patient, interfering \n     with patient care decisions.\n       Largely unchecked by Congress or the courts, the federal \n     government would have unprecedented authority to change the \n     Medicare program through the new Independent Medicare \n     Advisory Board and the new Center for Medicare & Medicaid \n     Innovation. Specifically, these entities could arbitrarily \n     reduce payments to physicians for valuable, life-saving care \n     for elderly patients, reducing treatment options in a \n     dramatic way.\n       The bill is devoid of real medical liability reform \n     measures that reduce costs in proven demonstrable ways. \n     Instead, it contains a ``Sense of the Senate'' encouraging \n     states to develop and test alternatives to the current civil \n     litigation system as a way of addressing the medical \n     liability problem. Given the fact that costs remain a \n     significant concern, Congress should enact reasonable \n     measures to reduce costs. The Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) recently confirmed that enacting a comprehensive set of \n     tort reforms will save the federal government $54 billion \n     over 10 years. These savings could help offset increased \n     health insurance premiums (which, according to the CBO, are \n     expected to increase under the bill) or other costs of the \n     bill.\n       The temporary one-year SGR ``patch'' to replace the 21.2 \n     percent payment cut in 2010 with a 0.5 percent payment \n     increase fails to address the serious underlying problems \n     with the current Medicare physician payment system and \n     compounds the accumulated SGR debt, causing payment cuts of \n     nearly 25 percent in 2011. The CBO has confirmed that a \n     significant reduction in physicians' Medicare payments will \n     reduce beneficiaries' access to services.\n       The excise tax on elective cosmetic medical procedures in \n     the bill will not produce the revenue projected. Experience \n     at the state level has demonstrated that this is a failed \n     policy. In addition, this provision is arbitrary, difficult \n     to administer, unfairly puts the physician in the role of tax \n     collector, and raises serious patient confidentiality issues. \n     Physicians strongly oppose the use of provider taxes or fees \n     of any kind to fund healthcare programs or to finance health \n     system reform.\n       Our concerns about this legislation also extend to what is \n     not in the bill. The right to privately contract is a \n     touchstone of American freedom and liberty. Patients should \n     have the right to choose their doctor and enter into \n     agreements for the fees for those services without penalty. \n     Current Medicare patients are denied that right. By \n     guaranteeing all patients the right to privately contract \n     with their physicians, without penalty, patients will have \n     greater access to physicians and the government will have \n     budget certainty. Nothing in the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act addresses these fundamental tenets, which \n     we believe are essential components of real health system \n     reform.\n       Senator Reid, we are at a critical moment in history. \n     America's physicians deliver the best medical care in the \n     world, yet the systems that have been developed to finance \n     the delivery of that care to patients have failed. With \n     congressional action upon us, we are at a crossroads. One \n     path accepts as ``necessary'' a substantial increase in \n     federal government control over how medical care is delivered \n     and financed. We believe the better path is one that allows \n     patients and physicians to take a more direct role in their \n     healthcare decisions. By encouraging patients to own their \n     health insurance policies and by allowing them to freely \n     exercise their right to privately contract with the \n     physician of their choice, healthcare decisions will be \n     made by patients and physicians and not by the government \n     or other third party payers.\n       We urge you to slow down, take a step back, and change the \n     direction of current reform efforts so we get it right for \n     our patients and our profession. We have a prescription for \n     reform that will work for all Americans, and we are happy to \n     share these solutions with you to improve our nation's \n     healthcare system.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         Medical Association of the State of Alabama, Medical \n           Society of Delaware, Medical Society of the District of \n           Columbia, Florida Medical Association, Medical \n           Association of Georgia, Kansas Medical Society, \n           Louisiana State Medical Society, Missouri State Medical \n           Association, Nebraska Medical Association, Medical \n           Society of New Jersey, South Carolina Medical \n           Association, American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, \n           American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive \n           Surgery, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, \n           American Society of Breast Surgeons, American Society \n           of General Surgeons, Congress of Neurological Surgeons.\n         Past Presidents of the American Medical Association: \n           Daniel H. Johnson, Jr., MD, AMA President 1996-1997; \n           Donald J. Palmisano, MD, JD, FACS, AMA President 2003-\n           2004; William G. Plested, III, MD, FACS, AMA President \n           2006-2007\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for his \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I must say, some of the debate on the \nother side of the aisle is a little surreal. They say they want to move \nahead, and then they refuse to enter into any reasonable time agreement \nto consider a necessary appropriations measure. I find it very \nimpressive--I am very impressed--how the minority can maintain both \nthat they want to move more quickly and not move at all--surreal.\n  I wish to also explain, despite what the claims on the other side \nare, that we have attempted mightily to work together on both sides of \nthe aisle to get health care reform passed. They claim it is all one-\nparty rule. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let me explain \nwhy.\n  When we began this effort over a year ago, we had many hearings. In \nfact, last year I think I had 10 hearings in the Finance Committee on \nhealth care reform to educate ourselves because we knew health care \nreform was going to be a big issue in the year 2009. So, in 2008, we \nhad many Finance Committee hearings on all different aspects of health \ncare. How does our system work? How do parts fit together? How does \nthis all work? We were there to educate ourselves. We did not have a \npolitical ax to grind. We were not trying to make points. We got the \nexperts in and asked: How does it work? How do the different parts of \nour system work together?\n  Then we issued a white paper. It was in November of last year. It was \nbasically a call to action, which is what we called it. It was about an \n80-, 90-page paper. It was a statement of the health care options: \ndelivery system reforms, various ways to get increased health\n\n[[Page S12859]]\n\ncare coverage, various ways to help with insurance market reform--lots \nof different provisions.\n  I might say, casting all modesty to the wind, that white paper, that \ncall to action, back in November of 2008, is probably the basis and \nspringboard from which most of the ideas we have been debating, both in \nthe House and in the Senate and on both sides of the aisle, come from. \nThey basically come from there.\n  I might say, it has all been totally transparent. It is all on the \nInternet. It has all been open for everybody. Republicans and Democrats \nparticipated fully. First was the Library of Congress all-day session, \nboth sides fully--that was over a year ago.\n  Since then, in 2009, this year, we have had a countless number--in \nthe Finance Committee--of what we call roundtables, a countless number \nof walk-throughs, a countless number of hearings on all the various \naspects of health care reform--bipartisan, fully open.\n  Also, I instituted something else here; that is, we got to the point \nwhere we finally got to the markup, and we put the marked up bill on \nthe Internet, again, so everybody sees everything. We also made sure \nall amendments were on the Internet and fully debated by both sides--\ntotally open, totally transparent. I prided myself on doing that.\n  In fact, one very well-known health journalist who works for a very \nmajor paper walked up to me and said: Max, is this a new way of doing \nthings? Maybe you started something, Max, in being so transparent and \nworking so much together. Do you think this is the model for the \nfuture? I said: I don't know. But it impressed him how much we tried to \nwork together and did work together with people on both sides of the \naisle.\n  I cannot think of a more comprehensive, more transparent, more \nbipartisan effort than this.\n  So what happened? Well, the HELP Committee had their version passed. \nSo we in the Finance Committee worked on ours. To move the ball, I \nshifted it to another group--we called it the Gang of 6; three \nRepublicans, three Democrats--to try to get a core provision together \nthat we could take to the full committee.\n  We had a countless number of meetings. I have forgotten the number of \ndays we met--I think in the nature of 30 or 40 meetings and close to \n100 hours and with Republicans and Democrats to and fro. Guess what. It \nwas very, very constructive. I wish the American public could have been \nan eye on the wall at those meetings and watched these meetings \nproceed. There were very good questions asked by Senators on both \nsides, Republicans and Democrats.\n  I highly compliment my friend from Wyoming, Senator Enzi. I highly \ncompliment my friend from Maine, Senator Snowe. I highly compliment \neverybody who was there. They asked very good questions--and Senator \nGrassley, of course, he is the ranking member of the Finance Committee; \nand the same on the Democratic side--in an effort to try to find a \ngood, solid health care reform bill.\n  Well, we kept working--bipartisan--working together for days, days, \nhours, hours. Then, unfortunately, we got to the point where--I am just \ncalling it as I see it; one of my failings is I am too honest about \nthings--and the Republicans started to walk away. They pulled away from \nthe table. They had to leave.\n  I ask you, why? Why did that happen? The answer--to be totally fair \nand above board--is because their leadership asked them to. Their \nleadership asked them to become disengaged from the process. I know \nthat to be a fact. Why did their leadership ask Republicans to leave \nand become disengaged from the process? To be totally candid, it is \nbecause they wanted to score political points by just attacking this \nbill. They were not here to help be constructive, to find some \nbipartisan solution. They were for a while. Then, when the rubber \nstarted to meet the road, when it came time to try to make some \ndecisions, they left and began to attack.\n  I think a big, unfortunate circumstance in all this--we are going to \npass health care reform. It is going to pass. It is going to do wonders \nfor the American people. We are going to dramatically reform the health \ninsurance market. People are going to have health insurance they do not \nnow have. We are going to help put in place delivery system reforms. \nThat is just a fancy term for saying changing the way we reimburse \nhospitals and doctors in a very positive way, so we are focusing more \non quality and less on quantity and volume. This bill is going to pass. \nIt is going to be a very good bill when it finally does pass and people \nunderstand it.\n  But the unfortunate part is this: It is unfortunate, in my judgment, \nthat the other side pursued a strategy of just saying no, just saying \nno, and attack, attack, attack. That is basically what we have heard \nhere in the last several weeks, instead of coming up with a \ncomprehensive alternative, instead of coming up with a comprehensive \nalternative health care reform package. Then it would have been \nwonderful if we had an honest-to-goodness, solid debate on the pros and \ncons of each side, the merits of each side, a constructive dialog, \npursuit, inquiry, focus on which portions of this should be put in the \nbill and which should not. But that did not happen. We did not have \nthis constructive alternative provision presented to us. We had no \nprovision presented to us--and by ``to us,'' I mean the American \npublic--so we could debate here. But, rather, they just said no.\n  We have worked as hard as we could to be bipartisan. But to be honest \nand candid about it, the other side walked away. They walked away, and \nI think it is very unfortunate that happened.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kirk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, before I say anything else, I wish to, once \nagain, commend the Senator from Montana for his leadership on this \nhistoric piece of legislation. It is going to have an impact on people \nmore widely and broadly than our Social Security system, and this will \nbe as important a domestic piece of legislation as that. Every American \nwho looks forward to their golden years knows what Social Security \nmeans.\n  The Senator from Montana has quite correctly mentioned how this \nlegislation will have an impact on people's lives. I have only been in \nthe Senate a short period of time, but I cannot tell you the numbers of \nconstituents who have communicated with me about their situation in the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts; whereas, in 2006, Massachusetts enacted \nhealth care reform, many of the aspects of that legislation are \ncontained in the bill we are debating.\n  For the record, today the Boston Globe published a story indicating \nthat more than 96 percent of the State's adult taxpayers had health \ninsurance in 2008. This is close to universal coverage, and I am sure, \nbefore too long, we will be able to say we hit the 100-percent mark.\n  This is providing affordable insurance to people who otherwise would \nnever have had it. When the Senator from Montana talked about how this \nbill would impact people's lives, I am going to tell you a story that \nwas told to me by a family who had a situation. I will call them Daniel \nand Brenda. Those are their names.\n  They had been living without health insurance for years. In fact, \nBrenda said she could barely remember when they had last gone to the \ndoctor because they did not have health insurance. But she learned \nabout our Health Care for All on the Helpline that is in existence in \nMassachusetts from a close friend. Soon after she contacted it, her \nhusband was diagnosed with a serious heart condition. With the \nindispensable assistance of the Helpline, her family was able to enroll \nin coverage they could afford.\n  Brenda's husband Daniel had started to feel constant fatigue. He \nnever imagined that someday he would need to have a strong supporting \ndevice inserted in his heart. Brenda said they truly appreciated all \nthe assistance given to them through the Helpline. But there is more.\n  Brenda and Daniel recently welcomed a new addition to their family. \nUnfortunately, their son was born with respiratory problems and had to \nstay in the intensive care unit for 7 days immediately after his birth. \nBrenda told\n\n[[Page S12860]]\n\nus she had a hard time leaving the hospital without her newborn son in \nher arms. But she could also take comfort in being surrounded by top \nmedical professionals who were dedicated to caring for her son. Here is \nwhat she wrote:\n\n       Health Care for All has been such a gift to our lives. \n     First, my husband had no idea of the seriousness of his \n     health issue. If it wasn't for our eligibility with the \n     [State's new health care reform] programs, we would probably \n     have found out about his heart disease too late. And right \n     after came the unexpected surprise of having my son in \n     neonatal care for a week. Both of these situations were hard \n     to go through just emotionally. We just couldn't imagine how \n     it could have been hard financially speaking. That's why, and \n     for many other reasons, we are just so amazed to be \n     Massachusetts residents and count on the tremendous support \n     we have been receiving from the Helpline counselors.\n\n  This is just one example of countless families I have heard from in \nMassachusetts.\n  It clearly shows how important it is to pass national health care \nreform and enable all Americans to have the quality, affordable health \ncare that Brenda, Daniel, and their son were able to have.\n  So I wanted to bring to the attention of our colleagues in the Senate \na real life story of what health care reform can mean and what will be \ngreat relief for the financial and health security to American families \nwhen we enact this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Boston Globe article I mentioned be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Dec. 10, 2009]\n\n      Fewer Taxpayers Are Penalized for Not Having Health Coverage\n\n                         (By Elizabeth Cooney)\n\n       Fewer Massachusetts taxpayers were penalized for lacking \n     required health insurance last year than were fined in 2007, \n     the state said yesterday in a report reflecting the second \n     year that residents had to report on their tax returns \n     whether they were covered under the state's near-universal-\n     coverage mandate.\n       More than 96 percent, or 3.8 million, of the state's 3.95 \n     million adult taxpayers said they had health insurance for at \n     least part of 2008, according to the state Department of \n     Revenue, and 3.65 million had coverage for the entire year.\n       About 45,000 tax filers did not have health insurance, \n     although they were classified as able to afford it under \n     state guidelines. They paid a penalty of up to $76 for each \n     month they went without coverage, depending on a sliding \n     scale matched to their income. Another 8,000 successfully \n     appealed their penalties, based on hardship, to the \n     Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority.\n       In 2007, when 95 percent of tax filers said they were \n     insured, more people were fined: 60,000 people lost their \n     personal exemption, about $219 for an individual, for not \n     having health insurance that year.\n       ``This report gives us yet another data point demonstrating \n     the continued success of health reform with exceptionally \n     high rates of insurance and a smooth system for the mandate \n     in the Commonwealth,'' Lindsey Tucker, health reform policy \n     manager at the advocacy group Health Care For All, said in an \n     e-mailed statement.\n       ``The report also reminds us of one of the major gaps in \n     our reform: the thousands of residents unable to purchase \n     insurance due to its lack of affordability,'' she said. ``We \n     must continue to search for ways to keep quality coverage \n     affordable for all our residents.''\n       The penalty, which is pegged to one half the cost of the \n     lowest premium offered by the Commonwealth Connector, went up \n     to a maximum of $89 a month for 2009, and the Revenue \n     Department has proposed raising it to $93 in 2010.\n       People who are deemed unable to afford insurance are not \n     penalized, and those who have a lapse of up to three months \n     in their coverage are also not subject to the penalty.\n       The high percentage of tax filers reporting they have \n     insurance fits with other state reports saying that 97 \n     percent of all residents have coverage, Navjeet K. Bal, \n     commissioner of the Department of Revenue, said in an \n     interview.\n       ``From 2007 to 2008, we did not see a real drop in health \n     insurance,'' she said. ``Even with the economic turmoil that \n     started in [fall] 2008, people still had health insurance. A \n     year from now, we'll see.''\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak on two \nsubjects as part of our health care debate. The first is what happens \nto our children. We have had an opportunity over the last couple of \nweeks, and will continue to have a full debate about so many aspects of \nthis legislation. When it comes to the question of what happens to our \nchildren--and I speak of in this case poor children and special needs \nchildren--I have said from the beginning of this debate and even before \nthe debate began many months ago that the standard ought to be four \nwords: No child worse off. It is a very simple standard. I think it is \na standard we can meet and I believe it is a standard we should meet \nfor the most vulnerable children in America--those who happen to be \npoor or suffer from or are burdened by special needs, both the impact \non that child, that individual life, as well as the impact on his or \nher family.\n  The good news is that over the last couple of years, we have gotten \nit right with regard to children's health insurance, a program I am \nproud to say had a good bit of its foundation and its origins in \nPennsylvania. It became a national effort in 1997 when President \nClinton signed the legislation. We have had, frankly, a lot of \nbipartisan support for this program over many years, although we had \nless bipartisan support when it was reauthorized this past year when \nPresident Obama signed it into law.\n  Here is what it means. The Children's Health Insurance Program, known \nby the acronym CHIP, has provided millions of children with health \ninsurance coverage they would never have absent that program. We don't \nknow the exact number as we speak today, but we are at a point now \nwhere we have in the range of 7 million or more children covered. Over \nthe next couple of years, we will have 14 million American children \ncovered. That is an enormous achievement, but more important than any \nkind of legislative achievement, it will mean that 14 million children \nor their families won't have to worry about whether they get quality \nhealth care.\n  In the first year of a child's life, the experts tell us they should \nget to the doctor at least six times for a so-called well child visit. \nA Children's Health Insurance Program in America ensures these children \nreceive many benefits, including dental, immunization, and preventive \ncare. But the fact I always point to is that for six times in the first \nyear of a child's life, he or she will get to see a doctor because they \nare in the CHIP program, and that has an enormous impact for that one \nlife, for that one family, but I would argue--and I think the evidence \nis irrefutable--it will have a positive impact on all of our lives, \nbecause of the impact of millions of children getting that kind of help \nin the early years of their life.\n  We know this program works. The Children's Health Insurance Program \nworks. That is an understatement. It works well.\n  What we are worried about, though--what I am worried about--is that \nthere have been people in Washington who have advocated putting the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program in the new insurance exchange. The \nexchange is going to be a very positive development for our health care \nsystem and for adults, but I would argue strongly and vigorously that \nit is not good for kids. So we are going to be debating that maybe in a \ncouple of years, but we want to make sure as we debate that question \nthat we have as much evidence to show that and put forth the reasons \nwhy the Children's Health Insurance Program should not--should not--be \npart of the exchange.\n  In terms of why we say that, the research on this question is \nindisputable. The director of CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, \nDoug Elmendorf--and we know a lot about CBO. They make determinations \nabout this bill and about costs. CBO has said that children will have \nbetter benefits and more cost savings in CHIP than they will in the \nexchange.\n  Yesterday, an organization many people here know as First Focus \nreleased a white paper which compared Children's Health Insurance \ncoverage versus coverage those children would get in the exchange. Here \nare some of the results of that research paper.\n  No. 1, the question of children's coverage from 2009 through 2013:\n\n       If health reform were to repeal CHIP in 2013, States would \n     not invest in improving coverage for those children when \n     those very efforts will be dismantled just a few years later.\n\n  It stands to reason. Why would a State go forward to strengthen a \nprogram they know is going to change as\n\n[[Page S12861]]\n\na matter of Federal policy a couple of years later?\n\n       The increased coverage of 4 million children that is \n     expected from passing Children's Health Insurance legislation \n     earlier this year would be largely lost.\n\n  That whole effort that took years--years--and two Presidential \nvetoes, before President Obama became President, to get to continue the \nCHIP program and expand.\n  No. 2, First Focus, another one of their conclusions:\n\n       Children in most State Children's Health Insurance Plans \n     receive coverage for all approved vaccinations, dental care \n     and well-baby and well-child visits. This level of benefits \n     stand in contrast to private plans, like those in the \n     exchanges.\n\n  What is good for an adult may not be good for a child. Children are \nnot small adults as so many advocates have said over and over. But the \nlevel of benefits that children get in CHIP stands in contrast to the \nprovisions in private plans such as those in the exchange which often \nimpose limits that are particularly harmful to low-income children and \nchildren with special needs.\n  That is conclusion No. 2 by First Focus.\n  Conclusion No. 3 is the following:\n\n       An actuarial study--\n\n  A recent study--\n\n     finds that children moved from CHIP to the exchange plans \n     would dramatically increase out-of-pocket costs for those \n     kids. Out-of-pocket costs for a child living in a family \n     earning 225 percent of the Federal poverty level would \n     increase by 1,100 percent--\n\n  not 1,100 dollars, but 1,100 percent--\n\n     if the Senate were to join the House in repealing Children's \n     Health Insurance Program.\n\n  This is another reason why it is a bad idea. We want to make sure \nthis program is strong. We know it works. We also don't want to \nexponentially, radically increase out-of-pocket costs.\n  Conclusion No. 4, premiums:\n\n       Because Children's Health Insurance keeps premiums and \n     other out-of-pocket costs for children at low levels, the \n     cost of health insurance exchange plans will be many times \n     higher than that, even for just covering children.\n\n  An increase in premiums will lead to a number of children currently \nenrolled in CHIP to lose coverage--to lose coverage--according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  No. 5, reason to do the right thing, access to pediatric providers:\n\n       Children's Health Insurance plans specifically focus on the \n     unique health care needs of children, which is not the case \n     in the proposed exchanges. The recent Children's Health \n     Insurance reauthorization--\n\n  For those who watch these Senate debates, we use words such as \n``reauthorization.'' My simple way of saying that is we do it again. We \ntake an existing program, evaluate it, see if it is working, and keep \ndoing it. That is what reauthorization is all about. But we did that \nearlier in the year, thank goodness, for children's health insurance.\n  The recent effort to continue CHIP included improvements to \npediatric-specific quality measures that may get lost in the conversion \nof CHIP as a stand-alone program put into the exchange. We don't want \nto do that for kids. We want to make sure every pediatric-specific \nquality measure that we have in place now, all of these years later, is \nmaintained. We don't want to injure that. We don't want to cut that \nback.\n  Finally, in terms of another item on the list of reasons, guarantee \nto care:\n\n       In exchange plans, some children currently eligible for the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program may be barred--may be \n     barred--from receiving subsidies for coverage due to the cost \n     of employer-sponsored plans.\n\n  Once again, what is good for an adult may not be good for our kids. \nWe have to watch this.\n\n       Moreover, the families that are eligible for subsidies and \n     coverage through exchange plans may find coverage so \n     unaffordable that they are left without insurance entirely.\n\n  So we don't want to send a family into the exchange who is trying to \nget insurance for themselves and their kids and find out that they \ncan't cover their kids because it costs too much. We have an existing, \nstand-alone Children's Health Insurance Program that we know works.\n  This amendment I filed for this debate on health care--the children's \nhealth insurance amendment to guarantee that we keep it strong, \nstrengthen it and continue it--the Children's Health Insurance Program \nhas the support of over 500 national and State organizations that focus \non children's health, health policy generally, social workers, \nchildren's mental health advocates, school educators, health plans in \nparticular, faith groups across the country, and more. These 500 \nnational and State organizations speak volumes about why this amendment \nis so important. We must strengthen and ensure the continuity of CHIP \nin this health care reform bill. That is what our amendment is all \nabout.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to hae printed in the Record a \nletter addressed to me, dated December 9, from more than 500 \norganizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 December 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Robert P. Casey, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Casey: As organizations committed to ensuring \n     that all of our nation's children get the health coverage \n     they need and deserve, we are writing to thank you for your \n     commitment to making children an important priority by filing \n     Amendment #2790 to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act (H.R. 3590). Your amendment builds on the provisions of \n     the underlying bill, continuing to protect and improve the \n     country's successful Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (CHIP) and ensuring that no child ends up worse off as a \n     result of health reform. We applaud your leadership.\n       America's children have a lot at stake in health reform. \n     More than eight million children remain uninsured, and more \n     are losing employer-sponsored coverage daily. Families are \n     just one playground accident away from medical bankruptcy. \n     Each day a child is uninsured is a lost opportunity to \n     strengthen our next generation, America's future. Your \n     amendment goes a long way toward protecting and improving \n     coverage for millions of children in low-income working \n     families across the nation by:\n       Providing full funding for CHIP through 2019;\n       Maintaining current CHIP eligibility through 2013, and \n     setting a floor for income eligibility for children in all \n     states at 250 percent of poverty ($55,125 for a family of \n     four) beginning in 2014;\n       Streamlining enrollment procedures making it easier for \n     children to get coverage and keep it;\n       Ensuring that coverage for children remains affordable;\n       Guaranteeing all children in CHIP the comprehensive care \n     they need from head to toe; and\n       Requiring an HHS report in 2016 that will compare coverage \n     for children in CHIP with coverage for children in the new \n     Health Insurance Exchange and if coverage (including \n     benefits, cost-sharing, premiums, and other features) is \n     comparable or better, children can be transitioned from CHIP \n     into the Exchange in 2019.\n       Our nation has made great strides over the last decade in \n     securing health coverage for low-income children of working \n     families. We must now seize this historic opportunity to \n     build on the success of prior efforts and the bipartisan CHIP \n     program, and ensure that children will be better off, not \n     worse off, as a result of health reform. Your amendment will \n     do just that.\n       We offer our strong support for your CHIP Amendment \n     (#2790). We stand ready to work with you and your Senate \n     colleagues to achieve our common goal of reforming our \n     nation's health care system and ensuring that all children, \n     indeed everyone in America, have access to the health \n     coverage they need and deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           National Organizations.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you very much. I wish to inquire as to how much time \nI have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CASEY. I will move quickly.\n  The second part of my remarks focuses on pregnant and parenting teens \nand women. We have an amendment that focuses on a group of pregnant \nwomen in America that we are not doing enough about. Neither party, in \nmy judgment, is doing enough about them, enough about help for those \nwomen. I will come back to this maybe later today. But it is vitally \nimportant, whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or Independents, but \nas Americans, that we give integrity and meaning to the sentiment that \nis often expressed that we care about pregnant women, that we care \nabout a teen mother who decides to bear a child, that we are going to \nhelp her through if she makes that decision.\n  If a woman on a college campus becomes pregnant and decides to have \nthat child, we want to give her all the help we can. If a woman is a \nvictim of domestic violence or other sexual violence or stalking, and \nthrough all of the horrific nightmare of that violence,\n\n[[Page S12862]]\n\nshe determines that she is going to go through with a pregnancy and \nhave a child, that we help her in the midst of that darkness, that we \ngive her some light in that darkness. What we don't want to have is \nwomen who are deciding to bear a child who feel all alone, who have to \nwalk that path all by themselves.\n  That is what this amendment is about. I will return to it later \ntoday.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be \nable to go into a colloquy for the next half hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the taxes \nthat are in this bill--taxes that are imposed in 3 weeks--not 3 weeks \nfrom 6 months from now, not 3 weeks from 2014, but 3 weeks from now, \nJanuary 1, 2010. Three weeks from now, on January 1, 2010, we are going \nto see the taxes in this bill start.\n  I know people are saying: Wait a minute. This bill doesn't take \neffect until 2014. That is what we have been talking about. It is what \nwe have been hearing. But, no, the tax part starts in 3 weeks--January \nof 2010.\n  I have partnered with Senator Thune, who has been working on this \nproblem, and Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch and many others who \nwill be speaking today.\n  I see my colleagues from Florida, Nebraska, Wyoming, as well as my \ncolleague, Senator Crapo, from Idaho, all of whom--Senator Crapo, of \ncourse, is waiting for a vote on his amendment, which would stop the \ntaxes on everyone who makes $200,000 or less.\n  We are talking about the taxes because it is such a huge issue. Here \nis what is going to happen with the taxes in the bill that start in 3 \nweeks. Americans will pay more in insurance premiums. Americans will \npay more in prescription drugs. Americans will pay more for medical \nequipment. Let's walk through those taxes.\n  In a few weeks, in January of 2010, this will begin: $22 billion in \ntaxes on prescription drug manufacturers; $19 billion in taxes on \nmedical device manufacturers; $60 billion in taxes on insurance \ncompanies. That is around $100 billion, which starts in 3 weeks. Then, \nin 2013, the taxes on high-benefit plans take effect. That is $150 \nbillion in taxes. So for every union member who has a good plan that \ngives them the benefits they have negotiated for over the years, those \ntaxes come in at 40 percent of the benefits. That starts in 2013.\n  You are still saying: Wait a minute. I thought the bill started in \n2014--and that is right. But the taxes start in 3 weeks, and they keep \nright on going. In 2013, the high-benefit plans start getting a 40-\npercent excise tax.\n  Mr. President, when the $100 billion in taxes start in 3 weeks on \ndrug manufacturers, medical device manufacturers, and insurance \ncompanies, what happens? Premiums go up immediately, prescription drug \nprices go up immediately, and the medical devices--hearing aids and \nthings people need for medical treatments--go up immediately.\n  We have been talking about health care reform and the need for it, \nand the need to make history. Yet the reform we are going to see go \ninto effect right away is huge tax increases. I am here with many \ncolleagues, who are so concerned about this for their constituents.\n  I ask the Senator from Wyoming, who is one of the two physicians in \nthe Senate--he has been so active in this area. When the taxes go up on \nour insurance premiums, our prescription drugs, and our medical \nequipment, I ask the Senator from Wyoming, as a physician, what does he \nthink is going to happen to the cost of health care.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I have great concern about the cost of \nhealth care for American families. We see it with our seniors \ncertainly, as they will be seeing Medicare cuts. In this bill, there is \n$464 billion in Medicare cuts, but there are taxes that are going to go \nup, which will impact all of the people in this country.\n  I remember a promise the President made. He said his plan would not \nraise taxes one penny. He went on to say: not your income taxes, \npayroll taxes, capital gains taxes--any of your taxes.\n  We are seeing that taxes are going up, and in a way that is \nbasically--you hate to say it, but it is a gimmick in this bill, where \nthey are going to collect taxes for 10 years but only give benefits for \n6, and it is the last 6 years.\n  As my colleague from Texas said, they are going to start collecting \ntaxes--today is December 10--on the 31st of this month, 21 days from \nnow, but the services would not be given for 4 years. That is how they \nget the number under $1 trillion, and it is at a time when the \nPresident makes a statement that this would not add a penny or a dime \nto the deficit. Eighty percent of the American people don't believe it \nbecause they know what is in front of them. They know what it is like \nto live their own lives. Is this what the Senator from Texas is seeing \nas well?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The President said, in his address to the joint \nsession of Congress, that this bill had to come in at a cost of no more \nthan $900 billion. So the CBO scored the bill at $847 billion. But the \nSenator from Wyoming has brought up a point that is because they \nstarted scoring the bill in 2010, but the services in the bill don't \nstart until 2014.\n  If you take the years from 2010 to 2019, it probably comes in at $847 \nbillion. But if you start when the spending starts and go to 2023, the \ncost is $2.5 trillion.\n  I just ask the Senator from Nebraska if his constituents are hearing \nof this $2.5 trillion cost, with one-quarter of it coming from Medicare \ncuts and about one-quarter of it in new taxes that start next week. \nWhat does the Senator from Nebraska say about this?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, the citizens from Nebraska are absolutely \non to this gimmick. They know it is a gimmick. Here is what I tell the \nSenator from Texas: I had an opportunity, as she knows, to be their \nGovernor for 6 years. Every year, I had to walk in front of the \nunicameral--our one-house system--and give a state of the State address \nand lay out a budget plan. If I had walked into that chamber with a \nbudget plan with these kinds of gimmicks, they would have been rolling \nin the aisles laughing at me, literally. They would have been rolling \nin the aisles.\n  I always did a State fly-around, where I visited the communities and \ntalked about my budget vision and my legislative package, et cetera. \nThe people of Nebraska would have run me out of the State had I tried \nto balance the State budget based upon this kind of gimmicky approach.\n  The Senator has absolutely hit the nail on the head. What we have \nhere is a situation where those who wrote this bill--as we all know, it \nwas written behind closed doors and nobody knew what the bill was until \na few weeks ago--but those who wrote the bill said: Oh my goodness, the \nPresident has said we have to bring this bill in under $900 billion. \nThat is what he said. How are we going to get that accomplished? So \nthey used gimmicks. They uploaded the bill, front-end loaded the bill \non the revenues, so that starts right away. Then the benefits don't \nstart for 3 or 4 years. So it is magic; we have made the bill come in \nunder $900 billion.\n  Let me offer this thought: Who loses on this crazy accounting \ngimmick? Do you know who loses? The constituents we represent in the \nUnited States--not just in Nebraska. They are going to pay the taxes. \nThey are not going to see the benefits. It is like buying a car and \npaying on it for 4 years but not getting the car for 4 years. They are \ngoing to pay on it.\n  Sadly, and most concerning to me, is that this gimmickry is going to \nbe passed on to the next generation because, when it doesn't work, \nsomebody has to pick up the bill. The full cost of this bill, we have \ncome to recognize, is $2.5 trillion. This bill doesn't fit together. It \ndoesn't pass the smell test, as we say back home in Nebraska.\n  My hope is that sanity will revisit what we are doing and people will \nsay: Time out. We can't ask the American people to go along with this. \nWe have to call a timeout and get this right.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. I think having \nbeen a former Governor, his view is especially important. What we have \nheard through the grapevine--we haven't seen any new proposals, but we \nheard there is going to be an expansion of Medicare and an expansion of \nMedicaid. Medicaid, in particular, is going\n\n[[Page S12863]]\n\nto be very costly to States because they have a matching requirement \nfor Medicaid. Many Governors are concerned about that.\n  I know the former Governor of Nebraska, in his background, realizes \nthat is one of the biggest issues in a State's budget.\n  I know the Senator from Florida also has experience with being in a \nGovernor's office, being a chief of staff for a Governor. He has been \nvery active, especially because the population of Florida has a very \nhigh rate of senior citizens. The cuts in Medicare in the bill are \nhuge. He is on the Senate floor. I am just wondering, when we are \nlooking at the cuts in Medicare and the huge taxes, how that will \nimpact the State of Florida, and how he thinks we are going to have to \ndeal with that.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. This is \nbudget gimmickry. As the Senator from Texas said, as a former chief of \nstaff who worked on trying to balance the budget because our \nconstitution in Florida requires that, we try to figure out how much \nrevenue we have and how much we can spend. If there were not enough \nrevenues, we either had to cut spending or find a new source of \nrevenues. We could not engage in this budget gimmickry.\n  If I may borrow an analogy from my friend from Nebraska, this is like \npaying for a car for 4 years before you even get to drive it. Imagine \nyou are going to make a substantial purchase--a house or car--and they \nshow you the house, and they say here is your mortgage payment, and you \nwill live in the house for 10 years, but you will start paying for it \ntoday. But you can't move in until 2014. That is what this bill does.\n  In order to make this ``budget neutral,'' we steal $\\1/2\\ trillion \nfrom Medicare--health care for seniors, which seniors have paid into--\nand we raise taxes, which is going to increase, not decrease, the cost \nof insurance. When we tax pharmaceutical companies and tax the \nproviders of medical devices, what happens? They pass those costs right \nalong to the citizens. Not only are we stealing from Medicare, not only \nare we raising taxes, which will be passed on to the citizens, now we \nare going to tell the States we are going to increase Medicaid.\n  We are hearing about this secret deal that has been put together \nbehind closed doors. My friends are in the dark, and a lot of Democrats \ndon't know what is going on either. They are trying to figure out what \nthe deal is. The deal will put more of a burden on the States.\n  I know my friend from Nebraska knows this, being a former Governor. \nThe American people need to know, when you increase Medicaid, the \nStates pay the vast majority of that; and because they have to balance \ntheir budget, they will have to cut something else. So they are going \nto have to cut teachers or law enforcement. So we steal from seniors, \nsteal from the States, raise taxes, and we don't cut the cost of health \ncare for most Americans.\n  I am new to this Chamber, and perhaps my friend from Idaho can help \nme understand this. It doesn't make a lot of sense as to how we should \nproceed with health care reform.\n  Mr. CRAPO. No, it does not. I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom Florida, all my colleagues on the Senate floor today.\n  As the Senator from Texas indicated, one of the items of business \nbefore us today is my motion to commit this bill to the Finance \nCommittee to take out the taxes that the President pledged would not be \nin there. The President pledged that no one who makes less than \n$250,000 as a family or $200,000 as an individual will pay any taxes \nunder this bill. Yet in the very first 10 years, there is almost $500 \nbillion of those taxes, a huge portion of which falls on people who are \nin that category.\n  As has been indicated, the real implementation of the bill on the \nspending side does not happen until 2014. If you count the amount of \ntaxes that start when the spending starts, it is about $1.2 trillion of \nnew taxes. Really, the only thing that is transparent--because this was \nall crafted behind closed doors--the only thing that is transparent is \nthe gimmick.\n  The President said, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, that he \nwould not let a bill come across his desk and get a signature if it \nspent more than $900 billion. First of all, you have to say: Wow, why \ndo we need almost $1 trillion of new spending? But when they went \nbehind closed doors and came up with this bill, it turns out it cost \naround $2 trillion or $2.5 trillion.\n  How did they make it meet the $900 billion test? They just said: \nLook, let's delay its implementation for long enough that the number \ncomes out to under $900 billion. That happened to be the year 2014. So \nif you don't count the first 4 years and only count 6 of the 10, then \nin this budget window we are working in you can get your number. It is \njust remarkable.\n  Before I ask the Senator from South Dakota about his perspective, \nbecause I know he is working with the Senator from Texas on an \namendment to try to correct this gimmick, I would like to respond to \none quick point I know our opposition on the other side has continued \nto make, and that is they actually say there are no tax increases in \nthe bill.\n  How do they say that? Here is the way they say it. There are \nsubsidies in the bill that are provided to people with low income who \ndo not have adequate access to insurance. Those subsidies total about \n$400 billion in the bill in the first 10 years, which is really only 6. \nThey count those subsidies as a tax cut. The technical term given to \nthem is a ``refundable tax credit,'' although $300 billion of those \nsubsidies do not go to taxpayers. The people who receive them do not \nhave a tax liability. But then they offset those subsidies against the \ntaxes the rest of America will pay and say, therefore, there are no \ntaxes in the bill.\n  I think that is another form of gimmickry. I ask my colleague from \nSouth Dakota what his perspective is on the types of gimmicks we are \nseeing and whether the American people should insist that these kinds \nof things be removed from the bill.\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to my colleague from Idaho that I support his \nmotion. I hope we get a chance to vote on it. I know right now they are \nscrambling to find an alternative to put up so they can have something \non which to give their side political cover because they know the \nreason they are trying so hard is because they know this raises taxes. \nTo say with a straight face this does not raise taxes--the American \npeople get this. I think the gig is up. They figured out there are huge \nMedicare cuts in this bill, huge tax increases in this bill. And as the \nSenator from Idaho pointed out, when they say these refundable tax \ncredits are going to go back in the form of premium subsidies and there \nare not that many people who are going to pay, as he pointed out, 73 \npercent of the people who will get those premium subsidies are people \nwho do not have an income tax liability already. Therefore, it is hard \nto say you are going to reduce taxes on somebody who does not have an \nincome tax liability.\n  More important than that, there are still 42 million Americans with \nincomes under $200,000 a year, according to the Joint Tax Committee, \nwho are going to see their taxes go up under this bill. So you \nliterally have millions and millions of Americans under $200,000 a \nyear. And as the Senator from Idaho mentioned, the President's promise \nwas he would not raise taxes on anybody earning under $250,000 a year. \nThis flatly contradicts that, flatly violates that pledge. I cannot \nfathom anybody coming here with a straight face and saying: Oh, yes, \nthis doesn't raise taxes. Of course it raises taxes.\n  What the Senator from Texas and I intend to do on our motion--and I \nhope we have a chance to vote on it and the Senator's motion--we will \ngo back to the committee and figure this out. We want to offer a motion \nthat we think makes sense because it aligns and synchronizes the dates \nof all this.\n  What has happened here, I would say, in a very deceptive way, is they \nunderstated the costs of the bill. My colleagues on the floor already \nalluded to this. They tried to get it under $1 trillion, and in attempt \nto get it under $1 trillion, they had to come up with budget gimmicks.\n  To illustrate that with a bar chart, we can see in the first 10 years \nof this bill--starting today and going to 2019--the spending in the \nearly years does not show up much. That is because most of the spending \ngets put off until January 1, 2014.\n\n[[Page S12864]]\n\n  So if we look at that first 10-year period, the spending under the \nbill is less than it will be when the bill is fully implemented. When \nthe bill is fully implemented, looking at the years 2014 to 2023, it \nexplodes the spending in the bill from about $1 trillion over the first \n10 years to $2.5 trillion over the 10 years when it is fully \nimplemented.\n  The reason they were able to do that is because of this sort of \nsmoke-and-mirrors way of enacting the tax increases immediately and \ndelaying the spending. The American people are going to end up spending \n$71 billion in tax increases out of their pockets, out of the American \ntaxpayers' pockets, about $600 per taxpayer, before they ever see a \nbenefit under this bill.\n  What the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and I are offering is a \nmotion that would delay the tax increases until such time as the \nbenefits begin. That, to me, seems to be a fair way to go about making \npublic policy.\n  What they have done, in an effort to obscure the overall cost of this \nbill, is to say that 22 days from now, we are going to raise your \ntaxes. On January 1 of this year is when most of these taxes--the taxes \non prescription drugs, taxes on medical devices, taxes on health \nplans--all the taxes in the bill begin to take effect January 1 of next \nyear. For 4 years, people will be paying taxes out of their pockets. I \nmight add, because of the taxes that are going to go on all the device \nmanufacturers, prescription drugs, and health plans, they will get \npassed on in the form of higher premiums. They are going to see tax \nincreases and premium increases before they ever see a dollar of \nbenefits.\n  It is 1,483 days until the benefits under this bill kick in. That is \nunfair. It is unfair to the American taxpayer, it is unfair to the \nAmerican people, and it is unfair to try to obscure and mask the total \ncost of this bill and say we are only spending $1 trillion on this bill \nwhen we know full well when it is fully implemented, the total cost of \nthat is $2.5 trillion.\n  I appreciate the discussion that is being held here in pointing out \nthe smoke and mirrors, the sort of underhanded way to try to shield the \ncost of this bill but also to support the Senator from Idaho with his \nmotion that would commit this bill and get these tax increases out of \nhere because the one thing small businesses are saying right now is we \nwant to invest, we want to create jobs. But you cannot raise taxes on \nsmall businesses when you want them to create jobs. That is what this \nbill does.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business, the Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Wholesalers and Distributors--all \nthe major business organizations--have come out opposed to this bill.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business in a letter yesterday \nsaid: We do not support policies that increase the cost of doing \nbusiness and that raise taxes. Clearly, that is what this bill does.\n  Our motion is very simple; that is, it simply delays tax increases \nuntil such time as the benefits begin.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am very pleased that the Senator from South Dakota \ntalked about what we are trying to do because it is very simple. It is \nvery simple. The Hutchison-Thune motion to commit says, if we do \nnothing else, if we do nothing else in this bill, we have to be fair \nand transparent with the American people; that is, we do not start the \ntaxes, we do not start the increases in premiums, increases in \nprescription drug benefits, increases in medical devices until at least \nthere is an implementation of this insurance program that we hear is \ngoing to be offered to the American people. We have not seen it, but we \nare told that there is going to be an insurance program that Americans \ncan sign up for, but they are going to be paying higher taxes and \npremiums and costs in health care for 4 years before they ever see it. \nAll we are saying is, let's send this bill back to committee and fix \nthat.\n  It does not--as the Senator from Nebraska said earlier--pass the \nsmell test. It does not pass the smell test in Nebraska, Wyoming, \nFlorida, Idaho, South Dakota, or Texas. To tax people for 4 years, to \nraise their costs until they basically are going to say, Give me an \nalternative, and the alternative is, guess what: A big government \ntakeover of our health care system. That is like saying: I am from the \nFederal Government, and I am here to help you. We have heard that \nbefore.\n  I do not think the American people will in any way believe that this \nbill is fair or honest with them if we start the taxes 22 days from \nnow, as the Senator from South Dakota has pointed out, but they do not \nsee a program. They are going to go online and say: Oh, my premiums are \ngoing up, my prescription drugs are going up; my goodness, where is the \ninsurance program they have been talking about? They are going to go \nonline, but, hey, there is no program.\n  How can we go home--I ask any of the Senators who would like to add \ntheir perspective on this--how are you going to go home and tell your \nconstituents that your taxes start in 22 days, and maybe in 4 years, \nroughly, maybe you are going to see a program, and we are from the \nFederal Government, and we are here to help you?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. You cannot go home and say that with a straight face. \nThere are many rural areas in our States. People see through all this.\n  There are two articles next to each other in today's New York Times. \nOne talks about the details of the secret agreement they are working on \nbehind closed doors. It says: ``Details Are Scanty.'' Right next to it \nit talks about: ``For Rural Elderly, Times Are Distinctly Harder.'' \nThese are the people who are going to see taxes going up, these are the \npeople who are going to see cuts in Medicare.\n  I want to read the first paragraph because this is from Lingle, WY, a \ncommunity in my State. It talks about Norma Clark, 80. It says:\n\n       Norma Clark, 80, slipped on the ice out by the horse corral \n     one afternoon and broke her hip in four places.\n\n  I am an orthopedic doctor. I have taken care of these over the years.\n\n       Alone, it took her three hours--\n\n  These are the kind of wonderful Americans we have--\n\n       Alone, it took her 3 hours to drag herself 40 yards back to \n     the house through snow and mud, after she had tied her legs \n     together with rope to stabilize the injury.\n\n  This is a person who is on Medicare, and they are going to cut $464 \nbillion from Medicare, and they are going to use gimmicks that are \ngoing to harm our people.\n  I have a former Governor and a former chief of staff for a Governor's \noffice. You know in the rural parts of your community, I say to \nGovernor, now the Senator from Nebraska, you have people like that--\nhard-working people who expect honesty from a government, and they are \nnot getting it in this bill which is going to tax for 10 years and only \ngive services for 6.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. That is such a compelling story. I want to add something \nto that. When you think the policy could not get more crazy and insane, \nyou hear about this idea that they are going to expand Medicare, which \nis due to be insolvent in 2017. But the tragedy of that in relating it \nto the story you just told us is this: That will hammer our rural \nhospitals. Why? Because they cannot stay open on Medicare reimbursement \nrates. They cannot stay open on Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n  This poor woman who dragged herself to try to get some care all of a \nsudden could be faced with the possibility that the hospital she relies \non will not stay open under this health care bill.\n  I have been to those hospitals. I have seen the struggles they are \ngoing through with Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement. Every hospital \nadministrator tells me the same thing: We would close our doors if we \nhad to live on that.\n  So what is their solution? Expand Medicaid and Medicare. You have got \nto be kidding me. Who are they listening to? You know what. Take this \nbill out to the rural areas of Nebraska. You will get an earful.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven seconds--2, 1, 0. Time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me give the last 5 seconds to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. I yield back my 5 seconds. I don't have enough time to \ndistribute equally. It would not be fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe\n\n[[Page S12865]]\n\ntime for debate only be extended until 2 p.m., with the time equally \ndivided, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, \nwith no amendments in order during this time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Senator from \nFlorida, it is 10 minutes and going back and forth. It is not 30 \nminutes allocated per side; is that correct?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask to be advised when I have used 8 of my \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, small businesses are the backbone of our \neconomy. They make up 99.7 percent of all employer firms. They employ \njust over half of all private sector employees. They pay 44 percent of \nthe total U.S. private payroll. They have generated 64 percent--a \nmajority--of the net new jobs over the past 15 years. They create more \nthan half of the nonfarm private gross domestic product, and they hire \n40 percent of all high-tech workers.\n  Small businesses drive this economy. They are also the sector most in \nneed of real health reform that will reduce cost and make it easier to \nbuy insurance. It is estimated that 26 million of the uninsured are \nsmall business owners, employees, and their dependents. That is a \nmajority of the uninsured. They continue to struggle to be able to \nafford health care.\n  Here are two examples: Jim Henderson, president of Dynamic Sales in \nSt. Louis, has made every adjustment in the book to continue to provide \nhealth insurance to his employees. He covered both employees and their \nfamilies back in the 1980s, but he is now at a point where he can only \nafford to provide for his employees. He pays 70 percent, his employees \n30 percent. Jim is one of the very few small businesses that right now \nhave weathered the storm despite the economy. He wants reform that \nlowers cost and helps individuals better spend their health care \ndollars.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic health care bills we have seen so far--\nand I guess we haven't seen all of them--won't help Jim to continue to \nprovide his employees health care.\n  Kathie and Tom Veasey own True Value Hardware in Wilmington, DE, the \nhometown of Vice President Biden. They employ 28 people, most of whom \nthey consider family. They cover 100 percent of the cost for their \nemployees and half for their families. But they have seen huge \nincreases in premiums over the years, with a 36-percent increase just \nthis year after an employee got sick. Each year, they are forced to \nshop for health insurance, but they continue to have limited choices \ndue to an uncompetitive market.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic bills won't fix the problem or help \nKathie and Tom continue to provide their employees health care.\n  If we really want to get out of this recession, if we really want to \naddress the problem of affordable and accessible health insurance, then \nthe majority party needs to take a hard look at health care reform.\n  First of all, we need to allow small businesses to go together and \npurchase health care across State lines so they have true competition \nand so they can lower costs. We need medical malpractice reform, which \nwould cut $120 billion to $200 billion out of the cost of health care.\n  However, when we look closely, the bills we see before us do not \naddress the real health care needs, and, in fact, by imposing more \ntaxes--and taxes which the CBO said will be passed from health care \ncompanies down to those who are paying the private bills--not only will \nit make health care less affordable for these small businesses, it will \nforce many of them to drop whatever coverage they have now.\n  Tax equity is extremely important. An employee of a large corporation \nor a union member who gets health care premiums paid for by their \nemployer or by their union doesn't have to record them as income. Small \nbusinesses, their employees, farmers, and individual purchasers need \nthe same benefit that the employees of large corporations and union \nmembers get.\n  Now, instead of proposing commonsense health care solutions for small \nbusinesses, the bills we have seen coming out of the smoke-filled rooms \nrun by the majority leader continue to heap costly new burdens on small \nbusinesses that are trying to keep their doors open. More and more it \nseems small businesses are under attack, and that is what they are \ntelling us. One of the universities that visited me this past week is \ntrying to do something to help small businesses, and I said: What is \nthe attitude? They say: The attitude of small business is that they are \nunder attack by what is being done in Congress and what is being \nproposed by the administration.\n  The 2010 budget calls for tax increases on those earning $250,000 or \nmore. For small businesses that are taxed at their personal rate--\nproprietorships, partnerships, and sub S corporations--these tax \nincreases hit the returns of those small businesses, and they are taxed \nat the punitive rate. Higher energy taxes on businesses in the cap-and-\ntrade plan will put many small businesses in my part of the country out \nof work. New taxes and new mandates in the health care bill will be \npassed on.\n  Randy Angst of Lebanon, MO, says the following about the Senate bill:\n\n       The new taxes would eliminate roughly half of my profits. \n     It would force me to let employees go, refrain from hiring \n     new employees and prevent me from reinvesting in my business. \n     The mandates would be very harmful and make it much more \n     costly for me to operate my business.\n\n  This bill--the last bill we have seen--requires a costly $28 billion \nnew mandate on businesses that do not offer health care. Who pays that \nmandate? Anybody looking for a job. If you tell businesses they have to \nspend big money on a mandate, they cannot spend it on hiring new \nworkers. The mandates do nothing to reduce insurance costs, and because \nthey are focused on full-time workers, the mandate gives companies an \nincentive to classify more of their workers as part time.\n  Gene Schwartz, with K Wire Products in Neosho, MO, says:\n\n       We are in a recession and I am in manufacturing. The \n     legislation would be nothing but detrimental to us. Our \n     workforce is already down 25 percent from last year, and if \n     this bill goes through in its current form, the new taxes and \n     mandates will force me to make further cuts. Also, this bill \n     will increase my costs by further raising my already sky-high \n     insurance premiums.\n\n  This bill also includes more paperwork which is costly for a small \nbusiness. Section 9006 requires that every time a business vendor sells \na service or property exceeding $600 to another business, the receiving \nbusiness must report the transaction to the IRS. That is an enormous \nnew costly paperwork burden that will hit almost every business \nregardless of how small.\n  These mandates and regulations disproportionately affect small \nbusinesses and come at a high cost. According to the SBA's own Web \nsite, very small firms with fewer than 20 employees annually spend 45 \npercent more per employee than larger firms to comply with Federal \nregulations. These very small firms spend 4\\1/2\\ times as much per \nemployee to comply with environmental regulations and 67 percent more \nper employee on tax compliance than their larger counterparts.\n  The bill clearly fails to bring down the cost of health care for \nsmall businesses. It fails to bring down the cost of health care at \nall, but it is especially hard on small businesses that can't afford \ncoverage under the current law.\n  Small business owners from my State have come to me for two decades \nlooking for more affordable ways to make health insurance available. \nThey want to be able to provide insurance for their people. That is why \nI have long been a champion of small business health care reform.\n  Does the majority's bill include strong reform that will allow small \nbusinesses and the self employed access to more affordable, more \naccessible health care? No.\n  Does the bill include protections for small businesses that \ndisproportionately feel the burden of increased government mandates and \ntaxes? No.\n  In fact, CBO has said that this bill will increase premiums for \nindividuals in the non group market by 10-13 percent.\n  Premiums for small businesses could increase by 1 percent or be \nreduced by 2 percent but it is easy math. If a small business cannot \nafford to provide health insurance now, they will not be able to afford \nto do so under this bill.\n\n[[Page S12866]]\n\n  According to CBO, under current law families in a small group plan \ntoday pay about $13,300. In 2016, they will pay about $19,200 if this \nbill becomes law.\n  That is the wrong direction.\n  Health care is already too expensive for small businesses. We need to \nmake it cheaper. It should not cost a family $19,200 in 2016 for health \ninsurance.\n  This bill continues down the path of unsustainable health care costs.\n  In fact that is one of the main reasons the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses opposes this bill. They say, ``Small businesses \ncan't support a proposal that does not address their number 1 problem--\nthe unsustainable cost of healthcare. With unemployment at a 26-year \nhigh and small business owners struggling to simply keep their doors \nopen, this kind of reform is not what we need to encourage small \nbusiness to thrive.''\n  This bill also imposes new taxes and fees, like the $6.7 billion per \nyear tax increase on health insurance companies.\n  Yes, the majority wants to sock it to the insurance companies.\n  Well, guess what. The insurance companies are going to pass the costs \nalong to consumers.\n  Small businesses cannot self-insure, they must purchase products \navailable in the marketplace. That is why CBO has found that increased \ncosts due to fees being passed on to the consumer will be more \npronounced for small businesses. NFIB has also said this new tax will \nfall almost exclusively on small businesses.\n  This bill just does not help small businesses.\n  I know the argument my colleagues on the other side offer.\n  They say they provide a tax credit to help small businesses.\n  What they don't say is that this is a bait and switch.\n  First of all, in order to get the full credit, you cannot have more \nthan 10 workers who get paid an average of $20,000.\n  After that, the credit begins to phase out for each employee you have \nabove 10. It also phases out for each $1,000 increase in average wages \nabove $20,000. If you have 25 employees or you pay more than an average \nwage of above $40,000, you don't even get the credit.\n  The real kicker is that the full credit is only available for 2 years \nafter the exchange takes effect. Then that is it.\n  A small business will either have to offer an employee health \ninsurance--which will really not be any cheaper than it is today--or \nthey will have to pay a fine. Or an employee can go into the exchange \nas an individual where insurance will cost 10-13 percent more.\n  Let us examine a realistic situation using Jim from St. Louis as an \nexample.\n  As I mentioned before, the small business tax credit is filled with \nthresholds and variations that make it of limited value for the few \nsmall businesses that are eligible to claim the credit.\n  The full value of the credit, which is equal to 50 percent of the \nbusiness owner's costs, is available for small businesses with 10 or \nfewer workers that pay their employees an average annual wage of \n$20,000 or less. But the credit also starts to phase out as the \nemployer adds employees or gives raises, so the entire credit is gone \nif the employer has 25 or more employees and pays them an average wage \nof $40,000 or more.\n  Jim has six employees and his average annual wage is about $39,000. \nJim has to ask if he meets the two threshold questions before he can \ndetermine whether he gets the tax credit. He passes the first test, \nsince he only has six employees. But Jim's credit is reduced because he \nhas paid his employees too much in wages.\n  Today, Jim's health care costs are $30,540. If he qualified for the \nfull value of the credit, his annual health care costs would be \n$15,270--about half of what he pays now.\n  But the value of his small business tax credit is directly related to \nwage, so the value of Jim's credit is reduced to $763 based on the \nformula. That is a small fraction of his health care costs and wouldn't \neven cover the cost of hiring an accountant to figure out how much the \ncredit is worth.\n  Because Jim is already so close to the highest average wage to be \neligible for any credit at all, this means if he gives his employees a \nwell-earned and well-deserved raise, he will lose the credit \naltogether.\n  In these tough economic times, the government is encouraging small \nbusiness owners like Jim to create more jobs, but if they create too \nmany or pay people too much, then the government will reward them by \ntaking away their small business tax credit.\n  And even worse, the phase-outs mean that Jim has a disincentive to \nhire more workers.\n  So this bill completely misses the mark for small businesses.\n  Mr. President, our small businesses are struggling. We owe more to \nthis critical sector of our economy which is responsible for half of \nthe private-sector jobs and employees than a bill that mandates taxes \nand fails to provide real health care reform.\n  In a recent letter to Senator Reid, the NFIB outlines how the bill \nwill adversely affect business owners.\n\n       When evaluating healthcare reform options, small business \n     owners ask themselves two specific questions. First, will the \n     bill lower insurance costs? Second, will the bill increase \n     the overall cost of doing business? If a bill increases the \n     cost of doing business or fails to reduce insurance costs, \n     then the bill fails to achieve their No. 1 goal--lower costs.\n       In both cases, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act (H.R. 3590) fails the small business test and, therefore, \n     fails small business.\n\n  They further say in the letter:\n\n       Despite the inclusion of insurance market reforms in the \n     small-group and individual marketplaces, the savings that may \n     materialize are too small for too few and the increase in \n     premium costs are too great for too many. Those costs, along \n     with greater government involvement, higher taxes and new \n     mandates that are disproportionately targeted at small \n     business and are being used to finance H.R. 3590, create a \n     reality that is worse than the status quo for small business.\n\n  It is worse than the status quo.\n  Mr. President, it is time to stop attacking small business and work \non real reform. We should defeat this proposal that does not make \ninsurance more affordable, is a massive government intrusion into \nhealth care and that will pay for new entitlement programs on the backs \nof our small businesses.\n  Let us put this debate in context. If small businesses do most of the \nhiring, and we are counting on them to help lead us out of the \nrecession, why would we want to increase their costs of doing business \nand make it less likely they will hire new workers?\n  President Obama hosted a Forum on Jobs and Economic Growth last week, \nwhere he invited ideas to jump start job growth in our sluggish \neconomy.\n  Now, he and the majority are considering a new plan to jump-start job \ngrowth using ``unspent'' or returned TARP funds. Have they forgotten \nthat it is all borrowed money, and thus deficit spending, in the first \nplace?\n  Let me submit that the bill before us will hurt job creation.\n  Before practicing medicine, doctors often take an oath, the \nHippocratic Oath, where they promise to refrain from doing harm. I \nwould like to see Congress and the President take the same oath.\n  How can you on the one hand legislate new taxes on businesses in the \nname of health reform--coupled with new energy taxes in the name of \nclimate protection--and on the other hand ask businesses to generate \nnew jobs? It cannot be done. Massive tax increases and job creation are \nmutually exclusive.\n  Employers who face uncertainty regarding new, oppressive taxes and \nmandates are not going to want to sink money into new jobs. It is that \nsimple.\n  We should think about the harm we will do to small businesses through \nthis legislation and instead work on commonsense reforms that have \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from the National Federation of Independent Businesses.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                                 December 8, 2009.\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: As the Senate continues \n     to debate the future of comprehensive healthcare reform, the \n     National Federation of Independent Business,\n\n[[Page S12867]]\n\n     the nation's leading small business association, is writing \n     in opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act (H.R. 3590).\n       When evaluating healthcare reform options, small business \n     owners ask themselves two specific questions. First, will the \n     bill lower insurance costs? Second, will the bill increase \n     the overall cost of doing business? If a bill increases the \n     cost of doing business or fails to reduce insurance costs, \n     then the bill fails to achieve their No. 1 goal--lower costs.\n       In both cases, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act (H.R. 3590) fails the small business test and, therefore, \n     fails small business. The most recent CBO study detailing the \n     effect that H.R. 3590 will have on insurance premiums \n     reinforces that, despite claims by its supporters, the bill \n     will not deliver the widely-promised help to the small \n     business community. Instead, CBO findings report that the \n     bill will increase non-group premiums by 10 to 13 percent and \n     result in, at best, a 2 percent decrease for small group \n     coverage by 2016. These findings tell small business all it \n     needs to know--that the current bill does not do enough to \n     reduce costs for small business owners and their employees.\n       Despite the inclusion of insurance market reforms in the \n     small-group and individual marketplaces, the savings that may \n     materialize are too small for too few and the increase in \n     premium costs are too great for too many. Those costs, along \n     with greater government involvement, higher taxes and new \n     mandates that are disproportionately targeted at small \n     business and are being used to finance H.R. 3590, create a \n     reality that is worse than the status quo for small business. \n     The shortcomings of the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act include:\n     A New Small Business Health Insurance Tax\n       Unlike large businesses, which self-insure and find \n     security under the blanket of ERISA, most small businesses \n     are only able to find and purchase insurance in the fully-\n     insured marketplace. The Senate bill includes a new $6.7 \n     billion annual tax ($60.7 billion over 10 years) that falls \n     almost exclusively on small business because the fee is \n     assessed on the insurance companies. CBO's most recent study \n     reinforces those costs will ultimately be passed on to their \n     consumers, leaving the cost to be disproportionately borne by \n     small business consumers in the individual and small-group \n     marketplace whose only choice is to purchase those products \n     or forgo insurance altogether.\n     A New Mandate That Punishes Employers, Employees and Hinders \n         Job Creation\n       Employer mandates fail employers and employees in two ways. \n     First, mandates do nothing to address the core issue facing \n     small business--high healthcare costs. Second, mandates \n     destroy job creation opportunities for employees. The job \n     loss, whether through lost hiring or greater reliance on \n     part-time employees, harms low-wage or entry-level workers \n     the most. The employer mandate in H.R. 3590 sets up \n     potentially troubling outcomes for this sector of the \n     workforce. The multiple penalties assessed on full-time \n     workers will most certainly result in a reduction of full-\n     time workers to part-time workers and discourage the hiring \n     of those entrants into the workforce who might qualify for a \n     government subsidy, hardly an outcome that contributes to a \n     greater insured population.\n     A Poorly-Structured Small Business Tax Credit\n       As structured, the small business tax credit will do \n     little, if nothing, to propel either more firms to take-up \n     coverage or produce greater overall affordability. Due to its \n     short-term temporary nature and the limitations based on the \n     business' average wage, its benefit is, at best, a temporary \n     solution to the long-term cost and affordability problem. A \n     tax credit that is poorly structured is not going to provide \n     sustainable and long-term relief from high healthcare costs, \n     and the recent CBO finding that the tax credit would benefit \n     only 12 percent of the small business population illustrates \n     its lack of effectiveness.\n     A Benefit Package That Is Too High a Hurdle for Small \n         Business\n       NFIB has voiced concern over establishing a benefit \n     threshold that is too high a price tag for small businesses \n     to meet. Small businesses are especially price sensitive. \n     They need purchasing choices that provide the flexibility in \n     coverage options that reflect their marketplace and business \n     needs. If Congress doesn't adjust the actuarial value \n     standards in the legislation, what may be affordable this \n     year may be unaffordable next year. As a result, small \n     business owners will be at risk of having to drop coverage \n     due to cost increases that outpace their healthcare budgets.\n     Destructive Rating Reforms and Phase-In Timelines That \n         Threaten Affordability for All\n       NFIB supports balanced federal rating reforms that protect \n     access and affordability, regardless of an individual or \n     group's health status. However, the excessively tight age \n     rating (3:1) in H.R. 3590 will increase more costs than it \n     will decrease, and make coverage unaffordable for the very \n     populations that are most beneficial to the insurance pool--\n     the young and the healthy. Independent actuaries have \n     analyzed the negative impact of such tight bands and have \n     indicated that there will be devastating effects to the long-\n     term viability of a pool without action to correct this \n     rating imbalance.\n       Additionally, to prevent volatile spikes in insurance \n     premiums, also known as ``rate shock,'' federal rating \n     reforms must be appropriately applied to all marketplaces and \n     phased in over a responsible period of time. If this is not \n     done, then certain plans, including ``grandfathered plans,'' \n     will utilize different rating practices when underwriting \n     risk, which can create adverse selection issues. Those \n     selection problems will have a striking negative impact on \n     the new exchanges--exchanges that are meant to improve, \n     rather than decrease, affordability for small business and \n     individuals.\n     National Plans That Provide Limited Promise for Success\n       Leveling the playing field for small business starts with \n     allowing uniform benefit packages to be purchased across \n     state lines. If done right, this can provide a greater \n     security that, as people change jobs and move from state to \n     state, they can keep the benefit plan that meets their \n     healthcare needs. National plans would be particularly \n     helpful for states with smaller populations and where \n     consumers lack a robust marketplace with choice and \n     competition for private plans. Specifically, the state ``opt-\n     out'' language in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act would create more disincentives than incentives for \n     carriers to embark on these new opportunities. If the \n     national plan section is not significantly restructured to \n     make national plans a viable option, then these new \n     opportunities will never materialize for small business.\n     Threatens Flexibility and Choice for Employers and Employees\n       Small employers need more affordable health insurance \n     options and new alternatives for employers to voluntarily \n     contribute to individually-owned plans. Provisions also need \n     to be structured to insure that options are widely available \n     to both employers and employees. The simple cafeteria plan \n     language in H.R. 3590 excludes the owners of many ``pass-\n     through'' business entities from participating in these \n     arrangements. If owners are unable to participate in the \n     plan, they will be less likely to provide insurance to their \n     workforce. Finally, small business needs the freedom and \n     flexibility to preserve options that are already proven to \n     work. Prohibiting the use of HSA, FSA and HRA funds to \n     purchase over-the-counter medications, along with the $2,500 \n     limit on FSA contributions, diminishes that flexibility and \n     threatens to further limit the options employers have to \n     provide meaningful healthcare to their employees.\n     New Paperwork Costs on Small Businesses\n       The cost associated with tax paperwork is the most \n     expensive paperwork burden that the federal government \n     imposes on small business owners. The Senate bill \n     dramatically increases that cost with a new reporting \n     requirement that is levied on business transactions of more \n     than $600 annually, leaving small business buried in \n     paperwork and increasing their paperwork compliance expenses.\n     An Unprecedented New Payroll Tax on Small Employers\n       Since its creation the payroll taxes that fund the Medicare \n     programs have not been wage-based and are dedicated \n     specifically to funding Medicare. The Senate bill changes the \n     nature of the tax and creates a precedent to use payroll \n     taxes to pay for non-Medicare programs.\n     The Absence of Real Medical Liability Reform\n       NFIB strongly supports medical liability reform as a means \n     to both inject more fairness into the medical malpractice \n     legal system, and to reduce unnecessary litigation and legal \n     costs. Taking serious steps to adopt meaningful medical \n     liability reform is a significant step toward restoring \n     common sense to our medical liability litigation system. It \n     also is especially critical to improving access to healthcare \n     for those living in rural areas, where it is becoming \n     increasingly difficult for those in need to locate \n     specialists such as OB/GYNs and surgeons.\n     The Creation of a New Government-Run Healthcare Program\n       A government-run plan will drive the private healthcare \n     marketplace out of business. Private insurers will be unable \n     to compete in a climate where the rules and practices are \n     tilted in favor of a massive government-run plan. This means \n     millions could lose their current coverage. This will \n     decrease choice and increase costs. On both accounts, the \n     government-run plan will leave small business with a single \n     option--the government-run plan, which is the exact opposite \n     outcome small businesses want from healthcare reform.\n       There is near universal agreement that, if done right, \n     small business has much to gain from healthcare reform. But \n     if it is done wrong, then small business will have the most \n     to lose. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n     which is short on savings and long on costs, is the wrong \n     reform, at the wrong time and will increase healthcare costs \n     and the cost of doing business. NFIB remains committed to \n     healthcare reform, and urges the Senate to develop common \n     sense solutions to lower healthcare costs while ensuring that \n     policies empower small\n\n[[Page S12868]]\n\n     business with the ability to make the investments necessary \n     to move our economy forward.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Susan Eckerly,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                                    Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have a couple of other comments I wish to \nadd.\n  We have now learned that there is a new proposal coming out of the \nback rooms--the smoke-filled rooms. Every time something new is thrown \nup on the wall, we stand around with a great deal of interest to see \nwhether it sticks. When you look at this one, I don't believe it \nsticks. I think it stinks.\n  If you read the Washington Post's lead editorial today, its headline \nis ``Medicare sausage? The emerging buy-in proposal could have costly \nunintended consequences.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nafter my remarks, the Washington Post article.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. At the end of the article, it says:\n\n       The irony of this late-breaking Medicare proposal is that \n     it could be a bigger step toward a single-payer system than \n     the milquetoast public option plans rejected by Senate \n     moderates as too disruptive of the private market.\n\n  To say that it moves toward a public takeover is confirmed by one of \nthe most outspoken backers of the public option, the one most \ninterested in getting public control or governmental control of all of \nhealth care, New York Representative Anthony Weiner. He is quoted in \nPolitico today as having hailed the expansion of Medicare as an \nunvarnished triumph for Democrats like himself who have been pushing \nfor a single-payer run health care system. In the article, he says: \n``Never mind the camel's nose, we've got his head and his neck in the \ntent.''\n  I think that is clear. Trying to expand Medicare will almost \nassuredly drive all the private plans out of the market. Why? Medicare \npays 80 percent of the cost of hospitals and less for doctors, and they \nhave to make up the rest of their cost by charging privately covered \npatients more money. It will raise the cost so that private health care \ncan no longer succeed.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 10, 2009]\n\n                           Medicare Sausage?\n\n       The only thing more unsettling than watching legislative \n     sausage being made is watching it being made on the fly. The \n     11th-hour ``compromise'' on health-care reform and the public \n     option supposedly includes an expansion of Medicare to let \n     people ages 55 to 64 buy into the program. This is an idea \n     dating to at least the Clinton administration, and Senate \n     Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) originally \n     proposed allowing the buy-in as a temporary measure before \n     the new insurance exchanges get underway. However, the last-\n     minute introduction of this idea within the broader context \n     of health reform raises numerous questions--not least of \n     which is whether this proposal is a far more dramatic step \n     toward a single-payer system than lawmakers on either side \n     realize.\n       The details of how the buy-in would work are still sketchy \n     and still being fleshed out, but the basic notion is that \n     uninsured individuals 55 to 64 who would be eligible to \n     participate in the newly created insurance exchanges could \n     choose instead to purchase coverage through Medicare. In \n     theory, this would not add to Medicare costs because the \n     coverage would have to be paid for--either out of pocket or \n     with the subsidies that would be provided to those at lower \n     income levels to purchase insurance on the exchanges. The \n     notion is that, because Medicare pays lower rates to health-\n     care providers than do private insurers, the coverage would \n     tend to cost less than a private plan. The complication is \n     understanding what effect the buy-in option would have on the \n     new insurance exchanges and, more important, on the larger \n     health-care system.\n       Currently, Medicare benefits are less generous in \n     significant ways than the plans to be offered on the \n     exchanges. For instance, there is no cap on out-of-pocket \n     expenses. So would near-seniors who buy in to Medicare get \n     Medicare-level benefits? If so, who would tend to purchase \n     that coverage? Sicker near-seniors might be better off \n     purchasing private insurance on the an exchange. But the \n     educated guessing--and that's a generous description--is that \n     sicker near-seniors might tend to place more trust in a \n     government-run program; they might assume, with good reason, \n     that the government will be more accommodating in approving \n     treatments, and they might flock to Medicare. That would \n     raise premium costs and, correspondingly, the pressure to dip \n     into federal funds for extra help.\n       In addition, the insurance exchanges proposal is being \n     increasingly sliced and diced in ways that could narrow its \n     effectiveness. Remember, the overall concept is to group \n     together enough people to spread the risk and obtain better \n     rates. But so-called ``young invincibles''--the under-30 \n     crowd--would already be allowed to opt out of the regular \n     exchange plans and purchase high-deductible catastrophic \n     coverage. Those with incomes under 133 percent of the poverty \n     level would be covered by Medicaid. The exchanges risk \n     becoming less effective the more they are Balkanized this \n     way.\n       Presumably, the expanded Medicare program would pay \n     Medicare rates to providers, raising the question of the \n     spillover effects on a health-care system already stressed by \n     a dramatic expansion of Medicaid. Will providers cut costs--\n     or will they shift them to private insurers, driving up \n     premiums? Will they stop taking Medicare patients or go to \n     Congress demanding higher rates? Once 55-year-olds are in, \n     they are not likely to be kicked out, and the pressure will \n     be on to expand the program to make more people eligible. The \n     irony of this late-breaking Medicare proposal is that it \n     could be a bigger step toward a single-payer system than the \n     milquetoast public option plans rejected by Senate moderates \n     as too disruptive of the private market.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, over the past several months, I have come \nto the floor of this body many times to speak about the urgent need for \ncomprehensive health care reform. I have said that our bill must \naccomplish three goals in order to be effective: It must bring \ncompetition to the insurance market--competition to the insurance \nmarket--it must provide significant cost savings to ordinary Americans, \nand it must restore accountability to an industry that has run \nroughshod over the American public for far too long. I would like to \nfocus on this last point with my remarks today.\n  We need real accountability in the insurance market. After almost 100 \nyears of debate about health care reform, this Senate stands on the \nverge of making history. There are many good elements in the \nlegislation that is before us today, but without accountability, any \nreform measure would be toothless and inconsequential. If we don't give \nthe American people a chance to hold their insurance providers \naccountable, quality care will continue to elude certain segments of \nour population. We can't stand for this any longer. We must prevent \ninsurance companies from discriminating against people by charging them \nhigher rates or denying coverage because of certain conditions.\n  Everyone knows it is hard for uninsured patients to get quality \nmedical care. Under the current law, in the case of catastrophic injury \nor illness, anyone admitted to the emergency room should receive equal \ntreatment to save their life. Shockingly, Harvard researchers have \nfound that this is not the case. They examined 690,000 individual cases \nover 4 years and found that uninsured patients are nearly twice as \nlikely to die in the hospital as patients with similar injuries who do \nhave insurance. And even after these results were adjusted to account \nfor age, race, gender, and the severity of the injuries, they found \nthat the uninsured were still 80 percent more likely to die than those \nwith health coverage, including Medicaid.\n  I just had a delegation of physicians in my office. I listened to \ntheir comments in reference to wanting us to make sure we passed a \nhealth care reform bill this session. One of those physicians began to \nrelate to me the story of his brother, who was employed but was without \nhealth insurance. At 41 years old, he died of cancer because he waited \ntoo long to try to get treatment. And because he was uninsured and no \none would treat him, that took his life at the young, tender age of 41.\n  So this new evidence is conclusive, and it is truly disturbing. The \npoor and the uninsured suffer disproportionately under our current \nsystem. In the most advanced country on Earth, there is no excuse for \nthis stunning inequality.\n  Big corporations know there is a lot of money to be made out of the \npoor and they do not hesitate to rake in large profits and their \nexpenses. These companies exploit minor technicalities\n\n[[Page S12869]]\n\nto deny coverage to people who are sick. They use gaping holes in the \nsystem to refuse treatment for those with certain conditions. That is \nbecause they do not see patients as real people who need help, they see \nthem as numbers in the corporate ledger. They see risk and expenses and \nlower dividends for their shareholders. That is why we need to \nprioritize patients over profits. That is why we need to extend \ncoverage to more people and make these companies accountable for the \nfirst time in decades.\n  If we pass insurance reform with a strong public option it would be \nillegal to deny coverage because of a preexisting condition. For the \nfirst time in many years, ordinary Americans would be able to shop \naround if they are paying too much, or they are not being treated \nfairly. Costs would come down, coverage would improve, and lives would \nbe saved.\n  Let us pledge ourselves to this cause. Let us make sure every \nAmerican can get the treatment they need in the emergency room \nregardless of their income, need, or the insurance coverage they have. \nWe must not fall short in this regard. We must not settle for anything \nless.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my friends on the other side of the \naisle have consistently stated that this 2074-page Reid bill, according \nto the Joint Committee on Taxation, is a net tax cut. I want to put \nemphasis throughout my remarks on the word ``net.''\n  Yesterday a chart was used to illustrate this point. This chart had \nmultiple bars with dollar figures. For example, in 2019 the chart \nshowed a $40.8 billion net tax cut. My Democratic friends said this \nnumber came from the Joint Committee on Taxation, a very responsible, \nintellectually honest group.\n  Unfortunately, the chart my friends were using was not entirely clear \non how they came up with this net tax cut for Americans. So it was \nnatural for most of the fellow Senators and the country at large to \nwonder how my Democratic friends got this number. They said show me the \ndata.\n  To clear up any confusion, right here is the Joint Committee on \nTaxation table that the Democrats relied on to claim that the Reid bill \nresults in a net tax cut. Here it is. We can see the negative $40,786, \nfor example. That is the figure that was used. As the chart indicates, \nthese dollar amounts are in the millions, so $40,786 million. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation says it this way: This means negative--the \nnegative mark there--negative $40.8 billion.\n  My friends on the other side unfortunately did not explain what was \ngoing on here. It appears my friends simply made an assertion that they \nhoped many of us and those in the media would believe. But I cannot let \nmy Democratic friends get off the hook this easily. Why? Because the \nentire story is not being told, so let me take a moment to explain.\n  First, in simplest terms, where you see negative numbers on this \nchart, the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us there is some type \nof tax benefit going to the taxpayers. So this group and these groups \nhere, wherever there is a negative here, those are tax benefits to the \nbenefit of the taxpayers.\n  For example, families making $50,000 to $75,000 have a negative of \n$10,489 in their column. This means the Joint Committee on Taxation is \ntelling us that this income category is receiving $10.4 billion in tax \nbenefits.\n  I hope you will listen closely. When we see a negative number on this \nchart, the Joint Committee on Taxation tells us there is a tax benefit \nso, conversely, where we see a positive number the Joint Committee on \nTaxation is telling us that these taxpayers are seeing a tax increase. \nI have actually enlarged those numbers, the number of tax returns and \nthe dollar amounts where there is a positive number for individuals and \nfamilies. Again, these positive numbers indicate tax increase.\n  My friends have said that all tax returns in this chart are receiving \na net tax cut. If that were so, why aren't there negative numbers next \nto all of the dollar amounts listed? Because not everyone in this chart \nis receiving a tax cut, despite what my friends have said. Quite to the \ncontrary, a group of taxpayers is clearly seeing a tax increase and \nthis group of taxpayers in middle income is seeing tax increases.\n  I didn't come down to the floor to say my friends on the other side \nof the aisle are wrong. After all, you can see here the negative \n$40,786 million figure they used is right there, out in the open. What \nI am doing is clarifying that my Democratic friends cannot spread this \n$40.8 billion tax cut across all the affected taxpayers on this chart, \nand then say that all have received a tax cut.\n  You want to know why. Because this chart, produced by the nonpartisan \nJoint Committee on Taxation, shows that taxes go up for those making \nmore than $50,000 and families making more than $75,000. It is right \nhere in the yellow, as you can see.\n  The numbers obviously do not lie. I say the nonpartisan Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, I think everybody agrees, is very intellectually \nhonest. So let me give you my read on what the Joint Committee on \nTaxation is saying here as evidenced by the figures on the chart.\n  First, there is a group of low- and middle-income taxpayers who \nclearly benefits under the 2074-page bill that is before the Senate. \nThey benefit from the government subsidy of health insurance. This \ngroup, however, is relatively small.\n  There is another much larger group of middle-income taxpayers who are \nseeing their taxes go up due to one or a combination of the following \ntax increases: the high-cost plan tax increase, which actually is a \nbrandnew tax; the medical expense deduction limitation, which used to \nbe 7.5 percent, and now before you can deduct you have to have 10 \npercent of your income be medical expenses or you don't deduct \nanything, so that is a tax increase; and then a Medicare payroll tax \nincrease, where everybody is going to pay--well, everybody over a \ncertain income is going to pay an additional half a percentage point \nor, if you are self-employed, pay 1 percent more of payroll tax. In \ngeneral, this group is not benefiting from the government subsidy. \nAfter all, how can a taxpayer see a tax cut if they are not even \neligible for the subsidy?\n  Also, there is an additional group of taxpayers who would be affected \nby other tax increase provisions in the Reid bill that the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation could not distribute in the way people are \ndistributed on this chart. These undistributed tax increases include, \namong others, the cap on Federal savings--flexible savings accounts. \nThen there is a tax on cosmetic surgery.\n  My friend from Idaho, the author of the amendment before us, Mr. \nCrapo, recently received a letter from the Joint Committee on Taxation \nstating that this additional group exists and many in this group will \nmake less than $250,000 and, hence, have a tax increase that is not \naccounted for here and also a tax increase if they are under $250,000. \nThat is a violation of the President's promise in the last campaign \nthat nobody under that figure would get a tax increase--only people \nover $250,000.\n  So you see, my Democratic friends cannot, No. 1, say that all \ntaxpayers receive a tax cut--I have proven that here--and, No. 2, say \nthat middle-income Americans will not see a tax increase under the Reid \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, some of the charges from the other side of \nthe aisle have taken us down some detours to essentially try to \ndistract us from some of the main points of this legislation. I want to \ntake a few moments to discuss one of the key features of the bill and \nthat is insurance market reform.\n  The bill would change the way insurance companies do business in \nAmerica. Sometimes I think this reform is part of the reason some on \nthe other side are fighting this bill so hard. Our bill will end the \npractice, widespread today, of insurance companies denying coverage \naltogether, or charging someone an exorbitant amount of money if they \nhave some preexisting condition, something in their health history \nwhich is an issue. Our bill would make those changes right away. They \nstart going into effect in 2010. That is, the prohibition on companies \ndenying coverage for preexisting conditions or\n\n[[Page S12870]]\n\nhealth care stats, and right down the list, would take effect right \naway, 2010.\n  We all have countless numbers of examples, either directly or through \nfriends or relatives of small insurance companies that either denied \ninsurance coverage or you have to pay much greater increase in premiums \nbecause of a preexisting condition, whatever it may be, of something. \nIt is wrong, flat, outright, 100 percent wrong. This bill stops that, \nstops those practices by insurance companies.\n  I think it is important that we not get sidetracked by some other \nvery important matters but keep focused on what this legislation does. \nIt reforms the health insurance industry.\n  What else does our bill do with respect to reforming the health \ninsurance industry? It would prohibit lifetime limits on payments to \npeople who get sick. Right now, insurance companies limit how much they \npay out to people when they get sick. They have lifetime limits, annual \nlimits. No matter how sick you are, some catastrophic coverage you \nhave, the insurance company says: Sorry, we are putting a limit on it. \nThat is not right. Sometimes people have conditions that require a lot \nmore attention, more hospitalization, more attention by doctors. Our \nlegislation would prohibit lifetime limits on payments to people who \nget sick.\n  Our bill also prohibits unreasonable annual limits. These are limits \nthat insurance companies impose on policyholders. This reform would \napply in both the group market and the individual market. What does \nthat mean, that gobbledygook. It implies that for everybody, whether \nyou are an individual or whether you are working for a company, this \nwould take effect 6 months after enactment. That is pretty important. A \nlot of people have insurance policies with limits, where the insurance \ncompany will only pay so much to an individual or during the person's \nlifetime or in any year. It is not right because some conditions \nrequire a significant increase in payments or coverage for the person.\n  Our bill would require any insurance plan that provides dependent \ncoverage for children to continue to make that coverage available until \nthe child turns age 26. We know that is a problem today. Often, in a \nState, once a child turns 21 or 22, that person can't find health \ninsurance. In today's economic recession, with unemployment so high, it \nis kind of hard for kids to find jobs, and that is how they would \notherwise get their health insurance. We say family coverage covers \nyour child until the child turns age 26. This reform would take effect \n6 months after enactment.\n  In addition, when the exchanges are up and running, our bill would \nprohibit insurance companies from discriminating against consumers \nbecause of health status, generally. Sometimes the insurance industry \nsays it is not a preexisting condition, but you have not been healthy \nlately so we will not give you insurance. No longer can insurance \ncompanies refuse to sell or renew policies because a person gets sick. \nIf you pay your premiums, the insurance company has to renew your \ncoverage.\n  When the exchanges are up and running, the legislation before us \ntoday would limit the ability of insurance companies to charge people \nmuch more just because of their age. That is what they do today. \nSometimes, depending upon the State, the insurance company is able to \ncharge somebody much more for the same coverage because of that \nperson's age. Right now it is not at all unusual for insurance \ncompanies to charge more than five times as much just because a person \nis, say, age 55. Our bill would prohibit insurance companies from \ncharging more than three times as much because of age. In some States, \nthere is no limit whatsoever. In my State of Montana, we have no limit. \nSome States have five. We are saying down to three.\n  When the exchanges are up and running, our bill would prohibit \ninsurance companies from charging women more than men. Think of that. \nSome insurance companies charge women more than men. That is not right. \nThis is also a widespread practice among insurance companies that is \ncharging women more than men. It is just plain wrong. Our legislation \nwould stop that.\n  Health insurance reform also means real insurance market reform. It \nmeans real change in the way insurance companies do business. No longer \nwill insurance companies be able to build their business by cherry-\npicking only the healthiest and the youngest. That is what they do \ntoday, especially for individuals, to some degree, in smaller \norganizations. No longer will they be able to insure only those who \ndon't need insurance. We bring real reform. It would make insurance \nmuch more fair, and that is literally a matter of life and death.\n  As a recent Harvard study reported, people without insurance are 40 \npercent more likely to die prematurely than people with private \ninsurance. Think of that. People without insurance are 40 percent more \nlikely to die prematurely than people with private insurance. Tens of \nthousands of Americans die each and every year because they do not have \ninsurance. Is that America? That doesn't sound like the United States \nwe are all so proud of, where we allow tens of thousands of Americans \nto die each and every year simply because we have not set up a system \nfor them to have health insurance. That is something we stop in this \nbill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have said, for the last 2 days, I was \ngoing to speak on the Dorgan amendment, a bipartisan amendment to allow \nthe importation of drugs into the United States. I haven't done it \nuntil now, so I am glad to rise in support of this bipartisan amendment \nto add provisions of the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety \nAct to this bill. That legislation is the result of a collaborative \neffort by Senators Dorgan, Snowe, McCain, and this Senator to finally \nmake drug importation legal.\n  I have, for a long time, been a proponent of drug reimportation. In \n2000, 2002, and 2003, I supported an amendment permitting the \nimportation of prescription drugs into the United States from one \ncountry, Canada. This amendment is much broader than only Canada.\n  In 2004, the late Senator Kennedy and I worked together on a bill \nthat would authorize drug importation, but it did not survive the \npartisan politics of this Chamber. I then introduced my own \ncomprehensive drug importation bill in 2004. That was S. 2307, the \nReliable Entry for Medicines at Everyday Discounts Through the \nImportation with Effective Safeguards Act. The REMEDIES Act is what the \nacronym finally spells out. In 2005, I combined my bill with a proposal \nsponsored by Senators Dorgan and Snowe. In 2007, we reintroduced a \nversion of that legislation with the hope that our combined efforts \nwould finally lower the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. \nThat is what we are still working together to do this very day. I thank \nSenator Dorgan for his leadership.\n  This time around, I should be confident that this effort will finally \npass. Historically, Democrats claim to be champions of holding the big \npharmaceutical companies accountable. Now we have a Democratic \nsupermajority in the Congress and a Democratic President who has \nsupported drug importation in the past. I am not as confident as maybe \nI should be. That is because the White House has participated in some \nback-room negotiations since the last time this legislation was brought \nbefore the Senate and then Senator Obama supported it. Behind closed \ndoors, the Democratic White House found new friends in the \npharmaceutical industry. Last summer, the head of the pharmaceutical \nlobbying group bragged that drug manufacturers had negotiated a ``rock-\nsolid deal''--those are their words--with the present administration.\n  An article in the New York Times detailed the administration's deal \nwith big drug companies. This quote comes from the New York Times:\n\n       Foreseeing new profits from the expansion of health \n     coverage, big drug companies are spending as much as $150 \n     million on advertisements to support the President's plan.\n\n  But in 2008, when President Obama was campaigning for the position he \nnow holds, he promised that:\n\n\n[[Page S12871]]\n\n\n       We'll take on drug and insurance companies, hold them \n     responsible for the prices they charge and the harm they \n     cause.\n  Certainly, the President knows that a great way to hold drug \ncompanies accountable is to allow drug importation. In fact, in 2004, \nwhen he was a candidate to be a Member of this Chamber, he challenged \nhis opponents to support drug importation. He said at that time:\n\n       I urge [my opponent] to stop siding with the drug \n     manufacturers and put aside his opposition to the re-\n     importation of lower-priced prescription drugs. . . .\n\n  But, unfortunately, it has been reported that during backroom \nnegotiations at the White House, the big pharmaceutical companies have \nconvinced the President to drop his strong support for drug \nimportation.\n  The New York Times reports that:\n\n       On July 7--\n\n  Meaning this year--\n\n     Rham Emanuel, [President] Obama's chief of staff . . . \n     assured at least five pharmaceutical companies during a White \n     House meeting that there would be no provision in the final \n     health care package to allow the reimportation of cheaper \n     drugs. . . .\n\n  I thought we were going to hold drug companies accountable. I thought \nhealth care reform was supposed to drive down the cost of health care, \nincluding the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. The Dorgan \namendment is a commonsense, bipartisan approach to achieve both of \nthese goals. Drug importation achieves these goals without imposing \narbitrary fees, and without flexing the muscles of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I have always considered this a free trade issue. I know most people \nsee it as a health issue, and it is a health issue. But I come at it \nfrom the point of view that there are only a couple items Americans \ncannot buy in this country from anyplace else in the world they want to \nbuy it. One class is pharmaceutical drugs, the other class is Cuban----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 additional \nminutes and that it come off the next block of time from our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So I see this as a free-trade issue. Imports create \ncompetition and keep domestic industry more responsive to consumers. In \nthe United States, we import everything consumers want. So I ask again, \nwhy not pharmaceuticals? That is why it is a trade issue for me as much \nas a health issue. Consumers in the United States pay far more for \nprescription drugs than those in other countries. If Americans could \nlegally and safely access prescription drugs outside the United States, \nthen drug companies would be forced to reevaluate their pricing \nstrategies. They would no longer be able to gouge American consumers by \nmaking them pay more than their fair share for research and \ndevelopment.\n  It is true that pharmaceutical companies do not like the idea of \nopening up America to the global marketplace. They want to keep the \nUnited States closed to other markets in order to charge higher prices \nhere.\n  Based on the reports I just read, it seems that the White House has \nalready sided with the drug manufacturers and promised them the ability \nto continue to gouge American consumers, otherwise known as the status \nquo.\n  The debate is not over. With the Dorgan amendment, prescription drug \ncompanies will be forced to be competitive and establish fair prices in \nAmerica. The drug companies will try to find loopholes in order to \nprotect their bottom line.\n  The Dorgan amendment would make such action illegal. It would not \nallow manufacturers to discriminate against registered exporters or \nimporters. It would prohibit drug companies from engaging in any \nactions to restrict, prohibit, or delay the importation of a qualifying \ndrug.\n  The Dorgan amendment would give the Federal Trade Commission the \nauthority to prevent this kind of abuse. It develops an effective and \nsafe system that gives Americans access to lower prices. Our effort \ngoes to great lengths to ensure the safety of imported drugs. The \nDorgan amendment requires that all imported drugs be approved by the \nFDA. It puts in place a stringent set of safety requirements that must \nbe met before Americans can import drugs from that country.\n  The amendment requires all exporting pharmacies and importing \nwholesalers to be registered with the FDA and inspected. It gives the \nauthority for the FDA to inspect the entire distribution chain for \nimported drugs. It sets very stringent penalties for violations of the \nsafety requirements in this bill, including criminal penalties and up \nto 10 years imprisonment.\n  We need to make sure Americans have even greater, more affordable \naccess to innovative drugs by further opening the doors to competition \nin the global pharmaceutical industry.\n  If my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are serious about bending \ndown the cost curve of health care inflation--and doing it in that \ndirection, the right direction--then they will support the Dorgan \namendment, a bipartisan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I echo the comments of the senior Senator from Iowa. He is exactly \nright about the Dorgan amendment. There are a lot of reasons, as he \npointed out, why the Dorgan amendment makes sense for the American \npeople.\n  It makes sense for taxpayers because we pay way too much for \nprescription drugs as taxpayers. It makes sense for government \nprograms--whether it is TRICARE, whether it is Medicare, whether it is \nMedicaid, whether it is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. \nIt makes sense for small businesses and large businesses alike who are \npaying too much for prescription drugs. And it makes sense for seniors \nand all Americans who are paying too high a price for prescription \ndrugs out of their pockets. It also makes sense in terms of, sort of, \ninternationally as to what we do on the buying and selling of \nprescription drugs.\n  I was part of these discussions in the House where we had the same \namendment. We would pass it, and then it would die in the Senate, or \nthings would happen in the conference committees or whatever, where the \ndrug companies really did exert their influence over the Congress and \nwith the President during the Bush years.\n  But one of the arguments they always make is to question the safety \nof these drugs, that these drugs coming from Canada or these drugs \ncoming from France are not safe, as if they did not have a food and \ndrug administration as efficient and effective as ours in terms of \nprotecting the public.\n  But what sort of shoots a hole in that argument is how many American \ndrug companies--over and over and over, and in increasing numbers--how \nmany American drug companies are importing ingredients especially from \nChina.\n  Senator Kennedy, 1\\1/2\\ years or so ago, asked me to chair an \noversight hearing with the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee on this issue of what is happening when these American drug \ncompanies are increasing their outsourcing of jobs, particularly to \nChina. It was in response to what happened in Toledo, OH, among other \nplaces, where a number of Americans died because of contaminated \nheparin.\n  Heparin is a blood thinner drug that is a very important drug to keep \npeople healthier and live longer and live better. But some of the \ningredients for heparin were made in China, and the drug company is not \nable to trace back, if you will, the supply chain, where they are \ngetting their ingredients. They know they get them from China. The \nAmerican drug companies--whether it is Pfizer or another drug company--\nwhen they outsource their production to China, may know where the plant \nis that puts all these ingredients together, but they cannot trace \nback--or at least they will not tell us or cannot tell us--all their \ningredients. So they may get this ingredient from Wuhan, and this \ningredient from Shanghai, and that ingredient from a rural outpost in \nHebei or Henan Province, but they cannot tell us exactly where they \ncome from. So no wonder these drugs are not as safe as they should be.\n  So if they were interested in drug safety, it would not be that they \nwould stop us from drug importation because we know if we buy it from \nFrance or Canada or Germany, they have a food and drug agency, an FDA \nequivalent,\n\n[[Page S12872]]\n\nthat keeps their drugs safe. They know that. It is all about protecting \ntheir profits. There is simply no doubt about that. Their profits get \nto be bigger because they make some of these drugs in China.\n\n  So let's not have it both ways. Let's not say we cannot import drugs \nsafely into this country--when they are exporting jobs, as so many \nother industries are doing, to China, exporting jobs to little villages \nwhere they manufacture these ingredients. They end up in America's \nmedicine cabinets. Let's not talk out of both sides of our mouths, as \nthe drug industry is doing.\n  A couple other comments about the underlying bill and how important \nit is we move on this legislation. There are more than 400 people every \nday--in Defiance, OH, in Gallipolis and Zanesville and Saint \nClairsville and Cadiz and all over my State--400 people every single \nday who lose their insurance.\n  Every day my friends on the other side of the aisle delay, every day \nthey offer amendments and then will not let us vote on them, and stand \nup and object to even voting on things, every day they try to \nfilibuster, every day they put up another hurdle, 400 more people in my \nState lose their insurance. It is about 1,000 people in this country \nevery week--1,000 people in this country every week--who die because \nthey do not have health insurance. It is 45,000 people a year, so 900-\nsome people every week in this country die because they do not have \nhealth insurance.\n  A woman with breast cancer without insurance is 40 percent more \nlikely to die than a woman with breast cancer with insurance. I heard \nPresident Bush, in Ohio, maybe a couple years ago, say every American \ncan get health care. They can go to an emergency room. Well, a woman \nsuffering from breast cancer, who did not get a mammogram because she \ncould not afford it, did not get the kinds of tests she should have \nbecause she did not have a doctor she could afford to pay, and because \nshe did not have insurance--the emergency room does not do those kinds \nof things. Even if she got sick, the emergency room would not take care \nof her until she was almost dead. Then she could go into the emergency \nroom and they will take care of her in her last few days or her last \nfew weeks of life.\n  That is not the way we should do health care. This kind of delay, \nhearing these kinds of delaying actions, these kinds of delaying \ntactics, these kinds of ``we can't pass this,'' ``chicken little,'' \n``the sky is following''--every day we have Republicans coming down \nhere saying ``the sky is falling,'' and it simply is not.\n  I want this bill to be bipartisan. I am a member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, as is my friend, Senator \nRoberts from Kansas, who is in the Chamber. During that markup in June \nand July, we passed 160 Republican amendments. Some of them were major, \nsome of them were not so major. But this bill had a bipartisan flavor \nto it.\n  It is only on the big questions--the role of Medicare, the role of \nthe public option--some of the bigger questions, where there are \nphilosophical differences; the same reasons that back in the 1960s, \nwhen Medicare passed, it was passed almost only by Democrats because \nRepublicans did not agree there should be a major role in government in \nour health care system.\n  So it is a philosophical difference. It is not so much partisan as \nthat. So even though there are many good Republican ideas in this bill, \non the big questions there is that difference.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is so important--when I hear that many \nOhioans, every day, lose their insurance, this many Americans, every \nweek, die because they do not have insurance--to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised the Senate is in a \nquorum call.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will try it again. I thought it was worked out.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the second time that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded so I may be--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. So I may proceed for 15 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Is this a bipartisan objection, I would ask the \nPresiding Officer?\n  The bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that over the next \n30 minutes, the time be equally divided with 15 minutes for the \nmajority and 15 minutes for the minority for debate purposes only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the President. I rise today to talk about health \ncare in general and the latest proposal to come out in the form of the \nso-called compromise, if there is no objection. I wish to talk about \nthe latest proposal to come out from what some of us have determined is \nthe majority leader's behind-closed-doors effort for the compromise on \nthe government-run health insurance plan. I will admit very readily I \ndo not know all of the details of this plan, although I hope to in the \nvery near future. I think most of my friends across the aisle are in \nthe same boat and we are all getting our information from the Post, the \nTimes, and the rest of the catch-up media.\n  But this is the compromise, as I understand it: The majority leader \nwill drop the government plan in exchange for two major policies: \nfirst, a national insurance plan run by nonprofit insurance companies \nand supervised by the Office of Personnel Management; and second, a \nmassive expansion of Medicare to tens of millions of people age 55 and \nolder.\n  Putting aside the first policy which, frankly, I don't understand how \nit could possibly work, I cannot believe anyone is seriously \nconsidering expanding Medicare as a compromise to the government-run or \nso-called public option. It doesn't take a genius to see that a huge \nexpansion of Medicare is, as one single-payer advocate in the House \ndubbed it, ``the mother of all public plans,'' further quoting: ``An \nunvarnished and complete victory'' for advocates of single-payer health \ncare and socialized medicine. That is a very strong quote, but that is \nthe way it was.\n  In other words, this is not a compromise to the public option--it is \nworse. Maybe we need to remind ourselves why moving toward more \ngovernment control of our health care system is such a bad idea. We \nneed look no further than our current government-run insurance plans, \nMedicare and Medicaid, for examples. Government-run insurance plans \ncurrently control nearly half of the market. With the government's \npower, they have the ability to set payment levels for doctors and \nhospitals and home health care agencies and even hospices and all other \nhealth care providers, not based on the actual costs those providers \nincur when treating patients, but instead based on whatever arbitrary \nspending target the budget crunching bean counters determine the \ngovernment can afford.\n  To paraphrase one observer: These types of global government budgets \ntransform patients from sources of revenue over which providers compete \nto attract and serve, into sources of cost for the government to avoid, \nshunt off, and treat as cheaply as possible. That is not right. This \nhas clearly been the result in the Medicare Program, often heralded as \nthe best of all of the government's health care programs.\n  So to review: Medicare has been on an ever shrinking path toward \nbankruptcy for years. The latest reports\n\n[[Page S12873]]\n\nfrom the Medicare trustees say the hospital insurance trust fund will \ngo broke within the next 8 years. The program has $38 trillion in \nunfunded liabilities. How has the government responded? By severely \nunderpaying Medicare providers and denying Medicare patients' claims. \nMedicare only pays doctors around 80 percent of their costs, and \nhospitals even lower.\n  Privately insured Americans pay a hidden tax of nearly $90 billion a \nyear to make up for these underpayments. But even that hasn't been \nenough to keep some providers in business and able to afford to accept \nMedicare patients. Medicaid is even worse. Medicare is also a huge \ndenier of claims. I think many of my colleagues would be surprised to \nhear that Medicare denies claims more often than most private insurance \ncompanies. In fact, in 2008, Medicare had the highest percentage and \nthe highest number of denied claims in the country. Think about that \nwhen you hear some Senators demonize private insurance companies for \ndenying claims. Medicare is even worse.\n  This bill already exacerbates these Medicare problems by cutting \nalmost $\\1/2\\ trillion from this already woefully underfunded program. \nNow we are considering adding even more people. This is a sinking ship \nwith no lifeboats, and we are adding more folks to the deck.\n  By underpaying health care providers and denying claims, Medicare \nalready rations health care. Expanding Medicare to tens of millions of \nnew people as envisioned by this compromise we hear about will take \ngovernment rationing to a whole new level. Because as the government \ntakes over more of the health care system and becomes responsible for \nmore of the increasing costs of that system, the only way it will be \nable to afford this commitment is to ration health care. As I have said \ncountless times before, this bill gives the government all the tools it \nrequires to ration care.\n  From Comparative Effectiveness Research, to the independent Medicare \nadvisory board, to the new powers granted to the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, CMS and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, \nthis bill puts the rationing infrastructure into place. The U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force's recent change to its guidelines \npertaining to mammograms was a perfect illustration of how your health \ncare will be rationed under this bill. For those who don't know, the \ntask force recently reversed its longstanding advice that women should \nstart getting regular mammograms to detect breast cancer at age 40.\n  Why is this important? Because under this bill, the recommendations \nof this task force will carry the weight of law for both government-\nrun--i.e., Medicare--and private insurance. If the task force \nrecommends a particular treatment or a particular set of patients, then \nMedicare and private insurers must cover it. If it doesn't, they don't.\n  What do you think will happen to treatments and tests that don't get \nthe task force's recommendation? They simply will not be covered. That \nis how the government will hold down health care costs, by rationing \naccess to treatments and tests such as mammograms.\n  Some government-controlled health care systems such as the one that \nexists in the United Kingdom are much more explicit about rationing. \nThe rationing in this bill, quite frankly, is not as honest. Since \nAmericans would never stand for the government explicitly rationing \ntheir health care, the authors of this bill had to come up with a \npseudoscientific justification for rationing, and that justification is \nthe main feature of this bill: Comparative Effectiveness Research, or \nCER.\n  Very generally, it is very simple. CER is the comparison of two or \nmore treatment options to see which one is better. Sounds great, right? \nExcept when you realize that CER is not being conducted for the purpose \nof improving patient care but for the purpose of saving the government \nmoney instead.\n  I read the CER section of the bill and I remember my amendment on CER \nand the distinguished chairman of the HELP Committee was very helpful, \nand said he would study it overnight. Because I had the word \n``prohibit'' in the amendment we got into a great debate on what \nprohibit means. I thought it was pretty clear but, unfortunately, that \nwas dropped from the bill, from the HELP Committee bill. We tried that \nagain in Finance. It didn't work. We would like to try it again if we \nhave time.\n  This bill establishes a CER institute to conduct this research for \nthe purpose of justifying government rationing of health care. CER will \nbe the golden ring of rationing.\n  So what we have here is a recipe for disaster: a bill that already \nsignificantly weakens the woefully underfunded Medicare Program and \nlays the foundation for a rationing infrastructure, plus a \n``compromise'' that apparently will pour millions of more people into \nthe program.\n  In the no-holds barred search for a proposal that can attract 60 \nvotes, I don't understand how any Senator can support this idea.\n  This is just another Trojan horse, another incremental step toward \nthe single-payer system. Again, as one House Member in the leadership \nobserved:\n\n       This gets not only the camel's nose under the tent, but his \n     whole head and neck, too.\n\n  It is another step toward socialized medicine and increased \ngovernment rationing of health care.\n  The American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, and \nthe Federation of American Hospitals are finally taking notice of the \nadvice they are receiving from their State and local hospitals and \ndoctors. They, finally, have seen the light and have come out in \nopposition to this deal at least.\n  I urge my friends across the aisle to resist this latest misguided \nattempt at deal making. The consequences are too dangerous.\n  There is an awful lot of cactus in this health care world. I don't \nthink we need to sit on each and every one of them.\n  Before yielding back my time, I truly thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut for his comity and allowing me to make these debate \ncomments. I thank the acting Presiding Officer in his effort to be \nbipartisan.\n  I think we will have a sad day in this body if one side or the other \ngets into a situation where we do not allow people to make remarks on \nnot only the pending bills and specifically on the general issue of \nhealth care.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, he raises an interesting point. \nI am going back several months. As we get older, it is hard enough to \nremember what happened yesterday. The Presiding Officer is on the \ncommittee, as is my colleague from Vermont. There was a debate over the \nword ``construed'' to prohibit. I remember that word, talking about \nvarious practices. As I recall, the compromise that was offered either \nby my friend and colleague from Kansas or some other member was to \nstrike the word ``construed,'' so nothing would be prohibited. I still, \nto this day, am not quite sure why we should not accept language that \neliminates the word ``construed.'' That went on for about a day back \nand forth. I invite my colleague, again, to maybe get our staffs \ntogether and talk about that. I don't think he is wrong about this. I \nthink it is good to have best practices. If a physician and patient \ndecide, as a certainty, it is essential for that patient, then you \nshould not be prohibited from doing that. As I recall, the debate was \nover the word ``construed.'' I don't want to take time from the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. I point out \nthat in the specifics of the bill, I think it says shall not, in regard \nto cost containment on Medicare A and B, but the rest is encouraged. \nThat is where we get into problems because CER is the blueprint on how \nwe allot health care dollars in this country.\n  I might mention to the Senator, I had a chart on what CER \nrecommended, and it had a figure of a humpback whale and how much money \nwe would be devoting to different age groups. If you are 60--and, by \nthe way, the average age of the Senate is 62--you are out of luck. If \nyou are 70, you better get something fixed real quickly before this \nbill passes. That is my point. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Roberts for his amendment in \nthe HELP Committee to protect patients by preventing rationing of \nhealth care. That is in the Senate bill. That was language we adopted, \nI say to my friend from Vermont. It was a Roberts amendment that was \nadopted in\n\n[[Page S12874]]\n\nour markup that prohibits any rationing of health care in our bill. I \nthank him for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, when Republicans controlled the White \nHouse, the Senate, and the House, they had the opportunity to do \nsomething about the health care disaster in America. From 2000 to 2008, \nsome 7 million Americans lost their health insurance. Where were the \nRepublicans? During that same period, health care costs soared in \nAmerica. Small businesspeople found themselves unable to provide health \ncare to their workers.\n  Where were our Republican friends? I am delighted they are down on \nthe floor every single day criticizing an effort to try to improve the \nsituation. But it might have been a little better if they were here 8 \nyears ago, bringing forth their ideas. But they were not.\n  Having said that, let me suggest that in the midst of this health \ncare crisis, in which 46 million Americans have no health insurance and \nhealth care costs are soaring and, as the President indicates, that \nwill double in 8 years if we do nothing, at a time when 45,000 \nAmericans this year will die because they don't get to a doctor when \nthey should, when close to 1 million Americans are going to go bankrupt \nfrom medically related bills, we need real health care reform.\n  That is something that I, and I know many other Members in Congress, \nhave been fighting for for years. More than anything, I wish to see us \npass strong health care reform. I must express a disagreement with some \nof my colleagues on the Democratic side, who think we are on the 2-yard \nline, we are almost there. I don't think so. I think there are a number \nof problems that remain in this legislation that have to be resolved. I \nwish to touch on a few of them.\n  One of the parts of this legislation is that, finally, we are going \nto add some 30 million Americans to health care insurance. That is a \ngood thing. About half of them will be added to an expanded Medicaid--a \nhuge expansion of Medicaid. But here is my concern. Right now, our \nprimary health care system is extremely weak. Everybody knows we don't \nhave enough primary health care doctors. We know that Medicaid, today, \nis on wobbly legs as it tries to take care of the people who access \nthat program. I am not quite sure how you add 15 million more people to \nMedicaid if you don't have a primary health care infrastructure to \naccommodate their needs.\n  In this regard, I have fought very hard for authorization language in \nthe Senate to greatly expand community health centers and the National \nHealth Service Corps, for which we will train and make sure that we \nhave the primary health care doctors, dentists, and nurses we need, \ndesperately need.\n  In the House bill, there is language introduced by Representative \nClyburn, supported by the Democratic leadership, that would provide $14 \nbillion over a 5-year period to expand community health centers, enable \ntens of millions more to access health care, and make sure we have the \nprimary health care doctors and dentists we need.\n  It would be a cruel hoax to tell people they now have health \ninsurance--Medicaid or another program--but not create a situation by \nwhich they can get into the doctor's office. I fear that may happen. I \nam going to fight as hard as I can to make sure we have the primary \nhealth care infrastructure we need. That means, in the Senate, \nadopting the language that currently exists in the House bill for $14 \nbillion over a 5-year period--money which, according to a variety of \nstudies, will pay for itself as we keep people out of the emergency \nroom and keep people from getting sicker than they otherwise should be \nand ending up in a hospital. This makes a lot of sense. Community \nhealth centers have had wide bipartisan support. We have to support the \nHouse language.\n\n  On another issue, I found it interesting that my friend from Kansas, \na moment ago, was denouncing the United Kingdom's health care system, \ndenouncing socialized medicine, single payer. Well, I got a little \nconfused by my Republican friends, who have been in Congress, saying: \nWe love Medicare. My word, do we love Medicare. We are very angry that \nthose Democrats are trying to cut back on that.\n  Republicans who, year after year, wanted to privatize Medicare, this \nweek they love it. If they love it so much, why don't they join us in \ntrying to expand Medicare and address some of the problems in Medicare? \nLet's work together.\n  Last week, we were criticized, but now, I guess, the tune has changed \na little. Get your act together, my Republican friends. Either you \ncontinue the line you have had for many years about detesting Medicare \nbecause it is a single-payer health care program, a government health \ncare program--that is what it is, a single-payer government health care \nprogram. You have been on the floor defending it all week long, until a \ncouple days ago.\n  I support Medicare. In fact, what I believe and am fighting for is a \nMedicare-for-all, single-payer program because, at the end of the day, \nI disagree with many on this side of the aisle. I think, at the end of \nthe day, the only way you are going to provide comprehensive universal \nhealth care to all Americans, in a cost-effective manner, is through a \nMedicare-for-all, single-payer system, which ends the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of bureaucracy and waste engendered by the private \ninsurance companies.\n  One of my concerns, as we seem to be hurtling down the finish line, \nis I don't know who is going to be able to offer amendments. I have an \namendment that speaks to what millions of Americans want, including the \nPhysicians for a National Health Program--17,000 doctors, mostly \nprimary health care doctors but not exclusively. They want to see this \ncountry have a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system. I understand I am \nnot going to get very many Republicans supporting that amendment--or \nany Republicans. I also understand I will get few enough Democrats \nsupporting that amendment. In the years to come, we are going to have a \nMedicare-for-all, single-payer system. I want that debate on the floor \nof the Senate. I have offered an amendment and I want to have that \ndebated. I don't need 20 hours or 5 days. I would love to discuss that \nissue with my Republican friends.\n  Democrats, I think it is an amendment that has a right to be offered \nand it should be. I understand that will not pass. I will tell you what \ncould pass and what could have Republican support, it is the provision \nI have been working on that at least says that in our Federalist \nsystem, where each State learns from other States, at least give States \nthe option. If the Governor or the legislature wants to go forward with \na single-payer model; maybe it works, maybe it doesn't work. I have the \nfeeling if one State--whether it is Vermont, California, Pennsylvania, \nStates that have strong single-payer movements, a lot of support for \nthat concept--if one State does it well, then other States will be \nsaying we want the same thing. It is a cost-effective way to provide \ncomprehensive health care to all our people.\n  I want to touch on another issue, where I think my colleagues in the \nSenate are wrong and my former colleagues in the House are right. This \nis an issue the occupant of the chair has worked on with me. We held a \npress conference this morning. It is to understand this legislation is \ngoing to cost between $800 billion and $1 trillion.\n  How do you get the money? Well, the Senate bill contains a tax on \nhealth insurance benefits. I think that is wrong. I think that is \nregressive. It is called a tax on Cadillac plans. Given the soaring \ncost of health care in America today, what may be a Cadillac plan today \nwill be a junk car plan 5 years from now. Millions of Americans are \ngoing to be forced to pay taxes on their health care benefits or else \ntheir employer will cut back on those benefits, and they are going to \nhave to pay out of their own pockets. That is wrong. It is a regressive \nand unfortunate and unfair way to raise the revenue we need.\n  Our friends in the House did the right thing. They said that \nmillionaires should be asked to pay a little bit more in taxes to make \nsure we expand health care coverage in this country. I support what our \nfriends in the Senate and the House did, and I disagree with what is in \nthe Senate bill. There will be a poll coming out this afternoon in \nwhich 70 percent of the American people, as I understand it, disagree \nwith the tax on\n\n[[Page S12875]]\n\nhealth care benefits. They understand that is a tax on the middle \nclass.\n  Let's be clear. We are in a terrible recession now. Working families \nare struggling. It is wrong for us to propose a tax on health care \nbenefits, which in a few years will be impacting millions of middle-\nclass workers. We should follow what the House has done and say to \npeople at the top--millionaires who have received huge tax breaks under \nPresident Bush--that they have to pay a little bit more in taxes so we \ncan provide health care to all our people.\n  There is a lot in the bill in the Senate that makes a lot of sense to \nme. I congratulate Senator Dodd and Senator Baucus and all those people \nand their staffs who have worked so very hard on this bill. We have 31 \nmillion more people who will get insurance. There is insurance reform \ndealing with preexisting conditions. We made progress in disease \nprevention. There are a lot of good things in it.\n  I want to be very clear: I do not think we are at the 2-yard line. I \nthink a lot of work has to be done to improve this bill. We need to, as \nI mentioned a moment ago, make major improvements in primary health \ncare. We need to change how we fund many parts of the expansion of \ninsurance and do away with the tax on health care benefits. We have to \ngive States the option, the flexibility to go forward with a single-\npayer system if that is what they want to do.\n  Also, I hope very much that this afternoon we will vote and adopt the \nreimportation prescription drug legislation championed by Senator \nDorgan. It is an absurdity in this country that we remain the country \nthat pays by far the highest prices in the world for prescription \ndrugs. When I was in the House, I was the first Member of Congress, as \nI understand it, to take Americans over the Canadian border. Back \nthen--10, 15 years ago--women were able to purchase the breast cancer \ndrug Tamoxifen for one-tenth the price they were forced to pay in the \nUnited States. I know the drug companies are very powerful. I know they \nhave a lot of influence in this institution. But I hope we can do the \nright thing and provide affordable medicine to all Americans through \nreimportation. And I hope we can adopt that amendment.\n  I did want to say I have some very serious concerns about this \nlegislation, and I hope they will be addressed in the coming days and \nweeks. I very much want to be able to vote for this bill, but I am not \nthere now, not by any means.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, at the end of the day, Americans don't care \nif a health reform proposal originated with a Democrat or a Republican, \nwhat matters to them is that it works. That is why I am proud to join \nforces with Senator Collins to offer commonsense amendments that will \nhold down premium costs and make health care more affordable for \nAmerican families and their employers. As I have long said, the best \nway to hold down health care costs and make insurance companies \naccountable is to put Americans in the driver's seat and empower them \nto pick the plan that best fits their needs.\n  Along with Senator Collins, I am proposing as amendments to the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act three amendments that will \nimprove the Senate bill by doing more to hold down premium increases \nfor all Americans while expanding health care choices for more \nAmericans and their employers. Our amendments are as follows:\n  First, we are offering an amendment to provide more choices for \nemployers and workers. While the current Senate legislation will \neventually make it possible for employers to insure their workforce in \nthe new health insurance exchanges, the legislation does not contain a \nmechanism to make it possible for employers to offer their workers the \nability to choose any plan offered in the exchange. This Wyden-Collins \namendment would correct that by making it possible for employers--who \nwant to offer their employees the full range of choices in the \nexchange--to do just that while increasing competition in the new \nmarketplace.\n  Under the amendment, any employer that sponsors a health plan would \nhave the option to offer tax-free vouchers to its workers equal to the \namount the employer contributes to its own health plan. Workers could \nthen use that voucher to purchase the exchange plan that works best for \nthem and their family. If a worker decides to purchase a less-expensive \nplan, the worker would keep the savings as added income just as workers \nwanting to purchase more generous plans in the exchange will be able to \npay the additional cost out of pocket. Whatever employers pay for \nvouchers will remain tax deductible for employers and tax free for \nemployees and while no employer will be required to offer vouchers \nunder the new system, in order to encourage participation, employers \nwho want to offer their employees tax-free vouchers will be given \naccelerated access to the new health insurance exchanges. Under the \namendment, any employer offering its workers vouchers would have access \nto the exchange in 2015 rather than 2017, which is the schedule for \nemployer access in the bill.\n  Our second amendment offers more choices to individuals and families \nin the insurance exchanges. This amendment will make it possible for \nindividuals who are not eligible for a subsidy to purchase a \ncatastrophic plan, regardless of age. Catastrophic plans will typically \nhave much lower premiums than other plans offered through the exchange \nbut subscribers will pay for most of their health care expenses out of \npocket up until they exceed their plan's catastrophic limit.\n  Americans should have the choice to purchase more affordable \ncoverage, if that is what works best for them. Under the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, individuals up to the age of 30 are \neligible to purchase these plans. This Collins-Wyden amendment will \nextend that option to individuals--not receiving government subsidies--\nover the age of 30. This amendment would give consumers more choice and \nhelp ensure that more people can purchase coverage that fits their \nneeds and is affordable to them.\n  The amendment includes aggressive disclosure requirements that will \nrequire catastrophic subscribers to certify that they understand the \nterms of the coverage and know that they are purchasing the lowest \nlevel of coverage available.\n  Finally, we are sponsoring an amendment to help hold down premium \nincreases for consumers. Starting in 2010, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act will impose an annual fee on insurance companies \nbased on the number of premiums written each year. This Wyden-Collins \namendment will modify that fee to create an incentive for insurers to \nhold down rates. So, for example, insurance companies that hold down \npremium increases will pay lower fees, while insurers who jack up their \npremiums will pay much higher fees. Starting in 2010 the fee will be \nvaried by as much as 50 percent based on how aggressively insurers \ncontrol costs which will give them a strong incentive to hold the line \non overhead, executive salaries, provider payments, and inefficiency. \nAs under the bill, the total amount of the annual fee will be $6.7 \nbillion per year.\n  I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support these \nbipartisan, commonsense amendments.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as more American families struggle in the \nface of job loss and rising health care costs, the urgency with which \nthe Senate health care debate must progress is clear.\n  Americans feel a growing insecurity about the future of their family \nand the future of our country. The recent economic crisis demonstrated \nthe interconnectedness of Wall Street and Main Street. It confirmed \nwhat we already knew: that the strength and stability of our economy is \nintimately tied to the welfare of working families and our ability to \ndirect spending down a more sustainable path.\n  In 2008, the United States spent $2.4 trillion on health care. By \n2018, national health spending is expected to almost double, reaching \n$4.4 trillion and comprising 20 percent of our economy. If the growth \nof health care costs is not addressed, America's economy won't be able \nto keep up and more jobs will be lost, wages will drop, and health care \nbenefits will be cut.\n  In addition to the unsustainable growth of health care costs, further \nfaults in our current health care system leave millions of Americans \none illness or job loss away from losing their health care benefits. \nGuaranteed access to affordable and meaningful health benefits would \nprovide Americans with the security they deserve.\n\n[[Page S12876]]\n\n  I recently heard from Brad and Joanne in Goodwin, SD. Brad is a \ncancer survivor and Joanne is a heart attack survivor. They had health \ninsurance coverage at the time of their illnesses but still carry \nmedical debt. After the economy forced the plant Joanne worked for to \nclose in October 2008, she fell back on the health insurance coverage \noffered by Brad's employer. She relies on medication to manage her \nheart health and Brad requires regular checkups to make sure he stays \ncancer-free. In March of this year, the family hit hard times again \nwhen Brad's employer downsized and he was laid off.\n  Today, Brad and Joanne are still unable to find work and their \nunemployment benefits are set to run out at the end of the year. Even \nif they could find an insurance policy that approved them for coverage \ndespite their pre-existing conditions, the price of health insurance in \nthe individual market is far beyond their reach. So Joanne pays \nentirely out-of-pocket for her pricey heart medication and Brad can't \nafford to visit his doctor as often as he should. They do not know what \nthey will do in the event they suffer another medical emergency or if \ntheir unemployment benefits run out before they are able to secure a \nnew job.\n  Joanne and Brad's story illustrates the insecurity of many American \nfamilies who are one job loss away from losing access to the health \ncare they need. While South Dakota has been fortunate not to have as \nhigh of unemployment rate as other parts of the country, the economic \ncrisis has put more and more South Dakotans on unsteady financial \nfooting.\n  It is estimated that over 88 percent of South Dakotans have health \ninsurance. This too is an impressive figure compared with other states, \nbut it does not paint the whole picture. Nearly 61 percent of South \nDakotans either purchase health insurance in the individual market or \nhave coverage through their employer. These families are at risk of \nlosing their coverage for reasons out of their control, such as those \nexperienced by Brad and Joanne.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will guarantee these \nfamilies access to affordable health insurance through life's ups and \ndowns. Insurers will be barred from denying coverage for pre-existing \nconditions, discriminating based on gender or medical history, and will \nnot be able to drop your coverage the moment you become ill and need \ncostly treatment. New health insurance exchanges in every state will \nprovide a menu of quality, affordable health insurance plans for the \nself-employed and those not offered coverage through their employer. \nFamilies who need assistance will be eligible for tax credits to make \nthe plan of their choice affordable.\n  These commonsense solutions will give every American one less thing \nto worry about when they get sick, change or lose their job. As we \ncontinue to work out the details of health care reform, let us keep in \nmind the American families who are struggling to make ends meet in the \nface of job loss and rising health care costs. When we think of them, \nthe urgency of health care reform is clear.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/10/senate-section/article/S12876-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12876-S12904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n              APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to proceed to the conference report \nto accompany H.R. 3288, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed for a moment here prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my good friend the majority \nleader, we have been anxious to have health care votes since Tuesday, \nand we have had the Crapo amendment pending since Tuesday. You have \nsaid repeatedly, and I agree with you, that the health care issue is \nextraordinarily important and that we should be dealing with it and \ndebating it.\n  So it is my hope that somehow, through our discussions both on and \noff the floor, we can get back to a process of facilitating the \noffering of amendments on both sides of the aisle at the earliest \npossible time and we can get back to the health care bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to respond through the Chair to \nmy distinguished colleague.\n  I think it is pretty evident to everyone here not only what has \nhappened here on the Senate floor but the statements that have been \nmade publicly and privately. And certainly I am not going to discuss \nany private conversations I have had, but based on Rush Limbaugh and \nGlenn Beck, which is on all the news today, they are upset at Senator \nMcConnell because he is not opposing the health care bill enough--that \nin a reasonable process on this, there are no efforts being made to \nimprove this bill, only to kill this bill.\n  I think the debate has come to a point that I have rarely seen in the \nSenate. In fact, I have never seen it. To have my friends on the other \nside of the aisle come to the floor and in some way try to embarrass or \ndenigrate me by virtue of the fact that--in fact, trying to embarrass \nme. What they should understand is that any events I had scheduled for \nthis weekend have been canceled. Events I had last weekend had been \ncanceled--four or five of them. To say the least, I would never, ever \nintentionally come to the floor and try to talk to somebody about \nhaving had a fundraiser and that is why they are trying to get out of \nhere.\n  The reason I laid out to the Senate what I thought was a reasonable \nschedule is because, procedurally, we are where we are. The rules of \nthe Senate are such that once cloture is invoked, that is what you stay \nwith. I thought it would be appropriate, because we have worked pretty \nhard here, to have a day or two off. Anything that was reasonable, I \nwould be happy to deal with everyone. But there was no result from \nthis. Everything that can be done to stall and to divert attention from \nthis bill is being done. And that is too bad, because it is important \nlegislation.\n  Today, 14,000 Americans will lose their health insurance. Between now \nand 3:30, a number of people will die as a result of having no health \ninsurance. So we are engaged in some important stuff; as pundits have \nsaid, some of the most important legislation that has ever been in this \nbody.\n  So I am going to proceed to follow the rules of the Senate, and I am \nsorry we haven't been able to work with the Republicans in a \nconstructive fashion on this health care bill, but it is obvious we \nhaven't.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nrespond briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I reiterate to my good friend from \nNevada, all I said was the Crapo amendment has been pending since \nTuesday. We would like to vote on amendments. There has been some \ndifficulty, apparently, in coming up with a side by side to the Crapo \namendment. I understand that. But I am perplexed that it would take 2 \ndays to come up with a side by side.\n  This, as has been stated by my good friend the majority leader, is \nthe most important issue--some have said in history. It has been \nequated with a variety of different monumentally important pieces of \nlegislation in American history. All we are asking is the opportunity \nto offer amendments and get votes. I said it in a most respectful way \nand meant it in a most respectful way. I think it is pretty hard to \nargue with a straight face that we are not trying to proceed to amend \nand have votes on this bill. That is what we desire to do.\n  The majority leader certainly has the right to move to the conference \nreport. He has now done that--or we are about to vote on doing that. \nAll I suggested was we would like to get back on the health care bill \nas soon as we can, resume the debate process on what has\n\n[[Page S12877]]\n\nbeen described on an issue of historic importance, and let Senators \nvote, which is what we do here in this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Kentucky that I have \nan event I am going to now. I will vote and come back, and I will see \nif we can work something out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is my understanding we are now on the \nfiscal year 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act. I will have a lot to \nsay about this 3,000-page omnibus appropriations bill, but I would \npoint out to my colleagues that it is loaded down with 4,752 earmarks, \ntotaling $3.7 billion; six bills, totaling $450 billion; 1,351 pages \nlong, with 409 pages of earmarks. Spending on domestic programs is \nincreased by 14 percent. Veterans spending is increased by 5 percent. \nThat shows the priorities around here. Let me repeat that. Domestic \nspending programs are increased by 14 percent. Military construction \nand veterans spending is increased by only 5 percent.\n  Here we go again. Just a matter of months ago, in March, the Senate \npassed a monstrous $410 billion, 3,000-page omnibus appropriations bill \nthat was loaded up with over 9,000 earmarks. At that time, those of us \nwho complained about the ridiculous amount of waste were ignored. In \nfact, the President's Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \nPeter Orszag, said in an interview that ``this is last year's business. \n. . . We want to just move on''--a truly remarkable statement coming \nfrom the man the President put in charge of the government's budget.\n  In March, the majority leader placed the blame for the omnibus \nspending bill at the feet of President Bush. Senator Reid said:\n\n       . . . we have a lot of issues we need to get to after we \n     fund the Government--something we should have done last year \n     but we could not because of the difficulty we had working \n     with President Bush.\n\n  So what is the excuse this time? Where will the blame be placed now? \nIs the majority leader having difficulty working with President Obama? \nWe have had all year to work on 12 annual spending bills, and we only \nenacted 5 of them through the regular order, and 1 of those 5 was \npassed and sent to the President before the new fiscal year began.\n  We should be embarrassed by this process. Here we go again--faced \nwith a whopping 1,350-page omnibus appropriations conference report, \nwhich contains six bills, spends $450 billion, and is loaded up with \n4,752 earmarks, totaling $3.7 billion. Meanwhile, people are out of \njobs, they are out of their homes, unemployment in my home State is 17 \npercent, and we are going to spend money on things such as $2.7 \nmillion--get this; I am not making it up--$2.7 million for supporting \nsurgical operations in outer space--supporting surgical operations in \nouter space--at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE; \n$30,000 for Woodstock Film Festival Youth Initiative; $13.9 million for \nfisheries in Hawaii--the list goes on and on and on and on--$200,000 to \nrenovate and construct the Laredo Little Theatre.\n  We should not be spending American taxpayer dollars to replace worn \nauditorium seating and soundproofing materials. The list goes on and on \nand on: $800,000 for jazz at the Lincoln Center; $3.4 million for a \nrural bus program in Hawaii--you will note that Hawaii pops up all the \ntime here--$1.6 million to build a tram between the Huntsville \nBotanical Garden and the Marshall Flight Center in Alabama; $750,000 \nfor the design and fabrication of exhibits to be placed in the World \nFood Prize Hall of Laureates in Iowa.\n  I am not making these up. This is the same party and President that \npromised to scrub each one of these appropriations bills and get rid of \nthe unnecessary ones.\n  So we will be talking a lot about this bill. But I want to point out \nagain what is before us to the American people: six bills--not one--six \nbills, totaling $450 billion; 409 pages of earmarks, 4,752 earmarks, \ntotaling $3.7 billion; and spending on domestic programs is increased \nby 14 percent; MILCON and veterans spending is increased by 5 percent.\n  I have met recently with the Governor of my State. We are suffering \nunder incredible economic difficulties. We are having the greatest \nfinancial crisis in the history of my State. Couldn't they use some of \nthis $3.7 billion in earmarks to pay for some of the essential services \nthat are having to be cut back, not only in my State but all over \nAmerica? No. The beat goes on. It is business as usual here in \nWashington.\n  And do not be surprised at the anger of the American people over this \nway of doing business--bills 1,351 pages long, filled with earmarks and \npork that have nothing to do with the betterment of our Nation.\n  So we will be talking a lot more about many of these porkbarrel \namendments that are in it. But it is awful: $200,000 for ``design and \nconstruction of the Garapan Public Market'' in the Northern Mariana \nIslands. We will be hearing a lot more about it.\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senator mentioned that for these seven bills, the \nyear-over-year increase in spending is 12 percent. Does the Senator \nfrom Arizona know what the CPI this last year was?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The CPI was minus 1.3 percent, not to mention 10 percent \nunemployment in America, not to mention people not being able to stay \nin their homes, not to mention the hardest economic conditions in \nhistory, certainly, since the Great Depression.\n  Spending on domestic programs is increased by 14 percent. What brings \nthat down to 12 percent is they only increased veterans spending--\nveterans spending--by 5 percent. But opera houses, rural bus programs, \nmusic programs--$300,000 for music programs at Carnegie Hall. Do you \nthink Carnegie Hall needs $300,000 for music programs?\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator will yield for another question, do any of \nthese numbers the Senator is talking about--this 12-percent increase in \nspending in these seven appropriations bills over\n\n[[Page S12878]]\n\nthe previous year, at a time when families across this country are \nbeing asked to tighten their belts, small businesses are tightening \ntheir belts; as the Senator said, we have record unemployment--do these \nnumbers include the almost $1 trillion that was spent earlier this year \nin the stimulus bill?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The stimulus bill has nothing to do with that, I would \nsay to my colleague, and we all know that. This is entirely new, six \nappropriations bills, totaling nearly $450 billion which, by the way, \nthe majority leader wanted to pass by unanimous consent. Remarkable.\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to my colleague and friend from Arizona, that is a \n12-percent year-over-year increase and the five bills that have already \npassed had increases that were in the teens in terms of the year-over-\nyear increases too. I do not know how, when you pass a $1 trillion \nstimulus bill, much of which was distributed to Federal agencies that \nare also going to get these year-over-year 12-percent, 14-percent, 15-\npercent increases in spending, we can justify that to the American \ntaxpayer or to hard-working Americans who are struggling right now to \nmake ends meet and have to balance their family budgets. States are \nstruggling to balance their budgets. But here in Washington, it seems \nas though it is spend, spend, spend.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would also respond to my friend, it has to be in the \ncontext of a revision over 10 years, recently, by the Office of \nManagement and Budget from a $10 trillion to a $12 trillion deficit. \nThe deficit for this year is $1.4 trillion, and I am not sure what it \nis next year. But they could not have known that in the Appropriations \nCommittee when they passed spending measures such as this.\n  The point is, in the face of massive, unprecedented deficits, \nunfunded liabilities in Social Security and Medicare, where we are \nasking Americans all over to tighten their belts--in my State essential \nservices are being cut because they do not have enough money--this is \nthe same business as usual that we have seen for years.\n  I saw a poll yesterday--it was in a Hotline poll or one of those--\nthat the approval rating of Members of Congress is below that of used \ncar salesmen. I have not met those who express their approval. So we \nshould not be surprised at some very interesting things that may take \nplace in the elections coming up this November. But it is unfortunate, \nthat is all.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to the Senator, one final point I would make is, of \nall that spending the Senator mentioned--and again the $1 trillion in \nstimulus money was all borrowed money; that was all added to the debt, \nwill be added to the debt, and is going to be paid for by our children \nand grandchildren, but the $1.4 trillion the Senator mentioned that \nlast year constituted the Federal deficit means that out of every \ndollar the Federal Government spent last year, 43 cents was borrowed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Forty-three cents. And do you know who they borrowed it \nagainst? Our kids and our grandkids. They are the ones who are going to \nhave to pay for it. I do not think I will. It is our kids and our \ngrandkids whom we are laying it on. This is a colossal act of \ngenerational theft that we have committed. And believe it or not, the \nAmerican people have figured it out.\n  Mr. THUNE. There is no question. The one thing that I guess is \nbothersome is most generations of Americans--your generation, \nobviously--worked hard, sacrificed so the next generation could have a \nbetter life. What we are basically doing is borrowing from the next \ngeneration because we have not been able to live within our means. That \nturns on its head one of the great ethics of America that has served \nthis country so well for generations. Washington, DC, has not learned \nthe lesson that when you borrow money, it has to be paid back, and that \nyou cannot spend more than you take in. Forty-three cents out of every \ndollar last year was borrowed--all to be put on the bills of our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3288), making appropriations for the Departments of \n     Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and \n     for other purposes, having met, have agreed that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree \n     to the same, signed by a majority of the conferees on the \n     part of the two Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the Record of December 8, 2009, \nbeginning at page H13631, Book II.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I know we have moved to the Omnibus \nappropriations bill to continue government, and the time is running out \nfor the current authorization bill, and this brings us back to the \nauthorization of spending, but it also takes us away from health care \nreform.\n  On this side of the aisle, we have been waiting for a long period of \ntime to vote on some amendments that are now before the Senate, such as \nthe Crapo motion which would send the bill back to committee to take \nout the tax increases that are in it. Then we also have the Dorgan \namendment. I can understand why maybe the majority does not want to \nvote on Republican amendments, but I sure don't understand why they \nwould object to voting on Senator Dorgan's amendment, a Democratic \namendment, because there have always been more Democrats than \nRepublicans for the Dorgan amendment, and quite frankly, I am in a \nposition where I agree with that amendment. I am a cosponsor of it. I \nthink we would have a great deal of bipartisan support for the Dorgan \namendment. But now we are just automatically away from the health care \ndebate and those amendments.\n  So I am wondering why we had to do this appropriations bill right \nnow. I think there is growing realization that maybe public reaction, \nnegative reaction to the legislation before us--remember that 2,074-\npage bill that is before us--the public is getting wise to what is in \nthat bill and there is objection to it, and maybe now the majority \nparty would like to have a little respite from that debate. So I \nthought I would come back to not the substance of the health care \nreform bill debate but to a lot of organizations that oppose it and why \nthey oppose it, just to keep the public's attention that we on this \nside of the aisle feel the health care issue is very important.\n  As I travel around Iowa, I hear a lot of concern about out-of-control \ngovernment spending. People are worried about all of the bailouts, the \nbanks, and the automakers, the automakers such as General Motors being \nnationalized. They are worried about the rising rate of unemployment, \nwhich is 10 percent now. They don't see how we will ever dig ourselves \nout of the deficit hole we are in, a deficit that has been increased by \n$1.3 trillion since President Obama's inauguration.\n  As Senator McCain just pointed out, the bill that has now come before \nthe Senate to fully fund the Federal Government has 12.5-percent \nincreases in it. From that standpoint, it seems to me we are getting \naway from a commonsense principle that we ought to use around here on \nspending, and that is that spending shouldn't eat up any more than the \neconomic growth of the tax base that is coming into the Federal \nTreasury to support that spending. Quite obviously, you can't have 12.5 \npercent increases in appropriations this year over last year, and last \nyear was 9 percent over the previous year. You just can't sustain that. \nCommon sense dictates against it. But what rules here in Washington is \njust a lot of nonsense.\n  So our constituents are confused. They are confused as to why, in the \nface of all these fiscal problems, some in Congress are now proposing \n$500 billion in tax increases. Tax increases are very bad for the \neconomy. It is more difficult to get out of the recession as\n\n[[Page S12879]]\n\nyou increase expenditures. They don't understand why some are proposing \nthe largest Medicaid expansion since the program's creation. They want \nto know why they are proposing $500 billion in Medicare cuts to create \nan entirely new entitlement program that this country can't afford.\n  Nowhere are these worries and this confusion more evident than among \nbusiness leaders of America because business is where jobs are created. \nGovernment does not produce wealth; government consumes wealth. So if \nyou want to expand the economy, you do it through the private sector. \nThat is where the resources of government come from. That is where the \nresources that sustain our people come from.\n  So whether it is a small business owner on Main Street or a CEO on \nWall Street, the message is clear: Stop spending, get the economy back \non track, and get people back to work.\n  Unfortunately, the health reform bill will not address any of these \ngoals. In fact, it may just do the opposite. Don't take my word for it. \nLet's take a look at what the groups that represent American businesses \nare saying.\n  Let's start with the Chamber of Commerce representing 3 million \nAmerican businesses. In a press release distributed November 19, 1 day \nafter the release of the Senate bill, the Chamber called the Senate \nbill a ``Missed Opportunity to Enact Meaningful Reform.'' That was \ntheir title.\n  Let me go to a specific quote:\n\n       This bill still contains a government-run plan and an \n     onerous employer mandate, it taxes working Americans, slashes \n     Medicare, spends over a trillion dollars--and after all \n     this--CBO tells us 24 million Americans will still not have \n     health insurance.\n\n  That doesn't sound like the kind of reform that is going to help get \nthe chamber members back on track hiring more workers so we can get \nthis unemployment down. It sounds as though they will end up being \nforced to pay higher taxes and cut jobs. I am not an economist, but \nthat certainly doesn't sound like a formula for getting this country \nout of the recession.\n  In fact, the chamber's press release says:\n\n       The Chamber believes the path to a healthier economy is to \n     cut taxes, not to raise them by $500 billion.\n\n  They go on to ask a question for which I still can't find an answer:\n\n       Why is there still no meaningful medical liability reform? \n     Is currying favor with the trial lawyers worth passing up $50 \n     billion in CBO verified savings?\n\n  I think it is pretty clear that the Chamber of Commerce doesn't think \nthis $2.5 trillion bill will cure what ails the U.S. economy.\n  Let's see what some other business groups have to say. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers put out a press release the same day as \nthe Chamber of Commerce, November 19. The National Association of \nManufacturers is the Nation's largest industrial trade association. \nTheir members build the machines that keep America running, so they \nshould know a little bit about how to get our economy running again. \nUnfortunately, they see Senator Reid's bill as a step in the wrong \ndirection. Like the Chamber and like pretty much every other business \ngroup, the National Association of Manufacturers has announced that \nthey cannot support the pending bill.\n  I find it hard to believe that some Senators who claim to be \nprobusiness can support a bill that is opposed by almost the entire \nbusiness community--or am I missing something? How can some Democrats \nwho claim to want to get people back to work support a bill that \neconomists from the far right to the far left say will reduce wages and \nincrease unemployment? It just doesn't seem to make sense.\n\n  Like other business groups, the National Association of Manufacturers \nis in favor of reform. Manufacturers realize that we need health reform \nto lower costs, increase access, and improve quality. But according to \ntheir press release, they cannot support a bill that will--this is \ntheir quote--``add massive financial burdens to businesses that are \nalready struggling in this recession.'' They go on to express deep \nconcern about huge tax increases that will hurt small business \nmanufacturers, and they are worried that both the so-called public \noption and the massive Medicaid expansion will just end up shifting \nmore costs and higher premiums to private businesses.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers ends their press release by \nsaying:\n\n       Oppose the majority leader's bill and urge Senators to do \n     the same as it raises costs and ultimately will destroy jobs.\n\n  Again, I find myself asking how someone can claim to be probusiness \nbut support a bill that is so strongly opposed by the business \ncommunity.\n  Let's take a look at what small businesses have to say. Maybe that is \nwhere the answer is. You have to remember that small businesses create \n70 percent of the net new jobs in America. In fact, it was Christina \nRomer, the President's top economic adviser, who said in a recent \nWebcast that health care reform will ``benefit small business--not \nburden it.''\n  Unfortunately, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the \nvoice of small businesses, doesn't seem to agree. After the release of \nSenator Reid's bill, the National Federation of Independent Businesses \nsaid this:\n\n       This kind of reform is not what we need to encourage small \n     business to thrive. We oppose the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act due to the amount of new taxes, the \n     creation of new mandates, and the establishment of new \n     entitlement programs.\n\n  Like the chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers, small \nbusinesses want and need reform, probably more so than even chamber \nmembers and the National Association of Manufacturers. But it doesn't \nsound as though the pending bill actually addresses the problems of \nsmall business. In fact, it sounds as though the pending bill simply \ncreates a host of new problems--problems at a time when this country is \ncoming back from the brink of the greatest economic downturn since the \nDepression.\n  The National Federation of Independent Businesses goes on to say:\n\n       There is no doubt all of these burdens will be paid for on \n     the backs of small businesses.\n\n  Over the coming weeks, I am sure some Senators are going to come down \nhere and talk about all of the benefits for small businesses that are \nin this bill. But in the interest of honest debate, I hope they will at \nleast mention in their remarks that despite all of the so-called \nbenefits, this bill is still opposed by the voices of America's small \nbusinesses. It is still opposed by the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses. I could go on and list about half a dozen other \nbusiness groups that oppose this bill. The Associated Builders and \nContractors, the Independent Electrical Contractors, the International \nFranchise Association, the National Association of Wholesalers, the \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Council, and the International Food \nService Distribution Association--all of these groups recognize the \ndevastating impact this bill will have on our economy.\n  We are facing the highest unemployment rate in 26 years. We have \nalready seen the national debt increase by $1.3 trillion since \ninauguration or per household $11,535. The pending bill misses the mark \non business' top priority, and that is lowering costs. Don't take my \nword for it. The Congressional Budget Office says the Reid bill bends \nthe Federal spending curve further upward by a net of $160 billion \nbetween 2010 and 2019.\n  For these reasons, the pending bill is opposed by these organizations \nI have quoted: the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber \nof Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, as well \nas almost every other business group based in Washington, DC, or maybe, \nfor all I know, they are based in other parts of the country, but they \nstill follow legislation here in this city, in the Congress.\n  The business community has spoken, and their message is loud and \nclear. For Senators who want to bend the growth curve down--and that is \nwhat we all set out to do, but we don't have a bill before us that does \nit--this bill is not the answer. For those Senators who want to get \npeople back to work, this bill is not the answer.\n  For those Senators who want to get this country's economy back on \ntrack, this bill is not the answer.\n  If you support American businesses--and American businesses are what \nprovide the income into the Federal Treasury, whether it is corporate \ntax or income tax--it seems to me that if you have pride in American \nbusinesses and the jobs they create, you cannot support this bill.\n\n[[Page S12880]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Washington \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to speak about \nthe Transportation-Housing title of the bill now before the Senate. \nThis is a bill that has broad bipartisan support because it addresses \nthe very real housing and transportation needs of American families \nacross the Nation.\n  There is a lot to be proud of in this conference report, and I am \npleased with what we have been able to accomplish working with my \ncolleague from across the aisle, Senator Bond, Chairman Olver on the \nHouse side, and Congressman Latham and all their staffs.\n  This bill makes needed investments in our transportation \ninfrastructure, creating critical jobs, while also supporting housing \nand services for our Nation's most vulnerable.\n  It ensures that two critical Federal agencies--departments that \ncommunities across the country depend on--have the resources they need \nto keep our commuters safe and our communities moving and prospering.\n  The bill before us touches the lives of Americans in ways they can \nappreciate each day. Because we are talking about transportation \nprojects and housing assistance, we are also talking about jobs and \nstemming a housing crisis that has contributed to our current economic \ntroubles.\n  Whether it is the parent who commutes every day and needs safe roads \nor new public transportation options so they can spend more time with \ntheir families or a business that depends on solid infrastructure to \nmove goods and attract customers or the young family searching for a \nsafe and affordable community in which to raise their children or the \nrecently laid-off worker who needs help to keep his or her family in \ntheir home, this omnibus bill before us has a real impact on Americans \nwho are struggling in these troubling economic times.\n  Our bill takes a balanced approach that addresses the most critical \nneeds we face in both transportation and housing, while remaining \nfinancially responsible and staying within the constraints of the \nbudget resolution.\n  I am especially pleased that the bill provides over $10.3 billion to \nsupport and expand public transit, which continues to see record growth \nin ridership.\n  The bill also includes $600 million for the competitive multimodal \nsurface transportation grant program, which supports projects making a \nsignificant impact on communities and regions--in addition to the over \n$41.8 billion included for our Nation's roads and bridges, which will \nsupport good-paying construction jobs and lead to safer and more \nreliable infrastructure.\n  These transportation investments are critical to supporting our \nNation's economy and creating good-paying jobs.\n  In addition to these important investments in transportation, the \nbill represents a firm commitment to provide critical housing and \nsupportive services to families most impacted by the economic crisis.\n  This bill includes increased funding for the section 8 program, which \nprovides housing for low-income families across the country. In \naddition, the bill increases housing programs for some of our Nation's \nmost underserved populations, such as the elderly, the disabled, and \nNative American communities.\n  Senator Bond and I are particularly proud that this bill includes $75 \nmillion for vouchers for the joint HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive \nHousing Program. That program will provide an additional 10,000 \nhomeless veterans and their families housing and supportive services. \nWe should all be very proud of the inclusion of that in the bill.\n  I am also pleased the bill includes more than $150 million for \nhousing counseling programs to help families avoid scams and stay in \ntheir homes, instead of facing foreclosure.\n  Our bill provides assistance to those who need it most, and it \ndirects resources in a responsible and fiscally prudent way.\n  It addresses the needs of families and businesses in every region of \nthe country--families who are looking for the Federal Government to \nstep up and provide solutions to everything from congestion solutions \nto transportation safety, to foreclosure assistance, to affordable \nhousing.\n  This bill helps our commuters, homeowners, and the most vulnerable in \nsociety. Most important, it will create jobs and support the continued \nrecovery of our national economy.\n  I hope we can get past the differences we have and move quickly to \nsend this bill to the President's desk.\n  Before I close, I thank all our Senate staff who worked extremely \nhard over this past year to move this bill forward to our subcommittee, \nthrough full committee, to the floor of the Senate, through conference \ncommittee, and now here at its final stop before it reaches the \nPresident's desk. They have worked many weekends and evenings putting \nthis together. These staff members are: Matt McCardle, John Kamarck, \nEllen Beares, Joanne Waszczak, Travis Lumpkin, Grant Lahmann, Michael \nBain, Dedra Goodman and Alex Keenan and especially Meaghan McCarathy \nand Rachel Milberg for their outstanding efforts to help us get this \nbill to the floor today. We are the ones who stand before everybody and \ntake credit for these bills, but it is our staffs who have helped us \nget here. I thank the staffs on both sides of the aisle for getting us \nhere today.\n  I urge our colleagues to get past our differences and move the bill \nquickly to the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I wish to speak on the Omnibus \nappropriations bills, to which we just moved, as well as to return and \nmake some comments on the health care legislation from which we just \nretreated.\n  First, regarding the Omnibus appropriations bill, I am very concerned \nabout the fact that, as my motion is pending on the health care bill, \ndealing with one of the more important issues; namely--the President's \npledge to make sure no one in America who makes less than $250,000 as a \ncouple or $200,000 as an individual will be required to pay for the \nunbelievably high cost of this bill.\n  While we were facing that amendment, the majority has decided they \nwill shift from the bill--I understand that is a tough vote to take \nbecause the bill contains so many hundreds of billions of dollars of \nnew tax increases that the American people squarely in the middle class \nwill be called upon to share. We should not have shifted from the \nhealth care debate to move to the Omnibus appropriations bill, not only \nbecause of the importance of the issues we are dealing with on the \nhealth care legislation but because of the Omnibus appropriations bill \nitself.\n  This Congress cannot control its appetite for spending. The \nappropriations bill we see before us now is called omnibus because it \npackages together seven of the original appropriations bills this \nCongress has been working on--and we are studying them to find out the \ndetails. But from the information I have received, the average rate of \ngrowth in spending in this bill overall--over those seven bills--is \nsomewhere between 12 percent and 14 percent growth in\n  Federal spending.\n  This Congress has generated a $1.4 trillion deficit in less than 12 \nmonths. For next year, we want to see Federal Government grow by \nanother 12 to 14 percent. That doesn't count the new stimulus package \nspending that is being talked about, and it doesn't count the \nspending--that almost $2.5 trillion in new spending--contemplated in \nthe health care legislation, and any number of other pieces of \nlegislation waiting in the queue to come before the Congress.\n  At some point, fiscal restraint has to return to Washington, DC. We \nhave not seen it here for far too long. I know it is very tempting to \njust say we can pile the debt on our children and grandchildren and \nspend what we want to spend today. There are those who say the only way \nwe can have a strong economy is to spend ourselves into prosperity. Yet \nit is not the government that creates jobs. It is the formation of \ncapital, the investment by small businesses and entrepreneurs in new \nideas and products, and the expansion of business in the United States \nthat will allow us to sustain a strong, healthy growth in our economy.\n  If we continue to rely on borrowing money from the future in order to\n\n[[Page S12881]]\n\nspend ourselves into prosperity, we will continue to see our national \ndebt mount to a point where it cannot be sustained. We are already at a \n$12 trillion national debt, a national debt that is projected to double \nover the next 10 years to $24 trillion. I object to moving off the \nhealth care bill, where we had such critical amendments and motions \npending. I object to moving to a bill that will now increase the \nspending of the Federal Government by 12 to 14 percent.\n  Let me shift for a moment and talk more about the health care bill. \nThe motion I had brought--the pending motion before the Senate--or it \nwas before we shifted off the health care bill--was a simple motion \nthat would have required the bill to be committed to the Finance \nCommittee, with instructions to the Finance Committee to take out those \nparts of the bill that impose a tax increase on people in the United \nStates who earn less than $250,000 as a couple or $200,000 as \nindividuals.\n  Very straightforward, it is exactly what the President pledged he \nwould do, on multiple occasions, to the American people. Yet we have \nshown there are almost $500 billion of taxes in the first 10 years of \nthis bill. If you look at the real first 10 years after the spending \nhas kicked in--the 2014 to 2023 time period--it is almost $1.2 trillion \nin new taxes, a huge portion of which falls on the middle class. The \nresponse has been that actually this bill is a net tax cut. How can \nthat be? The only way it can be claimed to be a tax cut is if you take \nthe subsidies in the bill--about $400 billion worth of them--which are \nused to provide people at lower income categories, who don't have \nadequate access to insurance, with a subsidy toward the purchase of \ninsurance and if you call that a tax cut. In the bill, it is actually \ncalled a renewable tax credit--even though $300 billion of the $400 \nbillion goes to individuals who do not pay taxes, do not have a tax \nliability, and it is scored by the CBO as spending, not tax relief. \nEven if you were willing to count that money as tax relief, then you \nwould have a situation in which 7 percent of the Americans would be \nreceiving these government subsidies, while the remainder would be \npaying the price--paying the taxes.\n  To put some numbers on that, out of 282 million Americans who have \ninsurance in America today--or will have in 2019--only 19 million would \nreceive this tax credit being talked about. Remember, the vast majority \nof them get what is called a tax credit, but it is a government subsidy \ngoing to those who have not generated a tax liability, and 157 million \nof the 282 million would be people who get health insurance through \ntheir employer and will not be eligible for that health insurance.\n  After you do all the numbers and take out the taxpayers who make less \nthan $250,000 a year as a couple or $200,000 as an individual, the \nbottom line is, after all those who are subsidized are taken out, there \nare still 42 million Americans in the middle class, as defined by the \nPresident, who will pay hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes.\n  My amendment would simply require that those taxes be taken out of \nthe bill, the President's pledge be honored in the bill, and the bill \nthen be put into a posture to return to the floor for further debate.\n  There is one other item I would like to talk about. One of the things \nthat is often said by the opponents of my amendment is that this bill \nactually drives down the spending curve.\n  When they say that, I wonder what curve they are talking about. Are \nthey talking about the size of government? No. The size of government \nunder this bill grows up by $2.5 trillion. Are they talking about the \ncost of health care? No. The CBO study indicated very clearly that at \nbest Americans will not see the cost of their health care go down. For \nthose in the most needy categories, the 17 percent of Americans who are \nin the individual market, their health insurance will actually go up by \n10 to 13 percent.\n  Are they talking about the Federal deficit? Actually, CBO says the \ndeficit will go down. That is not the size of the government, but that \nis the size of the debt or spending each year. But how does it go down? \nIt goes down only if you use the budget gimmicks that I will outline in \njust a minute or if you include all the taxes, the hundreds of billions \nof dollars of taxes that are in the bill, and if you count the Medicare \ncuts that are in the bill.\n  Take out any one of those--the nearly $500 billion of Medicare cuts, \nthe nearly $500 billion of taxes, or the budget gimmicks--and this bill \ndoes not drive the deficit curve down.\n  What are the budget gimmicks--and I will close with this--what are \nthe budget gimmicks about which I am talking? There are a number of \nthem. The biggest is that the proponents of the bill do not count the \nfirst 4 years of spending. If you look at the 10-year spending cycle of \nthe first 10 years of the first part of this bill, the taxes go into \neffect on the first day the bill is law, on January 1 of next year. The \nspending does not start until the year 2014.\n  So we have 10 years of taxes, 10 years of Medicare cuts, and 6 years \nof spending. That is how they are able to say it balances out. If they \nstarted the spending and the taxing on the same day and did not give \nthemselves a 4-year run of tax collection until they start the actual \nimplementation of the spending part of the bill, it would drive the \ndeficit down also.\n  All we need to do in this Senate is to slow down, refer the bill back \nto committee, have them fix the provisions on taxes, and then work on \nsome of the common ground we know we have that will help bend the \nspending curve down and will help improve the situation for Americans \nacross this country who are calling for us to control the skyrocketing \ncosts of health care.\n  It is my hope that as the Senate goes through the next few weeks of \ndebate on this legislation, as well as the other legislation we bring \nbefore us, we will remember our children and our grandchildren and all \nAmericans today who are calling for the kind of true health care reform \nthat will truly address the kind of fiscal responsibility and the kind \nof cost containment that we should be seeking in this Chamber.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I rise to reiterate exactly what my \ncolleague just said, that transparency with the American people on the \ncost of this plan is absolutely essential. If you are going to tax the \nAmerican people, tell them what you are going to tax. If you are going \nto cut their benefits, tell them what you are going to cut. Do not use \nsmoke and mirrors to create a panacea for the people down the road to \nfind out they have been sold a pig in a poke.\n  I want to talk about not what has been introduced but what has been \nreported in the press as to where we may go on this bill.\n  As many know, the bill that is under consideration that is supposed \nto reform health care is a bill that was crafted in a back office in \nthe Capitol where very few people participated, and those who did \nparticipate were only Democrats. It was not until it was rolled out on \nthe Senate floor that many of us had an opportunity to read the 2,074 \npages. If the American people are like I am, we are still working our \nway through section by section trying to figure out exactly what it \nsays and, more importantly, exactly what it means and, even more \nimportant than that, how does it affect me? How does it affect my \nfamily?\n  You see, health care is a very personal issue for everybody in this \ncountry. It is important that we display the honesty they expect from \nus. If, in fact, we are going to reform health care, then let's reform \nit. If we are going to do what we have done over the past several \nweeks, which is have a debate about coverage expansion, then let's be \nhonest with the American people. Who is going to pay for it?\n  We know how CBO looked at the bill and how it was designed by the \nmajority leader. They are going to steal $464 billion from Medicare. \nThat is a fact. Nobody disagrees with that. Madam President, $464 \nbillion would be stolen from Medicare which the Medicare trustees say \nwill be insolvent in 2017, a mere 8 years from now. I am not sure that \nis fiscal responsibility, but it is in the bill.\n  In the last 24 hours, the press reports the majority leader has sent \na new proposal to CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, because he is \nseeking to find out what that new proposal will cost. If the reports \nare correct, he has decided to drop the public option and to craft a \nnew coverage plan for some segment of\n\n[[Page S12882]]\n\nthe American people. Again, by news accounts only, that would be an \nexpansion of coverage for individuals in this country 55 to 64. I do \nnot know whether that is the entirety of the group. That is 24 million \nto 30 million people. The likelihood is if it were opened to any \nsegment, it would be like a magnet to those who probably had some type \nof health condition because if you do not have a health condition, the \nlikelihood is, in the open marketplace through your employer, if you \nare employed, you can find a reasonably priced plan. Automatically, the \nway we have designed it is we are going to attract the sickest of that \npopulation.\n  In the process of doing that, we have to pause for a moment and \nrealize that we have over 40 million seniors and disabled already in \nMedicare. It is a system that does not reimburse for 100 percent of the \nservices provided. In other words, for Medicare, we reimburse a doctor \nand a hospital less than it costs them to deliver the service. \nNationally, we have accepted that because in that system, when a senior \ngoes in under Medicare and gets a service, what is not reimbursed is \nthen shifted over to the private sector side. It is shifted over to \npeople who pay out of pocket. It is shifted over to people who have \nprivate insurance.\n  Doctors and hospitals have been successful at managing their payer \nmix. A lot of doctors have X amount of Medicare, X amount of Medicaid, \nand X amount of private pay. When they put them all together, they find \na way to stay in business.\n  I think it is safe to say if you change the doctors' payer mix or you \nchange the hospitals' payer mix, you could take a provider and move \nthem from slightly profitable, enabling them to practice, over to \nlosing money based upon how the payer mix reimburses them.\n  My point is, as you take people out of private pay, which is coverage \nby their employer under a health care plan, payment out of pocket or \npurchase of health insurance, where that health insurance pays at 100-\nplus percent of the cost of a service provided, we are basically \nputting 24 million possibly new additional covered lives into Medicare \nunder Medicare reimbursements. Through that, we automatically change \nthe payer mix of every potential provider in America. We put in \njeopardy the doctor. We put in jeopardy the hospital. We put in \njeopardy anybody who provides a service under Medicare.\n  What is the doctor going to do? The doctor can look at it and say: I \ncan absorb the reduction and the change in the payer mix or the doctor \nmay look at it and say: I cannot add any more Medicare beneficiaries. I \nam sorry, I saw you before when you were on private insurance, but I \ncannot continue to see you because now I do not get reimbursed \nsufficiently. So you are going to have to find another doctor.\n  Now we have gotten into the core pledges of the President where he \nsaid: If you like your plan, you get to keep it; if you like your \ndoctor, you can continue with him. We are putting a burden on the \ndoctor or the hospital to make a determination as to how they monitor \nand control their payer mix by one simple change: by increasing the \nopportunity for people to participate in a program that up to this time \nhas been sacred and, I might also add, is a program that every \nparticipant has paid in their lifetime to be enrolled in.\n  Medicare is a trust fund. I think we forgot that, when we arbitrarily \nsaid we can take $464 billion and steal it out of Medicare and use it \nto fund this new entitlement. This is not our money to steal. This is \nthe beneficiaries' money that they have paid taxes on their entire life \nto fund their Medicare benefits.\n  I am not sure why we believe we have the right to go in and move that \nmoney from one account to another, where, in essence, we are moving it \nfrom one account and using it for somebody totally different. It is \nunfair to those who planned a lifetime for this.\n  Let me go back to the payer mix. As you increase the rolls of \nMedicare beneficiaries, you affect the viability of every outlet of \nmedical services--hospitals, doctors, this could also affect \npharmacists. It is important that we realize we have already increased \nin this bill the number of individuals who will be covered under \nMedicaid. The majority leader's original bill mandates that every State \nwill now raise their limit on Medicaid participation from 100 percent \nof poverty to 133 percent of poverty. Medicaid reimburses at about 72 \ncents of every dollar of service provided. When you do that, you have \nnow enrolled between 11 million and 15 million new covered lives under \nMedicaid.\n  So every provider in the system is already looking at what has been \nproposed--until the press accounts of the last 24 hours--and said: I am \ngoing to have 11 million to 15 million more people. I am being \nreimbursed 72 cents of every dollar provided. It is hard to stay in \nbusiness when it costs you a dollar to deliver a service and you get 72 \ncents back as payment.\n  They are already trying to figure out how they are going to adjust \ntheir payer mix to meet the demands when all of a sudden we come out \nwith a new proposal that the press accounts say we could enroll 24 \nmillion people in, that further contributes to cost shift.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, I was in full agreement with the \nPresident when he came out and said: Here are our goals. We have to \nreform health care. We have to focus on making sure every American has \naccess and affordable options to health care. We have to make sure it \nis fiscally sustainable.\n  Why, in the 21st century, would we design a health care system that \nwe could not be certain was financially sound for generations to come?\n  The truth is, by every account, in a real 10-year period, 10 years of \ntaxes and 10 years of benefits going out, this bill before the revision \nyesterday is a $2.5 trillion bill. It will contribute to the debt. It \nwill borrow money that our children will be obligated to pay interest \non and pay back.\n  This just compounds the problem, a breakthrough. This is not about \npolicy; this is about in a back room in Washington in the U.S. Capitol, \nwhere the majority leader was trying to get to 60 votes. It is real \nsimple.\n  Listen to the American people and we would start over and we would \nstart over with the principles of the President: Make sure what you do \nreforms health care, attracts 100 percent of the American people \nbecause of access and affordability, and it is fiscally sustainable for \ngenerations to come.\n  The truth is, we have been on the Senate floor for 2 weeks. We have \ndebated a bill that does coverage expansion. I admit openly, it covers \n3l million more Americans. But it misses the mark of doing any health \ncare reform because, you see, the bill, before the press accounts of \nthe last 24 hours, assured every American that if they had private \ninsurance or they paid out of pocket, their health care costs were \ngoing up. There is no way they could not.\n  Now what we have done is we have shifted and said we are going to \nincrease the amount of the cost shift. Let me explain for just a minute \nwhat a cost shift is. Cost shift is when somebody goes in and is \nprovided a medical service, and if they do not pay for that service or \nthey do not pay the entire cost of that service, what is left over is \nshifted somewhere in the system. Well, somewhere in the system is the \nnext person who walks in with insurance or who pays out of pocket. \nBecause of the blend they have to meet, they pick up the difference.\n\n  Why has health care had such a phenomenal increase in cost? It is \nbecause as we increased the rolls of Medicaid, as we had more seniors \ngo into Medicare, we had more costs that were shifted. Up to this \npoint, the President, the Congress, and others were only focused on the \nuninsured and the underinsured. Well, they are a contributor to the \ncost shift, there is no question. But let me suggest to you that if we \nprovide insurance--and we should provide access and affordability for \nevery American. By putting people into Medicaid, all you are doing is \nexacerbating the cost shift. If, in fact, you create a health care \nsystem that has an incentive for an individual not to purchase their \nown health care because it is cheaper to pay the fine, all you are \ndoing is exacerbating the problem of cost shift.\n  Health care reform is about changing the health system so that cost \nshift is eliminated. Quite frankly, it starts with making sure we pay \n100 percent of what the cost of the services are. But we are not having \nthat debate. This debate on the Senate floor right now, 2 weeks before \nChristmas, is about coverage expansion. It is not about health\n\n[[Page S12883]]\n\ncare reform. If it were about health care reform, we would be talking \nabout how we create an incentive for private companies to create \nproducts that allow an individual to construct their health insurance \nso that it matches their age, their income, and their health condition. \nThat is not what we are doing. We are sitting in Washington, creating a \none-size-fits-all program and saying: You know what, if this doesn't \nfit, well, we are going to create a government option for you, and we \nwill subsidize you and put you in the government option. Where is that \nfair to the American taxpayer?\n  That is why Senator Crapo's motion is so important. Refer it back to \ncommittee. Start over. We have our priorities wrong as it relates to \nour ability to dip into the American people's pockets and use their \nmoney to fund something that is not going to benefit them one bit. This \nwould be a different debate if we could look at the people who are not \ncovered and say: We have fiscally maximized our ability to provide you \nhealth care but not necessarily abused the American people's pockets to \ndo it.\n  America is the most compassionate country in the world. But when we \ndebate things such as this, we are also the most foolish country in the \nworld because it is irresponsible on our part to abuse the power of \nthis government to spend money like this without the benefits that we \nset out to achieve.\n  So it is my hope that as we go through the weekend, we will have an \nopportunity to see what the new proposal is that is laid down on the \ntable. Again, I have to go by what I read, and that is not always \naccurate in this town.\n  The CBO has stated that a similar proposal, which was a proposal for \na buy-in at the age of 62, would result in an adverse selection in the \nMedicare Program and would drive up premiums. Let me quote CBO because \nI don't want it just to be me. This is what the CBO said:\n\n       A potential problem with this option is that the amount of \n     adverse selection that the program experienced could be \n     greater than anticipated, which would put upward pressure on \n     premiums.\n\n  CBO is the entity that is evaluating the cost of the current \nproposal, which nobody knows what is in it. But this was a proposal \nthat was sent to them some time ago that had the buy-in starting at 62, \nnot 55, and their assessment of it, with a buy-in of 62, is that the \nadverse selection--meaning more sick people were going to migrate to \nthis new option--would cause upward pressure on Medicare premiums and \nupward pressure on premiums across the board.\n  So it is my hope that we will have an opportunity very soon to know \nwhat is in the proposal and to be able to debate the facts versus just \ntrying to educate ourselves based on the leaks from the media. But \nthere is one thing for certain: The American people have voiced their \nposition on health care reform. They do not see it as reform. They do \nnot see it as positively affecting themselves. They see it as too \nexpensive, they see it as a breach of trust on a plan that seniors have \nbecome 100 percent reliant on because they paid into it.\n  This path has a lot of problems. It is not just the new proposals, it \nis the proposal that has been on the table for some time. It is my hope \nthat we will continue this debate as long as it takes to make sure that \nat the end of the day we do what is right for the American people and \nnot necessarily what is expeditious for Members who would like to be \nhome for the holidays.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, earlier today I explained to my fellow \nSenators, and hopefully to my friends in the media, that the Reid bill \ndoes not provide a net tax cut for Americans. Contrary to the \nDemocrats' claims, that seems to be the situation. They claim there is \na net tax cut. I hope I proved earlier today that it does not have a \nnet tax cut. Some Americans are cut, but don't forget that some \nAmericans have increases in taxes. I pointed directly to this data, as \nprepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation, to show that a group of \nmiddle-income taxpayers will see their taxes go up under the Reid bill, \nand that would be this class of taxpayers right here. I don't disagree \nwith Democrats saying there is $40,786 million of tax cuts, but there \nare also tax increases for a large share of Americans.\n  I want to now build on those earlier remarks. As I stated, there is \nclearly a group of individuals and families who benefit from the \ngovernment subsidy for health care. However, that group is relatively \nsmall. Another much larger group would see their taxes go up. So I want \nto take a minute to provide some statistics that we pulled from the \ndata of the Joint Committee on Taxation looking at both the winners and \nthe losers under the bill.\n  For the benefit of the public, the Joint Committee on Taxation is an \nintellectually honest group of professionals who are nonpartisan, and \nthey give Congress information on the impact of policies we make here \nin our various committees or as individuals or the Senate as a whole.\n  According to this professional group, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, out of those individuals and families affected by four major \ntax provisions under the Reid bill, individuals earning more than \n$50,000 and families earning more than $75,000 would see, on average, \ntheir taxes going up. Only individuals with incomes below $50,000 and \nfamilies with incomes below $75,000 would, on average, see some tax \nrelief on account of receiving subsidies for health insurance.\n  The data of the Joint Committee on Taxation indicates that in 2019, \nindividuals earning less than $50,000 would, on average, receive tax \nrelief through this subsidy equal to $875. Families earning less than \n$75,000 would, on average, receive tax relief equal to $2,031 from the \nsubsidy. This so-called tax relief, however, is in the form of an \nadvance refundable tax credit that is delivered directly to the \ninsurance company providing health insurance coverage, not to the \nindividual but signed, sealed, and delivered directly to the insurance \ncompany--100 percent of it. I repeat: not to the individual but to the \ninsurance company. Clearly, this group is a winner under the Reid bill. \nBut the same data from the Joint Committee on Taxation indicates that \nin 2019, individuals earning between $50,000 and $200,000 would, on \naverage, see a tax increase of $593. That is for individuals. Now, \nlet's go to families earning between $75,000 and $200,000. They would, \non average, see a tax increase of $670.\n  So what does all this mean? This means the Reid bill does not cut \ntaxes for all Americans. To the contrary, the Reid bill breaks Obama's \npromise not to tax individuals making less than $200,000 and families \nmaking less than $250,000 a year. And you just can't know how many \ntimes President Obama, during his Presidential campaign--whether in \ndebates or in individual appearances when he was a candidate--made it \nvery clear that nobody with under $200,000 a year in income was going \nto see a tax increase. To the contrary, the Reid bill breaks President \nObama's pledge not to tax individuals making less than $200,000, and \nthen a higher figure for families making less than $250,000.\n  Does the tax relief provided to individuals earning less than $50,000 \nand families making less than $75,000 represent a tax cut? Generally, \nno, because based upon the report of the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nof the $395 billion the government will spend on tax credits for health \ninsurance--or subsidies for health insurance--$288 billion will be \nrefundable, meaning individuals and families who have no tax liability \nwill still receive the full benefit. The Joint Committee on Taxation \ntells us that the remaining $106 billion will go toward reducing real \ntax liability.\n  The Congressional Budget Office classifies a benefit provided to tax \nfilers with no tax liability as government spending, not as a tax \ndecrease. This is compared to a tax benefit that actually will reduce a \ntaxpayer's tax liability. This means the $288 billion of government \nspending through the Tax Code cannot be considered a true tax \nreduction.\n  The Democrats count the $288 billion in government spending when \nclaiming the Reid bill provides a tax cut. And the reason is if the \nDemocrats do not count this government spending as a tax cut, they \ncould not hide the fact that the Reid bill increases taxes.\n  Bottom line: The Reid bill does not provide a net tax cut. Instead, \nthe bill\n\n[[Page S12884]]\n\nraises taxes and it raises taxes on individuals and families earning \nless than $250,000, contrary to Candidate Obama's presentation during \nthe campaign that nobody below that figure would get a tax increase.\n  Check the data. No one can dispute it. It is right here in these \nfigures. Everybody in the United States is represented by these figures \nhere highlighted. They are the ones who are going to get a tax \nincrease. That is the rest of the story.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, we are on the floor today, as we have \nbeen for many days and weeks now, discussing health care. One thing I \nthink is undeniably clear is that there is a basic divide in the Senate \non health care. That is not news to most people. But I believe on this \nside of the aisle there is a great deal of consensus about what health \ncare reform should be about.\n  We have been trying throughout this debate to make it very clear that \nwe are not only concerned about the tens of millions of Americans who \ndo not have any insurance at all--that is obviously a focus of our work \nand focus of the debate--but we are also concerned at the same time, as \nwe must be, with those who have insurance--with families with \ninsurance, families who believe they have the security of insurance \nbut, unfortunately, under our system many of them don't.\n  Many families, in fact millions of families, over the last couple of \nyears have had a member of their family denied coverage because of a \npreexisting condition. That should be illegal. In this legislation we \ndeal with that directly for the first time ever.\n  We also provide other protections. When you say ``consumer \nprotections,'' that is a nice sounding phrase but in some ways it does \nnot describe what we are trying to do. We are trying to prevent people \nfrom being denied coverage because of preexisting conditions. We are \ntrying to make sure that other families don't have a tragedy such as \nthe family I have spoken on before on this floor, the Ritter family in \nManheim, PA. They had the tragedy of finding out a number of years ago \nthat their two 4-year-old daughters, twins, had leukemia but also the \ninsult and the outrage of our system saying to them: Your daughters \nhave leukemia, we can treat them, we have a lot of experts and \nknowledge and technology to help them, but we are going to limit their \ncare.\n  That is an outrage. The first provision in this bill says we are not \ngoing to put caps on treatment for people who are very sick.\n  We also recognize that, as President Obama said a number of months \nago, if you get sick, you shouldn't go bankrupt. But that is happening \nmore and more in America. It is an outrage and we should not allow it \nto go on any longer.\n  We are trying also to keep premiums affordable. Fortunately, the \nCongressional Budget Office helped us make that argument. In their own \nway they weighed in on that question and talked about the fact that so \nmany American families will have their premiums reduced if not kept \nlevel.\n  We are obviously trying to enhance quality and prevention. All of \nthese strategies that we know work, the research is irrefutable, but we \ntalk about them as a way of a good example instead of talking about \nthem as something we ought to put in the law and make part of our \nsystem. Why should we have all of those prevention strategies and then \nthrow up our hands and say that would be nice if insurance companies \ndid that in their policies instead of make it part of the law. And we \nwill, both in terms of prevention strategies as well as quality.\n  Finally, as a quick summary of what we are trying to do, we are \ntrying to control costs. I think this bill does that. We still have a \nbill to do and amendments to make. It also cuts the deficit by $130 \nbillion over 10 years, and much more, several hundred billion, in the \nyears after that.\n  One fundamental recognition, I guess, in this debate--at least on \nthis side of the aisle--is that our system has left people out. In some \ncases it has left them out in a very tragic way when they are denied \ncoverage because of a preexisting condition. Our health care system has \nleft out others in different ways, and I rise today to speak about an \namendment I filed, along with Senator Klobuchar, my cosponsor on this \namendment, that seeks to address a group of Americans who have been \nleft out of our health care system and forgotten at a very difficult \ntime in their lives. The name of the amendment is the Pregnant and \nParenting Teens and Women Amendment. It recognizes what I believe to be \na fundamental reality in America. I will describe two scenarios--one \nthat so many of us have had the opportunity to experience as parents \nbut especially those in this Chamber and those who are listening to \nthis debate who are women who become pregnant.\n  For many women that moment when they find out they are pregnant is a \nmoment of joy. It is the miracle of pregnancy. They feel that joy and \nthey share it with their family and their friends. It is a time of real \nhappiness. Many of these women in that first scenario do not need help \nbeyond what their families provide or what they might receive by way of \nadequate support within our existing framework of programs and \nservices--whether that is government help or private sector or \nnonprofit help. That is wonderful and we hope that becomes more and \nmore the case.\n  But there is a second scenario in America, a second category where a \nwoman finds out she is pregnant and that moment of discovery is not a \nmoment of joy. For her, it is a moment of terror or panic or even \nshame. She may be in a doctor's office or she may be at home--she may \nbe in a number of places--but for her that moment begins with a crisis \nin which she feels overwhelmingly and perhaps unbearably alone, all \nalone. She could be wealthy, middle income, or poor--but most likely, \nif that pregnancy is a crisis, she is poor. Whatever her income, she \nfeels very simply all alone.\n  A pregnant woman who is facing those horrific circumstances may be a \nwoman who has an abusive spouse or boyfriend who is tormenting her. She \nis all alone in many instances.\n  Another pregnant woman may believe that she cannot support or care \nfor her new baby at this point in her life. She is all alone.\n  Another woman might believe that her financial situation is so \nprecarious that she cannot care for or raise a child. She may feel all \nalone and helpless. If she decides to bear a child, she needs our help. \nShe needs our help to walk with her along that difficult journey--not \nonly through the 9 months of her pregnancy but also through the early \nmonths and years of that child's life.\n  I believe that is an obligation we have. I know some may not agree \nwith that, but it is important that we are honest about where we stand.\n  We understand that many women face that reality. So what do we do \nabout it? Do we say: That is too bad and that is kind of their problem \nand let them find their own way or there is a little program down the \nstreet that might help them or there might be a little government \nprogram over here or there might be some charity that will help them. \nThey will do fine. Don't worry about them.\n\n  This country has shown a capacity to reach out and help people who \nare in crisis, to try to give people a sense that they are not all \nalone, that there are lots of ways to help. Unfortunately, neither \npolitical party has adequately met this challenge, in my judgment. We \nhear a lot of discussion about it. We hear a lot of sentiment about it. \nBut we do not do nearly enough about it.\n  Here is what the amendment will do. First, it will provide assistance \nand support for pregnant and parenting college students. Second, it \nwill provide assistance and support for pregnant and parenting teens. \nThird, it will improve services for pregnant women who are victims of \ndomestic violence, sexual violence, and stalking. And fourth, it will \nincrease public awareness of the resources available to pregnant or \nparenting teens and women.\n  Let me give some examples of these services. First, funding for \ncolleges to provide pregnant and parenting resources located on campus \nor within the local community and improve such resources, including: \nthe inclusion of maternity coverage, which a lot of insurance companies \ndo not provide now, unfortunately and insultingly, in my judgment; make \navailable riders for\n\n[[Page S12885]]\n\ncoverage for additional family members in student health care on a \ncollege campus; make sure that woman, if she has chosen to bear a \nchild, gets housing and childcare and flexible or alternative academic \nscheduling to allow her to remain in school; education to improve her \nparenting skills; maternity and baby clothing, baby food, baby \nfurniture--all of the things some of us take for granted in our \nfamilies prior to or upon the birth of a child.\n  The other part of this is funding for programs that help pregnant and \nparenting teens stay in or complete high school and prepare for college \nor vocational education, by providing resources and assistance.\n  Next, assistance to States in providing intervention services, \naccompaniment and supportive social services for pregnant victims of \ndomestic violence and other kinds of violence as well, to start.\n  Finally, making people aware, providing public awareness and outreach \nso that pregnant and parenting teens and women are aware of the \nservices available to them.\n  We cannot stand here on the floor and say we care about these folks \nand we want to help them if we are not willing to make good on that \npromise. It is not enough to have good intentions. It is not enough to \nsay there might be a program out there. We know for sure that at least \nthese three categories--maybe others could add to it, maybe others may \nnot, but these three categories of pregnant women are in many cases all \nalone. Neither political party nor our Government--and I would argue \nother parts of our society--are doing enough. It is time as we debate \nhealth care that we say one part of our health care system is going to \nbe made much better.\n  In addition to the substantial changes on protecting families from \nthe ravages of what insurance companies have done to some families, \nprotecting them at long last, those with insurance, ensuring 30 million \nAmericans, cutting the deficit, having prevention strategies, \ncontrolling chronic disease and making it something we can manage \nbetter, and save money--all of that is important. But I do not think in \nthe debate here we should leave out those who are asking for a little \nbit of the help we are not giving them.\n  We should never ask a pregnant woman to walk that journey all alone. \nI think that is the least we can do in this Chamber, in this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, my friends on the other side of the \naisle have taken to the floor to make the argument in favor of the Reid \nbill that it eliminates a so-called hidden tax. What is this so-called \nhidden tax? The other party argues that there is a hidden health tax \nthat families pay in increased premium costs to cover the costs of \ncaring for the uninsured. In short, when doctors and hospitals provide \ntreatment to the uninsured they are forced to compensate for this \n``uncompensated care'' and do so by charging more to private health \ninsurers. The cost of this care that is shifted to the insurers is then \npassed on to health care consumers in the form of higher health \ninsurance premiums. Unfortunately, this so-called hidden tax is often \noverstated.\n  Families USA conducted a study attempting to quantify the cost shift \nassociated with uncompensated care. According to this study, about $43 \nbillion in uncompensated care is shifted to private health insurance \nwhich led Families USA to conclude that there is a hidden tax of about \n$1,100 that families pay in increased premiums. A Kaiser Family \nFoundation study dissected the Families USA numbers and estimated that \nthe total amount of uncompensated care shifted to private insurers was \ncloser to $11 billion, making the so-called hidden tax around $200 for \na family, compared to the $1,100 that Families USA said. Let me give \nsome ground to my friends on the other side and assume that the hidden \ntax does equal that higher figure, $1,100, as compared to the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation figure of $200.\n  The Democrats' bill does not get rid of the hidden tax entirely. \nActually, this bill makes it worse. How? First, the Democrats' health \ncare reform bill still leaves a large number of Americans uninsured. \nSpecifically, the Reid bill leaves 23 million out of 54 million still \nwithout health insurance at the end of this decade, remembering that \nthis bill does not actually take effect until 2014. So between 2014 and \nat the end of the budget window, we still have 23 million people \nwithout health insurance. At best, the reform in this 2,074-page \nDemocratic bill cut the hidden tax in half; in this case, to about $500 \nfor a family.\n  The Reid bill adds, however, new hidden taxes. These impose $67 \nbillion worth of so-called fees on health insurance companies and self-\ninsured arrangements beginning in 2010. The Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan experts and \nofficial congressional scorekeepers have testified that these fees will \nbe passed on to health care consumers.\n  The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation \nhave further testified that this will result in higher insurance \npremiums for all Americans. The actuaries at Oliver-Wyman estimate that \nthe fees imposed on health insurers would add $488 to the cost of the \naverage family health insurance policy. A new hidden tax is also \ncreated as a result of the Medicaid expansion and Medicare cuts. The \nmajor cost shift in health care derives from the government programs, \nMedicare and Medicaid, which reimburse providers at rates roughly 20 \npercent to 40 percent lower than what private providers pay to the same \ndoctors and hospitals.\n  President Obama understands that paying doctors below market rates \nleads to a cost shift. After all, in a townhall on health care reform, \nthe President said:\n\n       If they're only collecting 80 cents on the dollar, they've \n     got to make it up somewhere, and they end up getting it from \n     people who have private insurance.\n\n  The Medicare and Medicaid cost shift will be increased significantly \nunder the Democrats' health care reform bill. According to CBO's \nestimate, Medicaid will be increased by more than 40 percent, from 35 \nmillion to 50 million people by the end of the budget window in 2019. \nAdditionally, the bill includes almost $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts \nwhich will result in lower payments to providers.\n  The actuaries at Milliman Consulting studied the current cost \nshifting resulting from Medicare and Medicaid underpaying providers and \nfound that this cost shift for Medicare and Medicaid totaled almost $89 \nbillion per year, adding $1,788 to the current family health insurance \npolicy. Increasing the current Medicare and Medicaid cost shift, as a \nresult of this 2,074-page health reform bill before us, would add even \nmore cost to a family health insurance policy.\n  The easier cost shift to address would be the $1,700 cost shift from \ndefensive medicine. The Democrats do not address cost shift from \ndefensive medicine which Dr. Mark McClellan, former head of CMS, and \nDaniel Kessler estimated adds $1,700 in additional cost per average \nfamily. Addressing this reform alone could save more than covering all \nof the uninsured.\n  So you see, the Democrats say their bill will eliminate the so-called \nhidden tax. My friends seem to come up short on that one. Also, my \nfriends add new hidden taxes that will burden middle-class Americans.\n  I ask my friends to be transparent when they are talking about \ngetting rid of the hidden tax. The Democratic health reform bill \nactually makes things worse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Last night, I held a telephone townhall meeting. As \nusual, because we get over 10,000 people on the telephone townhall \ntalking to us, I said: This is a meeting that is open to any subject \nyou can talk about.\n  Overwhelmingly, they all wanted to talk about health care. I had one \ncall where the fellow said he liked this health care bill. He was a \nsmall businessman. He said: This will help me as a small businessman, \nand why are you opposed to it?\n  I said to him: I have been a small businessman, and I would like to \npoint out to you that NFIB, the organization that helps small business, \nis opposed to it. And I went through some of the reasons. Then I told \nhim of other small- or\n\n[[Page S12886]]\n\nmedium-size businessmen in Utah who have said to me: If this bill \npasses, we are out of here. We could do our manufacturing overseas. We \ncould send our product to South America and have it made there. We have \nstayed in Utah more out of patriotism than money. But if this bill \npasses, the impact on us in small business will be sufficiently great \nthat we will leave Utah. We will leave America. We will take all of \nthese jobs and go overseas.\n  That was that one discussion with the one caller. Every other caller \ntalked about the health care bill and said: Don't pass it. Every other \ncaller was opposed. There was only the one who made comments in favor \nof it, comments on which I think I was able to dissuade him.\n  Every other one came up: Do you want to talk about Afghanistan?\n  No, we want to talk about health care. We are opposed to this bill.\n  Do you want to talk about some other aspects of what is going on in \nWashington?\n  No, we want to talk about health care, and we are opposed to this \nbill.\n  Over and over, the only other subject that came up that I can recall \nwith any regularity--there were several calls that talked about cap and \ntrade and expressed their opposition to that. But, overwhelmingly, the \nentire hour was people who were saying: We are opposed to this bill.\n  I want to share with the Members some aspects of the reaction of \nUtahns to the campaigns that have been mounted by various groups in \nfavor of this bill. Let's go to the campaign that has been mounted by \nthe AARP. AARP is one of the strongest lobbying organizations in the \ncountry. Indeed, there are those who say it is the most powerful \nlobbying organization. AARP, in an effort to make sure this bill gets \npassed, has prepared preprinted petitions and sent them out to their \nmembers. Here is a copy of one. It is addressed directly to me and was \nsent to people in the State of Utah: ``Petition to Senator Robert F. \nBennett. Dear Senator Robert F. Bennett, As one of your constituents . \n. . '' so on and so forth.\n  Then all the AARP member has to do is sign it and send it to me. This \none was sent to me. But as we can see, he didn't just sign it, instead \nhe wrote on it. This is what it says in handwriting:\n\n       Absolutely not! Please vote against current legislation \n     being proposed by the current administration and endorsed by \n     the AARP.\n  The ``not'' is underlined. He signed his name. I have taken it off \nthis facsimile to protect the man's privacy, but he made it clear that \nhe was not in favor of what the AARP was saying and doing in this \nsituation. We have others who have said the same kind of thing.\n  Here is a letter I will quote from:\n\n       Senator Bennett, please do not vote to pass the health care \n     bill that contains a public option. The present medical is \n     broken and surely needs fixing. However, it should be done in \n     ways that do not bankrupt the country, close hospitals and \n     doctors offices.\n\n  Who is saying this? He says:\n\n       I will probably withdraw from AARP since they support the \n     present health care proposals. Several of my doctor friends \n     have withdrawn from the AMA due to its support of these \n     proposals.\n\n  Then he signed his name, and his initials make it clear he, too, is a \nphysician, a member of AARP who clearly wants to drop out of AARP, and \na member of AMA who supports those who drop out of the AMA.\n  Let me quote from another physician who wrote a lengthier letter, \nmore analytical. I will quote from parts of the letter. He starts out:\n\n       As a practicing Utah physician, I see and treat patients \n     every day. I try to accurately diagnose what their troubles \n     are and offer an incremental plan for their recovery. I am \n     thorough, methodical and exacting in my plan, purposely first \n     doing no harm, as my Hippocratic oath reads, not making the \n     situation worse, not causing more pain or suffering. The \n     Senate bill before you will make America more ill, with \n     increased pain and suffering. I plead with you to first do no \n     harm. Please do not make the situation worse as with the \n     current bill. It is beyond repair. Please recognize that the \n     Senate plan will add to America's ills.\n\n  Then he goes on later in the letter to make this comment:\n\n       Patients ask me why the AMA appears to support this bill. \n     They sense that the AMA is not looking out for patients and \n     doctors. I agree that the AMA is misdirected and explained \n     that the AMA represents fewer than one in five U.S. doctors \n     and has compromised its mission.\n\n  I find that interesting. I didn't realize that the AMA membership had \ndropped so low. When I first became interested in politics, the AMA \nrepresented virtually every doctor in the country. Not anymore.\n  I tell my patients about the multitude of other medical organizations \nof which I am a member, state medical organizations, speciality groups, \nand the Coalition to Protect Patients Rights, representing thousands of \ndoctors who actively oppose the Senate bill in its entirety and are \nfighting for patients and the right fixes for affordable, quality care.\n  Well, as I found out in my telephone town meeting, which covered the \nentire State--and with no filtering on the part of my staff as to who \ncould get in and who could not--this is, indeed, very clearly the \nmajority opinion for members of the State, seniors who presumably \nbelong to AARP, and physicians who either used to belong to the AMA or \nunderstand the AMA.\n  Here is an e-mail from a doctor. I cannot pronounce the specialty he \nis in. He says:\n\n       As a constituent and practicing--\n\n  And then he goes on to say whatever kind of ``ologist'' he is--\n\n       I strongly urge you to oppose the passage of the current \n     Senate healthcare reform legislation. . . . Although our \n     nation would benefit from targeted healthcare reform, the \n     proposed legislation is not the answer and will harm, not \n     help, healthcare delivery in our nation. . . .\n       As surgeons, we take pride in our work and strive to \n     provide the best patient care possible. We will support \n     reform efforts that truly preserve access to high qualify \n     specialty care without jeopardizing the physician-patient \n     relationship. As such, I oppose the ``Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Healthcare Act'' as it has the potential to \n     seriously compromise the delivery of healthcare in the United \n     States by creating additional pressures on an already \n     overburdened healthcare system.\n\n  Well, I have a number more. I will not go into all of them; I will \njust pick a few from the stack I brought with me.\n  Here is one:\n\n       I am a Surgeon who has been practicing for about 30 years. \n     I am against the total overhaul of the health care system. \n     All entitlement programs are not cost effective and all are \n     in danger of bankrupting the U.S.\n\n  Here is one, who is a retiree, who says:\n\n       Please vote against these healthcare ``reforms'' that will \n     limit options, cost us all more and reduce our freedoms. We \n     need real change: portability, tort reform, and less \n     government control.\n\n  Back to the doctors. He says:\n\n       Dear Mr. Bennett,\n       I am a pediatrician in Utah and met you at the hospital in \n     Orem. Thank you for your opposition to the current process \n     happening in Washington. We do not need to rush through and \n     push the American people into government run health care and \n     more red tape. Medicaid is already my biggest head ache in my \n     practice.\n\n  And so on and so forth, as I say.\n  I want to make this other point with respect to all of these people \nwho are so concerned that we will have an immediate bad impact if this \nbill passes. They do not realize--and I did my best to point this out \nto those who were on the telephone townhall meeting last night--that \nthis bill will not fully take effect--indeed, most of the aspects of \nthis bill will not take effect--until January of 2014. That is correct, \nJanuary of 2014--4 years away.\n  Here we are meeting on weekends, coming in here on Sunday, driving to \nget this done by Christmas because it is so pressing that we have to do \nit, and, by the way, we are not going to start, really, any of these \nreforms for 4 years. So these people who are writing me, these doctors \nwho are complaining about AMA's endorsement, these people who are \ncomplaining about AARP not representing them, are worried about an \nimmediate impact.\n  Let me tell you what the immediate impact of this bill will be. The \nimmediate impact of the bill will be financial. The taxes will take \nplace immediately upon passage. The increase in premiums will begin to \nstart on passage, as the pressure on the insurance companies, the \npressure on manufacturers, the pressure on pharmaceutical companies \nwill all begin with the passage of this bill. But all of the wonderful \nthings we are being promised as benefits from this bill will be delayed \nfor 4 years. Why? There is only one reason why: in order to use smoke \nand mirrors in the budgetary process to\n\n[[Page S12887]]\n\nmake it look as if this is cheaper than it really is. If you get the \nmoney coming in for 10 years but the expenses only going out for 6 \nyears in your calculation, it looks as if it is a whole lot cheaper \nthan it really is.\n  The only honest way to score this is to say the expenses start the \nsame day the taxes start, the expenses going out start the same day the \nrevenue coming in starts. Then you get an accurate description of how \nmuch this costs.\n  I cannot imagine any businessman going before his board of directors \nand saying: I have a new program I want to institute in this company, \nand it is going to cost X, and here is how I have calculated it is \ngoing to cost X. I am calculating the revenue from the sales of the \nproduct over a 10-year period, but the actual sales will only occur in \nthe last 6 years.\n  His board of directors would take one look at him and say: There is \nno way we can make a strategic plan based on that kind of smoke and \nmirrors. What in the world is wrong with you to do accounting of that \nkind?\n  He will say: That is the kind of accounting I learned from the U.S. \nSenate--start counting the revenues immediately, but don't count the \nexpenses until 4 years later.\n  Well, let's look at the impact of that 4-year gap and tie it to the \nmessages I am receiving from my constituents, and I think we will see \nsomething very interesting happen. Between now and the time the \nbenefits of this bill begin to take hold, there will be three or four \nopen seasons of people who will look at their health care plan and be \nallowed to make changes in it. They will see the costs go up, and they \nwill say: Wait a minute, what is happening here? The costs are going \nup, but there are no changes coming from this bill the Senate passed \nback in 2009--or 2010, if we push it until next year. What is \nhappening?\n  Well, your costs are going up in anticipation of the costs of this \nbill that will take hold in January of 2014.\n  At that point, the anger we are seeing from constituents now will get \nworse. The anger we are seeing in the e-mails and letters I am \nreceiving now will get more intense, and people will start to say: You \nmean I am being forced to pay extra premiums in 2010 because the \ngovernment needs to accumulate cash against the time when these great \nchanges hit us in 2014? When they start writing me that kind of \ncomplaint, I will say: That is exactly what I mean. The government is \ngoing to start taxing you in 2010, but they are not going to do this \nprogram until 2014--at which point, the outcry from constituents will \nbe: Well, let's stop the taxes and let's kill the effective date of \n2014.\n  I am not sure I can predict that with certainty, but I can go back in \nhistory and remember the catastrophic bill that was passed with respect \nto Medicare, and the senior citizens suddenly discovered how much it \nwas costing them. The outcry was so overwhelming that the Congress, \nwithin a matter of 6 months of the passage of the bill, repealed the \nbill. I remember the pictures that appeared in national magazines of \nCongressmen Rostenkowski, who was at the time the chairman of the Ways \nand Means Committee, being accosted physically when he went home to \nChicago by seniors who would stand in front of his car and not allow \nhim to move, who would sit on the hood of his car to block his way in \nevery conceivable way. The outcry was enormous when they saw this \nincreased cost for something where they did not see a corresponding \nbenefit, and Congress responded to that outcry and repealed that bill.\n  In this case, there will be a 4-year period for the outcry to build \nbefore they start to see the benefits, if, indeed, the bill does confer \nbenefits. There will be a 4-year period with that many open seasons for \npeople to look at their programs and see their premiums go up and see \ntheir plans change and see the adjustments made in preparation for \nthis, adjustments they will not want; 4 years in which they will see \nthe statement of the President of the United States, that ``if you like \nyour plan, you don't have to lose it,'' prove not to be the case.\n  In that 4-year period, it is entirely possible that the outcry from \nconstituents, like the ones who are complaining now, will have \ntremendously more impact and more force. I hope that is, indeed, the \ncase, if we pass this bill. I hope that in that 4-year period, before \nwe start to see the wonderful things we are being promised from the \nother side of the aisle come to pass--the increased premiums, the \nincreased taxes, and the increased costs will be with us--the people of \nthis country will rise up and say: We want this bill repealed. They \nhave 4 years in which to do it, 4 years in which to think about it, 4 \nyears in which to experience it.\n\n  Why are we rushing to get this done before Christmas when we have 4 \nyears before the thing finally kicks in? Let's take the time to do it \nright. Let's take the time to listen to our constituents. Let's take \nthe time to listen to the American people who are examining this bill \nand, by ever-increasing margins, telling us again and again that they \ndo not like it.\n  We have heard from many people the reactions of the polls. The \nQuinnipiac Poll made the comment: It is a good thing the Senate is not \nletting the American people vote on this bill because the American \npeople are against it. We have seen the Gallup Poll show a tremendous \nswing, as their people are against it. The more they know about it, the \nless they like it. Yet we are trying to rush it through in the holiday \nseason to get it done before Christmas even though it is 4 years away \nbefore all of the wonderful things that are being promised will \nsurface.\n  Mr. President, I think my constituents have it right. I think those \npeople who belong to AARP who are saying they are going to drop out \nbecause of AARP's endorsement are right. I think those physicians who \nsay they are either not members of the AMA or they are going to drop \nout from the AMA because of the AMA's position are right. And I think \nif we cram this thing through in a sense of urgency, even though it is \n4 years from implementation, we will see an outcry in the intervening 4 \nyears from the American people that will cause Members of the Senate to \nwish they had taken more time to examine it all, to do it right, and \nnot to panic over pressure from various special interest groups that \nsee ways in which they can profit from this.\n  The American people, the American physicians, the American patients \nall see ways in which they will be hurt, and I speak for them, as they \nsay: Slow this down. Do this thing right. Do not panic under pressure \nof an artificial time deadline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                        In Praise of Wendy Tada\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about my great \nFederal employee of the week who works at the Department of Education.\n  Whenever I enter this hallowed Chamber, I never fail to notice the \ninspirational words written on each wall above the doors. Above the \neast door is inscribed the Latin phrase ``Annuit Coeptis,'' or \n``Fortune favored Us in Our Beginnings.'' This refers to our Founders' \nbelief that Providence looked kindly upon our Republic during its \nearliest days.\n  In that time, ours was mostly an agrarian society. Town life centered \non planting seeds and harvesting crops. Children worked alongside their \nparents in the field, and when it came to their education, \nhomeschooling or learning to read and add in a one-room schoolhouse was \nthe norm.\n  Thomas Jefferson wrote, some years after his Presidency, that \n``Science is more important in a republic than in any other \ngovernment.'' It was this belief in the importance of knowledge and \nreason--including political and historical literacy--that led education \npioneers such as Horace Mann to promote universal schooling in the \nearly part of the 19th century.\n  Shortly before the Civil War, access to compulsory and free public \neducation spread across the country as States passed laws inspired by \nthis principle. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act provided for the \nconstruction of some of our Nation's greatest colleges and universities \nin the late 1800s. In the early years of the 20th century, States \nincreased access by expanding free, compulsory education to include \nhigh school. The last 60 years saw dramatic advances in this area, with \nthe legal desegregation of schools and the passage of critical \nlegislation such as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n\n[[Page S12888]]\n\n  I am proud to have been serving in the Senate earlier this year when \nwe passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. That legislation \nsent much needed funding to fix schools, make student loans more \nreadily available, and to keep teachers in the classroom. The Recovery \nAct so far saved over 230 teaching jobs in my home State of Delaware \nalone.\n\n  In 1980, the U.S. Department of Education was created, and its \nemployees have been working tirelessly to make sure students from all \n50 States, including Delaware and Rhode Island, receive the same strong \nsupport. They oversee the Federal loan programs that enable tens of \nmillions of Americans to afford college and postcollege studies. They \nhelp develop policies to ensure that Americans with physical and \nintellectual disabilities have education programs in their communities \nand can pursue a full range of opportunities.\n  Wendy Tada, who has worked at the Department of Education for 9 \nyears, is one of those outstanding employees. When she arrived at the \nDepartment in 2000, Wendy already had a great deal of experience \nworking to expand opportunities for rural special needs students in \nHawaii and Alaska.\n  Wendy, who is a lifelong learner herself, holds a bachelor's degree \nin psychology from Seattle University, a master's in physical therapy \nfrom Stanford, and a master's in public health from San Diego State. \nShe also earned a doctorate in developmental psychology from the \nUniversity of California in San Diego.\n  Wendy's experience includes working at the State and local levels. \nShe provided physical therapy to disabled students in Washington State, \ndeveloped an education curriculum for special needs children in Hawaii \nand its remote Pacific Islands, and evaluated health and education \nservices in Native Alaskan villages.\n  Wendy has taught college and graduate courses in education and public \nhealth at the University of Washington and the University of Hawaii.\n  Her first job with the Department of Education was as a research \nanalyst in the Office of Special Education Programs. Wendy's talents \nand experience led to a promotion within a year, when she became Chief \nof Staff to the Assistant Secretary overseeing that office. She \ncontinued as his top adviser when he was appointed to serve as \nAssistant Secretary for the Office of Vocational and Adult Education. \nIn 2006, Wendy became the Chief of Staff to the Deputy Secretary of \nEducation.\n  This January, after a brief stint as an education analyst for the \nOffice of Management and Budget, she was asked by the Deputy Secretary \nof Education to serve as senior adviser for policy and programs.\n  During her years in the Department, Wendy has been instrumental in \ndeveloping important regulations and guidance documents relating to \nIDEA and title I of the ESEA. Today, her time is spent in developing \nand putting into practice education programs funded by the Recovery \nAct.\n  One of the central programs under the Recovery Act is the new Race to \nthe Top Fund. This initiative represents the largest Federal \ncompetitive investment in elementary and secondary education in our \nhistory. It will offer over $4 billion--that is billion--in grants to \nStates to develop comprehensive education reform plans. This will help \nall States, including Delaware, save even more teaching jobs and add \nnew resources for schools.\n  Wendy's work and that of her colleagues throughout the Department of \nEducation continue to benefit American students nationwide. They ensure \nthat all our children are favored in their beginnings so they may \npursue the opportunities they deserve. Education is, without a doubt, \nthe most important investment our Nation can make, for its dividends \nare our future prosperity and global leadership.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Wendy Tada and all the \nhard-working employees of the Department of Education for their service \nto this country. Our future is in their hands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the \nlegislation which is pending before us, which is the Omnibus \nappropriations bill. It is a bill that will substantially add to our \nnational debt and substantially increase spending and I think it is \nworthwhile to point out some of the features of this bill, since \npresumably we will be voting on it sometime this weekend.\n  I would start by pointing out that our national deficit for the past \nfiscal year now stands at $1.4 trillion. So the fiscal year which just \nconcluded added $1.4 trillion to the national debt. That is the largest \ndeficit we have ever had, by far. It is about three times as much as \nthe largest deficit under the Bush administration. Our current \nunemployment level is at 10 percent, despite the administration's \ninsistence earlier this year that Congress pass a $1 trillion-plus \nstimulus package that was supposed to reduce unemployment. The Senate \nis currently in the middle of a debate on a health care bill that has a \n10-year implementation cost of $2.5 trillion. Sometime in the next \nmonth we will be forced to raise the Nation's debt ceiling for the \nsecond time this year to a level that exceeds the current ceiling of \n$12.1 trillion.\n  If all that were not enough, we are now presented with this Omnibus \nappropriations bill that costs nearly $500 billion more; to be exact, \n$446.8 billion. This is simply irresponsible. When is it going to end? \nWe are piling spending bill on spending bill and debt on debt. At a \ntime when many Americans are being forced to get by on less, the \nmajority has crafted a bill that uses the government's credit card to \nincrease spending on the six appropriations bills that make up this \npackage--by how much? By 12 percent total.\n  For perspective, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the \nconsumer price index, the CPI, the measurement of inflation over the \npast 12 months, was .2 percent. So the cost of living is going up by .2 \npercent. Yet we are giving these government agencies 12 percent more \nmoney for next year. Let me give some examples.\n  The Transportation-HUD bill receives a 23-percent increase over last \nyear. Has anybody had their income go up by 23 percent over last year? \nWell, if you are in the Federal Government, you can make it happen. \nThat is not responsible.\n  How about the State-Foreign Operations bill, a 33-percent increase, a \nthird over last year--a 33-percent increase. Included in that is a 24-\npercent increase for the State Department's salaries and operations \naccount. That is not responsible.\n  The Commerce, Justice, and Science bill receives a 12-percent \nincrease over last year. At least that is the average of the six bills \nin total.\n  How about earmarks? Well, they are in here, big time. According to \nTaxpayers for Common Sense, this bill is larded up with 5,224 \nearmarks--5,224 earmarks--that total $3.8 billion. That is not \nresponsible.\n  Some examples include $600,000 for a streetscape beautification in \nCalifornia and $300,000 for Carnegie Hall music and education programs \nin New York City. In the current economic environment, that doesn't \nseem to be the most responsible use of Federal taxpayer dollars.\n  If the irresponsible levels of spending were not bad enough, the bill \nmakes a number of significant policy changes as well. Ordinarily, we \nare not supposed to have policy changes in an appropriations bill, but \nwhen you lump them all together in a take-it-or-leave-it form, such as \nthis omnibus, well, if you are the majority, you think you can get away \nwith it. Here are 134 examples.\n  With respect to the fairness doctrine, this omnibus does not include \nthe fiscal year 2008 ban on Federal funds being used to enforce or \nimplement the so-called fairness doctrine--so nothing to implement or \nenforce the so-called fairness doctrine.\n  The bill makes some changes to several longstanding policy provisions \ncontained in the financial services bill and specifically the District \nof Columbia section dealing with abortion, medical marijuana, needle \nexchange, domestic partners, and the DC Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram. That program has been enormously popular and enormously \nsuccessful. Yet this bill provides only enough money--$13.2 million--to \nallow the currently enrolled students in this popular program, the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program, ultimately leading to the termination \nof the program. I have met with some of these students and their \nparents. They are doing very well because of the\n\n[[Page S12889]]\n\nenvironment in which they are finally able to study and learn and be \nsafe. This program is so popular that people have lined up in long \nqueues to take advantage of it. Yet we are going to terminate the \nprogram as a result of language in this bill.\n  Well, it is a cross between irresponsible policy and spending.\n\n  The bill reduces funding for the Office of Labor Management standards \nat the Department of Labor by 10 percent. This is the office that \ninvestigates union activity and the use of membership dues. Since \nfiscal year 1998, it has secured 1,400 convictions, resulting in the \nreturn of $106 million in embezzled funds to union workers. So where \nare our priorities? The only place where we see cuts in this bill are \nin areas where, in this case, the Department of Labor has been \nenforcing labor law and getting convictions for embezzlement of \nworkers' funds. This is not an area where we want to cut, unless, of \ncourse, you are trying to do the bidding of the labor unions who don't \nlike to be called to account for embezzlement of trust fund moneys of \ntheir members.\n  Well, what is missing from this bill? Despite spending nearly $500 \nbillion and covering 6 of the 10 appropriations bills, this bill is \nsignificant for what it does not include: The fiscal year 2010 Defense \nappropriations bill, arguably the most important bill yet to be acted \nupon. Just shortly after President Obama announced his surge strategy \nfor Afghanistan, the majority has decided to play politics on the backs \nof our troops. The majority is holding the Defense bill back from this \npackage so it can be used as a vehicle for other purposes; for example, \nto increase our Nation's debt ceiling and potentially push through a \nnumber of other bills that likely don't have the votes to pass on their \nown. That is wrong. While our commanders in the field and civilians at \nthe Pentagon wait, our other less-urgent appropriations priorities will \nreceive double-digit spending increases. That is not responsible and it \nis not right.\n  Given what I know about this bill--and I haven't had a chance to read \nit all yet--I would echo my friend in the House, Republican leader John \nBoehner, who requested the President uphold his campaign promise to go \nthrough the budget, line by line, and eliminate irresponsible and \nwasteful spending.\n  I can assure my colleagues, we will go through this and we will \nidentify those earmarks and we will bring them to the attention of our \ncolleagues, and we will, undoubtedly, because of these spending \nincreases and earmarks and bad policy, attempt to defeat this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, I wish to make reference to some comments I saw delivered by \nDr. Christina Romer, Chair of the White House Council of Economic \nAdvisers, as I was drinking my coffee and watching TV a couple days \nago. This was on CNN's ``American Morning'' program on December 8. I \nwas rather startled because she said she was getting rid of the jobs \ndeficit and dealing with the budget deficit, two big problems we \ninherited and absolutely have to deal with.\n  Well, it is true, on January 20 of this year when President Obama \ntook office, we had a deficit and we also had a problem with \nunemployment. The problem is in inferring they are doing something \nabout it, whereas the Bush administration created the problem, I think \nthey create a misimpression. So I asked my staff to get just two \nnumbers. What was the national debt the last day of President Bush's \nsecond term and what is it today--or actually December 7 is the date we \ngot the number for, the 322nd day of President Obama's term. In other \nwords, Dr. Christina Romer was saying these are big problems we \ninherited and we have to deal with them. So how have they dealt with \nthem? Well, it turns out the national debt the last day of President \nBush's second term was $10.6 trillion. What is it today, 322 days \nlater? It is $12 trillion. That is some way to fix that problem.\n  If they are going to complain about the national debt, then get it \nreduced instead of increased in less than a year--it has gone from \n$10.6 trillion to $12 trillion; that is $4.5 billion in new debt every \nsingle day. These are not my numbers, these are the official statistics \nof the Bureau of the Public Debt.\n  The other statistic was unemployment. ``We inherited unemployment.'' \nThat is true. I don't know the average, but I think it is somewhere \naround 4 or 5 percent in our country. On the last day President Bush \nwas in office, unemployment stood at 7.6 percent. I thought, given the \nstimulus package, surely we have reduced unemployment. What is the \nunemployment number today? It is 10 percent--after nearly a year of \nPresident Obama's failed $1 trillion stimulus experience.\n  When Dr. Romer said ``we inherited this problem,'' my immediate \nreaction is that the President has been in office for a year. What has \nhe done about it? Answer: It has gotten worse. We have added well over \n$1 trillion to the national debt, and unemployment is now up to 10 \npercent from 7.6 percent under President Bush.\n  Some fixing of the problem. I suggest that President Obama and his \nWhite House officials and staff stop trying to blame President Bush for \neverything. If the President has been in office long enough to get the \nNobel Peace Prize, presumably he has been in office long enough to do \nsomething about the public debt or unemployment.\n  He has done something about it all right: Unemployment is up from 7.6 \npercent to 10 percent, and the national debt is up from $10.6 trillion \nto $12 trillion.\n  In view of these facts, it doesn't make sense to me to pass a nearly \n$500 billion omnibus appropriations bill, with departments of this \ngovernment receiving 26, 30, and 33 percent increases in their budget, \nwhen the CPI has only gone up .2 percent this year, and when Americans \nare scrimping and saving and trying to get by with less. It makes no \nsense at all.\n  I hope my colleagues, as we consider this omnibus appropriations bill \nbefore us right now, will take these things into consideration before \nwe vote to pile yet more debt on the backs of our taxpaying \nconstituents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes on the \nLabor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies \nappropriations bill. The Senator from Michigan was kind enough to let \nme do this now, even though she had been on the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my comments, the Senator \nfrom Michigan be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, I want to \ntake a few minutes to go over the bill we have before us, the so-called \n``minibus.''\n  I wish in the beginning the Senate could have debated and voted on \nthe Labor-HHS bill individually, rather than having it as part of the \nso-called minibus. Unfortunately, it is now December. We still have to \ncomplete the health care bill and, frankly, we have run out of time.\n  However, I want to assure my colleagues that the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill is a bipartisan bill. We worked closely with \nSenator Cochran and his staff to reflect Democratic and Republican \npriorities alike. That is the tradition in our subcommittee--one we \ntake very seriously.\n  In fact, the full Appropriations Committee approved our bill by a \nvote of 29 to 1. You cannot do much better than that to accommodate the \nconcerns of both parties.\n  I also want to assure Senators that this is a fiscally responsible \nbill. Overall, our bill increases discretionary spending by just 2 \npercent over the fiscal year 2009 Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  With money so tight, we had to be selective about which programs \nreceived increases. One high priority is worker protections. Agencies \nthat enforce rules protecting the health, safety, and rights of workers \nhave been seriously shortchanged in recent years. This bill adds $121 \nmillion over last year's level and brings staffing levels at the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, the Employee Benefits \nAdministration, and the Employment Standards Administration back to \nwhere they were in 2001. This means the agencies will have the \nresources they need to prevent wage theft and ensure safe workplaces \nfor our Nation's workers.\n\n[[Page S12890]]\n\n  The bill also includes a 50-percent increase--a total $1.1 billion--\nto reduce improper payments, fraud, and abuse from mandatory benefit \nprograms, such as unemployment insurance, Medicare, and Social \nSecurity. These antifraud, anti-abuse measures could result in over $48 \nbillion in savings and increased revenues over the next 10 years.\n  Another priority we had was getting people back to work. This bill \nprovides an increase of $72 million, or 43 percent, for nurse training \nprograms, including a new program to train nursing home aides and home \nhealth aides.\n  This bill also provides a major increase--$260 million--for the \nnational service programs. This will boost the number of AmeriCorps \nmembers significantly and create a new social innovation fund that will \nhelp small nonprofits tackle a host of social programs.\n  In the area of education, increases are targeted to programs that are \ndesigned to reform schools, such as performance-based pay for teachers \nand principals, charter schools, and a comprehensive new literacy \nprogram.\n  Providing increases, such as the ones I have described, meant making \nsome tough choices. Our bill eliminated 11 duplicative and ineffective \nprograms, and we cut several others. Not everybody will be happy with \nall of those decisions. I may not be happy with all of them, but we did \nthe best we could, struck compromises, and I stand by the outcome.\n  I also support the other five bills in this minibus, if I might say \nthat. I worked closely with our colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I want to particularly thank Senator Murray regarding her \nwork to allow fiscal year 2009 Community Development Block Grant funds \nto be used as a match for other Federal programs. The reason this is \nimportant is because many States and local governments were hard hit by \nboth disasters--such as the floods in Iowa--and the poor economy. They \nwould have great difficulty providing Federal match requirements \nwithout this modification. I thank Senator Murray for putting that in \nher bill.\n  I also thank Senator Durbin for the inclusion of a provision \nregarding auto dealers. In my State, there are a number of decisions \nthat were made by General Motors to close down certain dealerships that \nmet the criteria set down by General Motors for staying in business. I \nhope this provision that Senator Durbin put in will allow for needed \nfairness for a number of these family businesses.\n  Again, I believe the package of bills we have before us is fiscally \nresponsible. They move our country in the right direction, and I hope \nthe Senate will approve them as soon as possible so we can send them to \nthe President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my good friend from Iowa leaves \nthe floor, I thank him for his wonderful leadership on the health care \nreform bill, on the appropriations that he chaired--formerly on \nAgriculture. It has been a pleasure to partner with him on so many \nthings.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as \nin morning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to talk about health care. I have \nto say that if 20 percent of what was being said by our Republicans \nfriends was true about this bill, I could not vote for it either.\n  I keep hearing things described that have no relationship to the \nreality of the bill that I helped to write in the Finance Committee, or \nmy friends helped to write in the HELP Committee or the bill that is on \nthe floor now. I see all kinds of comments that, frankly, concern me \nbecause I don't see them reflected in the reality of the legislation in \nfront of us.\n  I encourage people to take the opportunity to read the bill or the \nsummaries. For the people in Michigan, we have had it up on our Web \nsite, and we have had every bill, as it is introduced and passed, on \nthe Web site, so people will have an opportunity to look at the \ninformation available.\n  I do know this: What we have been hearing from our colleagues is not \ngood enough, when we think about the fact that we had a Congress and a \nWhite House for 6 out of the last 8 years that was controlled the by \nRepublican Party and yet nothing was done. Proposals have come forward \nnow about all these things that should be done. But they weren't done \nwhen they were in charge. What we saw was a lot of tax cuts for the \nwealthy people and a lot of no-bid contracts for friends of people in \nthe administration. We saw a lot of things that didn't affect people in \nmy State very positively and didn't help the working people in my great \nState of Michigan.\n  But now, as we are trying to move forward and do something for \npeople, for small businesses and large businesses, and bring down costs \nand provide health care for people, there are all kinds of suggestions \nabout why we should wait and do it over. What I heard in committee and \nwhat I am hearing now on the floor, as a proposal--because we don't \nhave a Republican bill in front of us or one that has been offered--is \nthis: Wait, wait, wait. We don't need to do this. That doesn't have to \nbe done right now. There is no sense of urgency. We should wait, wait, \nwait.\n  That is what we hear. We hear that business as usual for the \ninsurance companies is OK. Let them decide what is covered--if you can \nfind insurance--and how much it should cost, whether or not they are \ngoing to be able to provide a test for you or an operation for you. \nThat is OK. Let the insurance companies continue to be the ones between \nyou and your doctor. That is what we have seen over and over. We saw it \nin committee. Every time we were trying to lower costs for families and \nsmall businesses, they were on the side of helping the insurance \ncompanies. They were willing to take tax cuts we put in the bill, and \nthey offered amendment after amendment that would have had higher costs \nfor middle-class families and small businesses, in order to help the \ninsurance industry.\n  I will share a few stories from people who have become part of our \nhealth care people's lobby through my Web site, who have been willing \nto share stories.\n  David is from Sutton's Bay, which is a beautiful part of Michigan. We \nwould love to have you come visit. It is a gorgeous part right on the \nwater. David says:\n\n       I'm a 61-year-old cancer survivor with diabetes and high \n     blood pressure. I am self-employed, and lately, uninsured. I \n     worked all my life to build a stake here in farm country and \n     almost lost it last fall to foreclosure because of a medical \n     emergency. This farm is all I have . . . the savings and cash \n     are gone. I continue to work with no retirement in sight. I \n     have put everything I had for retirement into my farm. \n     Please, help me keep it.\n\n  I know that David is not saying wait, wait, wait. He wants us to act, \nand to act now, on something that will be meaningful and makes sense to \nbring down costs, to give him a chance to find affordable insurance \nthat doesn't bankrupt him and his family.\n  I want to share also another story from Jeff from Rockford, MI:\n\n       It has been over five years since death stared me down. I \n     was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Losing my job to a \n     layoff, mortgage to pay, among other things--and my options \n     were minuscule. I had no insurance then because there was \n     none that I could afford.\n       I thank God and the staff at Grand Rapids Spectrum Health \n     for my life today. Unfortunately, I am still $25,000 in debt \n     because of lack of coverage.\n       I served in the Marines from 1984-1988. One of their mottos \n     is, ``We take care of our own.'' Imagine what this country \n     would be like if we all thought like that.\n\n  Jeff is right. We are in this together and, just as we have \ndramatically increased our support for our veterans and their health \ncare, we need to make sure we are taking care of our own American \nfamilies and American businesses.\n  Wait, wait, wait? I don't think so. I don't think that is what Jeff \nis asking us to do.\n  Jennifer from Hollow, MI:\n\n       I am married and have one beautiful little girl. But about \n     6 months ago, my husband's work informed us they would no \n     longer be able to carry health insurance for their workers.\n\n  A very common story, having to choose between keeping people employed \nand paying for health care.\n\n       We could have gone on COBRA but it would have cost double \n     what we were paying and we couldn't meet that cost.\n\n\n[[Page S12891]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, as you know, we have worked to lower the cost of \nCOBRA, and we hope to be able to continue that lower cost in \nlegislation that will be coming up shortly. But it is still very \nexpensive.\n\n       We are lucky because Michigan has a program for children, \n     so we didn't have to worry about our daughter's coverage. \n     When we went to look for insurance for my husband and me, the \n     prices were steep or we were denied because of my preexisting \n     condition.\n\n  That is one of the things we are going to change.\n\n       Right now going to the doctor is next to impossible, but to \n     see a specialist is like asking for the Moon. We know that we \n     are highly blessed. My husband has a job. That is more than a \n     lot of people have. We just want affordable health insurance, \n     and we don't mind paying for it. It just doesn't seem like \n     too much to ask, does it?\n\n  No, Jennifer, it is not too much to ask, and that is what we are all \nabout. We are all about putting together a plan--and that is what is in \nfront of us--that will lower costs, that will save lives, save \nMedicare, that will focus on making sure each American has a health \ncare bill of rights, has protections they know will allow them to make \nsure their health insurance will be available if they pay for it; that \nthey cannot get dropped because of a technicality; that if they have a \npreexisting condition, they can still find affordable insurance; that \nthere will no longer be lifetime caps on insurance policies; that we \nwill allow our young people to stay on mom's or dad's insurance until \nage 26.\n  We have a number of changes we are making for people in the insurance \nexchange, for policies that take effect after the effective date of \nthis act, and it is about making sure people have affordable insurance \nand they are getting what they are paying for. That is what this is \nabout.\n  What happens if we do nothing--if we do nothing; if we wait, wait, \nwait, like the Republicans are saying? Every single day 14,000 \nAmericans lose their health insurance; 14,000 people got up today with \nhealth insurance and they will go to bed without it. That happens every \nsingle day.\n  Insurance rates are going to double in the next few years, by 2016. \nBusiness costs are going to double. Increased premiums are going to \ncost us, it is expected, 3.5 million more jobs. I don't know about any \nof my colleagues, but we cannot afford to lose any more jobs in \nMichigan. Health care is directly related to jobs and our international \ncompetitiveness.\n  We know incomes of families will be reduced. We know every 5,000 \nhomes will be foreclosed as a result of a health crisis, and 62 percent \nof the bankruptcies are as a result of a health care crisis.\n  Wait, like our Republican colleagues say? No, we cannot wait. The \nfamilies, the people I talked about and read their stories, they cannot \nwait. Families cannot wait. Businesses cannot wait. Small businesses \nthat cannot find insurance cannot wait. Large businesses that are \nfinding themselves in difficult situations, considering pulling up shop \nand going to another country because of lower health care costs cannot \nwait.\n  People expect us to solve this problem. They expect us to come \ntogether and work together, without all the stalling and the objections \nand the partisan politics. They expect us to come together and solve \nwhat is a huge American problem by bringing down costs and creating \naccess to affordable health care where people know that the insurance \ncompany will not be the one that is standing between them and their \ndoctor.\n  This is about saving lives, saving money, saving Medicare. Mr. \nPresident, 45,000 people will lose their lives in the coming year. And \n45,000 families will have one less chair or an empty chair at the \nholiday dinners that are coming up because 45,000 people could not find \naffordable insurance in this country--Americans, in America.\n  Saving money--this is about making sure small businesses get the tax \ncuts they need to help them buy insurance, to make sure that families \nwho are buying through the new insurance pool get the tax cuts they \nneed to afford to buy insurance.\n  This is about making sure large businesses begin to see costs come \ndown over time because when they are providing insurance already, they \nare not going to pay the extra costs of folks walking into an emergency \nroom uninsured who are treated and then the costs get rolled over on to \neverybody with insurance.\n  We as a country are going to save dollars, save money over time for \ntaxpayers and strengthen Medicare to bring down costs.\n  And, yes, we are going to save Medicare. We are going to lengthen the \nMedicare trust fund solvency. We are going to make sure overpayments to \nfor-profit insurance companies are reined in so that the majority of \nseniors do not see their premiums go up under Medicare to pay for those \nexcess profits.\n  We are going to make sure we are closing that gap in coverage for \nprescription drugs that has now been called the doughnut hole, where \ntoo many seniors or people with disabilities fall into that hole, \ncannot afford their medicine, and are not able to get the care they \nneed.\n  We are going to make sure preventive care does not have an extra cost \nof a copay or deduction because we know it saves money and saves lives. \nUnder Medicare, we are going to make sure that is there as well.\n  That is what this is about. It is not about waiting. It is not about \nall the other stuff we have heard that are scare tactics. This is about \ntackling and solving a problem for the American people that we cannot \nafford to wait to do any longer.\n  Coming from Michigan, I have to say everything I do, everything I \ncare about is about saving jobs. We know in addition, we truly are \nsaving jobs. We are saving jobs for our large employers right now that \nprovide insurance, have been doing the right thing for years but have \nseen their costs go up 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent every year \nand cannot sustain it anymore. They are cutting health care benefits, \nraising premiums, or laying people off because they cannot afford it.\n  We know our small employers under our package will save 25 percent. I \nbelieve we are going to be doing even more for small businesses.\n  We have tax credits to help companies, and, as I indicated before, \nour plan is going to save 3.5 million jobs that would otherwise be lost \nbecause of the increased health care costs that cause employees to be \nlet go or companies to move overseas.\n  We are talking about saving lives, saving money, saving Medicare. We \nare talking about saving jobs.\n  What we are not talking about is waiting. We are not talking about \nstall tactics or politics. We are way beyond that. I understand there \nis a big strategy to make sure the President of the United States is \nnot successful. There is a big strategy to make sure we are not \nsuccessful in the Senate. We have seen more filibusters and more \nobjections than ever before. The vast majority of the days we have been \nin session--I believe it is 39 weeks now--all but 4 of those we have \nseen filibusters. It has never been done before--filibusters and \nobjections over and over again.\n  We are committed to getting beyond that and focusing on the reality \nof what is happening in people's lives. People are waiting for us to \nstep up and to solve this problem and to give them the ability to have \naccess to affordable health insurance for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  We are not proposing something radical. We are proposing that we fill \nin the gaps for the folks who do not have insurance today, most of whom \nare in a small business, most of whom are working maybe one, two, three \npart-time jobs but they are working and they don't have access to \nhealth insurance, or they are self-employed, as the gentleman I talked \nabout, David, in Suttons Bay, maybe a farmer, maybe a realtor, maybe \nthe next Bill Gates in their garage coming up with the next great \ninvention. They don't have access to the same big insurance pool that a \nbig business has to bring down costs.\n  What we are talking about for those folks who are working or have \nrecently been laid off and cannot find insurance is giving them a way, \na competitive way to buy insurance from an insurance pool.\n  I cannot imagine a more important Christmas present to give to \nAmerican families than the ability to know going forward that when they \nlose their job, they are not going to lose their health\n\n[[Page S12892]]\n\ninsurance; that they have an opportunity, a way to get affordable \ninsurance, and that we have come together as a Senate to focus on \nsaving lives, saving money, and saving Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I would love to interject a question \nto the distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  We are in a situation in which the other side is repeatedly coming to \nthe Senate floor to ask us to delay, to stop, to slow down, to start \nover. I am curious, as somebody who has watched this debate very \nclosely, what the Senator from Michigan thinks about where we would be \nif we acceded to that wish? Bearing in mind that one of the sort of \nideological firebrands who seems to be leading a measure of the debate \non the other side has indicated this is not about health care and \npeople; this is about giving President Obama a Waterloo; this is about \ncreating a political defeat for the President of the United States on \ntheir side; it has nothing to do with health care; it is entirely about \ncreating a defeat for this new President; when, in the face of all the \nobstruction the distinguished Senator from Michigan described so \neloquently, this recordbreaking, ``unprecedented in the history of the \nSenate'' obstruction we are seeing, the person whom I think right now \nseems to characterize the leadership of the radicalized rightwing and \nis running the Republican Party, Rush Limbaugh, is telling the other \nside they have not been obstructive enough.\n  So if we were to go back, start all over, and reach out our hands \nagain to our friends on the Republican side, is there any reason to \nbelieve that we would not be just as rebuffed going forward as we have \nbeen in the long arduous process of negotiation and hearing and public \nmeeting and all of the work that has taken us to this point right now?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island for \nthe question and for his advocacy and understanding of how we bring \ndown costs and what we should be doing in so many areas for families \nand for businesses in the country.\n  I will just say that we have, first of all, attempted to get \nsomething done for years. In the last couple of years, reaching out to \nRepublicans in an unprecedented way, our distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, as everyone knows, went to unparalleled lengths in \nreaching out and spending months and months putting together a work \ngroup of three Democrats and three Republicans to work in good faith to \nget something done.\n  We have accepted Republican ideas. I know on the HELP Committee there \nwere many amendments accepted from Republican colleagues. We have \ncontinued to reach out and look for ways to work together.\n  But what we are seeing is a lack of desire to work together and more \nthan just a lack of desire, as the Senator indicated, but simply to \nattempt to embarrass the President of the United States, to stop him \nfrom being successful, and to stop us politically, when the reality is \nvery serious. This is not about a President. We have had 100 years of \nPresidents trying to do this. This is not a particular Senate. We have \nhad Senates for years that have been trying to do this. This is about \nwhen are we going to get beyond all this? When are we going to actually \nget beyond this and focus on the reality of what is going on in \npeople's lives, what is going on in every small business that is trying \nto figure out how to pay the bills and hold it together or every \nmanufacturer in my great State that is trying to figure out how they \nare going to hold it together. At one point, the American people will \nhave every right to say to us: When are you guys going to get beyond \nthis stuff?\n  The good news is, we have a President who has said now is when we are \ngoing to put it behind us and the Senate has said now is the time and \nwe will work in good faith with anyone who wants to work with us. But \nwe will not wait, which is what we are being asked to do--wait until \nanother time, when 45,000 more people will have died next year, when \nanother 5,000 people a day will have lost their homes to foreclosure.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If we were to wait, does the Senator think there is \nany likelihood people on the other side would suddenly want to \ncooperate with President Obama and not hand him a defeat? If Rush \nLimbaugh would say: OK, Republicans in the Senate, go ahead, work with \nthe Democrats now; don't just be the party of obstruction and delay but \ntry to work cooperatively for the American people, does the Senator \nthink there is any likelihood of that happening?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would like to think there would be a likelihood of \nthat happening, but I can't imagine it. Frankly, and I think \nunfortunately, they view it in their self-interest, whether it is a \nbusiness decision, as a radio host, or whether it is a decision of the \nother party. I appreciate the fact that it is hard to lose elections. \nWe have all been in those situations. I appreciate the fact that folks \ndon't want to be in the minority. Most of us have been in that \nsituation. So I appreciate that. But I think all of us were hoping this \nyear, with two wars, with the deficit we have, with the challenge on \nhealth care, with the need to create jobs, and with the financial \ncrisis we are in, that somehow it would be different for a while.\n  I would ask my colleague if he had the same sense of hope coming in; \nthat this year maybe there would be a moratorium on the partisanship; \nthat we could actually come together in the interest of the country and \nsolve problems before going back to the elections. I would ask my \nfriend if he was as surprised as I was that there was not only no \nstopping after the election but that the same folks who led things \nduring the election are leading them right here on the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I share the disappointment of the Senator from \nMichigan; that the promise and the outreached hands have been rejected \nand rebuffed; that this place has become so bitterly partisan. This is \nmy first time in the Senate with a Democratic President, and I have \nbeen surprised at the tone of the debate, at the lack of truth of a \ngreat many of the arguments, of the very apparent motivation.\n  I have spoken to members of our caucus who I think are probably \nviewed as some of the most moderate when it comes to seeking \nbipartisanship, who are calm and respected Members of the Senate and \nwho have been here a long time, and I have asked them how this compares \nto their long years of experience in the Senate. One of them said he \nhas literally never seen anything like it in all the years he has been \nin the Senate. He has never seen anything like it. They are always on \nmessage, he said, but I have never seen them so off truth.\n  I think it is regrettable, but if your mission is to destroy a strong \nand important piece of legislation, not because it is bad legislation \nbut because you can't stand having this new President win a political \nvictory, are you going to go out and disclose that is your motivation? \nNo, you are going to come up with a bunch of other cockamamie arguments \nto paper that over. You will talk about death panels and you will go \nthrough all the nonsense we have seen and it is regrettable.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I might interject with my friend, I have been handed \na note that says, in fact, there have been over 150 amendments offered \nby Republicans, and so our attempts have been ongoing to reach out.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I think those were the Republican amendments that \nwere accepted into the HELP Committee bill. In fact, I think there were \n161, if I remember correctly from my time sitting on the committee. We \ntook Republican amendment after Republican amendment after Republican \namendment trying to reach out to them.\n  Ms. STABENOW. So we have over 300 pages of the bill which contain \nRepublican amendments, and that is fine. There is no ownership in the \nsense of who has the better ideas. In fact, what I find interesting is \nthe insurance exchange we have in the bill for small businesses--which \nis at the heart of coverage of small businesses and individuals--has \nbeen offered by Republicans and Democrats. I believe distinguished \nformer Senator Bob Dole offered some form of an exchange back during \nthe debate when President Clinton was in office.\n\n[[Page S12893]]\n\n  So we are not trying to claim a corner on ideas. There are many ideas \nthat have been available and talked about for years. It is a matter of \nhaving the will, the commitment to actually do the hard work people \nexpect us to do in order to get this done. I think that is what is so \nimportant about this time, when the average family is finding \nthemselves unraveling, with not knowing if their job is going to \ncontinue to be available or if there will be a cut in wages. They are \npaying more out of pocket for everything under the Sun and then \nworrying if the employer is thinking: Well, you can have your job or \nyour health insurance because the employer can't keep both going.\n  The fact is, we have lost so many middle-class jobs--and I will spend \nanother time talking about the loss of manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry. We have lost a lot of our middle class in terms of good-paying \njobs. So people are now saying: Wait a minute, just being the party of \nno, that is not going to be enough. That is not good enough--just \nsaying no for political reasons. That is not enough. We want to know \nwhat you are going to say yes to. We want to know how you are going to \nwork together. We want to know how are you going to actually solve a \nproblem.\n  When someone such as Joe, from Rockford, MI, says he served in the \nMarines for 4 years and their motto is: ``We take care of our own,'' my \nquestion is: When are we going to come together and take care of our \nown Americans? I don't mean literally taking care of every person but \ncreating opportunity for people, creating the climate for people to \nhave a job, to have health insurance, to send the kids to college, to \nbe able to afford to keep their lights on, and to be able to know that \ntheir country is on their side. That is what this is about. They do not \nwant us to wait more, they want us to move quickly--move quickly on \nhealth care and jobs and all the other issues that are so important to \ntheir families.\n  So I thank my friend from Rhode Island for joining me, because there \nis a sense of urgency that people have, and we need to have that sense \nof urgency to get things done--to work together and to get things done. \nFrankly, one of the things our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have successfully done is united our caucus in its determination \nto not let this kind of stalling and objections and tactics, which are \nslowing things down, stop us from actually solving a huge problem that \nhas gone too long unsolved for the American people.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are considering the omnibus bill. \nOnce again, I have to say that we are heading recklessly, at a high \nrate of speed, toward the most reckless spending this Nation has ever \nseen. We saw some big spending during World War II but nothing like \nthis, in the kind of environment we are in today. Plus, then we had the \nwhole Nation working to win that life-and-death struggle.\n  I will just say a few things about this omnibus bill. First, I don't \nthink any of us should support it. Why? It is unacceptable. Why? It is \nthe kind of spending that has caused the American people to be outraged \nand to go out in the streets. People told me they had never been to a \nrally before in their lives, but they went out because they are afraid \nfor their country.\n  Look at the package of spending that is in this legislation--the \nCommerce, Justice, and Science bill has been cobbled together with the \nothers. There are 6 of the 13 appropriations bills all packaged \ntogether into 1 to see if they can't ram it through during the last \ndays before Christmas so nobody will have the gumption to cause a fuss \nabout it and so we can just get this done. What is it that is contained \nin the legislation that causes such angst on my part and on the part of \nothers? I will explain it for you.\n  Here are the numbers. The Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations \nbill contains $64 billion in spending. The percent of growth over last \nyear's spending is 12 percent. Just to recall for my colleagues, if you \nknow the rule of seven, which you learn in accounting: at a 7-percent \ngrowth rate--or if you have an interest rate of 7 percent--your money \nwill double in value in 10 years. Here we have a 12-percent increase. \nThat means the expenditure line of Commerce, Justice, and Science \nincreases at 12 percent, which would double that whole amount in about \n7 years. Do you think that is what the American people want? This does \nnot count the stimulus package we passed earlier this year. My wife \nsays: Quit saying we passed, when you voted against it. I didn't vote \nfor it. It was $800 billion, and $15 billion went into Commerce, \nJustice, and Science appropriations. So we go from $64 billion in this \nbill and add $15 billion on top of that amount, which is already being \nspent.\n  What about a second one--financial services. It has a 7-percent \nincrease. The rate of inflation is what, 1 percent? On top of this \nbill, we add about a $7 billion infusion in financial services from the \nstimulus package. Last year, the spending was $22 billion; this year, \nit is $24 billion. Add $6.9 billion on top of that and you have about \n$31 billion, which is a massive increase.\n  Labor, HHS, and Education also increased at 7 percent, and it \nreceived $72 billion extra from the stimulus package. I am not counting \nthe stimulus when I say it is a 7-percent increase. I am talking about \nthe baseline budget. Military Construction and Veterans Affairs is \noddly the lowest. It only received a 5-percent raise. Well, 5 percent \nis still a big increase when the inflation rate is below 2, and it \nreceived $4 billion from the stimulus, which is not much. The stimulus \ngave very little to military matters.\n  What about the State Department and Foreign Operations? How much did \nthat budget line increase over last year? Thirty-three percent. We \ndon't have to increase State and Foreign Operations 33 percent. This is \nbeyond a reasonable amount by any stretch of the imagination, and it \nalso received an increase in the stimulus package.\n\n  What about Transportation and Housing and Urban Development? What \nkind of increase did they get in this year's budget, in a time when the \nAmerican people are having to cut their budgets, when they try to save \nmore than they ever saved before, trying to find work if they or family \nmembers are losing jobs, when they are not getting overtime like they \ndid before, when other things are tightening them up and the fear of \nunemployment is out there; what does Transportation and HUD get in the \nbaseline budget? Not counting the stimulus money: 23 percent increase. \nWith a 23-percent increase you double the whole Transportation-HUD \nbudget in 4 years. This is not responsible.\n  By the way, the baseline Transportation-HUD budget in 2009 was $54 \nbillion. It was $54 billion, and the stimulus package added $61.8 \nbillion on top of that.\n  The omnibus bill in all of the spending lines amounts to an increase \nof 12 percent. This is unsustainable, and the 12 percent does not \ninclude the huge amount of money that was funded through the stimulus \npackage.\n  I see my colleague here, one of our stalwart Members of this Senate. \nI will yield to him, but I just want to be on record saying I would \nlove to vote for these bills. I voted for many of these funding bills \nin years past, but I am not going to vote for a package that increases \nspending of the Federal Government at 12 percent when the average \nAmerican is lucky to have a job and inflation in this country is 1 or 2 \npercent. This makes no sense to me.\n  Remember, this spending is in addition to the amount of money \napproved in the stimulus package--$800 billion.\n  If you would like to know how much money $800 billion amounts to, the \ngeneral fund budget in my State of Alabama--we are an average size \nState--is less than $2 billion. The entire total spending of these six \nbills in this omnibus package is $445 billion, and we spent in \nFebruary--this Congress approved without my support $800 billion extra \nto try to stimulate the economy. Unfortunately, it has been frittered \naway without the kind of impact we need.\n  I am worried what we are doing. I appreciate having this opportunity \nto share those comments, and I will speak more about it in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's great remarks. \nI rise today to discuss an important aspect of this multifaceted health \ncare\n\n[[Page S12894]]\n\nreform bill that is now pending on the Senate floor. It is tax \nincreases and who will bear the burden of those tax increases. I have \nactually heard some stand on the Senate floor and say there are tax \nreductions. Who are they kidding? The gargantuan piece of legislation \nlaying before us provides plenty of fodder for debate and discussion. \nThis debate and discussion is taking place all over the country among \nAmericans everywhere: over the family breakfast table, during breaks at \nwork around the water cooler, in corporate boardrooms, and bowling \nalleys, and during Christmas shopping trips.\n  Of course, right here in the Senate we have already had many hours of \ndebate about the health care bill, with many more likely to come. As \none peruses the 2,074 pages that comprise the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act--this bill--it quickly becomes obvious that this \nbill encompasses many topics and touches on a comprehensive array of \nissues dealing with our health care system.\n  However, it is not until near the very end of the bill, starting on \npage 1,979, that we find title IX, which deals with revenue offset \nprovisions. Perhaps it is because this title is near the end of this \nseemingly endless bill that we have heard relatively little discussion \nabout the new taxes it creates or perhaps it is because the tax title \nis relatively short, a mere 67 pages.\n  No matter the reason, I believe it is vital that the American people \nunderstand something about these new taxes before we are asked to vote \non this legislation, this gargantuan legislation.\n  Before I get into the specifics of the new taxes and tax increases in \nthis bill, I need to inform my Utahns and Americans everywhere that \nthey are being sold a bill of goods when it comes to these taxes.\n  Based on what President Obama promised during his campaign last year, \nevery individual American taxpayer earning less than $200,000 per year, \nand every family making less than $250,000 per year is justified in \nbelieving that this health care bill, which has been endorsed by the \nPresident, would not raise their taxes. Here is the direct quote from \ncandidate Barack Obama in New Hampshire on September 12, 2008:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge. Under my plan no family making \n     less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase.\n\n  Unfortunately, this bill places the cost of health care reform \nsquarely on the backs of the taxpayers and mostly on the 98 percent of \nAmericans the President promised to protect from new taxes. That is \nwhat it said. President Obama's exact words were:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making \n     less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase.\n\n  The President went on to promise:\n\n       Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital \n     gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\n\n  However, when one looks at the list of revenue offsets beginning on \npage 1,979, we see all but 5 of the 14 revenue raisers included there \nwould hit families making less than $250,000.\n  There is a cornucopia of new taxes on middle-income Americans in this \nlegislation: a limitation on itemized medical expense deductions for \nmedical expenses; an excise tax on the high-cost health insurance \nplans; a new tax on medical devices such as wheelchairs, breast pumps, \nand syringes used by diabetics for insulin injections; a limit on \ncontributions to flexible spending accounts; an increase on the penalty \nfor unqualified distributions from a health savings account; an \nincrease in the payroll tax, and on and on.\n  Look at all these taxes: itemized medical expense deduction, fees on \ndrug manufacturers, high-cost plan tax--by the way those are passed on \nto you and me and every other consumer, most of whom are less than \n$250,000-a-year earners--fees on health insurers, nonqualified HSA \ndistribution from 10 percent to 20 percent, fees on medical device \nmanufacturers, fees on FSAs--a $2,500 cap on FSAs--people who have \nsuffered from disabilities and other problems, they can't live with \nthat kind of cap--and an individual mandate penalty excise tax, all of \nthose. That is just mentioning a few of them. It goes on and on.\n  Some of these would directly hit many taxpayers who make less than \n$200,000, such as this 5 percent excise tax on cosmetic surgery, while \nothers would in the form of higher fees and penalties that would \nultimately be passed on to the consumer.\n  This is certainly the indication with the new ``industry fees'' that \nwould be assessed on several sectors of the health care industry.\n  Who do they think is going to pay for those? It is you and me and \neverybody else. Look at this chart, the biggest single tax increase in \nthis health care bill is also one of the most insidious. This is the \n40-percent excise tax on high-cost insurance.\n  By 2019, 88 percent, or $30.5 billion will be borne by individual \ntaxpayers. Eighty-four percent of those will be individuals who make \nless than $200,000 or families who make less than $250,000. That is \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, upon which I sit. It is a \nnonpartisan committee.\n  This is the 40-percent excise tax on health insurance coverage that \nexceeds $8,500 for single families or $23,500 for families.\n  The unions in this country are going crazy over that, and with good \nreason.\n  The proponents of this idea tell us it is necessary in order to \n``bend the cost curve'' downward and get the cost of health care under \ncontrol. However, in reality, this is simply a bastardized version of \nthe concept that might have been effective in discouraging employees \nfrom bargaining for too much insurance because it is a tax-free \nbenefit; that is, for corporations that provide it, a cap on the value \nof tax-free, employer-provided health insurance.\n  The original concept, which was discussed at length in the finance \ncommittee earlier in the process of developing health care reform \nlegislation this year, has merit if done correctly. By providing a \ndirect disincentive to the very individuals who would suffer the tax \nincrease, this original idea would have discouraged purchasing or \nbargaining for higher cost insurance simply because of the tax benefit.\n  However, this bill and the one approved by the Finance Committee does \nnot take this route. Instead, it takes the cowardly approach and \napplies the tax increase at the insurer level.\n  Why is this a bad idea? For one thing, the tax increase occurs at a \nlevel two steps removed from the individual employee, which is where \nthe decision to buy a less costly plan is made. Rather, the tax is \nassessed on the insurance company which has no choice but to pass the \ncost of the tax on to the employer and the employee who, together, pay \nthe cost of the policy.\n  Instead of providing a disincentive for purchasing more health \ninsurance than is necessary, applying the tax at the insurer level \nsimply increases the cost of insurance without the employer and \nemployee necessarily even knowing why the cost has gone up.\n  You wonder why insurance costs go up?\n  So for the sake of avoiding what appears to be a direct tax increase \non workers, this approach loses the benefit of the original idea of \nbending down the cost curve by providing a disincentive. But make no \nmistake, this increased cost of these insurance plans will be passed on \nto the employees.\n  ``Forty percent excise tax on high-cost insurance''--which most \npeople will have. This is not even--\n\n       . . . by 2019, 88 percent or $30.5 billion will be borne by \n     individual taxpayers; 84 percent of those will be individuals \n     who make less than $200,000 or families who make less than \n     $250,000. The Joint Tax Committee.\n\n  My gosh, when does it end?\n  Moreover this tax burden would not be just on those whom the \nPresident says he wants to target for tax increases, those making over \n$200,000 per year as individuals or $250,000 per year for families. Far \nfrom it.\n  Data from the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation showed that \nonly 16 percent of the $30.5 billion borne by individual taxpayers in \n2019 would be paid by those making over $200,000 per year. This means \nthat 84 percent or almost $26 billion for this 1 year only would be \npaid by those whom the President promised to protect against tax \nincreases.\n  Unfortunately, the excise tax on high-cost insurance policies is not \nthe only way the health care bill would increase the cost of health \ninsurance. To add insult to injury, the bill also includes a $6 billion \nannual fee assessed on providers of health insurance.\n  I have heard the other side just condemn health insurers, day in and \nday out. Yet they are adding all these costs\n\n[[Page S12895]]\n\nto the health insurers that have to pass them on to the individual \ncitizens, or insurees.\n  As I understand it, the rationale behind this misguided idea is that \nhealth insurance companies will be enjoying a windfall from this bill \nin that millions of new customers will become insured for the first \ntime. Therefore, the reasoning goes, the health insurance industry will \nbe earning billions of dollars that they would not have otherwise made, \nall because of the beneficial aspects of this health reform bill.\n  Therefore, since these companies will be reaping all of this extra \nprofit, why should we not tax them on this windfall in the form of this \nannual fee as though those costs are not going to be passed on? This is \na bad idea on so many levels. First, it assumes that the insurance \ncompanies will actually be gaining all of these new customers. \nSecondly, it assumes that the insurance companies will be making money \nfrom these new customers if they indeed gain them. Keep in mind, they \nare talking now in the back rooms. Nobody knows what they have \nconcluded. They are talking about putting people into Medicare from 55 \nyears old on, where today you have to be 65 years of age to be able to \nqualify for Medicare. Now they want to do that at 55. What does that \nmean? That means the sickest of the sick will go into Medicare. People \nare going to push them out of regular policies and others will go into \nMedicare, so these insurance companies aren't going to make all the \nmoney the Democrats say they are.\n  The third assumption is the most troubling. That is that it would be \nthe insurance companies themselves that would bear the burden of these \nfees. These are all dangerous assumptions. The third one is downright \nfallacious. It assumes that corporations suffer the incidence of \ntaxation. As anyone with a modicum of economic training knows, \ncorporations do not bear the burden of taxes, people do. Specifically, \nit is the people who work for the corporation, who own the corporation, \nand who are the customers of the corporation who ultimately pay the \ntax. They are passed right on to the people. This is not the only \ndangerous new excise tax in this bill. We have a whole passel of them. \nA new excise tax on health insurance providers. Look at this, excise \ntaxes in the health care bill, excise tax on health insurance \nproviders, new tax on pharmaceuticals, a new tax on medical devices, a \nnew tax on high-cost insurance plans, and a new tax on cosmetic \nsurgery. In the case of competitive markets, an excise tax is generally \nborne by consumers in the form of higher prices in the long term. At \nleast this is what the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation said to \nme in a letter on these insurance industry fees, dated October 28, \n2009. Why in the world would we want to add a fee to the health \ninsurance industry when we know it will be passed right on to consumers \nof the health insurance in the form of higher insurance costs? That \nmeans you and me. That means the employee. That means the person who \nbears the burden. I thought the purpose of this health reform bill was \nto rein in health care costs.\n  How much does this so-called health care reform bill harm taxpayers \nand violate President Obama's promise not to raise taxes on the middle \nclass? Let me tell you about one of the most egregious tax increases in \nthis bill. I have always believed that one of the major purposes of \nhealth care reform is to lower the cost of medical expenses to American \nfamilies and especially to vulnerable American families. Therefore, it \nmakes no sense to me that this bill should include this next tax \nincrease which would largely hit the sickest Americans. This proposal \nwould increase the threshold for deducting medical expenses from \ntoday's level of 7.5 percent to 10 percent of adjusted gross income. \nThis seemingly small change is projected by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation to cost taxpayers over $15 billion over 10 years. Which \ntaxpayers would suffer this tax increase? The ones earning more than \n$250,000 per year that President Obama pledged would be the only \nAmericans to be saddled with a tax hike under his administration? \nHardly. Of the many millions of families affected by this change, only \na few thousand have incomes over $200,000. Think about that. The vast \nmajority of the victims of this tax hit would be below that figure, \nwith many of them being far from wealthy. In fact, a high percentage of \nthe taxpayers affected by this change make less than $75,000 per year.\n  Look at this. If your income equals $100,000, then you need to incur \n$10,000 worth of medical expenses before you become eligible for the \ndeduction. Millions of taxpayers making less than $200,000 will be \naffected. The deduction for medical expenses has been in the Tax Code \nfor decades. Its purpose is to provide relief to Americans who face \ncatastrophic medical expenses in relation to the size of their income. \nIt is designed so that an average or usual amount of health care costs \nwill not trigger the relief. Like I say, a family earning $100,000 this \nyear would have to have medical expenses exceeding $7,500 before the \ndeduction kicks in. This does not count what insurance pays but only \nwhat the family would fork over in out-of-pocket costs.\n  Even for those with the most basic health insurance, 7.5 percent of \nfamily income spent for medical expenses is a large amount. In many \ncases, this much medical cost relative to income is caused by chronic \nhealth conditions or serious accidents or injuries, and this is exactly \nthe point. The current tax law rightly says that if a family has to pay \ncatastrophic or near catastrophic amounts for health care during the \nyear, relief is available. By design this deduction is there only for \nthose who need it. So the big question is: Why we would want to \nincrease taxes on those with already high medical expenses by making it \ntougher for them to get relief from catastrophic medical expenses. But \nthe real conundrum is why would we do this as part of a bill that is \nsupposed to rein in health care costs.\n  It is no wonder my fellow Utahns and Americans everywhere are \nquestioning the wisdom of this bill. As with so many other features of \nthis so-called health reform plan, this doesn't make sense.\n  There is much more I want to say about the tax increases in this \nbill. American taxpayers need to know the truth about what is about to \nhit them, if the majority has its way. I have not yet mentioned the new \nindustry fee on medical device companies. Because my home State of Utah \nhas many such companies, I plan to address this new fee in a separate \nfloor statement as this debate progresses.\n  Let me summarize by reminding my colleagues that the tax increases in \nthis bill fly in the face of the promises made by the President, the \nleader of the majority party in Congress who has explicitly endorsed \nthis legislation. The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation recently \nconducted a distributional analysis of how four of these tax increase \nprovisions affect American taxpayers. Under that analysis, in 2019, \nindividuals making over $75,000 and families making over $75,000 will \nsee their taxes increase under this bill. That is equal to 42 million \nmiddle-income taxpayers. Think about that: 42 million middle-income \ntaxpayers all making less than $200,000 per year and all of them, told \nby the President that they would be protected from tax increases, will \nbe hit and hit hard by this bill. This is after taking into account the \ntax effects of the advanced refundable tax credit for health insurance.\n  Think about this: Millions more middle-income taxpayers will be hit \nby indirect tax increases from the health industry segment fees \nincluded in this bill. There is no question that these fees and other \nexcise taxes will be passed through to the individuals who are \nconsumers of the health care products that are being passed. As we \ndebate this health care bill, it is imperative that the American people \nknow what is in the legislation and how it will affect them. It would \nbe a travesty for us to vote on this before these things are fully \nunderstood and debated. This is one of those few bills that come along \nonly once in a generation or so. It is one of those bills that has the \npotential to change our country forever, for good or bad. In this case, \nit is not for good.\n  The tax increases in this bill are unprecedented in many ways and not \nwell thought out. They will have a devastating effect on the people the \nPresident has promised to protect. The tax increase aspect alone of \nthis leviathan is enough to demand its defeat here in the Senate. But \nthere are so many more ill-advised provisions in the other 2,007 pages \nas well.\n\n[[Page S12896]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to take a good and honest look at these tax \nincreases and make sure they are ready to face the vast majority of \ntheir unsuspecting constituents once they discover what has been done \nto them with this bill, should it pass.\n\n  I am very concerned about this bill. The American people are very \nconcerned about this bill. Polls show they don't support this bill. I \ncan't believe my colleagues on the other side are trying to present it \nas though it is a tax deduction bill when, in fact, it raises taxes in \nbillions and billions of dollars, most of which go to the middle class \nor lower in transferred payments, and causes other problems added to \ntheir woes in health care and their very lives, as we go through all of \nour lives here in the United States. I am very concerned about it. I \nthink everybody ought to be concerned about it. This is one-sixth of \nthe American economy. If we can't get 75 to 80 votes in a bipartisan \nway, you know it is a lousy bill. This is a lousy bill. From what I \nhave heard of the one that even Democrats don't know what form it will \nbe in, it is going to be even more lousy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before us now is an omnibus bill \nwhich contains six different appropriations bills. It was not our \nintention to call this omnibus bill but to call each one of the \nappropriation bills. Unfortunately, it has been impossible to reach \nthat goal because of a strategy that has been employed by the \nRepublican side of the aisle to slow down any debate on any topic as \nmuch as possible, to challenge us with filibusters and force cloture \nvotes and make the Senate go into interminable quorum calls. So many \ntimes we have called bills that came out of the Appropriations \nCommittee with overwhelmingly positive votes only to run into \nroadblocks on the floor. And then after weeks and weeks and weeks of \nprocedural problems tossed our way by the Republican side of the aisle, \nthe bill is finally called and passes by an overwhelming margin. The \nstrategy is clear.\n  It is as clear on the health care bill as it is on the appropriations \nbills that the Republican side of the aisle doesn't want us to \ncomplete. So we are attempting to do our best by consolidating into one \nappropriations bill six different appropriations bills that passed with \noverwhelmingly positive margins out of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. There were three bills that received 30 to nothing votes in \nthe Appropriations Committee and three others that were reported out 29 \nto 1, to give an idea of the kind of support they had. We brought up \nthe Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill on October 6. It took \nus a month to finish that bill because of the delay tactics of the \nother side. That is the reality of what we face. We have run ourselves \ninto the ground day after day, week after week with amendments relating \nto things of little or no consequence. I cannot count how many ACORN \namendments we voted on. It would be a forest of oak trees if those \nacorns were planted. But we voted on them regularly, religiously. We \nmade sure we took care of ACORN, but we didn't take care of the \npeople's business because those amendments wasted our time.\n  These appropriations bills have taken longer and longer because the \nminority will not agree to reasonable time agreements to consider \namendments and finish debate.\n  Instead, we found ourselves consistently sidetracked by the minority, \nspending hours on the floor taking the same votes on keeping ACORN from \nreceiving money from different Federal agencies like the Interior \nDepartment.\n  So, here we are. We have 21 days before the end of the calendar year \nand we need to finish the business of the Congress.\n  To do so, we engaged Republican members of the Appropriations \nCommittee and worked on reasonable compromises to the differing bills \nin the House and Senate.\n  This package of appropriations bills is the result of a truly \nbicameral and bipartisan effort.\n  This package represents the priorities of the American people. The \nconference report invests in students, veterans and law enforcement.\n  The bill before us makes college education more affordable for \nstudents by increasing Pell grants to $5,500.\n  This will help all students, whether they are going to college for \nthe first time or going back to acquire new skills, get the college \neducation necessary to compete in the global economy.\n  The conference report also helps local governments fight crime and \nputs more police on our streets.\n  We have increased grants for State and local law enforcement by $480 \nmillion over last year.\n  These grant programs were cut by almost $2 billion during the last \nadministration.\n  This conference report sets the right priorities by increasing \nfunding essential to helping our States and local police departments \nfight crime.\n  We also help local law enforcement with hiring and training by \nincluding $298 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services or \nCOPS program to put more cops on the beat.\n  This funding will help hire or retain approximately 1,400 police \nofficers.\n  The COPS program has helped train nearly 500,000 law enforcement \npersonnel and put over 121,500 additional officers on the beat \nnationwide.\n  This conference report also helps keep our promise to our Nation's \nveterans by increasing funding for the Veterans Affairs Department by \n$5.3 billion above last year's level.\n  This funding will increase access to quality health care for our \nveterans. In particular, the conference report increases discretionary \nspending at the VA by more than $5 billion to help the VA care for the \nmore than 6.1 million veterans they expect to see in 2010. \n  As chairman of the subcommittee responsible for Division C of this \nconsolidated appropriations bill, I would like to take the next few \nminutes to describe the key components of that portion of this bill.\n  Before doing so, I want to recognize and commend my ranking member, \nSenator Collins, for her helpful counsel, input, and support in \ncrafting the bill. It has been a privilege and pleasure to collaborate \nwith her in addressing the needs of the agencies and programs dependent \non funding under our division of this conference agreement. I am proud \nthat we have produced a truly bipartisan product.\n  This conference agreement allocates budgetary resources totaling \n$46.3 billion. This consists of $24.2 billion in discretionary spending \nand $22.1 billion in mandatory spending for financial services and \ngeneral government accounts. The discretionary funds are $1.6 billion \nabove the fiscal year 2009 enacted level and $40 million less than the \nPresident's request.\n  Our work has provided a valuable opportunity to evaluate the \nresponsibilities, functions, and budgetary needs of the diverse \nagencies and programs under our jurisdiction. Our challenge has been \ndeliberating carefully to make tough decisions within our conference \nfunding allocation to address many worthy requests.\n  The bill provides resources for the Department of the Treasury, the \nExecutive Office of the President and White House operations, the \nFederal judiciary, and the District of Columbia.\n  In addition, the bill funds over two dozen independent and vital, but \noften obscure, Federal agencies responsible for a wide array of \ncritical functions in the delivery of public services.\n  I would like to share some of the highlights of the bill:\n  My top priority this year was to continue to address the resource \nneeds of two of our Nation's premier regulatory agencies: the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. These two agencies occupy pivotal positions at the \nforefront of stimulating and sustaining economic growth and prosperity \nin our country.\n  The CFTC received its fiscal 2010 funding as part of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, signed into law in September. I am pleased to have \nplayed a role in providing that agency with $168.8 million, a 16-\npercent boost above last year.\n  For the Securities and Exchange Commission, this bill includes \n$1,111,000,000, an increase of $85 million above the President's budget \nrequest and $151 million more than the fiscal year 2009 enacted level.\n  The SEC is the investor's advocate. I want to make certain that the \nSEC has\n\n[[Page S12897]]\n\nthe necessary resources to effectively fulfill its singular obligation: \nprotecting shareholders.\n  SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro has charted an aggressive new course to \nstrengthen SEC vigilance by recruiting professional expertise and \ninvesting in enhanced technology. The $85 million increase in this bill \nwill support 420 additional investigators, attorneys, and analysts to \nexpand significantly the SEC's enforcement, examination, risk \nassessment, and market oversight functions.\n  In addition, the SEC will be able to accelerate investments in \nseveral key information technology projects, including installing and \nlaunching a new system to track tips and complaints.\n  The conference bill supports community and small business development \nat a time when these investments are more crucial than ever. With the \neconomy struggling, economic development must be a top priority.\n  Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund \nprogram--CDFI--helps finance community development projects throughout \nthe country and supports basic financial services for underserved \ncommunities. The bill provides $166.8 million for CDFIs to provide \nfinancing for projects such as day care centers, community centers, and \naffordable housing projects in America's underserved neighborhoods.\n  Through the Small Business Administration, the bill provides over \n$824 million to promote the development of America's small businesses. \nThe bill supports $28 billion in new lending to small businesses, \nproviding financing opportunities for small businesses at a time when \nprivate sector credit is difficult, if not impossible, to access. The \nbill also provides $22 million for microloan technical assistance \ngrants and supports $25 million in microlending.\n  Funding also supports SBA's partners, including Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, Women's Business Centers, and Veterans Business \nOutreach Centers. These partners form a foundation of support to help \nAmerica's small businesses weather the economic downturn and assist \nnewly unemployed Americans seeking advice on starting a small business \nas a new career path.\n  As we have done in the past few years, this bill provides a \nsignificant funding increase for the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. To help keep CPSC on track to meet its new responsibilities \nunder the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, the bill provides \n$118.2 million, an increase of $13 million above last year's level and \n$11 million above the budget request.\n  These funds will help expand the import safety initiative, which puts \nCPSC inspectors at key U.S. ports, and to further investigate suspected \nproblems with imported drywall from China. With these resources, the \nCPSC can provide the nation with a robust safety program and protect \nthe public against unreasonable risk of injury associated with consumer \nproducts.\n  For the Internal Revenue Service, the bill provides $12.2 billion. Of \nthis, $7 billion is for tax law enforcement, $387 million more than \nlast year, to help advance the administration's initiative to target \nwealthy individuals and businesses who avoid U.S. taxes by sheltering \nmoney in overseas tax havens.\n  The bill provides nearly $6.4 billion to enable the Federal judiciary \nto carry out constitutional responsibilities to administer justice and \nresolve disputes impartially under the rule of law.\n  Of the $752 million in Federal funding for the District in this bill, \nthe largest portion, $563 million, is designated for the local courts \nand criminal justice system including public defender services and \npretrial and postconviction offender supervision.\n  In addition, the bill provides a total of $186 million in Federal \nfunds for local District of Columbia activities under the control of \nthe mayor. Of this amount, $110 million is for education-related \nfunctions, specifically support for local school improvement and post-\nsecondary tuition assistance.\n  This $110 million continues our commitment to improving the quality \nof education for children in the District of Columbia. I convened two \nhearings this fall to assess the Federal investment in school \nimprovement over the past 5 years. To date, including this bill, \nCongress has provided $348 million since fiscal year 2004 as special \npayments to help the District address long-standing deficiencies in its \neducation system.\n  This conference agreement provides $75.4 million for school \nimprovement in the District in three sectors: $42.2 million for public \nschools, $20 million for charter schools, and $13.2 million for \nopportunity scholarships. The bill also includes $35.1 million to \ncontinue the District of Columbia resident tuition assistance grant \nprogram which permits eligible District residents to attend out-of-\nstate colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates.\n  Finally, just a few words about earmarks. This is a very transparent \nappropriations bill shining a light on requests from Senators, House \nMembers, and the Obama administration. Quite frankly, that is the way \nit should be.\n  Nothing is buried or disguised. The name of every Member who has \nasked for anything in the House or Senate bill that has been included \nin this conference agreement is disclosed in the explanatory statement. \nEvery Member has to stand by every request he or she makes, and it is \nprinted right there for the world to see.\n  After the document went to print, Senator Schumer submitted a letter \nto the committee conveying his support for several items included in \nthe bill at the request of House members.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the text of Senator Schumer's letter \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 7, 2009.\n     Hon.

priorities, I also offer my \n     support for the following projects included in the House \n     version of the bill:\n       Support the House Appropriations Committee (HAC) addition \n     of

My friend--I want \nto make sure the Record reflects that he is my friend--the Republican \nleader, we scuffle and argue out here, but we have done a lot of things \ntogether over the years. But I do have a direct quote from my friend \njust this afternoon:\n\n       We have been anxious to have health care votes since \n     Tuesday and we have had the Crapo amendment pending since \n     Tuesday. We would like to vote on amendments. All we are \n     asking is an opportunity to offer amendments and get votes.\n\n  That is what we have been trying to do now for the last several \nhours. First of all, I have a cloture motion at the desk with respect \nto the conference report to accompany H.R. 3288.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 3288, the Transportation, HUD, \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010.\n         Daniel K.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of H.R. 3590, the health care bill, for the \npurposes of considering the pending Crapo motion to commit and the \nDorgan amendment No. 2739, as modified; that Senator Baucus be \nrecognized to call up his side-by-side amendment to the Crapo motion; \nthat once that amendment has been reported by number, Senator \nLautenberg be recognized to call up his side-by-side amendment to the \nDorgan amendment, as modified; that prior to each of the votes \nspecified in this agreement, there be 5 minutes of debate equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding \nback of the time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \nLautenberg amendment; that upon disposition of the Lautenberg \namendment, the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the Dorgan \namendment; that upon disposition of that amendment, the Senate proceed \nto vote in relation to the Baucus amendment; that upon disposition of \nthat amendment, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Crapo \nmotion to commit; that no other amendments be in order during the \npendency of this agreement; that the above-referenced amendments and \nmotion to commit be subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold and \nthat if they achieve that threshold, then they be agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that if they do not \nachieve that threshold, then they be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As I stated earlier today, and as the majority leader \nhas indicated, we have waited since Tuesday to vote on additional \nhealth care amendments, including the pending Crapo motion to commit on \ntaxes. Finally, tonight the other side gave us language on their \nalternative to Senator Crapo's motion.\n  Senator Crapo's motion would ensure that the bill does not raise \ntaxes on the middle class. I understand that their alternative is \nsense-of-the-Senate language on that subject. This consent request now \nhas us voting on two drug reimportation amendments from the other \nside--not one but two on the Democratic side--one of which we just \nreceived less than an hour ago and is 100 pages long.\n  We are prepared to return to the health care bill and proceed to the \ntwo tax-related votes tonight. After those votes, I would suggest we \ncontinue to work on the bill and other amendments. I assume there could \nbe votes on the drug reimportation issue and a whole host of other \namendments we have all been anxious to offer at a later time. But at \nthis stage, regretfully, I object and propound the following \nalternative.\n  Is my objection registered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend, the majority leader, could \nwe just get in the queue the Crapo amendment and the, I believe, Baucus \nside by side to the Crapo amendment? I ask unanimous consent that we do \nthat, which would give us a way to go forward on two measures that both \nsides seem to want to vote on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Just this afternoon, my friend, the Republican leader, \nsaid--and I quote--``I think it is pretty hard to argue with a straight \nface that we're''--``we'' meaning Republicans--\"not trying to proceed \nto amend and have votes on this bill. That's what we desire to do.''\n  Mr. President, it is obvious the Republicans have said privately to \ntheir friends and publicly here and in the media that this is a bill \nthey want to kill. To think they are interested in doing something that \nis positive about this stretches the imagination.\n  Also, let me just say this. I did not come to this body yesterday. I \nam not the expert with procedures in the Senate, but I am pretty good. \nI want everyone to understand this is a ploy procedurally to stop us \nfrom completing this bill. We are not going to have a bunch of \namendments stacked up. Amendments have been offered. We are agreeing to \nvote on the amendments. We know the drug importation is a difficult \nvote for the Republicans; it is a difficult vote for the Democrats. But \nthat is what we do around here.\n  Every amendment we have had so far has been 60-vote margins. This \nshould not be any different. So I want the Record to reflect that we \nare ready to vote. He keeps talking about ``since Tuesday.'' There have \nbeen quite a few things going on around here since Tuesday. It is not \nas if we have been sitting around staring in space. There has been good \ndebate on the Senate floor. It is just that we have amendments that \nwould--if we move off the motion they have filed, it creates a \nprocedural issue that we would have difficulty getting out of. That is \nwhy they are wanting to do that. We have to clear the deck, continue \noffering amendments, as we have. I think that is the right way to do \nit.\n  So, Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, could I just say, at the risk of being \nredundant--and I do not want to get into\n\n[[Page S12899]]\n\na spirited debate with my friend and colleague over this--the facts are \nwe were just handed a 100-page Lautenberg amendment about an hour ago. \nI have 39 Members here, all interested in that issue. It is simply \nimpossible for me to clear voting on an amendment of 100 pages in \nduration that I just got an hour ago.\n  The reason I had suggested--and I was hopeful that maybe it would be \na good way forward--we vote on the Crapo amendment, which everybody \nunderstands has been out there since Tuesday, and a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that is fairly brief, I assume--a very brief sense of the \nSenate that Senator Baucus was going to offer--is because both sides \nfully understand those two measures. They are not 100 pages long and \nenormously complicated. We did not just receive them.\n  So I do not want to get into an extensive back and forth with the \nmajority leader, but I would say to him through the Chair, sincerely, \nit strikes me a good way to just get started would be to vote on these \ntwo issues, the Crapo motion and the Baucus amendment that both sides \nfully understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is no sucker punch the Democrats have \njust leveled to the Republicans. This amendment was previously offered \nby Senator Cochran, a Republican, that Senator Lautenberg is offering. \nThis is something people have known about for a long time. So I \nunderstand people may have forgotten what was in that. They can have \nthe evening to look it over. But I will renew my request tomorrow. We \nare ready to legislate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I guess I will have to prolong it just \na little bit further.\n  I just learned something from the majority leader, that in fact this \nis an amendment that has been around before. We just learned that from \nhis comments, having just received it a short time ago. Nevertheless, \nwe will continue to talk and see if we cannot move forward and make \nprogress and give both sides votes they are clearly interested in \nhaving.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the attitude of the Republican \nleader. I think it is fair to have a chance to look at that amendment. \nWe will be here in the morning and try to work through this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The omnibus conference report.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about the omnibus conference bill \nbefore the Senate and specifically about provisions on Cuba that have \nnot passed the Senate and have not been subjected to debate by this \nbody. These provisions would undo current law where the Castro regime \nwould have to pay in advance of shipment for goods being sold to them \nbecause of their terrible credit history.\n  Yes, Cuba's credit history is horrible. The Paris Club of creditor \nnations recently announced that Cuba has failed to pay almost $30 \nbillion in debt. Among poor nations that is the worst credit record in \nthe world.\n  So I ask: If the Cuban Government has put off paying those to whom it \nalready owes $30 billion, why does anyone think it would meet new \nfinancial obligations to American farmers?\n  Considering the serious economic crisis we are facing right now, we \nneed to focus on solutions for hard-working Americans, not subsidies \nfor a brutal dictatorship. We should evaluate how to encourage the \nregime to allow a legitimate opening--not in terms of cell phones and \nhotel rooms that Cubans cannot afford but in terms of the right to \norganize, the right to think and speak what they believe.\n  However, what we are doing with this omnibus bill is far from that \nevaluation, and the process by which these changes have been forced \nupon this body is so deeply offensive to me and so deeply undemocratic \nthat I have no intention--no intention--of continuing to vote for \nOmnibus appropriations bills if they are going to jam foreign policy \nchanges down throats of Members in what some consider ``must-pass'' \nbills.\n\n  I am putting my colleagues on notice: You may have the wherewithal to \ndo that because you have a committee perch or an opportunity to stick \nsomething in that has not been debated on the floor of the Senate in \nwhat you think is a must-pass bill, but do not expect me to cast \ncritical votes to pass that bill.\n  An example of the danger of what we are doing by changing the \ndefinition that is now being changed in this omnibus bill of what we \ncall ``cash in advance'' is exhibited by a Europapress report. I want \nto quote from that press report: ``During a trade fair this month in \nHavana, Germany's Ambassador to Cuba, Claude Robert Ellner, told German \nbusinessmen that Cuba's debt to the German government had been \nforgiven''--forgiven--``in the hopes that Cuba will meet its debt \nobligations to them''--meaning to the businessmen.\n  In other words, German taxpayers will now be responsible for bailing \nout its private sector and, by implication, the Castro regime.\n  Thanks to the U.S. policy we have had up to now, of requiring the \nCastro regime to pay ``cash in advance'' for its purchases of \nagricultural products, U.S. taxpayers could rest assured that the same \nwould not happen to them--that we would not have to forgive any debt or \nobligations in order to make sure private businesspeople got paid by \nthe regime because, otherwise, they would be left defaulted.\n  The Castro regime has mastered the art of making some European \nGovernments acquiesce to its every whim, even if it means a free pass \nfor its daunting repression.\n  So how do they do it? It is rather simple. They give European \ncountries a choice: either you do what we say or we will freeze your \nnationals' bank accounts and default on any debts. To me, that is also \nknown as blackmail.\n  Let's take Spain, for example. Recently, European news services \nreported that Spain has begun a diplomatic offensive to convince the \nCastro regime to unblock nearly 266 million euros--or the equivalent of \nabout 400 million United States dollars--in funds that have been frozen \nby the Castro regime of over 300 Spanish companies in Cuba. These are \nSpanish companies doing business in Cuba and now cannot get access to \ntheir money.\n  So what does the Spanish Government do? Not coincidentally, the \nSpanish Government announced that upon assuming the Presidency of the \nEuropean Union in 2010, it would enter into a new bilateral agreement \nwith the Castro regime that would replace the current European Union \npolicy which contains diplomatic sanctions for human rights violations.\n  The Castro regime had made it clear to Spain that the current \nEuropean Union policy was an ``insurmountable obstacle'' to normal \nrelations and, I might add, for Spanish nationals and companies to get \ntheir money back. Therefore, the Spanish Government immediately \nresponded to what I consider to be blackmail.\n  On a recent visit to Cuba, Spain's Foreign Minister, Miguel Angle \nMoratinos, met for 3 hours with Raul Castro. He did not get one \nconcession--not one--on human rights. But he did get $300 million that \nCuba owed to Spanish companies that do business inside of Cuba.\n  Is that what the United States of America intends to do?\n  So the lesson for dictators is, go ahead and freeze the bank accounts \nof other countries' companies and create debt you do not intend to pay \nfor and you get a free pass for repression.\n  Look at another article. A recent Reuters article highlights that \nCuba continues to block access to foreign business bank accounts. Let \nme quote from that article:\n\n       Many foreign suppliers and investors in Cuba are still \n     unable to repatriate hundreds of millions of dollars from \n     local accounts almost a year after Cuban authorities blocked \n     them because of the financial crisis, foreign diplomats and \n     businessmen said.\n\n  It goes on to say in the article:\n\n       The businessmen, who asked not to be identified--\n\n  Because they are fearful if they are--\n\n     said they were increasingly frustrated because the Communist \n     authorities refused to offer explanations or solutions for \n     the situation, which stems from a cash crunch in the\n\n[[Page S12900]]\n\n     Cuban economy triggered by the global downturn and heavy \n     hurricane damage last year.\n\n  This is a quote from one of those people. He says:\n\n       I have repeatedly e-mailed, visited the offices and sent my \n     representative to the offices of a company I did business \n     with for years and which owes me money, and they simply \n     refuse to talk to me.\n\n  That is what a Canadian businessman told Reuters.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Delegations from foreign banks and investor funds holding \n     commercial paper from Cuba's State banks have repeatedly \n     traveled to Cuba this year seeking answers from the Central \n     Bank or other authorities--without success.\n       Representatives of some companies with investment or joint \n     ventures on the island say they were bracing for the \n     possibility of not being able to repatriate year-end \n     dividends paid to their accounts in Cuba.\n\n  Now, let's remember that some 90 percent of the country's economic \nactivity is in the regime's hands, in the state's hands.\n\n       Foreign economic attaches and commercial representatives in \n     Cuba said most of their nationals doing business with the \n     Caribbean island still face payment problems.\n\n  That is all from that article. These are all those who are doing \nbusiness with Cuba now finding themselves and their money trapped.\n  Last week, the Russian Federation's Audit Chamber revealed that the \nCuban regime failed on three occasions to pay installments on the \nequivalent of $355 million in a credit deal it signed with Russia in \nSeptember of 2006. That is just the latest episode in a saga that in \n2009 alone includes, first, reports by Mexico's La Jornada and Spain's \nEl Pais newspapers that hundreds of foreign companies that transact \nbusiness with the Cuban regime's authorities have had their accounts \nfrozen--frozen--since January of 2009 by the regime-owned bank that is \nsolely empowered to conduct commercial banking operations in that \ncountry.\n  Second, a June 9, 2009, Reuters article said:\n\n       Cuba has rolled over 200 million Euros in bond issues that \n     were due in May, as the country's central bank asked for \n     another year to repay foreign holders of the debt, financial \n     sources in London and Havana said this week.\n\n  Those are direct quotes from those articles.\n  As a reminder, in Castro's Cuba, you can only do business with the \nregime because private business activity is strictly restricted.\n  So the real reason so many whose work is often subsidized by business \ninterests advocate Cuba policy changes is about money and commerce, not \nabout freedom and democracy. It makes me wonder why those who spend \nhours and hours in Havana listening to Castro's soliloquies cannot find \nminutes--minutes--for human rights and democracy activists. It makes me \nwonder why those who go and enjoy the Sun of Cuba will not shine the \nlight of freedom on its jails full of political prisoners. They \nadvocate for labor rights in the United States, but they are willing to \naccept forced labor inside of Cuba. They talk about democracy in Burma, \nbut they are willing to sip the rum with Cuba's dictators.\n  Which takes me to a place in Cuba called Placetas. Placetas is a city \nin the Villa Clara Province in the center of Cuba, in the heart of the \nisland, in the center of Cuba. In other words, it is not a beachside \nresort frequented by Canadian and European tourists.\n  Placetas is also the home of this couple. It is the home of Cuban \npolitical prisoner and prodemocracy leader Jorge Luis Garcia Perez \nAntunez, generally known as Antunez. On March 15 of 1990, a then-25-\nyear-old Antunez stood at the center square of Placetas listening to \nthe government's official radio transmission calling for the Fourth \nCongress of the Communist Party. He spontaneously began to shout: \n``What we want and what we need are reforms like the ones performed in \nEastern Europe.'' Immediately, he was beaten by state security agents, \ncharged with ``oral enemy propaganda,'' and imprisoned. That would \nbegin a 17-year prison term, which is about half of his current life \nthat he spent in prison. His crime? Saying: We need the types of \nchanges that took place in Eastern Europe. For that, 17 years in \nprison. He was not released until 2007. He is now 45 years old, \nhopefully with an entire life ahead of him.\n  The Castro regime would love for Mr. Antunez and his wife, who is \nalso a prodemocracy activist--this says in Spanish, ``we are all the \nresistance'' and ``long live human rights.'' They would love for him to \nleave the island permanently, but he refuses to do so. He has decided \nto stay in Cuba and demand that the human and civil rights of the Cuban \npeople be respected. For this, he has been rearrested over 30 times \nsince 2007.\n  Last week, at that same center in that small town of Placetas where \nhe had been originally arrested simply for saying that: What we need is \na change as we saw in Eastern Europe, Antunez and other local \nprodemocracy leaders gathered to honor Cuba's current political \nprisoners, people who simply, through peaceful means, try to create \nchanges for democracy and human rights inside of their country and get \narrested and languish in jail.\n  Antunez and his colleagues were not ``educated'' on the importance of \nhuman rights and civil disobedience by foreign tourists, as some of my \ncolleagues suggest would happen--that we need to send foreign tourists \nto educate the Cubans about human rights and civil disobedience. He and \nall of those who are languishing in Castro's jails understand about \nhuman rights and civil disobedience in a way to try to capture your \nrights. Unwittingly, though, foreign tourists have financed their \nrepression. They give money to the regime that ultimately gives them \nthe state security forces that throw people such as Antunez in jail.\n  Let me read an open letter that just came out by Mr. Antunez that was \nsent to Cuba's dictator Raul Castro. I am going to quote from an \nEnglish translation.\n  It says:\n\n       Mr. Raul Castro--\n\n  This is Mr. Antunez speaking now--\n\n       My name is Jorge Luis Garcia Perez Antunez--a former \n     political prisoner--and I am writing to you again not because \n     I pretend to make you aware of something that, far from \n     alien, is commonplace in Cuba due to the nature and politics \n     of your government. For several months now my spouse Yris \n     Tamara Perez Aguilera and I find ourselves under forced house \n     arrest by your political police. The week before the Juanes \n     concert--\n\n  That is the concert of the famous Colombian singer Juanes--\n\n     a high ranking State security official upon arresting me \n     informed me that there had been an order for my arrest \n     throughout the island of Cuba, wherever I might be found. He \n     emphasized that they were going to be watching every step I \n     take. Since that date I have lost count of how many times I \n     have been arrested, the majority of times with violence.\n       Mr. Dictator--allow me a few questions that may help you \n     clarify some doubts amongst those compatriots of mine who are \n     hopeful that your government would diminish repression or \n     that even Democratic openings could be made.\n\n  He poses this question:\n\n       With what right do the authorities, without a prior crime \n     being committed, detain and impede the free movement of their \n     citizens in violation of a universally recognized right? What \n     feelings could move a man like Captain Idel Gonzalez Morfi to \n     beat my wife, a defenseless woman, so brutally, causing \n     lasting effects to her bones for the sole act of arriving at \n     a radio station to denounce with evidence the torture that \n     her brother received in a Cuban prison. Or is it that for \n     you there are only five families that exist in our country \n     that have the right to protest and demand justice for \n     their jailed relatives? Should you not be ashamed that \n     your corpulent police officers remain stationed for days \n     at the corner of my home to impede us from leaving our \n     house and monitoring our movements in our own city?\n       Where is the professionalism and ethics of your \n     subordinates that with their ridiculous operations provoke \n     the mockery of the populace towards these persons on almost a \n     daily basis? How do you feel when you encourage or allow \n     these persons who call themselves men to beat and drag women \n     through the streets such as: Damaris Moya Portieles, Marta \n     Diaz, Ana Alfonso Arteaga, Sara Marta Fonseca, Yris Perez, \n     and most recently--\n\n  The well-known blogger, Yoani Sanchez. I am adding for the record \n``the well-known blogger.'' He doesn't say that, but she is a well-\nknown blogger, internationally known, recently beaten simply as she was \ntrying to go to a place of civil disobedience.\n\n       How can you and your subordinates sleep calmly after \n     deliberately and maliciously physically knocking down on more \n     than one occasion Idania Yanez Contreras who is several \n     months pregnant? How can you and your government speak about \n     the battle of ideas\n\n[[Page S12901]]\n\n     when you are constantly repressing ideas through beatings, \n     arrests, and years of incarceration?\n       Maybe your followers cannot find or even attempt to find a \n     response. However, I find myself in the long list of persons \n     that are not afraid to respond.\n       You act this way because you are a cruel man, and \n     insensible to the pain and suffering of others. You act this \n     way because you are faithful to your anti Democratic and \n     dictatorial vocation, because you are convinced that \n     dictatorships like the one you preside over can only be \n     maintained through terror and torture, and because the most \n     minimal opening can lead to the loss of the one thing that \n     you are interested in--which is maintaining yourself in \n     power.\n       Lastly, returning to my case in particular, I will respond \n     without even asking you beforehand the concrete motives of \n     your continued repression against my person. Your government \n     and your servants in the repressive corps cannot forgive my \n     two biggest and only ``crimes.'' First, that despite almost \n     two decades of torture and cruel and inhuman punishment \n     during my unjust and severe sanction, you could not break my \n     dignity and my position as a political prisoner. And second, \n     because even though I am accosted and brutalized and above \n     all risk returning to prison, I have taken the decision not \n     to leave my country in which I will continue struggling for a \n     change that I believe is both necessary and inevitable.\n\n  The letter is signed: From Placetas, Jorge Luis Garcia Perez Antunez, \nDecember 2009.\n  This is the voice of those who languish under Castro's brutal \ndictatorship. As you can see, Mr. Antunez is an Afro-Cuban, not part of \nthe White elite of the regime's dictatorship; not what the regime tells \nthe world, that Cubans who are all White seek to oppose the \ndictatorship. Most of the movement for democracy inside of Cuba are \nAfro-Cubans. Inside of Cuba, they are subjected to a citizenship status \nthat is less than any human being should be subjected to.\n  Antunez's voice rings in my head. It tugs at my conscience.\n  His words:\n\n       Despite almost two decades of torture and cruel and inhuman \n     punishment during my unjust and severe sanction, you could \n     not break my dignity and my position as a political prisoner, \n     because even though I am accosted and brutalized and above \n     all risk returning to prison, I have taken the decision not \n     to leave my country in which I will continue struggling for a \n     change I believe is both necessary and inevitable.\n\n  Antunez is right. Change in Cuba is inevitable, but the United States \nneeds to be a catalyst of that change. It does not need to be a \nsustainer of that dictatorship. It does not need to create an infusion \nof money that only goes to a regime that ultimately uses it not to put \nmore food on the plates of Cuban families but to arrest and brutalize \npeople such as Mr. Antunez.\n  These are the human rights activists on whom some would turn their \nbacks for the sake of doing business. I guess the only thing they can \nsee is the color of money. Well, not me, not now, and not ever.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't rise to add to what the Senator \nfrom New Jersey said. I just wish to take this opportunity to tell him \nI agree with him, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue over \nseveral years--even the years before he came to the Senate.\n  Often, I am asked in my State, because we can export so much \nagricultural stuff, if I would vote to open trade with Cuba. I said I \nam willing to open trade for Cuba when they give political freedom and \neconomic freedom to the people of that country because this dictator \nhas run Cuba into the most impoverished country in the world. Before he \ntook over, they had a very viable middle class and they were a \nprosperous country.\n  I stand ready to help the Senator on what he is trying to do in that \narea.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. If the Senator will yield, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa for his comments and for the position he has taken \nover a long period of time. It may not be the easiest, but I believe it \nis the one that is morally correct. Most important, on that day--which \nI believe is sooner rather than later--in which Cubans are free, they \nwill remember who stood with them in the midst of this. That will make \nall the difference in the world. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor at this point to \ngive some breadth to a statement that was made on the floor earlier \ntoday. It was made by my friend, Senator Baucus. I don't take offense \nto what he said because I sensed a great deal of frustration in his \nstatement. I will read what he said so you know what I am reacting to. \nThe reason I don't take offense to what he said is because he and I \nhave worked so closely together over 10 years, with one or the other of \nus being chairman of the Finance Committee, that we have such an \nunderstanding of each other.\n  Just prior to the remarks I am going to read, he had spoken \npositively about Senator Enzi and me. So I want my colleagues to know \nthis statement is not made out of anger that I am going to give a \nrebuttal to.\n\n       Well, we kept working bipartisan--working together, for \n     days and days, hours and hours, and then, fortunately, Mr. \n     President, it got to the point where I'm just calling it as I \n     see it. I can't--I--one of my feelings is I'm too honest \n     about things. And it's--the Republicans started to walk away. \n     They pulled away from the table. They had to leave.\n       I ask you why? Why did that happen? And the answer is, to \n     be totally fair and above board, is--and above board, is \n     because their leadership asked them to. Their leadership \n     asked them to become disengaged from the process. I know that \n     to be a fact. Why did their leadership ask Republicans to \n     leave and become disengaged from the process? To be totally \n     candid, they wanted to score political points by just \n     attacking this bill. They were not here to help--help be \n     constructive, to find bipartisan solutions. They were for a \n     while, then when the rubber started to meet the road and it \n     came time to try to make some decisions, they left and began \n     to attack--and began to attack.\n\n  I wish to take a few minutes to respond to these remarks that I read. \nIt was asserted, through these remarks on the floor, that some \nRepublicans in the so-called Gang of 6 were directed by the Senate \nRepublican leadership to cease participating in bipartisan talks. The \nGang of 6 referred to the six bipartisan members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. On the Democratic side, the members were my friends, three \nchairmen, including Senator Baucus, Budget Committee chairman; Senator \nConrad; and Energy Committee chairman, Senator Bingaman. All are senior \nmembers of the Democratic Caucus. On the Republican side, the three \nmembers included Senator Snowe, ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee; Senator Enzi, ranking member of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee; and this Senator. Senators Snowe and \nEnzi are senior Members of the Republican caucus.\n  Chairman Baucus convened this working group with a singular goal of a \nbipartisan health care reform bill. We met for several weeks up in the \nMontana Room of Chairman Baucus's office. I would agree with the way \nparticipating Members have described these discussions. They were well \ninformed, thoughtful, provocative, challenging, and frustrating all at \nthe same time. But I would say that in the months we negotiated, there \nwas never once that anyone walked away from the table. There was never \nonce that there were any harsh words.\n  While we were engaged in those discussions, there was constant \npressure from folks outside the room for us to reach a quick deal. That \npressure came from the White House, it came from the Democratic \nleadership, it came from advocacy groups outside, and it came from many \nmedia folks covering the day-by-day meetings. To be fair, the Senate \nRepublican leadership was very concerned about some of the directions \nthe policy discussions were taking in the Gang of 6. That concern grew, \nparticularly after the very partisan HELP Committee markup occurred. \nSenator Hatch left the original Gang of 7 because of the character and \nresult of the HELP Committee markup.\n  Most important, the Senate Republican leadership was concerned that a \nbipartisan Finance Committee bill would be co-opted into a partisan \nfloor bill, when the Democratic leadership merged the bills. Senators \nSnowe, Enzi, and I anticipated that concern.\n  To be fair to Senator Baucus, as he was negotiating with us, he tried \nto convince us that we would be very much a part of those merging of \nthe bills. He offered that in good faith. I believe him. I even believe \nhim today saying that. But seeing how neither the HELP Committee nor \nthe Finance Committee was as involved as they should have been in what \nSenator Reid\n\n[[Page S12902]]\n\nput together in this 2,074-page bill, I wonder whether Senator Baucus \ncould have, if we had a bipartisan agreement, actually carried out that \nguarantee.\n  From the get-go, we Republican members of the Gang of 6, to make sure \nwe were a part of the process that I described, as Senator Baucus told \nus we would be, asked for assurances from the White House and from the \nSenate Democratic leadership on the next step in the legislative \nprocess, if we, in fact, did arrive at a bipartisan agreement.\n  I also found that many in the broader group of Republicans, who \nprovided the bipartisan glue for the CHIP bill of 2008, had similar \nconcerns. All Republicans had process concerns, such as where would it \ngo once it left the Senate Finance Committee.\n  We wanted assurances, and here is what we wanted. The assurances \nrequested boiled down to a good-faith promise that the bipartisan \nFinance Committee health care bill would not morph into a partisan \nhealth care reform bill when Majority Leader Reid merged the two \ncommittee bills. We wanted to make sure the bipartisan character of a \nbipartisan Finance Committee bill was going to be retained through \nthese next steps. To do otherwise would be akin to getting on a bus and \nnot knowing where the bus was going or how much the bus ticket would \ncost. Assurances were also requested with respect to a conference \nbetween the House and Senate. The assurances were similar to assurances \nrequested by Senator Reid and made by the then-majority Republican \nleadership during the period of 2005 and 2006. The Democratic minority \nleader, at that time, made these assurances a condition to letting \nmajor regular order Finance Committee bills even go to conference.\n  As an example, take a look at the Congressional Record, and you will \nsee the assurances made by then-Majority Leader Frist to then-Minority \nLeader Reid. These requests were made repeatedly to the Democratic \nleadership, publicly and privately, about how the postcommittee action \nof the bipartisan group would be handled in the merger with the HELP \nCommittee bill. It was a focus of a July 8 lunchtime, face-to-face \nmeeting at the majority leader's office, with Senators Reid, Baucus, \nConrad, Bingaman, Snowe, Enzi, and myself. The bottom-line response \nfrom Senator Reid at that meeting was he needed 60 votes.\n  I guess, the implication was, despite the fact that the Democratic \ncaucus contained 60 members then and now, Senator Reid didn't think it \nwas possible to secure the votes of all members of his caucus. A \nrestatement of the reality of the Senate rules was not the assurances \nthe three Republican Senators--this one included--sought from Senator \nReid.\n  Senator Reid, himself, recognized the validity of this request in an \nAugust 8 Washington Post article. I ask unanimous consent to have that \narticle printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 3, 2009]\n\n Democrats Find Rallying Points on Health Reform, but Splinters Remain\n\n                   (By Shailagh Murray and Paul Kane)\n\n       Democrats leave town for the August recess with frayed \n     nerves and fragile agreements on health-care reform, and a \n     new bogeyman to fire up their constituents: the insurance \n     industry.\n       With the House already gone and the Senate set to clear out \n     by Friday, the terms of the recess battle are becoming clear. \n     Republicans will assail the government coverage plan that \n     Democrats and President Obama are advocating as a recklessly \n     expensive federal takeover of health care. And Democrats will \n     counter that GOP opposition represents a de facto endorsement \n     of insurance industry abuses.\n       ``We know what we're up against,'' House Speaker Nancy \n     Pelosi (Calif.) told reporters on Friday. ``Carpet-bombing, \n     slash and burn, shock and awe--anything you want to say to \n     describe what the insurance companies will do to hold on to \n     their special advantage.''\n       Although Pelosi won a significant victory last week when \n     the Energy and Commerce Committee approved the House bill, \n     setting up a floor debate after Labor Day, conservative \n     Democrats were able to demand that negotiators weaken the \n     government-plan provision. The uprising, which lasted for \n     several days, suggested that the public option is growing \n     increasingly vulnerable even as a consensus forms around \n     other reform policies.\n       Republican leaders have pledged to use town halls, ads and \n     other forums to intensify their assault on the Democratic-led \n     reform effort. ``I think it's safe to say that, over the \n     August recess, as more Americans learn more about \n     [Democrats'] plan, they're likely to have a very, very hot \n     summer,'' House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) \n     said.\n       In the Senate, a bipartisan coalition of Finance Committee \n     lawmakers is backing a member-run cooperative model as an \n     alternative to the public option. But Republicans are \n     beginning to push back against that cooperative approach, \n     too.\n       The latest critic is Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who on \n     Sunday compared insurance co-ops to Fannie Mae and Freddie \n     Mac, the government-backed mortgage giants that played \n     prominent roles in the housing crisis. ``I have not seen a \n     public option that, in my view, meets the test of what would \n     really not eventually lead to a government takeover,'' McCain \n     said on CNN's ``State of the Union.''\n       Pelosi and other Democrats have countered that Republicans \n     are seeking to protect a health insurance industry that is \n     their business ally, not so much from a government insurance \n     option, but from the broad industry reforms that enjoy public \n     support, including the elimination of coverage caps and the \n     practice of denying coverage to those with pre-existing \n     conditions. The White House also wants to steer the debate \n     toward insurance reform, as it is easier to digest than \n     long-term cost control, which is another chief objective.\n       ``How you regulate the insurance industry is as important \n     to health-care reform as controlling costs,'' said White \n     House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. The public plan, he said, \n     is one of an array of measures intended to change industry \n     behavior.\n       As the rhetoric against the industry heated up, the leading \n     insurance trade group issued a statement Thursday calling for \n     lawmakers to cool down their criticisms and redouble efforts \n     toward ``bipartisan health-care reform.'' Robert Zirkelbach, \n     spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, defended his \n     industry, saying it had already proposed many of the changes \n     that Congress is seeking, including those involving pre-\n     existing conditions and ratings based on health status and \n     gender.\n       Despite the sparring, House and Senate Democrats and three \n     GOP Senate negotiators have reached broad consensus on the \n     outlines of reform. Lawmakers generally agree that \n     individuals must be required to buy health insurance, that \n     Medicaid should be significantly expanded, and that tax \n     increases, in some form, will be required. The final bill \n     also could bring about some of the most significant changes \n     to Medicare since the program was created in 1965.\n       But the rebellion from fiscal conservatives on the Energy \n     and Commerce Committee last week served as a political wake-\n     up call for Democratic leaders. With enough votes on the \n     panel and on the floor to sink reform legislation, the Blue \n     Dog Coalition forced Pelosi and Emanuel into concessions that \n     made the government plan similar to private health insurance, \n     sparking a new fight with House liberals.\n       Sensing that the Blue Dogs had dug in for a prolonged \n     fight, Pelosi and Emanuel gave in to most demands in order to \n     get the legislation moving again. They essentially decided \n     that it was better to pick a fight with their liberal flank, \n     where Pelosi remains popular and where loyalty to Obama is \n     strongest, particularly in the Congressional Black Caucus.\n       Despite threats from almost 60 progressive House \n     Democrats--who outnumber the Blue Dogs--Pelosi defended the \n     compromise, saying it was similar to one backed by Sen. \n     Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). Pelosi predicted that the \n     liberal wing would fall in line because the legislation is so \n     important to them.\n       ``Are you asking me, `Are the progressives going to take \n     down universal, quality, affordable health care for all \n     Americans?' I don't think so,'' Pelosi told reporters Friday, \n     breaking into laughter at the question.\n       Just as troublesome as the internal House divisions is the \n     burgeoning distrust among House Democrats, their Senate \n     counterparts and the White House.\n       Pelosi acknowledged that ``there are concerns'' in her \n     caucus that the White House, namely their former colleague \n     Emanuel, takes House Democrats for granted. House lawmakers \n     are being encouraged to pass the most liberal bill possible, \n     she said, while the White House works on a bipartisan \n     compromise with a select group of senators.\n       ``It's no secret,'' Pelosi said, ``that members sometimes \n     think: `Why do I always read in the paper that they're \n     checking with the Finance Committee all the time? What does \n     that mean, that they just want to know what's happened with \n     the Finance Committee? What about the [Senate health] \n     committee? What about our committees over here?' ''\n       The six Senate Finance Committee negotiators have burrowed \n     in for another six weeks of talks, having set a Sept. 15 \n     deadline for producing a bill. The group includes an array of \n     small-state senators with little national prominence who have \n     proven surprisingly resistant to pressure from their party \n     leaders and the White House.\n       Although the House bill and the Senate Health Committee \n     version have attracted no Republican support, the Senate \n     Finance Committee coalition includes Sens. Mike Enzi (Wyo.) \n     and Charles Grassley (Iowa), both Republicans, along with \n     moderate GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe (Maine). And the lead \n     Democratic negotiator, Finance Committee\n\n[[Page S12903]]\n\n     Chairman Max Baucus (Mont.), is a moderate who has broken \n     with his party on numerous bills co-authored with Grassley.\n       The closer these negotiators move to striking a deal, the \n     more fraught the discussions become by issues of trust and \n     political will. Among Republicans, the pressure is especially \n     acute. All three GOP senators fear they will be sidelined \n     once the bill is approved at the committee level, with their \n     names invoked to demonstrate bipartisanship even as they're \n     left with no say over the final product as it is meshed with \n     the Senate health panel's version and then ultimately with \n     the House bill.\n       For Republicans, a prime concern is that Senate Majority \n     Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) will abandon the Finance Committee \n     bill and force legislation to the Senate floor using budget \n     rules that would protect against a Republican filibuster. \n     Even advocates concede that the option is highly risky and \n     that it would vastly limit the policy scope of the bill. For \n     instance, Senate budget experts say most insurance reforms \n     would have to be sidelined.\n       Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Sunday that the \n     administration would consider all options. ``Ideally, you \n     want to do this with as broad a base of consensus as \n     possible,'' he said in an interview on ABC's ``This Week.'' \n     ``But people on the Hill are going to have to make that \n     choice: Do they want to help shape this and be part of it, or \n     do they want this country, the United States of America, to \n     go another several decades [without reform]?''\n       Reid said he already provided the Republicans with some \n     assurances, and added, ``I'll do more if necessary.'' He said \n     of GOP concerns, ``I don't blame them.'' And he added that, \n     considering the political realities of the Senate, with its \n     large number of moderate Democrats, health-care reform would \n     have to gain significant bipartisan support to cross the \n     finish line.\n       ``I sure hope we can get a bipartisan bill; it makes it \n     easier for me to go home,'' moderate Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-\n     La.) told the Democratic caucus last week, according to Reid.\n       ``We all feel that way,'' Reid added.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will quote, in part, from the article:\n\n       The closer these negotiators move to striking a deal, the \n     more fraught the discussions become by issues of trust and \n     political will. Among Republicans, the pressure is especially \n     acute. All three GOP senators fear they will be sidelined \n     once the bill is approved at the committee level, with their \n     names invoked to demonstrate bipartisanship even as they're \n     left with no say over the final product as it is meshed with \n     the Senate health panel's version and then ultimately with \n     the House bill.\n\n  Republicans were also worried that the bipartisan product could be \nlifted into a partisan reconciliation bill. I quote further from that \nsame Post article:\n\n       Reid said he already provided the Republicans with some \n     assurances, and added, ``I'll do more if necessary.''\n\n  Continuing to quote from the Post article:\n\n       He said of GOP concerns, ``I don't blame them.'' And he \n     added that, considering the political realities of the \n     Senate, with its large number of moderate Democrats, health-\n     care reform would have to gain significant bipartisan support \n     to cross the finish line.\n\n  President Obama and the Senate Democratic leadership set a deadline \nof September 15 for the bipartisan Gang of 6 to produce a proposal. If \nthe proposal were not available by then, the President and Senate \nDemocratic leadership made it clear the plug would be pulled on further \nbipartisan talks.\n  I point that out because that is very significant. A powerful member \nof the Senate Democratic leadership, the senior Senator from New York, \nmade it crystal clear the Senate Democratic leadership would pull the \nplug. That member, who is very smart and articulate, made it as \ntransparent as possible that the September 15 deadline was more \nimportant than a bipartisan deal.\n  I ask you to go back and look at the media reports. The Gang of 6 was \nunable to reach a deal on contentious issues such as abortion, the \nindividual mandate, and financing issues by White House/Democratic \nleadership's deadline.\n  Chairman Baucus had to move forward. I respect the pressure my friend \nfrom Montana was under. I have been there myself. But the record needs \nto be correctly made that the September 15 deadline was not a \nRepublican deadline. It was a deadline imposed by the White House and \nthe Senate Democratic leadership. I might say that wasn't just the GOP \ndeadline--it wasn't a deadline for the Gang of 6 either. I didn't \nsense, from the three Democratic members, that they agreed with that.\n  So the Senate Democratic leadership pulled the plug on the talks. \nAgain, go check the public comments and press reports. They pulled the \nplug. Senator Enzi and I could not agree to the product at that point \nbecause of substantive issues that were resolved against us and the \nfailure of the White House or Senate Democratic leadership to deliver \non those process assurances that we asked for.\n  Senator Snowe did have substantive issues resolved sufficiently at \nthe Finance Committee markup so that she could support the bill.\n  I might note today that I heard Senator Snowe caution the Democrats \nas she gave them the boost from her vote in the Finance Committee--that \nwas right after the bill passed--she made it clear that her vote for \nlater stages would depend in part on data on the key question of \nwhether the product makes health care more affordable. Her letter to \nCBO dated December 3 lays out the issues in precision.\n  At the next stage of the process, the merged-bill stage, all of the \nSenate Republicans' worst fears were confirmed, but it was especially \ntelling to Senator Enzi and me. My sense is Senator Snowe appreciated \nit more than any other member of our conference. The bottom line was \nthat the majority leader's merged bill was constructed in such a \npartisan way that Senator Snowe's input was cast aside.\n  Let's be clear. Senate Republicans did not set deadlines. Senate \nRepublicans did not threaten to go their own way if the deadlines were \nnot met. Even today, the pending motion from this side of the aisle \nputs the question to the Senate this way: Take the bill back to the \nFinance Committee.\n  As the old saying goes, hindsight is 20/20. As I look back on the \nprocess, I make these observations: There was an uncanny disconnect \nbetween those inside and outside the room. Many on the outside, mainly \nfrom the left side of the political spectrum, seemed to want a reform \ndeal just to have a deal. They did not seem to be that curious about \nthe contents. Perhaps for some of those folks, it was a bit of an \nimperative to draw on the good will that any President has in the first \nfew months of office.\n  For those of us in the room--meaning the room where the negotiations \nwere going on--there was a realization that we were tackling, as \nChairman Baucus has described it, an extremely complex set of issues. \nWe learned very quickly that closing the loop on the policy issues, let \nalone finding political consensus, was not easy.\n  The pressure to close a deal by the July 4 recess was overwhelming. \nMy friend, the chairman, wisely pushed back and said we would get a \ndeal when we reached a bipartisan deal. The Group of 6 was unable to \nreach a deal on contentious issues such as abortion, individual \nmandate, and financing issues faced by the White House-Democratic \nleadership deadline. Chairman Baucus had to move. In my heart, I feel \nhe would rather not have had that sort of pressure or make that \ndecision. But that was not our deadline. It was a deadline imposed by \nthe White House and the Senate Democratic leadership. They pulled the \nplug on the talks. Go check the public comments and the press reports. \nThey pulled the plug. Senator Enzi and I could not agree to a product \nat that point because of the substantive issues that were very much \ninvolved.\n  I want to make it very clear, for this Senator, of the three \nRepublicans who were negotiating, kind of in summary, that the \nRepublican leadership, I think, had questions about a lot of things \nthat were going on in those negotiations. But never once did Senator \nMcConnell, my leader, say to me: Get out of there.\n  That is the impression that was left this morning.\n  I can only say that I think I have established a reputation in the \nSenate, particularly while I was chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, that I did not listen to either the White House or people in \nleadership necessarily when I thought a bipartisan compromise was the \nonly way to get things done. I suppose there is a whole long list of \nthings that I ought to write down before I make this statement, but I \ncan only think of two or three right now that I can be sure of that I \ncan say in an intellectually honest way that I stood up to the Bush \nWhite House when I was chairman of the committee.\n\n[[Page S12904]]\n\n  They came out immediately for a $1.7 trillion tax cut in 2001. I made \na decision early on that it was not good for the economy and it was not \npolitically possible. So we passed a much smaller, in a bipartisan way, \ntax bill for that year. And yet it was the biggest tax cut in the \nhistory of the country.\n  In 2003, when the White House and House Republicans in the majority \nat that time said we had to have a $700 billion tax cut in addition to \nthe tax cut that was passed in 2001, there were not votes in the Senate \namong just Republicans to get it done. To secure the votes to get it \ndone, we had to limit it to half that amount of money, or just a little \nbit more than half that amount of money. And in order to get those \nvotes, contrary to the $700 billion tax cut that the Bush White House \nwanted and the House Republicans wanted that we could not get through \nhere, I said I will not come out of conference with a tax cut more than \nthat amount of roughly $300 billion.\n  We got that done by just the bare majority to get it done. But I \nstood up to the White House, I stood up to the House Republican \nleadership who thought we should not be doing anything that was short \nof that full $700 billion.\n  There have been other health care bills very recently where I stood \nup against the White House and against our Republican leadership.\n  I think I have developed a reputation where I am going to do what is \nright for the State of Iowa and for our country. And I am going to try \nto represent a Republican point of view as best I can, considering \nfirst the country and my own constituency.\n  Then when it comes to whether people in this body or outside of this \nbody might think that for the whole months of May, June, and July, and \nthrough August, with a couple meetings we had during the month of \nAugust, that we were dragging our feet to kill a health care reform \nbill, I want to ask people if they would think I wouldn't have better \nthings to do with my time than to have 24 different meetings, one on \none with Chairman Baucus, or that I wouldn't have more than something \nelse to do than have 31 meetings with the Group of 6. These were not \njust short meetings. These were meetings that lasted hours. There was \nanother group of people--Grassley, Baucus, and others, sometimes that \nincluded people from the HELP Committee and the Budget Committee. But \nwe had 25 meetings like that. I wonder if people think we would just be \nmeeting and spending all those hours to make sure that nothing happened \naround here. No. Every one of the 100 Senators in this body, if you \nwere to ask them, would suggest changes in health care that need to be \nmade. Even in that 2,074-page bill, there are some things that most \nconservative people in this country would think ought to be done.\n\n  We all know to some extent something has to be done about this \nsystem. We worked for a long period of time, thinking we could have \nsomething bipartisan. But it did not work out that way, and now we are \nat a point where we have a partisan bill.\n  That is not the way you should handle an issue such as health care \nreform. Just think of the word ``health,'' ``health care.'' It deals \nwith the life and death of 306 million Americans. Just think, you are \nrestructuring one-sixth of the economy.\n  Senator Baucus and I started out in January and February saying to \neverybody we met, every group we talked to, that something this \nmomentous ought to be passing with 75 or 80 votes, not just 60 votes. \nMaybe one of the times the White House decided to pull the plug on \nSeptember 15 may have come on August 5 when the Group of 6 had our last \nmeeting with President Obama. He was the only one from the White House \nthere and the six of us. It was a very casual discussion.\n  I said this before so I am not saying something that has not been \nsaid. But President Obama made one request of me and I asked him a \nquestion. For my part, I said: You know, it would make it a heck of a \nlot easier to get a bipartisan agreement if you would just say you \ncould sign a bill without a public option. That is no different than \nwhat I said to him on March 5 when I was down at the White House, that \nthe public option was a major impediment to getting a bipartisan \nagreement. Then he asked me would I be willing to be one of three \nRepublicans, along with the rest of the Democrats, to provide 60 votes. \nMy answer was upfront: No. As I told him, you can clarify with Senator \nBaucus sitting right here beside you, that 4 or 5 months before that, I \ntold Senator Baucus: Don't plan on three Republicans providing the \nmargin, that we were here to help get a broad-based consensus, as \nSenator Baucus and I said early on this year, that something this \nmassive ought to pass with a wide bipartisan majority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

I do \n     not recommend that you make any changes to the proposed \n     regulations, as I believe that they are consistent with the \n     clear meaning and spirit of their underlying statutory \n     authorization.\n       The remainder of this letter first comments on the general \n     privacy objections that have been raised by other commenters \n     with regard to the proposed regulations, and then addresses \n     several other criticisms and recommendations that are made in \n     some of those comments.\n\n\n                            Privacy Concerns\n\n       The most common criticism leveled against the proposed \n     regulations by other commenters is that the proposed rules \n     pose a threat to individual privacy. The general argument \n     made is that although fingerprints are routinely taken at \n     arrest, DNA fingerprinting is not like ordinary \n     fingerprinting because DNA has the potential to reveal \n     medically sensitive or other private information. This \n     concern usually also is the basis for arguments that the \n     proposed regulations are unconstitutional.\n       I think that the privacy concern is best addressed by \n     explaining the legal framework governing the operation of the \n     National DNA Index System (NDIS) and the practical realities \n     of DNA analysis.\n       A number of statutes prescribe privacy restrictions for use \n     of DNA samples. See 42 U.S.C. 14132(b)(3), (c), 14133(b)-(c), \n     14135(b)(2), 14135e. In general, DNA information is treated \n     like other law-enforcement case file information--its \n     dissemination is prohibited and subject to serious \n     professional and even criminal sanctions. In particular, \n     section 14133(c) of title 42 provides that any person who has \n     access to individually identifiable DNA information in NDIS \n     and knowingly discloses such information in an unauthorized \n     manner may be fined up to $100,000, and any person who \n     accesses DNA information without authorization may be fined \n     up to $250,000 and imprisoned up to one year.\n\n[[Page S12905]]\n\n       Lab employees are professionals. The notion that they will \n     violate the laws and regulations governing DNA analysis not \n     only requires one to assume that these employees will \n     jeopardize their careers, but also that they will risk \n     criminal fines and even imprisonment. Such fears are not \n     realistic. Indeed, when arguments were made that such \n     violations might occur during the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee's consideration of the Justice for All Act in 2004, \n     I proposed an amendment, which was subsequently enacted into \n     law, to increase the penalties in section 14133(c) for misuse \n     of DNA samples. When I consulted with the Justice Department \n     about my proposal, I was told that the FBI had no objection \n     to the amendment because there was no chance that any lab \n     employee would ever run afoul of the provision.\n       Let us assume, however, that a rogue lab employee were not \n     deterred by professional and criminal sanctions and were \n     determined to use a DNA sample to discover private \n     information. That lab employee would find that it is \n     virtually impossible for him to use the NDIS system to do so.\n       Developing a DNA profile from a saliva or blood sample \n     involves three broad steps: (1) the DNA is extracted from the \n     sample; (2) the DNA is copied or amplified at one of the \n     sites on the DNA strand from which the profile will be drawn; \n     and (3) the amplified DNA is processed in a genetic analyzer \n     to produce a DNA profile.\n       Each law enforcement DNA laboratory has a defined number of \n     staff who have access to DNA samples, the identity of the \n     person who submitted the sample, and DNA analysis equipment. \n     This is currently the universe of people who could \n     hypothetically use collected samples to try to violate \n     someone's privacy. If one of these employees sought to \n     analyze an individual's DNA to find medically sensitive or \n     other private information, he would run into a series of \n     virtually insurmountable practical problems.\n       First, the 13 sites at which a DNA strand is analyzed for \n     purposes of entry of a profile into the national database are \n     sites that do not reveal any medically sensitive information. \n     The 13 sites were chosen because the sites do not reveal \n     sensitive information, the sites are relatively stable and do \n     not degrade easily, and the sites tend to demonstrate great \n     variation between different individuals (with the exception \n     of identical twins). Even the American Civil Liberties \n     Union's (ACLU) May 19, 2008, comment on the proposed \n     regulations, while speculating that the 13 sites may be found \n     to reveal sensitive information in the future, concedes \n     ``none of the CODIS loci have been found to date to be \n     predictive for any physical or disease traits.''\n       So our hypothetical rogue lab employee would need to draw a \n     profile of different sites on the DNA strand in order to \n     discover medically sensitive information. This would be \n     extremely difficult to do. The second step of the analysis--\n     amplifying the relevant DNA sites for analysis--requires the \n     use of specialized reagents and equipment to copy the DNA \n     fragments in question.\n       Once the DNA is amplified, the DNA is pushed through a \n     column that separates out the DNA fragments. The columns used \n     in the lab serve to duplicate DNA for the specific 13 CODIS \n     sites. So our rogue employee would need to purchase a \n     specialized column for duplicating a different type of DNA. \n     Next the employee would need to obtain different reagents for \n     reproducing the DNA that he seeks. Reagents consist of \n     polymerase, certain chemicals, and DNA primers. A primer is a \n     piece of DNA that recognizes its complimentary DNA on a \n     molecule and attaches itself, allowing that part to be \n     reproduced when the remaining reagents are added. Access to \n     primers is extremely limited--our rogue employee couldn't \n     just buy them on the internet or from a medical supply store. \n     Primers usually are only available from the DNA researcher \n     who discovered the DNA gene or site in question. These \n     researchers generally have a proprietary interest in their \n     discovery; they do not publish all of the information \n     necessary to analyze that gene and do not give the necessary \n     primers to others. A lab employee is very unlikely to be able \n     to obtain the necessary information and primers to amplify \n     the DNA that he seeks.\n       Moreover, even if our hypothetical lab employee were able \n     to copy the DNA in question, he would next need to retrofit \n     the DNA analyzer to draw a profile from that DNA. This would \n     require breaking down, reassembling, and recalibrating the \n     lab equipment, and reprogramming the equipment and software \n     to analyze different DNA sites. This is an extremely complex \n     process and requires specialized software that, again, is \n     generally only available from the researchers who identified \n     the gene in question. The lab employees are not trained to \n     analyze any DNA other than at the 13 sites used in CODIS; to \n     analyze DNA used for medical purposes is a completely \n     different specialization that requires the use of equipment \n     that lab employees have no experience using.\n       Finally, our hypothetical rogue employee would need to \n     figure out how to do this analysis by himself and would need \n     to account for his use of the equipment. DNA analysis of \n     database samples is an assembly-line process that involves \n     different persons carrying out different steps of the \n     analysis. An employee acting alone would need to come in at \n     night and perform all of the steps by himself. Although \n     usually no employees are in the lab at night, the equipment \n     runs through the night. To use the equipment for a different \n     purpose, the rogue employee would need to shut it down, which \n     itself would lead to an inquiry into why the equipment did \n     not perform a programmed analysis at night. Moreover, the \n     robotics and most of the instruments used in DNA analysis \n     have programmed activity logs that record what process was \n     run on the equipment, and employees must log in it to operate \n     the equipment. Any inquiry into why the equipment was not \n     running at night would immediately reveal that a different \n     process was run on the equipment and would reveal who ran \n     that process.\n       Although it is not completely impossible, it is extremely \n     unlikely that a lab employee would be able to perform all of \n     these steps on his own, and it is virtually impossible that \n     he would be able to do so without getting caught. Suffice to \n     say that although the NDIS database has existed for 10 years \n     and nearly 6 million offender profiles have been added to \n     that database, and although the lab has been conducting \n     analysis of DNA from criminal suspects and victims for 20 \n     years, there has never been one noted case in which a lab \n     employee has ever made an unauthorized disclosure of DNA \n     information. The risk that lab employees will undertake such \n     acts is not substantial enough to merit consideration in a \n     reasoned analysis of the privacy risks posed by the operation \n     of NDIS.\n       Finally, it bears weighing the virtually nonexistent risk \n     to privacy posed by NDIS against other potential risks to DNA \n     privacy. Many of the arguments about the privacy threats \n     created by law-enforcement DNA sampling and analysis appear \n     to assume that DNA samples and the information within them \n     could not be accessed in any other way. A quick internet \n     search of the words ``DNA testing,'' however, reveals that \n     there are many private laboratories that offer to the public \n     at large a wide variety of DNA tests for sensitive \n     information. Nor are DNA samples particularly difficult to \n     obtain. Every time an individual spits on the sidewalk, or \n     even drinks from a paper cup and discards it, he leaves a DNA \n     sample behind. Particularly in light of the criminal \n     penalties attached to misuse of the NDIS system, a person \n     determined to analyze another person's DNA for an improper \n     purposes would find much easier sources of DNA than the \n     samples collected by law enforcement, and would have much \n     readier access to DNA analysis than that made possible by \n     law-enforcement laboratories. The incremental threat to DNA \n     privacy posed by the NDIS system is extremely small.\n\n\n                      Response to Other Commenters\n\n       A number of other commenters have offered various \n     criticisms of the proposed regulations beyond generalized \n     privacy arguments. Many of these comments are very similar \n     and appear to have been generated by news stories and notices \n     placed by various organizations and publications. Other \n     criticisms and recommendations are unique to particular \n     commenters. The remainder of this letter responds to those \n     criticisms, first addressing the mass comments and then the \n     arguments of particular organizations and individuals.\n     Constitutionality\n       The argument that arrestee and illegal-immigrant DNA \n     sampling violates the Fourth Amendment mostly rests on the \n     privacy arguments that are addressed above. It is beyond \n     argument that the Constitution permits arrestees and \n     immigration detainees to be fingerprinted and searched. If \n     the privacy risks posed by law-enforcement DNA sampling are \n     properly understood, there is no constitutionally significant \n     difference between ordinary fingerprinting and DNA \n     fingerprinting. Both are used for the legitimate purpose of \n     biometric identification and neither poses a significant risk \n     to individual privacy.\n       The physical intrusion necessary to collect a DNA sample is \n     minor and is commensurate with the other types of privacy \n     intrusions endured by arrestees, who are generally subject to \n     search following arrest. Some commenters cite the 1966 \n     Schmerber decision as a benchmark, and note that the court \n     upheld the drawing of a blood sample in that case because the \n     blood was drawn by a medical professional rather than by a \n     police officer. These commenters neglect to mention, however, \n     that the disposable and sterile pin-prick kits used to draw \n     blood samples for purposes of DNA analysis are much different \n     from and much less medically invasive than the needle-drawn \n     blood samples of 1966. And cheek swabs present even less of \n     an intrusion. Modern DNA sample-collection techniques present \n     less of a privacy intrusion than do the physical searches \n     that regularly accompany arrest.\n     Presumption of Innocence\n       Many commenters argue that DNA profiling of arrestees \n     violates the presumption of innocence that attaches to an \n     arrestee before he is convicted of a crime. Arrestees are \n     presumed innocent, but DNA sampling and analysis does not \n     constitute a finding or judgment of guilt. If biometric \n     identification did constitute such a judgment, then the \n     photographs and fingerprints taken at and kept after arrest \n     also would violate the presumption of innocence. They do not, \n     and neither does DNA sampling.\n     Disparate Impact\n       A number of commenters condemn the proposed regulations on \n     the basis that a disproportionate number of members of racial \n     minorities may be subjected to DNA sampling. A disparate \n     effect, however, is not the same thing as discrimination and \n     is not unconstitutional or otherwise proscribed. Nor\n\n[[Page S12906]]\n\n     could it be. Most laws have some type of disparate effect; it \n     is a rare (if nonexistent) law that affects each racial or \n     ethnic group in the United States in proportion to its \n     percentage of the U.S. population. The proposed regulations \n     are tied an individual's arrest or his detention on account \n     of his illegal presence in this country; they do not \n     discriminate between individuals on account of their race.\n     Analysis Backlog\n       Several commenters complain that adding DNA samples of \n     arrestees and detained illegal immigrants to NDIS will \n     increase the number of DNA samples that the FBI lab or \n     private labs used by the FBI must analyze, and that a backlog \n     of samples may result. The FBI lab and other law enforcement \n     authorities, however, have ample discretion to decide which \n     samples should be analyzed first. These commenters suggest \n     that a backlog of samples may hinder investigations, but a \n     murder or rape for which no suspect has been identified would \n     be hindered more by never collecting a DNA sample from the \n     perpetrator than by collecting that sample and analyzing it \n     after a delay. To the extent that these commenters are \n     concerned about the cost of analyzing DNA samples, they \n     should bear in mind the massive costs of the labor-intensive \n     police manhunts for serial murderers and rapists that would \n     be avoided if the perpetrator could be identified through DNA \n     sample collection, and the enormous costs of crime to its \n     victims and to society as a whole.\n     Outsourcing\n       Many commenters suggest that the proposed regulations pose \n     a privacy risk by allowing private contractors to aid in DNA \n     sample processing. These private laboratories are subject to \n     a comprehensive system of regulation, however. They also have \n     a powerful incentive to handle samples properly: a lab that \n     fails to do so will lose its contract and will go out of \n     business.\n     ACLU Letter\n       In addition to raising arguments addressed above, the \n     ACLU's May 19 comment argues that biological samples should \n     be destroyed after analysis. This recommendation is outside \n     the scope of the proposed regulations, and in any event \n     should be rejected. Biological samples need to be retained in \n     case the technology used for analysis is changed and all \n     existing samples must be reanalyzed, something that has \n     happened once already. Moreover, such samples are used for \n     quality control, and for rechecking a purported match to \n     crime scene evidence without taking a new sample from the \n     suspect identified by the match.\n       The ACLU argues that collection of DNA from immigration \n     detainees will deepen resentment and hostility among ethnic \n     communities living in or visiting the United States. Few \n     things exacerbate tensions between Americans and foreign \n     visitors to this country more severely, however, than the \n     serious crimes committed in the United States by illegal \n     immigrants. Angel Resendiz, the so-called Railway Killer, was \n     in this country illegal and is believed to have murdered 15 \n     people here (and an untold number in Mexico). Santana Aceves, \n     the so-called Chandler rapist and also an illegal immigrant, \n     sexually assaulted half a dozen young girls in their homes in \n     the Chandler suburb of Phoenix in 2007 and 2008. Both cases \n     ``deepened resentment and hostility'' toward illegal \n     immigrants in this country. And both Resendiz and Aceves \n     would have been identified and their crime sprees likely \n     stopped early had their DNA been taken during one of their \n     earlier deportations. Relations between different groups in \n     this country surely would be bettered rather than worsened \n     has these two men's names not been permitted to become \n     household words in the communities that they targeted.\n       The ACLU recommends that the proposed regulations \n     ``prohibit comparison of an individual's DNA profile with \n     anything other than the DNA profiles generated from the crime \n     scene evidence for which she [sic] is suspected unless or \n     until that person is convicted.'' This is a proposal to bar \n     the use of arrestee and detainee DNA to make cold-case \n     matches to crime-scene evidence. It is effectively a \n     recommendation to gut the proposed regulations and to \n     abdicate the Justice Department's responsibility to use the \n     authority created by the DNA Fingerprint Act and the Adam \n     Walsh Act. My floor statement commenting on final Senate \n     action on the DNA Fingerprint Act describes the dozens of \n     rapes and murders that could have been prevented in just one \n     American city had arrestee sampling been in place; I offer it \n     as rebuttal to the ACLU's argument that the proposed \n     regulations should not permit arrestee DNA to be used to \n     solve cold-case crimes.\n       The ACLU suggests that the Justice Department reassess the \n     costs and benefits of broad sampling and consider narrower \n     alternatives. ``Narrower alternatives'' would mean fewer \n     rapes and murders prevented, a cost which alone justifies the \n     proposed regulations.\n       The ACLU argues that the proposed regulations, by allowing \n     some exceptions to their sampling rules, fail to give \n     individuals adequate notice whether they will be subject to \n     sampling. The proposed rule clearly requires that all federal \n     arrestees and illegal immigrants being deported be sampled. \n     Allowing a few exceptions to this rule for practical and \n     other reasons does not significantly detract from the notice \n     given by the proposed regulations.\n       The ACLU complains that the proposed rule does not address \n     how to avoid duplicative sampling of the same individual. \n     This is an administrative matter that does not merit \n     attention in the text of the proposed regulation.\n       The ACLU questions the Justice Department's estimate of the \n     cost of analyzing and storing DNA samples. The Justice \n     Department's estimate is comparable to other estimates of the \n     costs of DNA storage and analysis.\n       The ACLU concludes that Congress ``doubtless intended that \n     the regulations would address [legal, privacy, and policy] \n     concerns and would limit the DNA sampling to instances where \n     . . . the benefits outweigh the costs.'' I believe that the \n     proposed rule adequately considers these concerns and \n     appropriately exercises the authority given to the Justice \n     Department by Congress.\n     McLain and Mercer Letter\n       William McClain and Stephen Mercer, both law professors at \n     the University of the District of Columbia, contend in a May \n     19, 2008 comment that the proposed regulations should be \n     modified to allow an individual to retain counsel and file a \n     lawsuit before a sample is collected. I urge the Justice \n     Department to reject this recommendation. Any individual \n     wishing to contest the legality of arrestee sampling may \n     challenge such sampling after the fact; the interests at \n     stake are not substantial enough to justify a pre-litigation \n     injunction in the regulations themselves. Such a delay in \n     sampling would also undermine the administration of the \n     proposed system, as it is far easier to collect a sample at \n     booking, when fingerprints and pictures are also taken.\n       The professors also suggest that the ``reasonable means'' \n     authorized to collect samples be defined more specifically \n     and be defined in the same way for all agencies collecting \n     samples. The different agencies collecting samples have \n     different means at their disposal and deal with different \n     populations of offenders and detainees; it is appropriate \n     that reasonableness should be defined in the context of each \n     agency and by that agency.\n       The professors also recommend that all DNA processing \n     agreements with private entities specify that all \n     constitutional, statutory, and regulatory federal law \n     requirements that would apply to government processing also \n     apply to private processing. Such a requirement is \n     superfluous, and in any event is unnecessary in light of the \n     comprehensive regulation of private entities processing DNA \n     on behalf of the Federal government.\n     Center for Constitutional Rights Letter\n       Aside from arguments addressed above, CCR argues in a May \n     19, 2008 comment that the proposed regulations would give \n     Homeland Security staff discretion to ``take DNA samples of \n     everyone pulled out of line for questioning at an airport \n     immigration station.'' This is an unreasonable reading of the \n     regulations, which exclude from sampling ``aliens held at a \n     port of entry during consideration of admissibility and not \n     subject to further detention or proceedings.'' The \n     regulation's ``further detention or proceedings'' clearly \n     contemplates more than just minor additional questioning at a \n     port of entry.\n     Alliance for Democracy and United for Peace and Justice et \n         al.\n       These two groups submitted comments on May 19, 2008 \n     suggesting that the proposed regulations would inhibit speech \n     because DNA samples would be taken from persons arrested for \n     civil disobedience. A person wishing to criticize the \n     government or communicate other messages has many ways of \n     doing so without committing a crime, and if he chooses to \n     commit a crime, he should be prepared to face the \n     consequences of doing so, including booking, fingerprinting, \n     DNA sample collection, and a fine or imprisonment.\n     National Lawyers Guild--Columbia Law School\n       NLG suggests in an April 21, 2008 comment that the proposed \n     regulations be amended to expressly bar DNA sample collection \n     from LPRs until they are ordered removed and their appeals \n     are exhausted. LPRs very rarely find themselves in \n     immigration detention, and when they do so, it is \n     overwhelmingly because they have committed a crime--and \n     therefore would be subject to sampling on that basis. The \n     remaining class of LPRs not subject to sampling is de \n     minimis; their situation does not rise to the level of a \n     matter that needs to be addressed on the face of the proposed \n     regulations.\n       NLG also suggests that, because of the risk that a citizen \n     may be mistakenly detained in immigration proceedings, no \n     illegal immigrant should be sampled unless his nationality is \n     conceded or proved, or in the alternative that no sampling \n     ought to take place until a final order of removal has been \n     entered. This proposal would substantially defeat \n     administration of illegal-immigrant sampling by precluding \n     sampling as part of the booking process. Moreover, cases in \n     which citizens are mistakenly detained for deportation are \n     extremely rare and are almost always corrected very quickly. \n     The few cases that might occur should be dealt with on a \n     case-by-case basis and do not merit attention in the text of \n     the proposed rule.\n       NLG also suggests that subsection (b)(1) of the proposed \n     rule suggests that ``the Secretary of Homeland Security could \n     authorize that which is not authorized by Congress''--\n\n[[Page S12907]]\n\n     apparently LPR sampling, though NLG is unclear on this point. \n     NLG's concern is misplaced. The bar on LPR sampling is \n     implicit in the proposed regulation, which earlier in the \n     same subsection clearly excludes LPRs.\n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts\n       The AOC suggests in a May 16, 2008 comment that the word \n     ``agency'' as used in the proposed rule be defined to exempt \n     judicial agencies from the obligation to collect DNA samples \n     from persons facing charges. A person facing Federal charges \n     may have been arrested by state authorities or turned himself \n     in, and therefore may not have had a DNA sample collected by \n     an executive agency during a Federal arrest.

Mr. President, I want to speak today in favor of the \nadministration's funding request for the Global Peace Operations \nInitiative and one of its important components, the Africa Contingency \nOperations Training and Assistance Program, for which the bill before \nthe Senate, the fiscal year 2010 State-Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill, includes $96.8 million in funding. These programs, \nwhich I have supported in their various forms for more than a decade, \nare vital tools in helping the United States and nations around the \nworld, but especially in Africa, to contain crises, violence and \ninstability that threaten not only other nations, but also our own.\n  The Global Peace Operations Initiative, or GPOI, began in fiscal year \n2005 as an effort to address worrisome gaps in the world community's \nability to support, equip, and sustain a growing number of peacekeeping \noperations. This initiative comprised, in part, the fulfillment of a \nU.S. pledge at the June 2004 G-8 summit meeting at Sea Island, Georgia, \nto train 75,000 new peacekeepers. The GPOI built on and incorporated \nthe Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance Program, or \nACOTA, which has trained African peacekeepers since 1997. The objective \nof these programs is to train and equip military units to deploy to \npeacekeeping operations, many of them in Africa. In addition, GPOI \nsupports efforts to train special ``gendarme'' police units to \nparticipate in peacekeeping operations.\n  Why are these programs so important? I think we all recognize that \nthe world has become a more challenging and less stable place, but we \nmay not recognize just how pronounced regional security problems have \nbecome. We do not need to look further than the two largest United \nNations peacekeeping operations, in Darfur, Sudan, and in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Both of these missions were \nauthorized in response to complex regional conflicts. The United \nNations, which oversees the majority of peacekeeping operations \nworldwide, reports that more than 100,000 peacekeepers and police \npersonnel are deployed on peacekeeping operations--a sevenfold increase \nsince 1999. Those troops are deployed in 17 separate operations, nearly \nhalf of which are on the African continent.\n  Through ACOTA and GPOI, the United States has helped to meet the \ngrowing demand for peacekeeping personnel. Since its start in 2005 \nthrough the end of fiscal year 2009, GPOI has provided training for \nnearly 87,000 personnel representing more than 50 nations. \nAppropriately, given the security challenges in Africa, ACOTA is GPOI's \nbiggest initiative. Since 2005, more than 77,000 personnel from about \ntwo dozen African nations have received training through the \ninitiative, and almost 14,000 more have received training under ACOTA \nthrough other funding sources. To make these numbers more significant, \non average, 90 percent of units trained under ACOTA have deployed \nbetween 2005 and 2009.\n  GPOI provides partner nations with the training and equipment they \nneed to perform peacekeeping missions through the UN or regional groups \nsuch as the African Union. This training is broad, and appropriately \nfocuses on peacekeeping-specific tasks such as how to operate \ncheckpoints and convoys, maintaining peace by safely disarming \npotential combatants, protecting refugees and internally displaced \npersons, developing and following appropriate rules of engagement, and, \nin some cases, peacemaking operations.\n  According to a report by the Department of State Inspector General, \nGPOI training through ACOTA ``is a win-win situation in which minimal \nnumbers of U.S. military troops are involved, African professionalism \nand capacity are built up, and the participating African troops are \nrewarded well when deployed.'' Significantly, the IG report states \n``that there have been minimal disciplinary problems and no ACOTA \ntrained troops have been cited for atrocities or notable human rights \nabuses,'' an important sign that the emphasis on adherence to human \nrights standards and following the UN's rules of engagement has paid \noff.\n  The bill before the Senate, the State-Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill, includes funding for the administration's request \nof $96.8 million in funding for GPOI in fiscal year 2010. All of this \nfunding is contained in the peacekeeping operations, or PKO, account of \nthe bill. Based on past practice and the demand for peacekeeping in \nAfrica, the Department of State will likely allocate more than half of \nthis funding to ACOTA. Nearly $100 million is a substantial commitment \nof taxpayer dollars. But the price of failing to fund these important \nefforts would be far higher.\n  Our military leaders are particularly supportive of such efforts, \nwith good reason. Admiral Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, believes the U.S. commitment to aid the peacekeeping efforts \nof other nations is ``extremely important and cost effective in \ncomparison to unilateral operations these peacekeepers help promote \nstability and help reduce the risks that major U.S. military \ninterventions may be required to restore stability in a country or \nregion. Therefore, the success of these operations is very much in our \nnational interest.''\n  I agree with Admiral Mullen. Programs such as GPOI are important not \nonly because they help alleviate suffering around the globe--which they \nsurely do--but also because they are a cost-effective way of managing \nU.S. security interests.\n  I am especially pleased that the administration intends to \nconcentrate going forward on strengthening the capability of partner \nnations to train their own peacekeeping forces. This ``train the \ntrainers'' approach multiplies the impact of U.S. efforts by giving \npartner nations the ability to sustain their own peacekeeping efforts. \nUsing this model, the State Department plans to assist in the training \nand equipping of more than 240,000 peacekeepers over the next 5 years. \nThe other focus will be on growing the planning and operational \ncapability of the regional security organizations on the African \ncontinent.\n  There are other steps we should take to make these vital programs \nmore effective, particularly in Africa. Outside that continent, the \nU.S. military's Geographic Combatant Commands are responsible for much \nof the day-to-day management of GPOI programs, including contract \nmanagement. In Africa, however, those tasks have been performed by \ncontractors working for the State Department's Bureau of African \nAffairs. With the stand-up of U.S. Africa Command, AFRICOM, in 2008, \nthere is now a Combatant Command in place that could take over the same \ntypes of management duties performed elsewhere by its sister commands. \nI believe\n\n[[Page S12908]]\n\nthe Departments of State and Defense should explore whether such \narrangements are advisable. Given the State Department's deep reliance \non contractor personnel to manage the ACOTA program and AFRICOM's \nunique interagency command structure, I believe AFRICOM ought to be \ngiven a more significant role in the day-to-day execution of this \ncritical program. Meanwhile, both departments should make efforts to \nensure close cooperation between the State Department and AFRICOM \npersonnel so that the taxpayers and partner nations see the maximum \nbang for the buck because they are a cost-effective way of managing \nU.S. security interests and supporting U.N. peacekeeping while \nreserving U.S. troops for other operations.\n  Having successfully completed the first 5-year phase, GPOI is \nentering a new phase. I urge my colleagues to support fully the \nadministration's funding request for GPOI. With this money, we can help \ncontain violence and chaos in many of the world's most troubled places. \nWe can reduce the chance for such instability to create direct and \nimmediate threats to our own security. We can enhance the ability of \npartner nations to maintain the peace in their own sectors of the \nglobe. And we can accomplish all these things with a relatively modest \namount of money--an investment with a substantial return, in both human \nand financial terms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/10/senate-section/article/S12908-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:35 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 86.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. PRYOR:\n  S. 2863. A bill to provide that an outbreak of infectious disease or \nact of terrorism may be a major disaster under the Robert T. Stafford \nDisaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122 et seq.), \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation to address gaps in our preparedness and ability to respond \nto widespread infectious disease outbreaks and biological attacks.\n  The H1N1 outbreak demonstrated to us how investments in pandemic \npreparedness activities, such as the creation of pandemic influenza \nstrategies, can lessen the effects of a pandemic and improve our \nresponse. However, we have learned from the H1N1 pandemic that we still \nhave gaps in our ability to prepare for and respond to these types of \nevents and that state and local entities are uncertain in their \nabilities to respond to a more severe event.\n  Apart from shortcomings in government coordination and planning, \nthere is also a glaring deficiency in an important statute that \nunderpins our nation's response to disasters. When a natural disaster \nsuch as flooding in Arkansas occurs, local and State government \nresources can be quickly overextended. When that occurs a governor can \nrequest and the President can issue a major disaster declaration, which \ntriggers the maximum amount of resources from the Federal disaster \nresponse system.\n  Sometimes the system works well and other times not as well, but we \nknow for certain that without a disaster declaration and effective \nFederal intervention a natural disaster can have devastating effects on \nlife, property, and our economy.\n  Unfortunately, due to a lack of clarification of the definition of a \nmajor disaster in the Stafford Act, there is no precedent for the \nPresident to issue a major disaster declaration when local medical \nresources are overwhelmed by the exponential spread of life-threatening \ndiseases, or alternatively, a deliberate biological attack by \nterrorists. The bills that I am introducing today will help to address \npreparedness shortcomings as well as the deficiency in law.\n  My first bill, S. 2863, entitled The Emergency Response Act, \naddresses this shortcoming in law. It will ensure the Federal \nGovernment can provide the maximum amount of support to State and local \ngovernments by allowing pandemics, acts of terrorism or other man-made \ndisasters to be considered a major disaster under the Stafford Act. \nThis clarification in law will permit the President to issue a major \ndisaster declaration and allow Federal agencies to coordinate their \nefforts, give technical assistance, give advisory assistance, and work \nwith local authorities and people in the private sector for events such \nas pandemics, biological attacks or chemical releases.\n  The second bill, S. 2864, entitled The Defense Against Infectious \nDisease Act, requires the Federal government to periodically update the \nNational Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and the National Pandemic \nImplementation plan with the assistance of State, Local and Tribal \nstakeholders in order to ensure our preparedness plans are up to date \nand incorporate the latest technologies, medical developments and \nlogistical challenges.\n  This bill addresses concerns raised by the U.S. Government \nAccountability Office about both the completeness of these emergency \nplans and the need for them to be updated. Most Americans may not even \nknow that these emergency plans exist, but they do understand that \nstrong planning is the foundation for effective action. An out-of-date \nplan is not a plan, and after watching the spread of H1N1 and the \nmissteps in our government's response, Americans can easily imagine \nwhat it would be like in the event of an even more serious disease \noutbreak, and the importance of planning for such an emergency.\n  This bill will also help address the situation I described previously \nin which a severe infectious disease outbreak can overwhelm our local \nmedical facilities, many of which have limited resources to handle even \ntheir every day needs. To address situations which will over extend \nlocal resources, my bill also requires the Federal Government to \nidentify alternative medical care facilities and other resources such \nas medical equipment, daily supplies and personnel to ensure we know \nwhat assets we have to help State and local communities.\n  The idea here is preparation. We should make the best of the H1N1 \noutbreak and learn from this experience. That is why I introduced the \nEmergency Response Act and the Defense Against Infectious Diseases Act. \nI ask that my colleagues support these bills to ensure that we are \nprepared for the next pandemic.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12912]]\n\n                 Emergency Response Act of 2009 Summary\n\n       The Emergency Response Act of 2009 is intended to improve \n     response to infectious disease outbreaks, acts of terrorism \n     and other disasters.\n       Section 2 of the legislation amends the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistant Act to provide that a \n     pandemic, act of terrorism or other manmade disaster be \n     considered a trigger to issue a ``major disaster'' \n     declaration under the Act. Section 3 creates a working group \n     under the auspices of the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     prepare recommendations for facilitating the dissemination of \n     public health information to State fusion centers and the \n     greater homeland security community.\n\n        Defense Against Infectious Diseases Act of 2009 Summary\n\n       The Defense Against Infectious Disease Act of 2009 is \n     intended to address gaps in preparedness in the event of a \n     significant outbreak of an infectious disease.\n       Section 3 of the legislation directs that a consortium of \n     state, local, and tribal representatives be convened to \n     assess the adequacy of existing guidance and support in the \n     National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and National \n     Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation plans. Section \n     4 directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services in \n     coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     identify alternative medical care facilities and resources \n     available to locate and distribute both medical and non-\n     medical supplies to support communities over extended by an \n     infectious disease outbreak. Section 5 directs GAO to prepare \n     a report describing the roles and responsibilities, \n     capabilities and coordination of federal government assets in \n     place across various departments for responding to infectious \n     disease outbreaks and biological attacks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2869. A bill to increase loan limits for small business concerns, \nto provide for low interest refinancing for small business concerns, \nand for other purposes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, our Nation's small businesses have \ncreated 64 percent of all new jobs in the last 15 years, yet in the \nlast year nearly 85 percent of the jobs lost have come from small \nbusinesses. To reverse this job loss trend and allow small businesses \nto be the engine of economic growth once again, we must make sure they \nhave the access to capital they need to be successful and help grow our \neconomy.\n  That is exactly why I, along with the ranking member of the Small \nBusiness Committee, Olympia Snowe of Maine, am introducing the Small \nBusiness Job Creation and Access to Capital Act of 2009. This \nbipartisan legislation is a result of five hearings and roundtables in \nthe Small Business Committee this year as well as numerous meetings \nwith small business owners. It builds off of S. 1832, the Small \nBusiness Access to Capital Act of 2009, and S. 1615, the Next Step for \nMain Street Credit Availability Act of 2009, legislation Senator Snowe \nand I have previously introduced.\n  This legislation enhances the ability of the SBA to support larger \nloans and provide more options to small businesses. As many other \nsources of capital have evaporated, loans guaranteed by the SBA, with \nsupport of funding through the Recovery Act, have been able to support \n$16.5 billion in loans to small businesses. Specifically, this act \nwould: increase the loan limit on 7(a) loans from $2 million to $5 \nmillion; increase the loan limit on 504 loans from $1.5 million to $5.5 \nmillion; increase the loan limit on microloans from $35,000 to $50,000, \nas well as increase the loan limit to microloan intermediaries from \n$3.5 million to $5 million; allow the 504 loan program to refinance \nshort-term commercial real estate debt into long-term, fixed rate \nloans; extend the authorization to provide 90 percent guarantees on \n7(a) loans and fee elimination for borrowers on 7(a) and 504 loans \nthrough December 31, 2010; and direct the SBA to create a website where \nsmall businesses can identify lenders in their communities.\n  These provisions will have an immediate impact on increasing the \navailability of credit for small businesses and spurring job growth, \nwith many of these provisions coming at little or no cost to the \ngovernment. For example, the SBA estimates that the loan limit \nincreases will be budget neutral, but will increase SBA lending by $5 \nbillion next year alone. The refinancing provisions could help save \n60,000 jobs next year by allowing small businesses to refinance short-\nterm commercial real estate debt into long-term fixed rate mortgages. \nTo ensure that this program is budget neutral we have included a \nprovision that would require any additional cost created by the program \nto be funded by the fees of the participants. Additionally, we have \nplaced a number of safeguards on this program, such as requiring that \nthe refinanced loan be current for at least one year, that the business \nowner invest a minimum of 20 percent equity and that the availability \nof funds be capped at $65,000 for every job retained.\n  The extension of the 90 percent guarantees on 7(a) loan and the fee \nelimination for borrowers on traditional 504 and 7(a) loans extends \ncritical provisions in the Recovery Act. This legislation does not \ninclude the appropriations for this funding, but does provide an \nextension of its authorization should appropriations be made available. \nIt is estimated that if an additional $479 million were to be \nappropriated for these programs, the SBA would be able to support $18.5 \nbillion in lending to small businesses. Alternately, we are starting to \nsee the impact of this funding not being available. In the first full \nweek of lending since the SBA had to create a waiting list for the \nfinal Recovery Act funding, 7(a) loan volume fell from $985 million in \nthe last week of the full funding being available, to $71 million. This \n$71 million in loan volume is lower than the average weekly volume we \nwere experiencing before the Recovery Act was approved. We also know \nthat as of today there are more than 700 small businesses in the SBA \nwaiting list approved for $350 million in loans if we made more funding \navailable.\n  It is clear that now is the time to act. Our Nation's small \nbusinesses need access to capital and this bill helps facilitate this \ncrucial need.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, we all know the statistics are bleak. \nUnemployment is at 10 percent, more than 7 million Americans have lost \ntheir jobs since the start of this current recession, and the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses' Optimism Index, a compilation of \n10 survey indicators, is at 88.3, a number the NFIB calls ``stuck at \nrecession levels.'' These statistics, and the stories they represent \npresent Congress with myriad challenges including: What will we do to \nlower unemployment, create jobs, and help our small businesses to grow \nagain?\n  The legislation Chair Landrieu and I are introducing today, the Small \nBusiness Job Creation and Access to Capital Act of 2009, aims to meet \nthis challenge and takes the best ideas from Republicans and Democrats, \nto help put American small businesses back to work. I would especially \nlike to thank the Chair for working with me in such an open manner in \ndeveloping this bill. Creating jobs and helping small businesses should \nnot be a partisan issue and the Chair has been extremely open to my \nsuggestions, incorporating many of the provisions I originally \nintroduced in the Small Business Lending Improvement Act, the 10 Steps \nfor a Main Street Economic Recovery Act, and the Next Step for a Main \nStreet Economic Recovery Act into this legislation.\n  In the past year, one cornerstone of small business recovery has been \nSmall Business Administration, SBA, backed lending. Last year, to help \naddress the chronic shortage of capital for small business borrowers, I \nintroduced the 10 Steps for a Main Street Economic Recovery Act. Many \nof the provisions in this legislation were included in the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act and some have been credited with helping \nto increase SBA loan volume 79 percent.\n  One provision which has been extremely popular has been fee \nreductions for 7(a) and 504 loans. In fact, at a round table on \nreauthorizing the SBA's access to capital programs the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship heard from Mr. Michael Heath, \nthe owner of Ramunto's Brick Oven Pizza in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. Mr. \nHeath told the Committee that the funds he saved in SBA fee reductions \nhelped him buy his pizzeria. The bill we are introducing today would \nextend the fee reductions I originally proposed in 10 Steps to December \n31st, 2010. This critical step ensures that we can continue to help \nentrepreneurs like Mike open businesses on Main Streets across America.\n  Another vital provision contained in this legislation expands the \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S12913]]\n\nbusinesses eligible for SBA-backed loans and expands the size of those \nloans. I originally proposed this idea in the Small Business Lending \nImprovement Act which calls for an alternative size standard that would \nhelp more small businesses meet the SBA's requirements to access SBA-\nbacked loans, and also included it in the Next Step for Main Street \nCredit Availability Act, which includes provisions allowing borrowers \nto take out larger 7(a) loans, microloans, and 504 loans. President \nObama has also recognized the need for larger loan sizes and has \nadvocated for this position as a way to create jobs and help small \nbusinesses.\n  Underscoring the inadequate size of SBA loans, I heard testimony \nearlier this year at a field hearing Senator Shaheen and I held in \nPortland, Maine from Mr. Richard Pfeffer, a local business owner, on \nhow small SBA loan sizes have directly impacted his business. Mr. \nPfeffer testified that his two businesses, Aroostook Starch and Gritty \nMcDuff's, a restaurant and pub regarded by many as a Portland landmark, \nwere close to bankruptcy not because of the economic downturn, but \nrather because of his inability to access larger SBA loans. Mr. Pfeffer \nis still in business today, and Gritty's is now serving its famous \nChristmas Ale, but his inability to access capital still looms and it \nis costing him the opportunity to expand his business and hire more \nworkers. The increased loan limits in this bill would help Mr. Pfeffer \nand others like him to put the American economy back on track.\n  This bill also includes another provision I proposed in March and \nintroduced in my Next Steps legislation that would allow SBA borrowers \nto shop and compare SBA loan rates online, offering borrowers the \nopportunity to make an informed choice and save time and money.\n  Finally, the Small Business Job Creation and Access to Capital Act of \n2009 would allow borrowers of 504 loans to refinance their debt. This \nprovision will give borrowers critical working capital that they can \nuse to grow and expand their businesses.\n  These targeted reforms will help put Americans back to work, ease the \ncapital crunch for small businesses, and help bring SBA lending into \nthe future. I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation \nto improve America's economy and increase small business lending.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/10/senate-section/article/S12913-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12913-S12914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3115.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 10103.

ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided for in this \n     section, the time for the commencement of a health care \n     lawsuit shall be 3 years after the date of manifestation of \n     injury or 1 year after the claimant discovers, or through the \n     use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the \n     injury, whichever occurs first.\n       (b) General Exception.--The time for the commencement of a \n     health care lawsuit shall not exceed 3 years after the date \n     of manifestation of injury unless the tolling of time was \n     delayed as a result of--\n       (1) fraud;\n       (2) intentional concealment; or\n       (3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no \n     therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of \n     the injured person.\n       (c) Minors.--An action by a minor shall be commenced within \n     3 years from the date of the alleged manifestation of injury \n     except that if such minor is under the full age of 6 years, \n     such action shall be commenced within 3 years of the \n     manifestation of injury, or prior to the eighth birthday of \n     the minor, whichever provides a longer period. Such time \n     limitation shall be tolled for minors for any period during \n     which a parent or guardian and a health care provider or \n     health care institution have committed fraud or collusion in \n     the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured \n     minor.\n       (d) Rule 11 Sanctions.--Whenever a Federal or State court \n     determines (whether by motion of the parties or whether on \n     the motion of the court) that there has been a violation of \n     Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (or a similar \n     violation of applicable State court rules) in a health care \n     liability action to which this subtitle applies, the court \n     shall impose upon the attorneys, law firms, or pro se \n     litigants that have violated Rule 11 or are responsible for \n     the violation, an appropriate sanction, which shall include \n     an order to pay the other party or parties for the reasonable \n     expenses incurred as a direct result of the filing of the \n     pleading, motion, or other paper that is the subject of the \n     violation, including a reasonable attorneys' fee. Such \n     sanction shall be sufficient to deter repetition of such \n     conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated, \n     and to compensate the party or parties injured by such \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 10105. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.\n\n       (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses \n     in Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, nothing \n     in this subtitle shall limit the recovery by a claimant of \n     the full amount of the available economic damages, \n     notwithstanding the limitation contained in subsection (b).\n       (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--\n       (1) Health care providers.--In any health care lawsuit \n     where final judgment is rendered against a health care \n     provider, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered from \n     the provider, if otherwise available under applicable Federal \n     or State law, may be as much as $250,000, regardless of the \n     number of parties other than a health care institution \n     against whom the action is brought or the number of separate \n     claims or actions brought with respect to the same \n     occurrence.\n       (2) Health care institutions.--\n       (A) Single institution.--In any health care lawsuit where \n     final judgment is rendered against a single health care \n     institution, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered from \n     the institution, if otherwise available under applicable \n     Federal or State law, may be as much as $250,000, regardless \n     of the number of parties against whom the action is brought \n     or the number of separate claims or actions brought with \n     respect to the same occurrence.\n       (B) Multiple institutions.--In any health care lawsuit \n     where final judgment is rendered against more than one health \n     care institution, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered \n     from each institution, if otherwise available under \n     applicable Federal or State law, may be as much as $250,000, \n     regardless of the number of parties against whom the action \n     is brought or the number of separate claims or actions \n     brought with respect to the same occurrence, except that the \n     total amount recovered from all such institutions in such \n     lawsuit shall not exceed $500,000.\n       (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--In any \n     health care lawsuit--\n       (1) an award for future noneconomic damages shall not be \n     discounted to present value;\n       (2) the jury shall not be informed about the maximum award \n     for noneconomic damages under subsection (b);\n       (3) an award for noneconomic damages in excess of the \n     limitations provided for in subsection (b) shall be reduced \n     either before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the \n     judgment after entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be \n     made before accounting for any other reduction in damages \n     required by law; and\n       (4) if separate awards are rendered for past and future \n     noneconomic damages and the combined awards exceed the \n     limitations described in subsection (b), the future \n     noneconomic damages shall be reduced first.\n       (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each \n     party shall be liable for that party's several share of any \n     damages only and not for the share of any other person. Each \n     party shall be liable only for the amount of damages \n     allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party's \n     percentage of responsibility. A separate judgment shall be \n     rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to \n     such party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact \n     shall determine the proportion of responsibility of each \n     party for the claimant's harm.\n\n     SEC. 10106. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY.\n\n       (a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to \n     Claimants.--\n       (1) In general.--In any health care lawsuit, the court \n     shall supervise the arrangements for payment of damages to \n     protect against conflicts of interest that may have the \n     effect of reducing the amount of damages awarded that are \n     actually paid to claimants.\n       (2) Contingency fees.--\n       (A) In general.--In any health care lawsuit in which the \n     attorney for a party claims a financial stake in the outcome \n     by virtue of a contingent fee, the court shall have the power \n     to restrict the payment of a claimant's damage recovery to \n     such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the claimant \n     based upon the interests of justice and principles of equity.\n       (B) Limitation.--The total of all contingent fees for \n     representing all claimants in a health care lawsuit shall not \n     exceed the following limits:\n       (i) 40 percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (ii) 33\\1/3\\ percent of the next $50,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (iii) 25 percent of the next $500,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (iv) 15 percent of any amount by which the recovery by the \n     claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000.\n       (b) Applicability.--\n       (1) In general.--The limitations in subsection (a) shall \n     apply whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, \n     mediation, arbitration, or any other form of alternative \n     dispute resolution.\n       (2) Minors.--In a health care lawsuit involving a minor or \n     incompetent person, a court retains the authority to \n     authorize or approve a fee that is less than the maximum \n     permitted under this section.\n       (c) Expert Witnesses.--\n       (1) Requirement.--No individual shall be qualified to \n     testify as an expert witness concerning issues of negligence \n     in any health\n\n[[Page S12930]]\n\n     care lawsuit against a defendant unless such individual--\n       (A) except as required under paragraph (2), is a health \n     care professional who--\n       (i) is appropriately credentialed or licensed in 1 or more \n     States to deliver health care services; and\n       (ii) typically treats the diagnosis or condition or \n     provides the type of treatment under review; and\n       (B) can demonstrate by competent evidence that, as a result \n     of training, education, knowledge, and experience in the \n     evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease or injury \n     which is the subject matter of the lawsuit against the \n     defendant, the individual was substantially familiar with \n     applicable standards of care and practice as they relate to \n     the act or omission which is the subject of the lawsuit on \n     the date of the incident.\n       (2) Physician review.--In a health care lawsuit, if the \n     claim of the plaintiff involved treatment that is recommended \n     or provided by a physician (allopathic or osteopathic), an \n     individual shall not be qualified to be an expert witness \n     under this subsection with respect to issues of negligence \n     concerning such treatment unless such individual is a \n     physician.\n       (3) Specialties and subspecialties.--With respect to a \n     lawsuit described in paragraph (1), a court shall not permit \n     an expert in one medical specialty or subspecialty to testify \n     against a defendant in another medical specialty or \n     subspecialty unless, in addition to a showing of substantial \n     familiarity in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), there is a \n     showing that the standards of care and practice in the two \n     specialty or subspecialty fields are similar.\n       (4) Limitation.--The limitations in this subsection shall \n     not apply to expert witnesses testifying as to the degree or \n     permanency of medical or physical impairment.\n\n     SEC. 10107. ADDITIONAL HEALTH BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The amount of any damages received by a \n     claimant in any health care lawsuit shall be reduced by the \n     court by the amount of any collateral source benefits to \n     which the claimant is entitled, less any insurance premiums \n     or other payments made by the claimant (or by the spouse, \n     parent, child, or legal guardian of the claimant) to obtain \n     or secure such benefits.\n       (b) Preservation of Current Law.--Where a payor of \n     collateral source benefits has a right of recovery by \n     reimbursement or subrogation and such right is permitted \n     under Federal or State law, subsection (a) shall not apply.\n       (c) Application of Provision.--This section shall apply to \n     any health care lawsuit that is settled or resolved by a fact \n     finder.\n\n     SEC. 10108. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) Punitive Damages Permitted.--\n       (1) In general.--Punitive damages may, if otherwise \n     available under applicable State or Federal law, be awarded \n     against any person in a health care lawsuit only if it is \n     proven by clear and convincing evidence that such person \n     acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant, or that \n     such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury \n     that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain \n     to suffer.\n       (2) Filing of lawsuit.--No demand for punitive damages \n     shall be included in a health care lawsuit as initially \n     filed. A court may allow a claimant to file an amended \n     pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the \n     claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of \n     supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after \n     weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a \n     substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the \n     claim for punitive damages.\n       (3) Separate proceeding.--At the request of any party in a \n     health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a \n     separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (4) Limitation where no compensatory damages are awarded.--\n     In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory \n     damages is rendered against a person, no punitive damages may \n     be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit against \n     such person.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     consider only the following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n     in a health care lawsuit may not exceed an amount equal to \n     two times the amount of economic damages awarded in the \n     lawsuit or $250,000, whichever is greater.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 10102.

A court may allow a claimant to file an amended \n     pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the \n     claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of \n     supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after \n     weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a \n     substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the \n     claim for punitive damages.\n       (3) Separate proceeding.--At the request of any party in a \n     health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a \n     separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (4) Limitation where no compensatory damages are awarded.--\n     In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory \n     damages is rendered against a person, no punitive damages may \n     be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit against \n     such person.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     consider only the following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n     in a health care lawsuit may not exceed an amount equal to \n     two times the amount of economic damages awarded in the \n     lawsuit or $250,000, whichever is greater. The jury shall not \n     be informed of the limitation under the preceding sentence.\n       (c) Liability of Health Care Providers.--\n       (1) In general.--A health care provider who prescribes, or \n     who dispenses pursuant to a prescription, a drug, biological \n     product, or medical device approved by the Food and Drug \n     Administration, for an approved indication of the drug, \n     biological product, or medical device, shall not be named as \n     a party to a product liability lawsuit invoking such drug, \n     biological product, or medical device and shall not be liable \n     to a claimant in a class action lawsuit against the \n     manufacturer, distributor, or product seller of such drug, \n     biological product, or medical device.\n       (2) Medical product.--The term ``medical product'' means a \n     drug or device intended for humans. The terms ``drug'' and \n     ``device'' have the meanings given such terms in sections \n     201(g)(1) and 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic \n     Act (21 U.S.C. 321), respectively, including any component or \n     raw material used therein, but excluding health care \n     services.\n\n     SEC. 10108.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Care Access \n     Protection Act of 2009'' or the ``MCAP Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A court may allow a claimant to file an amended \n     pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the \n     claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of \n     supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after \n     weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a \n     substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the \n     claim for punitive damages.\n       (3) Separate proceeding.--At the request of any party in a \n     health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a \n     separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (4) Limitation where no compensatory damages are awarded.--\n     In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory \n     damages is rendered against a person, no punitive damages may \n     be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit against \n     such person.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     consider only the following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n     in a health care lawsuit may not exceed an amount equal to \n     two times the amount of economic damages awarded in the \n     lawsuit or $250,000, whichever is greater.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. _103.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. _103.

liability action'' means a civil action brought in a State or \n     Federal Court or pursuant to an alternative dispute \n     resolution system, against a health care provider or a health \n

Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass by unanimous \nconsent the ``No Social Security Benefits for Prisoners Act of 2009,'' \nwhich was recently passed by the House of Representatives.\n  This bill would prevent retroactive Social Security and Supplemental \nSecurity Income benefit payments from being issued to individuals while \nthey are in prison, or in violation of conditions of parole or \nprobation, or are fleeing to avoid prosecution for a felony or a crime \npunishable by sentence of more than one year.\n  Under current law, the Social Security Act already prohibits payment \nof current monthly benefits to such individuals.
