Mr. President, following leader remarks, there will be a \nperiod of morning business for 1 hour. Senators during that time will \nbe allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes. The majority will control the \nfirst 30 minutes and the Republicans will control the second 30 \nminutes. Following morning business, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Energy and Water appropriations bill. The Senate \nwill recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. today to accommodate the \nweekly caucus luncheons.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken with the Republican leader at some \nlength over the last few days, and we all know what we have to do \nbefore we leave here. We are going to finish the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill, the Agriculture appropriations bill. We have the \nTravel Promotion Act we have to do. We have to complete the Sotomayor \nnomination.\n  We have a package of extenders, for lack of a better description, the \nHouse is going to send us. They are going to likely be out next week \nbut not for certain. In that package they are sending us, there will be \nan extension of the highway bill. I think all of this goes until about \nDecember. The Postal Service, we have to help them. We have to do \nsomething with FHA. We have to do something with unemployment \ncompensation. That is all in one thing they are going to send us for \nshort extensions. I have not seen what they are going to put together; \ntherefore, I could not share it with my esteemed colleague. But as soon \nas we have some information, we will make sure the committees of \njurisdiction on both sides have knowledge of what that is. But we have \nto complete that work before we leave here, and I hope we can do it \nsooner rather than later. I hope we do not have to work this weekend.\n  We have a finite number of things we need to do before we proceed on \nto the summer recess. This is something Members look forward to. I \npersonally have a very busy schedule, as I am sure most Members do. But \nonce a year, I get together with my family. I am looking forward to \nthat. It is for 7 or 8 days. But to justify that, we have a lot of work \nto do. If we look back in the years past, Congress adjourned by this \ntime in years past. They were through for the year. We are, \nunfortunately, not able to do that as much as we would like that. There \nis a lot of work we could do at home but we cannot because this is \nwhere business is when we are in session. So we are going to continue \nto work through these things and do it as quickly and as efficiently as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8149-7", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8149-S8150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, fixing our broken health care system after \ndecades of inaction is no small task. With such an effort comes no \nshortage of strong convictions, diverse ideas, rigorous analysis, and \nconstructive criticism. But as the plans, proposals, and policies \nevolve, our principles remain constant. Although we navigate a sea of \nchoices, we know where we will land. First, we will bring security and \nstability back to health care. Second, we will not add a penny to the \nconsiderable national deficit that has ballooned over the past 8 years. \nThis work we are doing on health care is budget neutral.\n\n[[Page S8150]]\n\nThat means it will not run up the debt. We are obligated to do that \nbecause that is in the budget resolution we passed earlier this year. \nThat is what it says. We cannot do health care if it costs an extra \npenny. So we will do that. Finally, we will remain focused on seeing \nthis fight all the way through because we are long overdue for a \nchange.\n  Those who are fortunate enough to have health care now and who hear \nus debate how to make it better might wonder: What are you talking \nabout? You may wonder what is in it for you--the people who are \nlistening in. Well, health care reform helps everyone and affects \neveryone. It will help those who have insurance today but do not know \nif it will be there tomorrow. It will help those who worry about being \njust one illness away or one accident or one pink slip away from losing \nthe insurance they have. It will help those who are covered but fear \ntheir children very likely will not be able to say that when they grow \nup--that they have coverage. And it will help nearly 50 million people \nwho have none to begin with.\n  The reform we are pursuing means making sure that if you lose your \njob, your health care will not go with it. It means that if you change \njobs, you will not have to worry about losing your coverage. Health \ncare reform means lowering the costs of care and keeping them low. It \nmeans improving the quality of the care you get and keeping the quality \nof care high. Reforming health care means that if your mother had \nbreast cancer or you had minor surgery last year or your child gets \nallergies every spring, your insurance company cannot say: I am sorry, \nyou are too much of a risk to cover. It means the premiums you pay \nevery month will not go up just because your insurance company feels \nlike it. It means keeping costs stable so the price of staying healthy \ndoes not fluctuate like a gallon of gasoline. It not only means making \nsure you can keep your family's doctor or keep your health care plan if \nyou like it but also that you can afford to do so. No one can predict \nwhen that next accident may occur or when one might lose their job. We \ndo not know when we will get sick next or when one of our loved ones \nwill become ill. But we can take the uncertainty and unfairness out of \nthe current system. We can make sure it is stable, more secure, more \nreliable, and more dependable.\n  Second, all of the many plans we have heard for fixing health care \nhave something else in common: They each have maintained President \nObama's commitment that this effort, I repeat, will not dig us any \ndeeper into debt than we already have. Any plan that passes this body \nwill be fully paid for, I repeat. When all the numbers are crunched, \nthe No. 1 bottom line is zero. It will not cost anything. In fact, as \nwe improve disease prevention, reduce health disparities, and better \ncoordinate medical services, we will be lowering future costs even \nfurther.\n  Families will also save in the long run because the status quo comes \nwith a hidden health care tax. If you have health care now, you are \npaying at least $1,000 more for that health care then you would need to \nif other families had some insurance. When we reform health care and \nyou are no longer responsible for covering the uninsured, you will see \nthose savings in every paycheck you get.\n  The only costs that worry me are the costs of doing nothing, of \ninaction. We have already seen what happens when we do nothing. Over \nthe past 8 years, health care costs rose to record levels and the \nnumber of Americans who cannot afford insurance did the same. The \nnumber of people who lost their insurance rose dramatically. Every day, \n14,000 people in America--7 days a week--lose their health insurance. \nRight now, in Nevada, half a million people already lack the coverage \nthey need or struggle with inadequate coverage. If we do not act, many, \nmany more Nevadans and millions more Americans will lose their \nhealth care as it gets more expensive day by day.\n\n  For a generation, we have been working to fix this broken health care \nsystem. Throughout this year, we have explored numerous proposals in \nnumerous bipartisan roundtables and committee hearings. This has been \nthe No. 1 issue on our agenda for a long time now. And today we are \ncloser than ever to getting something done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8150-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID.

We are \nbehind schedule even now. We do not want another big omnibus bill. We \nwant to do these appropriations bills, get them done.

Mr. President, as the debate over health care \ncontinues, it is important that we not lose sight of the fact that the \nAmerican people expect results. No one was ever elected to Congress to \npush a problem down the road or to point fingers. Americans certainly \nwant reform, and that is exactly what they expect us to deliver. At the \nsame time, Americans have a right to expect that the legislation we \npass actually addresses the problems they face and that we do not use \nthe need for reform as an excuse to pass legislation that does not \nreally help or that makes existing problems worse.\n  This is the nature of the debate we are in: Some in Washington seem \nto be rushing to push through so-called reforms just for the sake of \nreform, regardless of whether they actually help the situation, while \nothers are insisting we take the time to get it right.\n  Fortunately, with each passing day, more and more Americans and now \nmore and more Members of Congress are insisting that we take the \nresponsible path to health care reform--even if it means hitting the \nreset button and meeting in the middle on reforms that all of us can \nagree on and that Americans can embrace.\n  Here are some of the cautionary notes we have heard from Senators \njust in the last few days.\n  One top Senator said:\n\n       It's better to get a product that's based on quality and \n     thoughtfulness than on trying to just get something through.\n\n  Last week, nine freshmen Senators wrote an open letter to the Senate \nFinance Committee calling for a solution that doesn't bankrupt our \nhealth care system. Here is what those nine Senators wrote:\n\n       In the face of exploding debt and deficits, however, we are \n     concerned that too little focus has been given to the need \n     for cost containment.\n\n  We are hearing the same things over in the House. One Congressman \nsaid on Sunday morning that:\n\n       The American people want to take a closer look. They want \n     to feel comfortable with it. We have a long way to go.\n\n  Another Congressman said he thinks Americans are ``shell-shocked'' \nafter last year's financial bailout, the stimulus, the cap-and-trade \nbill, and other major bills approved this year.\n  Another Congressman, referring to health care reform, asked:\n\n       Why are we rushing? Why are we rushing? Let's get it right.\n\n  America's Governors are also calling on the administration and \nCongress to slow down and insisting that Congress take the time to \nproduce the right reform.\n\n[[Page S8151]]\n\n  One Governor recently was quoted as saying he:\n\n       Personally was very concerned about the cost issue, \n     particularly the $1 trillion figure being batted around.\n\n  Here is another one commenting on proposals to shift Medicaid costs \non to already cash-strapped States. She said:\n\n       As a governor, my concern is that if we try to cost-shift \n     to the States, we are not going to be in a position to pick \n     up the tab.\n\n  Another Governor had the same concerns about Medicaid. Here is what \nhe was quoted as saying in the New York Times last week:\n\n       Medicaid is a poor vehicle for expanding coverage . . . \n     It's a 45-year-old system originally designed for poor women \n     and their children. It is not health care reform to dump more \n     money into Medicaid.\n\n  All these people have something in common: They all want reform. They \nhave concerns about the proposals we have seen so far, and they have \nsomething else in common too. Every one of the lawmakers I have quoted \nis a Democrat--every one of them.\n  Some are trying to portray this debate as a debate between \nRepublicans and Democrats. This is a distortion of the facts and is a \ndisservice to the millions of Americans who want us to get this reform \nright. As I and others have said, the only thing that is bipartisan \nabout the reforms we have seen so far is the opposition. The reason is \nclear: It costs too much; they don't address the long-term challenges \nin our health care system; they don't reduce long-term costs; they \nwould add hundreds of billions to the national debt; and there is no \nway the American people will embrace them because all of them fall well \noutside the boundaries of the middle path Americans are asking us to \ntake.\n  This is why so many within the President's own party are now standing \nand telling the administration to slow down and to reassess. This is \nwhy even traditionally Democratic groups, such as the AFL-CIO, are \nhaving second thoughts. Just last week, the AFL-CIO criticized a plan \nto tax so-called gold-plated insurance plans because of the impact it \ncould have on workers. Why? Because they know that when politicians \ntalk about raising tax on business, it is average Americans who end up \nshouldering most of the burden.\n  Americans don't want to lose the quality of care our current system \nprovides, and they certainly don't want to pay trillions of dollars for \na government takeover of health care that could lead to the same \ndenial, delays, and rationing of treatment we have seen in other \ncountries. They have heard the same stories we have--of someone with \ncancer being denied a drug because it costs too much or the woman who \ncame here from Canada to deliver her babies because there wasn't any \nroom in the neonatal intensive care units back home or they visited \nplaces such as the M.D. Anderson Center in Houston, TX, as I have, and \nsaw how dozens of patients from other countries go there for \ntreatments.\n  We don't know the exact circumstances that brought these people here, \nbut we do know this: that they decided to come to the United States, in \nsome cases traveling thousands of miles to do so, to get the kind of \ncare that only America could provide.\n  Some people, for some reason, seem afraid to admit it, but the fact \nis, American health care is the envy--the envy--of many people around \nthe world, and Americans don't want to lose it. That is why Americans \nare telling us we can reform health care without bankrupting the \ncountry or destroying what is so unique and special about our current \nsystem. That is why a growing number of politicians in Washington are \nhearing the people's concerns and speaking out. That is why many of \nthem are now urging the administration to take a different path.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8151-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO METEOROLOGIST TOM WILLS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the people of \nLouisville, my hometown, and across Kentucky who were saddened by the \nnews that after 40 years on the air, WAVE-3 chief meteorologist Tom \nWills is retiring. Tom first joined the station and began to be \nwelcomed into people's homes over the airwaves back in 1969.\n  Many Louisvillians cannot imagine turning on the TV and not being \nable to find a forecast from Tom Wills. It is a rare and remarkable \nachievement to reach 40 years in broadcasting and even more so at the \nsame station, serving the same community.\n  Tom earned the level of respect he has in Louisville by being one of \nthe best meteorologists in the Nation. He is the only broadcast \nmeteorologist in Louisville to hold the Certified Broadcast \nMeteorologist Seal from the American Meteorological Society, and he is \namong the earliest holders of the AMS Seal of Approval in the Nation to \nstill be on the air.\n  We Louisvillians have appreciated waking up every morning the last 40 \nyears knowing Tom is there to tell us whether we need our coat or our \numbrella. Tom has also been a calming presence on the television screen \nat the time of severe weather, helping to save lives by providing \ncrucial information.\n  Tom was on the air on April 3, 1974, the day when the most severe \ntornadoes in living memory cut a path of destruction through the city \nof Louisville. When it was over, lives had been lost, hundreds were \ninjured, and over 900 homes were destroyed.\n  Throughout the night and into the early morning hours of the next \nday, Tom Wills was on the air telling people the information they \nneeded to know. As tragic as those events were, we know things could \nhave been worse if not for the lives saved and the tragedy averted \nthanks to Tom's work.\n  Tom Wills grew up in West Reading, PA, and knew by age 7 he wanted to \ndo the weather when he grew up. While earning meteorology degrees at \nPenn State and Colorado State, he specialized in the science of tornado \nformation.\n  In addition to his WAVE-3 duties, he has passed along his knowledge \nand experience by teaching meteorology at the University of Louisville.\n  Now that he will no longer have to wake up at 2:30 a.m. every day, I \nhope Tom will have time to pursue his other interests, including \ngardening and following our Louisville Cardinals sports teams. Of \ncourse, his wife Pam, his kids, and his grandkids will be happy to see \nmore of him. Tom is known throughout the community not just as a fine \nmeteorologist but also a gentleman and friend to the many people he has \nmet in his 40 years on the air. He is going to be greatly missed, and I \nwish to take this moment to thank him on behalf of Kentuckians \neverywhere for his service.\n  We are honored that for four decades he chose to share his talents \nwith the people of Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8151-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8151-S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING DAVID FULLER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, I am saddened by the recent loss of my good \nfriend David Fuller. This was a man who certainly had an impact both on \nhis community and on the Nation as a whole. It is no exaggeration at \nall to say that thanks to David, thousands of workers at nuclear plants \nin this country have safer jobs and healthier lives.\n  That includes David's coworkers at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion \nPlant in Paducah, KY, where for 10 years David served as president of \nthe Nuclear Workers Union. You see, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant \nhas produced enriched uranium since 1952 and is currently the only \noperating uranium enrichment facility in the United States.\n  For much of the Cold War, the Paducah plant produced fissionable \nmaterial for our country's nuclear arsenal. It also enriched uranium \nfor commercial nuclear reactors, helping to provide the benefits of \ncleanly generated electric power to millions of people.\n  Those Kentuckians who worked in the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant \nplayed a vital role in America's victory in the Cold War. \nUnfortunately, their own government did not look out for them as it \nshould have.\n  About 10 years ago, we learned there were risks associated with \nworking at the Paducah plant, particularly during the early years of \nits operation. Some workers were exposed to cancer-causing chemicals \nand radiological hazards. Some would later sicken and even die.\n  David was tireless in advocating for the workers at Paducah. He was \none of them. He put in 33 years as a cascade operator and electrician. \nHis testimony before Congress was key to advancing the effort to care \nfor those who had been harmed by the government's careless treatment. \nThanks, in part, to\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\nDavid, we created the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program to ensure that our Nation's nuclear workers \nfinally now get the attention they deserve from their government. \nMedical screening is available to all Paducah workers so they may be \ntested and treated for any illness they contract as a result of working \nat the plant. We are working to clean up some of the legacy waste \nmaterials left at the Paducah plant.\n\n  I also might say my wife Elaine Chao, who served as Secretary of \nLabor during the Bush years, was deeply involved in setting up this \ncompensation program there at Paducah and she too became a friend of \nDavid Fuller's.\n  David testified before Congress on behalf of his fellow workers, \nincluding before a committee I chaired. He served as his union's \npresident for 5 years, longer than anyone before, and never lost an \nelection.\n  David and I worked side by side for a long time on this issue. He \nvisited my office frequently here in Washington, and on several \noccasions I was his guest at the Paducah Nuclear Workers Union Hall to \nmeet with and speak to the local membership. In that time, I saw how \ndetermined David was to help develop a program that would ensure all \ncurrent and former plant employees were tested for exposure and that \nwould provide sick employees with the treatment they need and deserve.\n  Of course, nothing can take the place of a life or good health, but \nDavid wanted to see every effort made to provide compensation for the \nworkers and their families. Thanks to his extraordinary work, he lived \nto see that happen.\n  I know his tireless service will not be forgotten by his friends and \ncoworkers. Even the Paducah workers who did not get to know David \npersonally know they certainly have him to thank for the justice that \nwas provided to the workers who took on this vital duty.\n  Elaine and I have lost a good friend. We send our prayers to his wife \nKatherine Cooper Fuller; his daughters, Julie Fuller Leidecker, Laura \nAnn Nichole ``Nikki'' Fuller, and Meagen Joan Fuller; his son John \nDavid Fuller; his three grandchildren; and many other beloved family \nmembers and friends.\n  Not everyone, after he or she is gone, will be able to show as easily \nas David that theirs was a life spent helping others. David gave so \nmany the simple gift of time: more time spent with their family, \nfriends, and loved ones.\n  Sadly, David's family has run out of time with David himself, as he \npassed away on July 19 at the age of only 62. But I hope they can take \nsome solace in the tremendous work he did on behalf of others. Kentucky \nhas lost a great man. He will not be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8152-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a few moments ago, the Republican leader, \non the floor, talked about a concern about ``rushing'' to a health care \nreform debate and bill. I want to assure everyone that no one is \nrushing to anything. Everyone is working hard to come up with a good, \nstrong health care reform bill that addresses an urgent need in this \ncountry.\n  In fact, last week, President Obama spoke to the Nation about the \nurgent need to reform the health care system. He spoke about premiums \nthat have doubled over the last decade. He talked about the out-of-\npocket costs that have been shooting up by over a third. He talked \nabout deductibles that all of us have seen skyrocket. He talked about \nthe families and the small business owners who have to work harder and \nharder to stay afloat. President Obama spoke about the work that has \nbeen done to put a health care reform plan together.\n  I sit on the health care committee in the Senate. We spent months \nhaving hearings and working through some of the tough, difficult \nchallenges. We spent weeks and hours working through a debate on a \nhealth care reform package. We looked at hundreds of amendments, many \nof them Republican, a lot of them accepted into our health care bill \nbefore it passed out. We are working very hard now with the Finance \nCommittee for them to work through the challenging issues and come up \nwith a solution, as the House is as well.\n  We are working hard to come to a solution with the health care reform \nplan that protects patient choice, that reins in those costs I talked \nabout, and provides coverage for millions of Americans who don't have \nany today.\n  The President of the United States spoke frankly about some of our \nRepublican colleagues who are speaking out for the status quo. \nPresident Obama spoke plainly to Americans about the devastating costs \nof inaction--the devastating costs of inaction if we do nothing, and \nwhat will happen if we maintain the status quo. I am telling you what \nwould happen if we do nothing: Premiums are going to continue to rise, \nbenefits will continue to erode, out-of-pocket costs are going to \ncontinue to skyrocket, and more and more employers will do what I have \nseen too many in my State have to do: drop coverage for their workers. \nWe talk about 47 million Americans today who don't have coverage at \nall. That will seem like the good old days if we do nothing.\n  Despite what some of our colleagues wish us to believe, Americans do \nwant health care reform. They need health care reform desperately, and \nthey are not going to accept another year of talking and bickering and \nstalling.\n  Last month, I sent a letter to families across my State of Washington \nasking for their help as we work very hard to reform the health care \nsystem. I told them I wanted to pass a plan that protects existing \ncoverage when it is good, improves it when it is not, reins in costs \ntoday, and lowers them long term, and guarantees care for the millions \nof people who don't have health care today.\n  I asked my constituents to share with me their stories and ideas \nabout how to make this vision a reality. I told them that I know health \ncare is a very personal issue, but I also told them their personal \nstories have the power to change minds and transform debate. The \nresponse I got was overwhelming. I came to the floor last week several \ntimes and shared some of the over 5,000 stories that have now poured \ninto my office from my State. I underscored the need to fix this broken \nhealth care system and do it this year.\n  I come to the floor to share a few more stories, and I want to talk \nabout a specific aspect of health care reform I have been working very \nhard on, and that is, as we reform this health care system, we have a \nskilled health care workforce that is ready to step up and provide the \ncare we need.\n  Judy Allen, from Moses Lake, WA, sent me a story about her son. She \nsaid he had been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at the age of 5 and was \ngiven a 50-50 chance of making it to his ninth birthday. Judy said she \nand her husband had good health insurance, but they had to travel over \n3 hours to get to a clinic with the resources her son needed. They \ncould not move close to this facility, because moving would force them \nto switch health care insurance providers, and they knew if that \nhappened, they would get rejected because of their son's preexisting \ncondition. Sadly, Judy's son died 3 years ago, but the reforms we are \nworking on will help mothers such as Judy across the country.\n  We want to stop insurance companies from spending our premium dollars \non figuring out ways to exclude people from coverage. We are going to \nensure that nobody will be denied health care coverage even if they \nhave a preexisting condition.\n\n[[Page S8153]]\n\n  Unfortunately, Judy's story is not unique. Millions of Americans who \nhave insurance today--good insurance--struggle with a broken health \ncare system. They struggle with the skyrocketing costs, with the \ncomplicated system that works for the insurance companies but not for \nthe patients. So I agree with President Obama that we need to reform \nthe health care system this year.\n  As we work to provide quality affordable health care coverage to all \nAmericans, we have to make sure there are enough health care \nprofessionals to provide that care. We can write and pass a bill that \nimproves the coverage and reins in the costs, but without an educated, \naccessible system of doctors, nurses, x-ray technicians, physical \ntherapists, and other health care professionals, that coverage isn't \ngoing to mean much. If we provide health care coverage without the \nworkers, it is like building schools and not hiring any teachers. So it \nis common sense, but it makes economic sense as well.\n  Not only does this shortage make it hard to access care even if you \nhave insurance today, it makes it more expensive. That is why we have \nmade a number of investments that are going to create and sustain good-\npaying jobs and ensure access to care so that Americans stay healthy \nand productive.\n  We all know today that too few medical students are going into high-\ndemand general care fields. Many students enter specialty fields, in \npart to pay for the cost of medical school, and because they tend to be \nmore lucrative long term. So the health care bill we passed out of \ncommittee on health care includes incentives such as loan repayment \nprograms, scholarships, and grants to encourage students to go into \nhigh-need fields and to work in underserved areas. It invests in \neducation, training, and retention efforts, not just for new health \ncare workers but for all of those who are already providing quality \ncare in this country.\n  Investments in our health care workforce create jobs, ease the strain \non overworked health care professionals, and keep Americans healthy, so \nthey can be productive on their jobs. I am going to keep working to \nmake sure these investments remain a priority.\n  Quickly, before I yield the floor, I want to reiterate the critical \nneed I talked about a minute ago to fix the health care system. I want \nto share a story.\n  Sharon Alexander wrote to me from Steilacoom, WA, about her battle \nwith brain cancer--the same type Senator Kennedy suffers from. Sharon \nhad health insurance, but she wrote and told me that while she was \nrunning from doctor to doctor and undergoing radiation treatments, she \nand her husband had to spend a great deal of time navigating different \ncopayments and acceptance policies of all of her doctors. She told me \nshe was lucky she had insurance, but she still had to jump through hoop \nafter hoop to get the care she needed. Sharon discovered that in our \nbroken health care system, high-priced insurance doesn't guarantee \nhigh-quality health care.\n  That is why we need to act. We need to lower the cost of health care, \nwe need to ensure Americans have affordable health care and, in these \ndifficult times, with all of the challenges Americans have with \npremiums rising three times faster than wages and every day 14,000 more \nAmericans losing their health insurance, we are not rushing; we are \nworking hard to get this right, and it needs to be done this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the status of efforts to legislate comprehensive health care \nreform.\n  Recently there was a comment by a Senator opponent of President \nObama, who disclosed what has been known for some time as to the \ntactics of President Obama's opponents. The Senator who opposes \nPresident Obama said this:\n\n       If we are able to stop Obama on this, it will be his \n     Waterloo. It will break him.\n\n  This is essentially the same tactic that was used by President \nObama's opponents on the stimulus package. I am not betraying any \nconfidence about matters that were on the public record, but \nimmediately after the inauguration, within 2 weeks, when the Senate \ntook up the stimulus package, it was apparent that President Obama's \nopponents in the Senate were simply going to say no and obstruct the \nmatter. It is a matter of public record that only three then-Republican \nSenators would even talk to the Democrats about the stimulus package--\nSenator Collins, Senator Snowe, and myself. Now it is apparent, with \nwhat the Senator opponent of President Obama has said what the plan is.\n  Now that we know we will not vote on comprehensive health care reform \nuntil September, there is time for a little bipartisanship--perhaps \neven a little statesmanship--to come together on this issue. We have \nbeen sent by our constituents to Washington to solve problems, not to \nobstruct potential solutions. There are many items where we can all \nagree. There are many potential savings available, which I outlined a \nfew weeks ago in an extensive floor statement. For example, on advanced \ndirectives, estimates are that as much as 27 percent could be saved on \nMedicare. So much money is spent in the last few hours, few days, few \nweeks of a person's life. We know from the statistics that funding from \nthe National Institutes of Health can prevent illness and can cut down \ntremendously on the cost.\n  We also know that by changing the prosecution on Medicare and \nMedicaid fraud and imposing jail sentences, there would be a deterrent \nto that tremendous amount of fraud and abuse. A fine is simply a \nlicense.\n  We know also that substantial savings are possible by covering those \n47 million Americans so that we have medical care at an earlier stage \nto avoid chronic illnesses that are so very expensive, so that we could \ncome together on these items where I think there is general agreement.\n  The Senator opponent of President Obama is referred to in this \nmorning's Washington Post as saying that he is in favor of fixing the \nsystem, it has been one of the main causes of his career, and a \nspecific:\n\n       We need some real health care reform.\n\n  Well, it would be worthwhile to have that Senator opponent of \nPresident Obama say whether he believes we ought to cover the 47 \nmillion Americans now not covered. I believe there is a consensus that \nthat ought to be done. But if there are differences of opinion, let \nthem be stated, because if we agree that the 47 million Americans have \nto be covered, then the next question a responsible elected public \nofficial would have to ask is: How do we pay for it?\n  But if someone is going to say ``I am not in favor of covering the 47 \nmillion Americans,'' let him or her answer to his constituents. The \nSenator opponent of President Obama ought to note, as reported in the \nPost this morning, that there are 700,000 of his State's residents who \nare uninsured. If he believes we ought not to cover those 47 million \nAmericans, including the 700,000 in his State, let him respond and say \nso.\n  It may be that there is a political price to pay if you face up to \nthat. But if you move beyond the question of whether we need to have \nhealth care for all Americans, then we need to move forward.\n  When you talk about the Waterloo of President Obama, it sounds as if \nwe are fighting some foreign power as opposed to the collegiality which \nis supposed to be present in the Senate, reputedly the world's greatest \ndeliberative body.\n  I was pleased to see the Senator who is opposing President Obama with \nhis Waterloo statement--I am glad to see a number of his colleagues on \nthat side of the aisle distance themselves. But as yet we have not had \na proposal which comes from the Republican side of the aisle, just as \nwe did not have a proposal coming from the Republican side of the aisle \non the stimulus package.\n  It was my view, as I spoke on the floor on February 6, that the \nproblems about sliding into a 1929 Depression were present. We faced \nthat risk. Complaints have been made about the stimulus package that it \nhas not worked, but there have only been 5 months which have elapsed.\n  Yesterday I was in Pennsylvania at a major interchange, I-81 and \nRoute 39, announcing $12 million for road repairs; earlier, at the \nPhiladelphia International Airport announcing a substantial grant; in \nwestern Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh announcing millions of dollars for \nlocks and dams.\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\n  It may be that a better proposal could have been crafted on the \nstimulus package. But there were negotiations.\n  President Obama was sworn in on January 20. In the week of February \n2, within 2 weeks from the inauguration, taking the oath of office, we \nwere already having obstructionism.\n  It is my hope that while we adjourn for the August recess, there is \ntime to have a bipartisan plan, a plan which will reject partisanship, \na plan which might even bring a little statesmanship to this body.\n  When the three of us on the stimulus issue joined with the Democrats \nin providing the necessary votes, the indispensable 60 votes to invoke \ncloture and allow the stimulus package to move forward, the comment was \nmade from the other side of the aisle: Three Senators don't make a \nbipartisan bill.\n  So far, only three Republicans are negotiating on comprehensive \nhealth care reform. So let's see if we can't have in the intervening \nweeks between now and September a concerted effort made to move forward \nto answer some of these basic questions. If someone is opposed to \ncovering the 47 million Americans, let's hear it. If someone is opposed \nto having a public option, as proposed by Senator Schumer, which \nmaintains a level playing field, let's hear the specifics so that our \nconstituents can judge us, so that the 700,000 people who are not \ncovered by insurance in the home State of the Republican Senator who \nhas spoken out to break the President, to promote the President's \nWaterloo--we will have a chance to evaluate that kind of an attitude.\n  I thank the Chair, note the expiration of my time, 10 minutes, and \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we stand at a critical juncture today as \nwe grapple with how to fix our broken health care system. Rapidly \nescalating health care costs are compounding the current economic \ncrisis in America. Families and businesses across the country are \nstruggling to afford increased premiums, copayments, and deductibles. \nPremium increases are taking an increasing portion of workers' wages, \nand more firms are under pressure to reduce or possibly eliminate \nhealth care coverage for their workers.\n  Helping middle-class families and small businesses afford health care \ncoverage is a critical component of improving the Nation's economy. \nFamilies and business owners in Oregon have told me at length how \nconcerned they are about the rising costs of health care. Those \nfamilies who have health care are concerned about losing it, and they \nare concerned about the rising cost of premiums and the copays. And \nthose citizens without health care--nearly 47 million Americans are \nunable to afford the cost of health care--those citizens are worried \nabout getting sick or they are sick and they are worried about how to \npay for the drugs and treatments to get well. Under this system, our \nsmall businesses that are working hard to provide health care coverage \nfor their employees are worried they will not be able to continue, that \nthey will have to raise the share of the costs the workers carry or \nmaybe they will have to eliminate the health care plan altogether.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues the experience of one of my \nconstituents, Jeanette Hall of Milwaukee, OR. She was employed, but she \ncould not afford health insurance. Jeanette had a mole on her arm. It \nwas a mole she thought should be looked at. Her friends and family \nurged her to have it looked at. Finally, she went to the emergency room \nto have it examined. The diagnosis was melanoma, but Jeanette could not \nafford to have the surgery to address it.\n  Sometimes one gets a fortunate turn in life, and Jeanette just got \nsuch an example. She was interviewed by a local news station that was \ndoing a story about the plight of the uninsured. Jeanette says she is \nonly alive today because of that moment when a news station covered her \nstory because after that story aired, she received a call from a local \nhospital that offered to help. They basically said that in exchange for \nbeing the subject of an observational surgery for medical students, the \nhospital would cover the cost of the surgery. Jeanette is now cancer \nfree, and she feels very blessed about that. What is more, she now has \na job where she has health insurance, and that certainly puts a \nbrighter horizon in place for her. But while she is pleased about her \npersonal health and her personal health insurance, she is worried about \nhealth insurance for families and friends and health insurance for all \nAmericans in this broken health care system.\n  Her brother is very ill. Her brother does not have health insurance. \nHer brother needs an operation to save his life, but he is not getting \nthat operation. She anticipates that his life expectancy is very short \nnow as a result. She sees it very personally, very directly.\n  Just as she hopes for health care for her and her family and for \nAmerican citizens, so do citizens across this Nation. Citizens such as \nJeanette are not looking for a government handout. They don't expect \nsomething for free. But what they do want is access, choice, quality \nhealth coverage, affordable health coverage for their families and \ntheir workers.\n  We need to offer citizens such as Jeanette a lifeline in these hard \neconomic times. As a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, I am very proud of the bill we passed 2 weeks ago \nwhich puts us a significant stride closer to providing affordable, \nquality health care for every American. It is a plan that will lower \ncosts, provide consumers with more choices, and increase competition.\n  That act, the Affordable Health Choices Act, is a landmark bill. It \ngives every American a full range of health insurance options, \nincluding a community health plan. It ensures that those who like their \ncurrent health care coverage can keep it. And it guarantees that no \nAmerican will be denied coverage because of preexisting conditions. \nThat act makes sound investments in disease prevention, in health \npromotion, and it strengthens the health care workforce.\n  The Affordable Health Choices Act gives small businesses better \nchoices for high-value health insurance by creating a new health \ninsurance marketplace, or gateway as it is called, which will help \nlower costs and increase competition. In fact, let me explain this a \nlittle bit more.\n  Right now in America, if you are an individual trying to get health \ncare, you have to pay an extraordinary premium because you don't bring \nany market share clout to the negotiating table. And right now in \nAmerica, if you are a small business, you don't get a good deal because \nyou don't bring any market clout to the negotiation. This health care \nbill at its heart addresses this problem. It creates an exchange where \nyou would purchase health care, not as an individual but as a group of \nhundreds of thousands of fellow citizens. That health care plan would \nbring the combined negotiating clout of those hundreds of thousands or \neven millions of individuals, so you get a much better deal as an \nindividual and you get a much better deal as a small business. I know \nthat every individual and small business in America that has gone \nthrough this process of trying to get a fair, decent health care plan \nknows exactly what I am talking about. And that is the heart of this \nreform.\n\n  But even as we make historic progress on guaranteeing affordable \nquality health care for all, there are powerful forces underway to halt \nthis effort. There are those who favor the status quo, and they are \nworking on their talking points, they are rallying their special \ninterests, they are doing polls to see what phrase will most scare \nAmericans from changing. They want to defeat this historic march toward \nquality, affordable health care for every single citizen.\n  One thing is clear: We cannot afford to fail. Maintaining the status \nquo is not an option. The last time we attempted to tackle the problem \nin 1992, health care spending was $849 billion. Today, health care \nspending in America is $2.2 trillion and growing by over 10 percent a \nyear. March it forward next year, and it will be over $2.4 trillion; \nthe year after that, $2.7 trillion; the year after that, $3 trillion, \nand so forth. We will be spending nearly $40 trillion under the status \nquo over the next 10 years.\n\n[[Page S8155]]\n\n  Premiums in the early 1990s were 7 percent of a family's income. \nToday, premiums eat up 17 percent of a family's budget. In 1996, \nemployers paid about $3,700 toward a family plan. Now that is well over \n$10,000 and growing, and workers are picking up an increasing share of \nthe costs.\n  Today, under the status quo, 60 percent of bankruptcies are due to \nhealth care costs--more than half. More than half of personal \nbankruptcies are due to health care. What is more, more than half those \npersonal bankruptcies due to health care are with folks who have health \ncare insurance, but their health care insurance simply was not adequate \nto cover the extraordinary costs of a medical emergency. Indeed, 75 \npercent of those individuals who are going through bankruptcy due to \nhealth care costs had health insurance.\n  If we look to the future, the consequences of inaction are even more \ndire. But, despite all that, every day we hear from special interests, \nwe hear from their allies who are standing up, using their poll-tested \nphrase such as ``government takeover'' in order to scare the American \npeople into rejecting health reform.\n  Here are citizens who know firsthand the challenge and the stress of \nhealth care. But they are being manipulated. There is an effort to \nmanipulate them by powerful special interests that want to scare them, \nto turn them against reform and change. The opponents of reform have a \nhealth strategy. Their strategy is the status quo. Why do they like the \nstatus quo so much? Because the special interests are making so much \nmoney with the current health care system--huge profits for insurance \ncompanies, huge profit for other health care players. But here is the \nproblem. Soaring profits for health care companies equate to out-of-\ncontrol, unaffordable premiums for America's working families.\n  Let's examine the status quo plan put forward by the opponents of \nreform. Under the opponents' status quo strategy, the premiums that are \npaid by a family would go from about $13,000 a year now to, just 8 \nyears into the future, $24,000--nearly double in a short period of \ntime. If you want out-of-control premiums, then support the opponents' \nstatus quo efforts.\n  Second, under the opponents' status quo plan, the cost of health care \nfor a small business would more than double. The cumulative costs are \nextraordinary. We see the costs here, in billions of dollars, start in \n2009 at $156 billion--the cost imposed on small businesses--and soaring \nto $2.4 trillion by 2018--cumulative costs. So over a 10-year period, \nsmall businesses carrying a multitrillion-dollar burden under the \nstatus quo.\n  Third, under the opponents' status quo plan, the number of uninsured \nAmericans increases. Why is that? It is very simple: Families cannot \nafford these premiums, small businesses can't afford these premiums, \neven large businesses may not be able to afford this more than 10-\npercent-a-year increase in premiums. Indeed, under one study, the \nnumber of uninsured Americans, under the status quo, the opponents' \nplan, would reach 66 million Americans over the next 10 years, up from \nabout 47 million right now. That is a huge increase.\n  Fourth, under the opponents' status quo plan, our community hospitals \nwould see uncompensated care go through the roof. Why is that? Because \nwe have more uninsured. They have to go to the emergency room to get \ntheir care. So the hospitals end up carrying that burden. What does \nthat do? That results in a cost shift from those who do not have \ninsurance and go to the emergency room--those costs get shifted to \nthose with insurance. It continues the death spiral in soaring \ninsurance premiums that we have right now in America.\n  What is more, under the opponents' status-quo approach, we get the \nsame failure to invest in prevention and disease management. Insurance \ncompanies do not have an incentive to invest in disease management that \nmight make you healthier 10 years from now or 20 years from now because \nthey assume you probably will not be their customer 10 or 20 years from \nnow. We get the same investment in a fee system, in a cost-plus system, \nthat is driving up the cost of health care.\n  Let me make this very clear. If you have any form of expense in which \nthe compensation is cost-plus, the person providing those services is \ngoing to provide as many services as possible. If you are building a \nfighter and you say: We will pay your costs plus 10 percent, you are \ngoing to make sure that fighter plane is as expensive as possible. The \nsame is true in health care. Yet that model of compensation is the \ndominant model in health care today.\n  We need to invest in an integrated approach, such as the Mayo Clinic \ndoes, where the doctors are not motivated by profits but by providing \nhealth care to their patients. They have no incentive to run you \nthrough that MRI machine four or five times. Their only incentive is to \nhelp you get well. That is a very different approach, an approach we \nneed to expand on in America, an approach that says we need an \nintegrated health care system, not a cost-plus fee system.\n  When the opponents of reform try to scare you and say we don't need \nto change anything, remember how scary their plan is. I know you \nunderstand what I am talking about because you see it every day. The \nopponents are saying it is OK if insurance companies routinely deny \nnecessary medical care and cancel policies in order to increase their \nprofits. The opponents are saying they prefer an America where parents \nwill lie awake at night, worried if they can afford health care their \nchildren need because they do not have health insurance for their \nchildren. The opponents want an America where workers are just one pink \nslip away from losing their job and their health care. That is a double \ncalamity that strikes millions of families in America every year.\n  The opponents are arguing for an America where a would-be \nentrepreneur who works hard and wants to start a business may not do so \nbecause he or she cannot afford health coverage in a volatile, \nexpensive small business market. The opponents want an America where \nsmall businesses that do offer insurance are faced with double-digit, \nbudget-straining premiums that threaten the economic viability of that \nsmall business.\n  I wish to see our small businesses thrive. Our small businesses are \nincredibly creative, with far more patents per capita than large \nbusinesses. Our small businesses expand and grow and absorb more \nworkers. We want them to expand and thrive, and a major challenge they \nhave today to their thriving is our broken health care system.\n  I do not accept that vision for America, the vision put forward by \nopponents of health care reform. We need to create a simple health care \nexchange, where individuals and small businesses can go and be part of \na large pool so they can negotiate a fair deal. Today we do not have \nthat fair deal. Tomorrow we will.\n  We need a health care system that invests in prevention and disease \nmanagement. We need a health care system that works to expand the \nhealth care workforce, because we have a big challenge. Many of our \nhealth care workers in America, our doctors and our nurses, are \nretiring. They are baby boomers. They are reaching retirement age. We \nwill have increasing demand for more of their services as baby boomers \nretire. The bill we put forward works to address that discrepancy; \notherwise, greater demand and lower supply will drive up the cost of \nhealth care.\n  We need to create a system that eliminates insurance that doesn't \ncover preconditions. What kind of health care do you have if you have a \nbad back but your bad back is not covered? What kind of health care \nsystem do we have if you have melanoma, such as Jeanette did before her \noperation, and you cannot get it covered because it is a preexisting \ncondition?\n  This bill changes that. I believe we need to create a health care \nsystem that expands citizens' choices instead of constraining them as \nin our current system. We have many markets in America that only have a \nsingle dominant provider. We need to create a Community Health Care \nPlan to hold the feet of insurance companies to the fire. Competition \nin the marketplace--a 100-percent apple pie, American concept--is \nneeded in health care to help control costs.\n  Americans across the country are counting on us to work together to \nfind a solution, to help ease the burden of health care costs on family \nand business budgets and create more affordable health care options. I \nurge my colleagues to set their partisanship aside,\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\nset aside the goal of trying to torpedo America's future because you \nwant to torpedo the Presidency of Barack Obama. Think about the quality \nof health care for our working families and what we in this Chamber \ncould do to make that quality of life far better. The costs of \ninaction, the costs of our broken status quo system, are too great to \nallow their solution to fall to petty, bitter partisan bickering.\n  Let's come together. Let's fight for a brighter future for America's \nfamilies.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand).

Madam President, some friendly person is exercising \nhis or her constitutional first amendment rights in Memphis these days \nrunning television ads urging me to vote for the health care proposal \nthat is currently pending before Congress. That person may be wasting \ntheir money, because we are getting a fair number of calls in my \nMemphis office congratulating me for suggesting that we ought to slow \nit down and come up with a better plan.\n  We should start over in terms of what we are doing to try to find the \nright way to provide health care for the American people at a cost they \ncan afford and, at the same time, provide a government they can afford. \nWe are going in the wrong direction.\n  I know a lot of good effort has been put into the plan that came out \nof the Senate HELP Committee, and to the plans that have come out of \ntwo of the House committees and currently are being discussed in the \nthird. But the most charitable thing I can say about it is, very well-\nintentioned people are working hard to try to find the best way to go \nin the wrong direction.\n  When you are going in the wrong direction, is it not the best course \nto start over, especially when we are dealing with something as big and \ncomplex and as personal and as important as the health care of every \none of 300 million of us? We all know we will only have one opportunity \nto get it right. And that opportunity is before us. So if we are headed \nin the wrong direction, let us start over and let us get it right.\n  Who says we are headed in the wrong direction besides one Senator \nfrom Tennessee or maybe several members of the Republican Caucus?\n  The Mayo Clinic said that in an opinion it released about 10 days \nago. The Mayo Clinic is often cited as an example of what we ought to \nbe doing more of--good results, lower costs. But it said, we are headed \nin the wrong direction. It did release an addenda after someone \nobviously called, probably from the White House, and said, what is \ngoing on here? So the Mayo Clinic said one thing the White House said \ndid seem to be helpful, but fundamentally it said we are going in the \nwrong direction with the idea of a public option.\n  A public option, as the President has said, is to help keep the \ninsurance companies honest. That is like the President saying he is \ngoing to buy the rest of General Motors to keep Ford Motor Company \nhonest, or to buy a drugstore to keep Walgreen's honest, or to have a \ngovernment restaurant to keep O'Charley's honest. That is not the way \nour country works.\n  Who else says we are headed in the wrong direction? Democratic \nGovernors as well as Republican Governors as I mentioned here on the \nfloor last week--the Governors of Colorado, Montana. My State Governor \nsaid, this is the mother of all unfunded mandates. These Governors are \nlooking at the idea of dumping--I use that word carefully--another 20 \nmillion low-income Americans into a failing government-run program \ncalled Medicaid, when 40 percent of the doctors will not see Medicaid \npatients.\n  The proponents of these proposals call it health reform, and then \nthey are going to shift the cost to the States after about 5 years. The \nGovernors are appalled by this plan. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays we are going in the wrong direction. Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, has said that the only bipartisanship thing about \nthe health care debate is the opposition to it.\n  So let me take each of those points one by one. There are seven big \nproblems with the two health care plans, one in the Senate, one in the \nHouse, that are before us. One is it flunks the first test which is \nreducing cost.\n  Two, it cuts grandma's Medicare and spends it on another program.\n  Three, it would pass big, new Medicaid costs on to the States, \ncausing big increases in State taxes.\n  Four, despite what the President has said--or because the President \nsaid it, there is another reason to step back and take a different \ndirection--millions would lose their employer-provided insurance.\n  No. 5, millions more Americans would find themselves in government-\nrun health programs.\n  No. 6, during a recession, we would impose new taxes and new fines on \nemployers in order to encourage more health care.\n  And, No. 7, with those government programs, you are more likely to \nwait in line and you are more likely to have your health care rationed.\n  Let's take them one by one. Flunking the first test, reducing costs. \nWe should start with the 250 million Americans who already have health \ncare and make it more affordable. We know there are 47 million \nAmericans who do not, but 5 million are college students, 10 million \nare noncitizens, 11 million are people making $75,000 a year or more \nwho can probably afford it, 11 million are eligible for an existing \nprogram.\n  Those are important things to do, but the idea here is to try to \nreduce the growing costs of Medicaid so you can afford your health \ncare, and so that you can afford your government.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said on the 17th of this month that \nthe legislation before us significantly expands Federal responsibility \nfor health care costs. Over the weekend, in looking at the next 10 \nyears, the Congressional Budget Office--that is our Congressional \nBudget Office--said: The proposal would probably generate substantial \nincreases in Federal budget deficits during the decade beyond the \ncurrent 10-year budget window.\n  No. 2, it cuts grandma's Medicare. The New York Times yesterday, in \ndescribing the proposal in an editorial, said: Reformers are planning \nto finance universal coverage in large part saving money in the \ntraditional Medicare Program, raising the question of whether all \nbeneficiaries will face a reduction in benefits.\n  If we are going to cut grandma's Medicare, we ought to spend it on \ngrandma and grandpa.\n  We ought not to take that money from that program, which the Medicare \nTrustees have told us may be broke by 2017, and spend it on a new \nprogram.\n  Then there is the third issue, expanding Medicaid and increasing \nState taxes. As a former Governor, I am concerned that Congress hasn't \ngot a real sense of how this will affect States--this plan to expand \none government program, a failing, embarrassing program called \nMedicaid, into which we dump low-income Americans, and where we are \ngoing to dump another 20 million more. This is the reason the \nDemocratic and Republican Governors, at their meeting in Biloxi a \ncouple weeks ago, were up in arms about this. And after 5 years, we \nwill shift the cost of that to the States. To expand it that much, to \n133 percent of the Federal poverty level, would cost our State about \n$423 million a year for the State share. If we really want to give \npeople a bus ticket to a bus line that actually has buses, we will have \nto pay doctors more because today doctors, 40 percent of the time, \ndon't see Medicaid patients. As a result, that adds another $600 \nmillion. That equals a 10-percent new State income tax. It is inhumane \nto dump low-income Americans into a failing government program.\n  Then there are the employer taxes and fines. I have talked to a \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\nbusinesspeople. If given the choice between paying $750 per person, \nwhich the Senate plan does, or providing every single full-time and \npart-time employee health care, they will take the $750 a person. And \nwhere are the employees going to be? They will be out of employer \nhealth care. That is not what the President said he wanted. Where are \nthey likely to be? A lot of them will be in these government programs, \none of which is being extended and one of which is being created.\n  Then there is the problem of waiting in line and rationing. If we \ncreate government programs with government people in between ourselves \nand doctors, there is more of a chance that we will be waiting in line \nand that we will have our health care rationed.\n  Republicans have offered a number of plans that make more sense. A \nnumber of us have joined with Senator Wyden in a bipartisan plan that \nmakes common sense. That plan, to be specific, would take the subsidies \nwhich we now spend on health care and spend them in a fairer way, \ngiving low-income Americans a chance to buy health care like the rest \nof us have. It wouldn't create any new government programs. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, it wouldn't add to the debt. If we \nare starting over, that framework would be a good place to start.\n  People at home in Tennessee, the Mayo Clinic, 1,000 local chambers of \ncommerce that have made their announcement today, the Congressional \nBudget Office, and the Democratic Governors all say: Whoa, let's get it \nright. This has too many problems. Let's start over with something that \nAmericans can afford in terms of their own health care plan and a \ngovernment they can afford.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article by \nMartin Feldstein, President Reagan's former Chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, from the Washington Post of today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Obama's Plan Isn't the Answer\n\n                         (By Martin Feldstein)\n\n       For the 85 percent of Americans who already have health \n     insurance, the Obama health plan is bad news. It means higher \n     taxes, less health care and no protection if they lose their \n     current insurance because of unemployment or early \n     retirement.\n       President Obama's primary goal is to extend formal health \n     insurance to those low-income individuals who are currently \n     uninsured despite the nearly $300-billion-a-year Medicaid \n     program. Doing so the Obama way would cost more than $1 \n     trillion over the next 10 years. There surely must be better \n     and less costly ways to improve the health and health care of \n     that low-income group.\n       Although the president claims he can finance the enormous \n     increase in costs by raising taxes only on high-income \n     individuals, tax experts know that this won't work. \n     Experience shows that raising the top income-tax rate from 35 \n     percent today to more than 45 percent--the effect of adding \n     the proposed health surcharge to the increase resulting from \n     letting the Bush tax cuts expire for high-income taxpayers--\n     would change the behavior of high-income individuals in ways \n     that would shrink their taxable incomes and therefore produce \n     less revenue. The result would be larger deficits and higher \n     taxes on the middle class. Because of the unprecedented \n     deficits forecast for the next decade, this is definitely not \n     a time to start a major new spending program.\n       A second key goal of the Obama health plan is to slow the \n     growth of health-care spending. The president's budget calls \n     explicitly for cutting Medicare to help pay for the expanded \n     benefits for low-income individuals. But the administration's \n     goal is bigger than that. It is to cut dramatically the \n     amount of health care that we all consume.\n       A recent report by the White House Council of Economic \n     Advisers claims that the government can cut the projected \n     level of health spending by 15 percent over the next decade \n     and by 30 percent over the next 20 years. Although the \n     reduced spending would result from fewer services rather than \n     lower payments to providers, we are told that this can be \n     done without lowering the quality of care or diminishing our \n     health. I don't believe it.\n       To support their claim that costs can be radically reduced \n     without adverse effects, the health planners point to the \n     fact that about half of all hospital costs are for patients \n     in the last year of life. I don't find that persuasive. Do \n     doctors really know which of their very ill patients will \n     benefit from expensive care and which will die regardless of \n     the care they receive? In a world of uncertainty, many of us \n     will want to hope that care will help.\n       We are also often told that patients in Minnesota receive \n     many fewer dollars of care per capita than patients in New \n     York and California without adverse health effects. When I \n     hear that, I wonder whether we should cut back on care, as \n     these experts advocate, move to Minnesota, or wish we had the \n     genetic stock of Minnesotans.\n       The administration's health planners believe that the new \n     ``cost effectiveness research'' will allow officials to \n     eliminate wasteful spending by defining the ``appropriate'' \n     care that will be paid for by the government and by private \n     insurance. Such a constrained, one-size-fits-all form of \n     medicine may be necessary in some European health programs in \n     which the government pays all the bills. But Americans have \n     shown that we prefer to retain a diversity of options and the \n     ability to choose among doctors, hospitals and standards of \n     care.\n       At a time when medical science offers the hope of major \n     improvements in the treatment of a wide range of dread \n     diseases, should Washington be limiting the available care \n     and, in the process, discouraging medical researchers from \n     developing new procedures and products? Although health care \n     is much more expensive than it was 30 years ago, who today \n     would settle for the health care of the 1970s?\n       Obama has said that he would favor a British-style ``single \n     payer'' system in which the government owns the hospitals and \n     the doctors are salaried but that he recognizes that such a \n     shift would be too disruptive to the health-care industry. \n     The Obama plan to have a government insurance provider that \n     can undercut the premiums charged by private insurers would \n     undoubtedly speed the arrival of such a single-payer plan. It \n     is hard to think of any other reason for the administration \n     to want a government insurer when there is already a very \n     competitive private insurance market that could be made more \n     so by removing government restrictions on interstate \n     competition.\n       There is much that can be done to improve our health-care \n     system, but the Obama plan is not the way to do it. One \n     helpful change that could be made right away is fixing the \n     COBRA system so that middle-income households that lose their \n     insurance because of early retirement or a permanent layoff \n     are not deterred by the cost of continuing their previous \n     coverage.\n       Now that congressional leaders have made it clear that \n     Obama will not see health legislation until at least the end \n     of the year, the president should look beyond health policy \n     and turn his attention to the problems that are impeding our \n     economic recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8157-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3183, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3183) making appropriations for energy and \n     water development and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2010, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Dorgan amendment No. 1813, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this legislation comes from the \nAppropriations Energy and Water Subcommittee. It has passed through the \nfull Appropriations Committee and reported to the floor of the Senate. \nThis is another one of our appropriations bills that we very much hope \nwe can get done, have a conference with the House, and send to the \nPresident for signature. Regular order for this bill has not happened \nfor a couple of years, which is a failure of the Congress and the White \nHouse because of the way things developed in the last few years. We \nneed to change that.\n  I thank Senators Inouye and Cochran, the chairman and vice chairman \nof the full committee. They have made a decision that they want to \ndrive these individual appropriations bills through the process, get \nthem conferenced, then send them to the White House to sign them into \nlaw. That is the way they should be done.\n  We have put together legislation that we think is a good bill. It \nfunds all of the energy functions across the country, including \nprograms attached to the Energy Department. It funds all of the water \npolicy issues across the country, all the projects that are ongoing. It \nis a very important bill. If we think of the subject of energy and \nwater, there is not much more controversial or important at this point \nthan those two subjects.\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\n  This bill is 1.8 percent under the President's budget request and 1.4 \npercent over the amount spent in the previous fiscal year. This is a \nfairly conservative, austere bill we have put together. We have tried \nto make the best case we can for the best investments for the future.\n  The other thing that is important to understand is that, at a time \nwhen our country is in a deep recession, funding water projects and \nenergy projects provides a way of putting people to work and creating \njobs. At the end, rather than only spending and having the money \ndisappear, we have invested and we have returns on those investments in \nthe form of water and energy projects that will benefit the country for \nmany years.\n  Yesterday, I talked for a moment about the Department of Energy's \nnational laboratories. We fund a lot of issues in this appropriations \nsubcommittee, including all of our science, energy, and weapons \nlaboratories. I am so proud of those laboratories. They remind us of \nthe old Bell Laboratories, where so much good research and scientific \ninquiry occurred. The Bell Labs are now largely gone. The laboratories \nthat we have--the science, energy and weapons labs--are the repository \nof the most important research that goes on in this country.\n  I believe it was in the last fiscal year that Los Alamos in New \nMexico announced it had completed work on what is called the \nRoadrunner, which is the most powerful computer in the world. That most \npowerful computer does not exist somewhere else, it exists here at Los \nAlamos Laboratory.\n  It is a computer that has met the speed of what is called a petaflop. \nThat sounds like a foreign language.\n  Let me start first by talking about a teraflop. A teraflop is \nsomething where a computer can do 1 trillion discrete functions per \nsecond. In 1997, we reached that standard of a teraflop, 1 trillion \nfunctions per second. Ten years later, the amount of space for the \nhardware to do what was called a teraflop was a very large home \nessentially. That is the amount of space it took for the hardware. The \namount of energy it took to run all that computer power was the amount \nof energy it took to supply hundreds and hundreds of homes. Then, 10 \nyears later, a teraflop, the same 1 trillion functions per second, \ncould be provided with the energy equivalent of a 60-watt lightbulb on \nequipment the size of a very small token.\n  Now we are not talking about 1 trillion functions per second or a \nteraflop. We are talking about a computing standard called a petaflop. \nThe Roadrunner achieved it. A petaflop is 1,000 trillion functions per \nsecond. It is so powerful and unbelievable, it is almost hard to \ndescribe. I asked a scientist: What does it mean that you can do 1,000 \ntrillion functions per second? He said: As an example, they are using \nthem on stockpile stewardship and weapons issues. There are something \nlike 1 or 2 billion synapses in the brain that communicate with each \nother. This is the first computer that has the capability and the power \nto analyze what these billion synapses of the brain are doing in \ncommunicating in order to produce something from one's eye called \nvision. We understand we can see. We just don't understand how it is \nall possible. Yet the development of very powerful computers like the \nRoadrunner, the world's most powerful computer in this country, allows \nus to do almost unbelievable things in science and research and \ninquiry. Is that an investment in the country, in the future? Yes, it \nis a big investment, an investment that will pay dividends for decades \nto come.\n  I point that out to say that we have brought a bill to the floor that \ndeals with so many important energy and water issues. It attempts to \naccelerate research into renewable energy for programs like wind and \nsolar and biomass. It attempts to evaluate how, through science and \nresearch, we can understand our ability to continue to use our most \nabundant resource: coal. We understand we will have to have a lower \ncarbon future and capture carbon and sequester it or use it for \nbeneficial use. The way we will do that is by investing in the kind of \nresearch and inquiry that will unlock the mystery of doing that. I am \nconvinced we will. This is the legislation in which we make those \ninvestments.\n  Senator Bennett has no doubt had the experience I have had because we \nlead the committee that funds all of this. I have had people from all \naround the country come to my office breathless about the silver bullet \nthey have now patented that will solve all of our problems in energy, \neither the newest form of energy or the newest approach to capture \ncarbon. They come in breathless. By the time they are finished talking, \nwe are out of breath because they are so excited about what they are \ndoing.\n  We have a guy who was a witness at a hearing on the beneficial use of \ncarbon so that we can continue to use coal and not severely impact our \nenvironment. He has developed and patented an approach by which he \ntakes the effluent coming out of the stack of a coal-fired generating \nplant and doesn't separate the CO2. Through chemicals, he \nmineralizes it and creates a product that is equivalent and harder than \nand better than concrete. Is that the silver bullet? I don't know. But \nhe made a strong and interesting case before the committee that this \nwill dramatically advance our ability to use coal in the future while \nat the same time protecting our environment.\n  Senator Bennett and I, in this legislation, provide the investment \nfunds necessary to begin to scale up and demonstrate new approaches and \nnew patents and new technologies in so many of these areas. Why is all \nthis important? We are unbelievably dependent on foreign oil. Almost 70 \npercent of the oil we use comes from outside of our country. That makes \nus vulnerable from a national security and an energy security \nstandpoint. The country knows we have to move off that dramatic \ndependency and find ways to produce more here. That means more of all \nkinds of energy. That is what we support in this legislation. We \nproduce, we conserve. We provide greater efficiency for virtually \neverything we use every day, as we use energy in our daily lives.\n  Then, in addition to that large area of energy, which we will \ndescribe in greater detail as we have amendments to the bill, all of \nthe water projects in this country, through the Army Corps of Engineers \nand the Bureau of Reclamation, are projects that are making life better \nfor people, providing access to clean water and the storage of water.\n  We understand how controversial water is, but we also understand that \nwater is essential to economic growth and human health. To monitor and \nconserve water resources and make the best use of all of those \nresources is exactly what we are trying to do with this legislation.\n  I won't describe more except to say this legislation includes the \nPresident's recommendations, his wide range of earmarks, and what the \nWhite House would like to be funded in water projects. We respect that \nand have accepted most of what the President has recommended for \nspecific project requests. We have added some, while eliminating some \nof the President's, that we believe have higher value for various \nStates based on information we have gleaned.\n  We will have amendments. I think there are already a couple dozen \namendments filed. Some say the Congress should not have any imprint on \nwhat should be funded here, let's just let the White House tell us what \nthey want funded.\n  Well, that does not make a whole lot of sense because the folks in \nthis Chamber are elected by their constituents and perhaps have the \nbest sense of what kinds of water projects will best meet the needs of \ntheir region or their State. But, as I said, we respect the President's \nviews, and we have funded most of the specific projects he has asked us \nto fund and made some modifications where we think appropriate and \nwhere we think it will improve the legislation.\n  I say on behalf of myself and Senator Bennett, we were here \nyesterday, and we did not have amendments offered. We had some filed \nbut not offered. It is a quarter to 12 today, and we will be here all \nday. We very much hope, if people have amendments, they will come to \nthe floor of the Senate, offer them, and debate them so we can proceed. \nSo we are here. We very much would like to finish this bill by tomorrow \nevening--perhaps this evening, if people would be as optimistic as we\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\nare. But we would like people to come and offer amendments as soon as \npossible.\n  Madam President, I do not know whether Senator Bennett wishes to \nspeak. Well, I believe we have someone who wishes to offer an \namendment. We appreciate Senator Voinovich coming to the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1841 to Amendment No. 1813\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask that the Voinovich-Carper \namendment No. 1841 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich], for himself and Mr. \n     Carper, proposes an amendment numbered 1841 to amendment No. \n     1813.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nregarding the acquisition and lease of certain additional office space)\n\n       On page 63, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. AUTHORITY OF NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION.\n\n       The Nuclear Regulatory Commission may use funds made \n     available for the necessary expenses of the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission for the acquisition and lease of \n     additional office space provided by the General Services \n     Administration in accordance with the fourth and fifth \n     provisos in the matter under the heading ``salaries and \n     expenses'' under the heading ``Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission'' under the heading ``INDEPENDENT AGENCIES'' of \n     title IV of division C of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, \n     2009 (Public Law 111-8; 123 Stat. 629).\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I thank Chairman Dorgan and Ranking \nMember Bennett for allowing me to bring this amendment to the floor.\n  This bipartisan amendment renews authorization granted to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission and the General Services Administration in the \nfiscal year 2009 Omnibus appropriations bill that allows GSA to acquire \nadditional permanent office space near the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission headquarters location in Rockville, MD. We need to renew \nthis authorization in the fiscal year 2010 appropriations because the \ncurrent lease negotiations will likely extend beyond September 30, the \nend of fiscal year 2009.\n  This is a fairly straightforward and simple amendment, but I want to \ntake this opportunity to underscore the importance of the original \nintent of the authorizing language.\n  Having served as either the chair or ranking on the Clean Air and \nNuclear Safety Subcommittee for the past 8 years side by side with my \ngood friend, the senior Senator from Delaware, I take great pride in \nthe fact that the NRC has become one of the best regulatory agencies in \nthe world.\n  Senator Carper and I, together with other members on the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, have worked hard to provide the NRC with \nthe necessary resources to do its job; that is, ensuring safe operation \nof the 104 operating nuclear powerplants while conducting licensing \nreviews of the 17 applications for construction and operation of 26 new \nreactors. That may sound like some new information, and it is. We have \n17 applications filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for \nconstruction and operation of 26 new reactors.\n  With three pieces of legislation included in the Energy Policy Act of \n2005, we were able to help NRC hire more than 1,000 new workers and \nrehire retirees in the last 4 years to meet the increasing demand. The \nrehiring was to train new people who are being brought on board.\n  Now we need to follow through and provide NRC with adequate, \ncolocated headquarters office space to ensure maximum efficiency and \neffectiveness. I must say that the subcommittee has looked at this over \nand over again, and we have concluded that it is very necessary to have \nthem have space in the same vicinity so they can more adequately and \nmore efficiently run the operation.\n  Lately, we have been hearing a lot about how we need to increase the \nuse of nuclear energy if we are to achieve our energy independence, \nreduce greenhouse gases, and create jobs. I would point out that the \nNRC is at the center of all of this in the midst of reviewing those 17 \napplications for 26 new reactors.\n  Providing NRC with the tools necessary to achieve regulatory \nstability, efficiency, and effectiveness not only makes sense, it is \nthe job of Congress. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I am in favor of the Voinovich \namendment. To use the language of the cloakroom, it has not yet been \nhotlined. I do not know of any objection to it, and at least on this \nside, we will do what we can to get it hotlined, get it cleared, so it \ncan be adopted, I would hope by voice vote, as quickly as possible. But \nbecause it has not been hotlined on our side, I would suspect the vote \nwill probably take place this afternoon, if that is acceptable to the \nchairman.\n  There has been, as Senator Voinovich has pointed out, a significant \nincrease in the NRC workload, and GSA has been in negotiations with NRC \nto construct additional building space next to the existing NRC \nheadquarters. The negotiations may extend beyond the end of this fiscal \nyear, with the lease award occurring in 2010. So in order to anticipate \nthat, the NRC and GSA agreed that the language should be continued in \nthe fiscal year 2010 appropriations for the NRC. That will facilitate \nthe procurement process and protect the government from any protests \nafter a contract is awarded. This would mean the NRC could continue the \ncurrent procurement without interruption. For those reasons, I think we \nshould facilitate this.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the Senator would withhold?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I will withhold the suggestion of an \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I, too, rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Voinovich. It is a good amendment. In fact, it would \nextend authority we have previously carried in this legislation in \nfiscal years 2008 and 2009. So I believe we would be able to clear this \namendment by voice vote, but it has to be hotlined, I think. So my \nexpectation is we will be able to clear this amendment at some point \nafter lunch today.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, as to the bill that is \nbefore the Congress, I heard Chairman Dorgan mention Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory and the Roadrunner computer. I thank him for his \nattention to the two national laboratories in my State, Los Alamos and \nSandia. This computer, the Roadrunner computer, is a very important \ncomputer in dealing with issues such as climate change, national \nsecurity, and other scientific research. I applaud his efforts in \nmoving us forward, and also Ranking Member Bennett. I applaud them both \nfor their leadership.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Madam President, if you follow the debate in Washington about health \nreform, it is easy to get the wrong idea. The press likes to cover what \nwe are doing out here as if it is a game of chess--one side wins by \npassing health care reform; the other side wins by blocking it.\n  I understand that somebody will disagree with whatever plan we \nproduce to reform health care. That is democracy. Some Members of this \nbody might decide they have to vote no on health reform. But let's be \nclear on one thing: If we fail to pass a health reform\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\nplan, nobody wins. If we keep the status quo, all of our constituents \nwill be worse off.\n  The health care debate can get complicated. Both sides have a list of \nnumbers a mile long that are supposed to explain the problem and the \npossible solutions. But these numbers do not tell the whole story. For \nexample, we know that 22,000 Americans die each year because they do \nnot have health insurance. But that is only part of the story because \nevery one of those 22,000 is a unique and irreplaceable individual--\nsomebody's mother, somebody's son. Numbers cannot convey the injustice \nof it all, the needless pain for families and friends. Every year, this \ncountry produces 22,000 unnecessary stories of loss and suffering--\n22,000 stories that could go unwritten if we act now. These stories are \neverywhere we look, if we look.\n  Last week, I got a short note from a man in Pena Blanca, NM. The man \nwrote:\n\n       My wife and I have been self employed craftsmen for 25 \n     years. We never made enough money for health insurance. My \n     wife now has terminal colon cancer. If she could have had a \n     colonoscopy at 50 [years old] she would not be dying at 54. \n     My heart is broken.\n\n  All this woman needed was the simple preventive care that should be \navailable to every American--care that costs little and saves lives. \nBut our system did not provide that, and now she is dying. If we do not \nget health care legislation passed, thousands of women like my \nconstituent in Pena Blanca will not get their colonoscopies and \nthousands more hearts will be broken like her husband's. I do not care \nwhere you stand in this body, that is not a victory for anybody.\n  Another thing we talk about in Washington is ``preexisting \nconditions'' reform. It sounds as if it should be something \ncomplicated, something most Americans do not quite understand. But my \nconstituents know exactly what a preexisting condition is. It is the \nheart attack from 10 years ago that prevents dad from getting insurance \nthrough his job. It is mom's age. It is the fact that Sarah from down \nthe street might get pregnant--a fact that forces her to pay more for \ninsurance than her male coworkers.\n  I have held a number of townhalls on health care reform in New \nMexico, and everywhere I go I hear stories.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I heard a story about a constituent who had \ncome to my office for some casework a few years ago. This is one of \nthose people whom you would expect to do great things. He works an \nincredibly technical job at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Until \nrecently, he thought his knowledge and hard work would get him through \nany crisis. Then John began suffering from a host of unexplained \nneurological problems. The problems got so bad that he was actually \nrelieved when a doctor told him about a tumor in his brain. He chuckles \nwhen he remembers that day. He was so relieved to know what was wrong \nwith him, and his doctor said something could be done.\n  But John's insurance company had other ideas. Months went by, and \nJohn was not approved for the operation his doctor recommended. Only \njust recently was he approved for the procedure he needs. But now he \nhas other problems. His medical leave is about to run out, and he does \nnot know what to do. If he loses his job, he loses his insurance. And \nif he loses that, he could lose everything. He will become just another \nAmerican whose preexisting condition prevents him from getting health \ncare.\n  John was supposed to be one of the lucky ones. Before he began having \nproblems, he assumed he was one of the 55 percent of New Mexicans who \nhave adequate health insurance. But John was just one illness away from \nthe edge. And he is not alone. If we do not act, millions of Americans \nwill fall off the edge in the coming years. I do not care how you feel \nabout the President's health care plan, that is not a victory.\n  Because John cannot work, he could lose his health insurance. But you \ndo not have to lose your insurance to lose everything.\n  When I was back in New Mexico over the Fourth of July recess, I \nstopped at a local TV station for an interview. I went to the front \ndesk to check in and introduced myself to the woman sitting there. It \nwas like I had touched a nerve.\n  ``Senator Udall,'' she said, ``I need your help.''\n  This woman works full time and she has health insurance through her \nwork. Not too long ago, her doctor told her she needs cataract surgery \nor she will lose her sight. On Monday, before I met her, she was \nscheduled to get that surgery. Then, days before her appointment, she \nwas informed that the deductible would be more than $2,200, not \nincluding the cost of any followup care. Like many Americans, she has \nbeen struggling to make ends meet in this economy. She cannot spare \n$2,200 from her paycheck, so she canceled her operation. Now she is \nafraid she will lose her sight and she doesn't know what to do. So when \na Senator walked through the door, she asked me for help.\n\n  We can help this woman. She shouldn't have to choose between paying \nher rent and keeping her sight. Nobody should. And we can make it so. \nWe can create a system where people can find and afford to pay for \nquality health insurance that provides the care they need. We can \ncreate a system where people do not have to worry that they are one \nlayoff away from losing their insurance or one medical emergency away \nfrom losing everything. We can guarantee quality affordable health \ninsurance to every American. If we don't--if we miss this opportunity--\nthis is not a victory of one political party over another; it is a \nmassive loss for all of us and for everybody we represent. It would be \na national disgrace.\n  We are better than this. We can pass something that helps every \nAmerican. We can declare victory not over the other political party but \nover the status quo. I hope we do so.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to talk about our effort to \nachieve comprehensive health care reform. Most people agree that \nreforming our health care system is a necessity and that we cannot \nafford to wait another 10 or 20 years until health care costs consume \nthe American economy as well as the budgets of most American families. \nHowever, as urgent as this issue is, we must approach every aspect of \nhealth care reform thoughtfully and not rush to complete what might be \none of the most important legislative initiatives any of us will ever \nwork on during our time here.\n  As the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee release their \nproposals for health reform, we know we cannot consider a bill that \ndoes not control costs. Controlling costs is an enormous priority. I \nbelieve it is as important as ensuring universal coverage, because if \nwe provide universal coverage without controlling costs, the result \nwould be financial catastrophe for our Nation.\n  I want to be clear that lowering costs does not mean limiting access \nto care, although opponents of health care reform will try to convince \nthe American people that it does. These political talking points are a \ndistraction at a time when we are trying to expand access to health \ncare. No one will be forced to change their health plan, their doctor, \nor their hospital if they like what they have now. Health care reform \nwill provide coverage to those who do not have it today, and it must \nlower costs for both families and businesses.\n  One key component to cutting costs is to eliminate unnecessary \ntesting and overtreatment. If we can do that, then our health care \nsystem and America's patients will be in better shape. We can move in \nthis direction if the Federal Government starts paying for value of \ncare, not volume. As it stands, the Medicare reimbursement system \nprovides perverse incentives. Currently, geographic areas that provide \nthe most inefficient care oftentimes get the highest reimbursements. We \nneed to ensure that all health care systems provide better care in a \nmore efficient\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\nway and reward those systems that already do so; otherwise, we will \nnever get costs under control.\n  As chairman of the Aging Committee, I am familiar with many of the \nhealth care issues that affect seniors as well as all Americans. In \nthis capacity, I have been pushing for health reform to include \nimprovements to our long-term care system. Our Nation's population is \naging at a record rate, and with every passing year more elderly \nAmericans find themselves in need of long-term care. Most of us will at \nsome point struggle with the high and rising costs of caring for a \nloved one. These too are costs we must get under control as part of \nhealth care reform, and I applaud Chairman Kennedy for including the \nCLASS Act in the HELP Committee bill. This bill will provide new \nfunding for long-term care through a voluntary social insurance \nprogram.\n  We can also get long-term care costs under control by promoting a \nmove toward home and community-based long-term care services in \nMedicaid. These programs break away from a ``one size fits all'' \napproach, offering flexibility and choices tailored to an individual's \nneeds. Even better, they save a lot of money that would otherwise be \nspent on nursing home care. Senators Kerry, Grassley, and Cantwell all \nhave good ideas in this area that I hope will be considered.\n  We must also protect those consumers who are making an effort to plan \nfor the costs of their own long-term care in advance. In recent years, \nlong-term care insurance has gained popularity. Over 40 States have \ninitiated programs to encourage residents to buy long-term care \ninsurance in an attempt to ease the burden of Medicaid costs on State \nbudgets. I believe we have a duty to make sure these policies, which \nmay span several decades, are financially viable.\n  Many long-term care insurance companies have been raising their \npolicyholders' monthly premiums, which can be devastating for older \npersons who are living on a fixed income. Until we can guarantee that \nconsumers have strong protections, that carriers will not deny \nlegitimate claims, and that premiums will not skyrocket down the road, \nlong-term care insurance is not ready to be a major part of the health \ncare reform solution.\n  The funding of care is not our only concern. It has been 22 years \nsince we raised the standard of care in nursing homes, and quality \nimprovements are long overdue. Every year, as part of our Medicare and \nMedicaid reimbursement system, our government collects information \nabout all 16,000 nursing homes across the country. We should make this \ninformation available to consumers so they can judge a home's track \nrecord of care for themselves before deciding where to place a loved \none. We should make nursing homes safer by instituting a comprehensive \nbackground check system for long-term care workers. Pilot programs have \nshown that this would keep thousands of predators out of our nursing \nhomes where they can cause, and do cause, terrible physical, financial, \nand emotional harm to residents and their families.\n  The truth is that while there are some hot button issues that divide \nus and while there is seemingly endless ground to cover, there is a lot \nabout improving health care we do agree on. We all recognize the need \nto bolster the ranks of those who provide care. As America ages, we \nwill face a severe shortage of workers who are equipped to manage \nseniors' unique health needs. It is important to expand the training \nand education for licensed health professionals, direct care workers, \nand family caregivers, and I applaud the HELP Committee for recognizing \nthis need in their bill.\n  We agree that America's health systems should expand the use of \nhealth information technology, which has been shown to save lives by \nreducing medical errors and save money by promoting efficiency in \ntesting and communication. We agree that those who have suffered from a \nhealth problem in their past should not be denied insurance that will \nprotect them for the future by ensuring that these individuals with \npreexisting conditions can purchase coverage.\n  We also agree that we should do everything we can to remove fraud, \nwaste, and abuse from the system. We must employ a vigorous health care \nfraud enforcement program that will protect policyholders, businesses, \nand taxpayers.\n  We agree that we should work to provide appropriate care at the end \nof life. We need to break down the barriers to advance planning and \nencourage Americans to talk with their doctors about end-of-life care \nlong before such choices must be made.\n  Finally, we agree that we have a lot to gain if we get this done in a \nthoughtful, deliberate way. We can do this right and we must do this \nsoon because so many Americans are depending upon us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I think the American people are beginning \nto react in a negative way to what they perceive to be happening in \nWashington, DC, today with regard to the debate about health care, the \ndebate about new energy taxes in the form of a cap-and-trade program. \nOf course, we know there are a lot of questions about whether there was \nany value in the trillion dollar stimulus bill that passed earlier this \nyear, which was supposed to keep unemployment below 8 percent, and now \nin many States it is well into the double digits and continues to go \nnorth from there.\n  They have seen a lot of government spending with the stimulus, a \ntakeover of many industries, whether it is auto manufacturing, \nfinancial services, or insurance companies in this country. They have \nseen the cap-and-trade bill, which passed the House of Representatives, \nwhich they know--there are debates about how much, but they know it \nwill increase what they pay for energy in this country. And now we are \nhaving this discussion about the government taking over one-sixth of \nthe American economy in the form of health care.\n  I think what we are starting to see is that the American people, as \nthey engage in these issues, are becoming increasingly concerned about \nthe level of government expansion and intervention in the marketplace, \nand the amount of new taxation and new borrowing and spending that is \ngoing on in Washington, DC, at a time when the American people are \nbeing, by virtue of the fact that they have to live within a balanced \nbudget, required to make hard choices in their daily lives. They see a \ndisconnect between what they are experiencing in their family lives and \nwhat is happening in Washington, DC, where there continues to be this \npattern of new taxes, spending and borrowing.\n  Logic would dictate, I think, when you are in a recession, you should \nnot raise taxes. The worst thing to do in a recession is raise taxes \nand actually crush any economic recovery that might occur because, as \nwe all know, what helps create jobs is small business. If small \nbusinesses are faced with higher taxes, they have less to invest in new \nequipment and in hiring new employees.\n  The other thing I think logic dictates is that when you are running \ntrillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see, you should not be \npiling more debt upon future generations. It seems as if everything we \nare talking about these days is an expansion of government in \nWashington, at greater additional costs to the American people, either \nin the form of higher taxes or increased borrowing from future \ngenerations, neither of which is something I think most Americans would \nacknowledge we ought to be doing when you have an economy in a \nrecession and trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  The current health care debate is a good example of something about \nwhich people have reservations and concerns, because they see the \nattempt by the Federal Government to take over one-sixth of the \nAmerican economy, to essentially nationalize it--whatever you want to \ncall it. In any\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\nevent, it will mean greater government intervention and greater \ngovernment involvement and an expansion of government in Washington, \nDC. I think they are starting to react in a negative way against that, \nand more and more members in Congress, in the House and Senate, are \nhearing that.\n  I think that is why it is becoming increasingly difficult now to move \nin the quick way in which the Democratic leadership in the House and \nSenate wanted to in order to enact some form of health care reform \nbefore the August break.\n  The way I view this issue is that we ought to look at starting over. \nClearly, what has been proposed and rolled out so far is not working. \nIt is not working in terms of winning the minds of the American people, \nin terms, in Washington, DC, of putting together what ought to be a \nbipartisan solution to probably one of the biggest challenges and \ncrises facing the American people and our economy.\n  So far, we have seen a bill being debated at the committee level in \nthe House of Representatives, and perhaps scheduled for the floor--if \nnot this week, when we get back--and we have seen action by the HELP \nCommittee in the Senate on a bill that, by CBO's estimate, is about a \ntrillion dollars in new costs. Somehow, it will have to be paid for.\n  It seems as if we ought to push the reset button and figure out, OK, \nhow can we do this in a way that achieves savings to the American \npeople and the health care costs in this country, as opposed to \nactually adding new costs by increasing government spending in \nWashington, DC, expanding the size of government, and putting the \ngovernment in the way of--I guess intervening in that fundamental \nrelationship between physicians and patients.\n  There are a number of things that are, in my view, wrong with the \ncurrent plan, the plan that passed the HELP Committee in the Senate, as \nwell as the one currently being considered in the House of \nRepresentatives. The first fundamental test it flunks is that it \ndoesn't do anything to reduce costs. To me, reform ought to be finding \nefficiencies, streamlining, looking at ways of doing things in a less \ncostly way to achieve savings. We know that is not the case with the \nbill that passed the HELP Committee in the Senate, and we know the \nHouse of Representatives, in their bill, according to the most recent \nCongressional Budget Office estimates, also does nothing to find \nsavings or achieve any sort of savings as a result of all these changes \nbeing proposed. So it flunks the first fundamental test of reform; that \nis, it does nothing to reduce costs.\n  Secondly, it does cut payments, reimbursements, under Medicare to \nproviders, whether it is hospitals, whether it is the cost of \npharmaceuticals. All of these things in this country that add to the \noverall cost of health care are obviously going to take a nick in this. \nWe don't want to see the health care currently provided under Medicare \nto American senior citizens somehow be hurt by the fact that they are \ntrying to find money to pay for this whole new expansion of government \nhealth care in this country. So you have the issue of cuts to \nreimbursements currently under Medicare, which very likely would impact \nthe delivery of care, the quality of care for America's seniors.\n\n  The third thing, and another big problem, is that it adds new \nMedicaid costs to our States. States currently are participants. \nMedicaid is a shared program between the Federal and State governments, \nand there is talk about a significant expansion, the size of the \nMedicaid Program, which obviously costs the Federal taxpayers a lot \nmore money. But it also passes on an incredible new and costly mandate \nto State governments. Many States are figuring that out and are \nstarting to react to it.\n  My State of South Dakota is a good case in point. Our State \nlegislature, Governor, and people who looked at this have concluded it \nwould cost South Dakota an additional $45 million a year in Medicaid \ncosts, which may not sound like a lot of money in Washington, DC, but \nin a State such as South Dakota, where there is a requirement to \nbalance the budget every year, that represents a lot of money. \nObviously, it will have to be paid for somehow. When you get to the \nlarger States, the numbers increase in multiples.\n  You are talking about new taxes on States, in addition to the new \ntaxes being talked about in Washington, DC, to pay for all this. You \nhave new Federal and State taxes, again, at a time when already many \nState governments and budgets are strapped and they are trying to \nfigure out how to balance their budgets currently.\n  Another reason why the current plan is such a big problem, and why we \nneed to start over and hit the reset button, is because you are going \nto have a lot of people who are going to lose employer-provided \ninsurance. Most of the studies conclude--and the House bill is a good \nexample--that about 83 million people would lose their private health \ninsurance under the bill that is under consideration in the House of \nRepresentatives. There are other studies that have been done. This was \na Congressional Budget Office estimate. Other studies suggest that the \nnumber of people who could lose insurance on some of these plans under \nconsideration in Congress could be in the 120 million range.\n  If you consider that we have 177 million people today who get their \ninsurance through their employer, that is a significant number of \npeople who are going to lose their privately provided health insurance \nand be pushed into a government plan.\n  That brings me to the next point of why the current health care plan \nbeing debated is the wrong direction in which to head and creates \nproblems; that is, you are going to have more people going into the \ngovernment-run plan--literally millions of people, the ones who are \ngoing to lose their insurance in the private marketplace. They are \ngoing to be pushed into a government-run plan. Obviously, there are a \nlot of people who would like to see that. I don't happen to be one of \nthem. We ought to preserve what is best about the market and \ncompetition we have and allow people to have more choices. We don't \nwant to, by default, shove more and more people into a government-run \nplan, when there are opportunities out there available to them today \nwhere they can get their health care coverage and insurance in the \nprivate marketplace. That is a much better model and has worked very \nwell for a long time.\n  That isn't to say there are not things we can do better. I don't know \nof any Senator on either side of the aisle who doesn't acknowledge that \nthere are things we need to do to reform health care in this country, \nto get costs under control, provide access to more people. But \ncertainly taking away private coverage and pushing people into a \ngovernment-run plan is not a reform of the health care system that \nmakes sense to me or, I argue, most Americans, especially when it will \ncost trillions of dollars to do it.\n  As I said, I think most people look at reform as something that would \nactually reduce or somehow eliminate costs or create greater \nefficiencies and savings in the health care system in this country. You \nhave a lot of people who will lose private insurance, and millions of \nAmericans would be pushed into a government-run program.\n  As I said before, another big problem with this idea is that for \nemployers, during a recession, it imposes new taxes and fines, both of \nwhich would be very costly, and both of which would deprive them of the \nopportunity, as the economy hopefully starts to recover, to hire new \npeople, create new jobs, which is what small businesses do best. They \nare the economic engine of this country. We are talking about imposing \nnew taxes and fines on them, at great cost, and so that takes away a \nlot of the resources, as they generate revenue that they can be able to \ndevote or allocate toward capital investment or hiring more people. \nThey are going to be paying fines and taxes to the Federal Government \nto underwrite this new expansion of government in Washington, DC.\n  Logic would dictate, and history would suggest, that the worst thing \nyou can do in the middle of an economic recession is to raise taxes on \nthe job creators in the economy. Raising taxes on small businesses is a \nbad idea. In fact, the House bill that is under consideration, with the \nsurcharges and increased taxes, would actually increase marginal income \ntax rates from the top rate today of about 35 percent to about 37 \npercent. Think about that. The size of the increase in marginal income \ntax rates that would occur in\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\nState and Federal marginal tax rates, under the plan under \nconsideration in the House of Representatives, and how that would \nimpact the economy, would be the largest tax increase we have seen \nsince the end of World War II.\n  Frankly, if you think about most Americans and most small businesses, \nwhen you start paying half, or 50 cents out of every dollar, in taxes, \nyou are getting to a point where it is going to be very difficult for \nthese businesses which might say: Why should I continue to try to \ncreate jobs and provide health care coverage for my employees, when the \ngovernment takes more and more of the profits I make in this business? \nI think that is the risk we run with the job creators, the small \nbusinesses, which are the economic engine and create as many as two-\nthirds to three-quarters of all of the jobs in our economy, in a \nrecession. When you put new taxes and fines on them, you are layering \nthem and burdening them with more costs that will make it very \ndifficult for them to lead us out of the recession and start to expand \nthe economy and create jobs. Intuitively it makes no sense for us to \nhead in this direction.\n\n  Finally, I think the last problem--and, as I said, there are many \nwith the current health care proposals--is we will have to start \ndealing with the lines and the rationing that so often occurs when we \nsee a system such as they have in Europe or the Canadian system. Some \nhere actually believe that is the best way to do this. They believe in \na single-payer system. They believe we ought to nationalize our health \ncare system in this country. Inevitably, what we will end up with is \npeople ending up in lines. We will have government making decisions \nabout what procedures will be covered, what the reimbursement will be \nfor this procedure, that procedure. It is a disaster and a train wreck \nin the making, and it is a direction I don't think we ought to go.\n  These are all issues that I think point to the need for us to hit \nthat reset button and to sit down and actually figure out what can we \nagree upon that will be a bipartisan solution to the challenge of \nincreasing costs and a lack of access for millions of Americans.\n  That being said, we have a large number of proposals out there which, \nI submit, we ought to be able to debate. As the HELP Committee and the \nFinance Committee go through their deliberations, there are many things \nthat have bipartisan support in the Congress for which we could get big \nmajorities and which would address the fundamental issues of access to \nhealth care and cost of health care but none of which are being \nconsidered because right now the only plan out there is the one that \nhas been written by the Democratic leadership, which consists of this \ngovernment plan or this government takeover of the health care system.\n  We believe the principles in this debate ought to continue to \nmaintain: People ought to be able to keep their health care; it ought \nto be health care they can afford; it ought to provide choices; and it \nought to be patient centered.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8163-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I will in the \nnext few weeks fairly often, to share letters with my colleagues in the \nSenate and the people of this country, letters I have gotten from \npeople in Ohio. I have letters today from a woman in Clermont County, \nCincinnati; a lady in Lake County, Cleveland; a gentleman from Lake \nCounty also; and a gentleman from Columbus. I want to read these \nletters because this is really what the health insurance debate is all \nabout. It is partly about preexisting conditions and exclusivity and \ngateway and exchange and public option--all those terms we all throw \naround. But what this debate is really about is people who are hurting \nbecause of the health insurance situation in this country. We know it \nis broken. We know we need to fix it. These are real people I want to \ndiscuss, people my office has talked to and I have talked to in some \ncases, people, for instance, like Lee Parks, whom I sat next to at \nMedworks in Cleveland this weekend. She was helping people with intake, \npeople without insurance. They had some 1,500 people who came by \nwithout insurance. They needed dental care, eye care, medical care. \nThere were several hundred volunteers, as I said, like Maria Parks and \nher husband Lee, who came and worked with us on health issues. Let me \nshare some of these letters.\n  This is Wes from Columbus:\n\n       I am a 42 year old single male, small business owner. I had \n     been able to make sure that I have health insurance up until \n     March of 2007. It was then that Anthem raised my premium by \n     40 percent to $725 a month.\n       I had to decide whether to pay for the insurance or to \n     continue to put money into my business. I chose the business, \n     since without it I wouldn't have had access to insurance \n     anyway. Since then I have tried to get coverage, but because \n     of my 3 spinal surgeries, 2 sinus surgeries, and a \n     prescription, NO ONE will cover me.\n\n  He capitalizes ``no one.''\n\n       Ohio has something called ``open enrollment'' which is a \n     joke. Each month a different insurance company has legally to \n     accept anyone who has pre-existing conditions. BUT, the way \n     they keep people away is by making the rates so high.\n\n  We know that is what the insurance companies do. That is why we \nwanted the public option.\n\n       In 2008 Aetna quoted me a rate of $26,000 a year for \n     coverage.\n\n  This is a small business owner. He says:\n\n       That is over half of my pre-tax income.\n\n  He said:\n\n       It's clear to me I will never get coverage under the \n     present system.\n\n  Margaret, from Amelia, OH, writes:\n\n       I am a 61-year-old woman who has oral cancer. I worked in a \n     law firm in Cincinnati for over 27 years, as the records \n     manager. I've had four recurrences of cancer, and so far have \n     been very lucky, but the doctor has said it will be back . . \n     . and will get progressively worse. I'm worried about the \n     pain, disfigurement and death, but right now--\n\n  She has oral cancer, she says--\n\n       I am most worried that I will be unable to work following \n     surgery or treatments and lose my job and health insurance.\n\n  So she loses her job, she loses her insurance. We know that happens \nto so many people.\n\n       In 4 years I will be on Medicare but the cancer is coming \n     back within months, now, not years. My husband is several \n     years older and will probably be retired before I could get \n     Medicare.\n\n  She writes:\n\n       Do you really want a truck driver on the road in his late \n     sixties?\n\n  Her husband.\n\n       I am worried that we will lose the house and everything \n     we've worked for.\n\n  This is a letter from a woman from Lake County:\n\n       I am 80 years old and have several health problems making \n     it necessary to take 8 prescription drugs. Last year I fell \n     into the donut hole.\n\n  This was the President Bush privatization of Medicare. It provided a \nprescription drug benefit, sort of--a good one for some people. But it \nwas a bill, as you remember, written by the drug companies and written \nby the insurance companies at the betrayal of the middle class in this \ncountry.\n  She writes:\n\n       I fell into the donut hole by July, and only made it \n     through the rest of the year due to the doctor giving me \n     samples. . . .\n       My son had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis several \n     years ago. The insurance he had with his employer agreed to \n     allow the treatments with remicade.\n\n  Remicade is that very expensive biologic drug that costs tens of \nthousands of dollars a year for which there is no generic substitute, \nfor which there is no way to get the price down.\n\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\n\n       Then [my son] changed jobs and his new insurance would not \n     allow the remicade, but would allow the use of humira, if my \n     son would co-pay $1,000 per treatment--every other month. . . \n     . That was almost more than his salary. He is barely making \n     out.\n\n  That is the reason we need generic biologic reform, the reason we \nneed a health insurance reform plan.\n  The last letter I will share today is from Thomas, from Lake County.\n\n       My name is Tom Zidek. I work for the United Steelworkers \n     Union. Today I received information from one of the companies \n     I represent that Kaiser is requesting a 30 percent increase \n     in premiums next year.\n\n  This company has received another quote from Anthem, and ``Anthem's \nincrease will be 15 percent for next year.''\n  He then goes on and tells me about his son who has Down's syndrome, \nhas had open heart surgeries. His wife has cancer, and the medications \nshe takes, according to Medco, cost approximately $5,000 to $6,000 a \nmonth.\n\n       As I said, me and my wife have good healthcare but earlier \n     this year we were both concerned that we might lose our jobs.\n\n  He has worked for 36 years in the steel industry. He, along with \nmillions of other workers, he tells us, middle-class families, played \nby the rules, and this is what happened.\n  These letters are four of hundreds that we get, many of us, every \nsingle day. I have had more calls and letters and e-mails this week \nabout health care than any other week in my whole Senate career, my \nwhole House career, for the last 18 years; more letters on health care, \non this subject, than total letters I have gotten in any other week \nsince I have been in the Congress. This is so serious. It is absolutely \na necessity that we work on this. People who say go slow need to \nunderstand there are 14,000 Americans every single month losing their \nhealth insurance. Many of them live in my State. We need action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           china human rights\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to make a very brief statement \nwhile we are awaiting Members of the Senate to come and offer \namendments. Senator Bennett and I have been very patient. We have a \ngood many amendments filed, so we are waiting for our colleagues to \ncome offer those amendments on the underlying appropriations bill. But \nI wish to take a couple of minutes while we are waiting, to offer a \nbrief statement.\n  I am Chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. The \nCommission examines human rights and rule of law developments in China. \nI would like to talk for a moment about these issues and some \ndevelopments in China that concern me a great deal.\n  I want to discuss the increasing harassment of human rights lawyers \nin China, which this Commission had reported on in great detail. Some \nhave been disbarred, and their law firms have been closed. Others have \nbeen physically harassed or beaten. What do these lawyers share in \ncommon? The tenacity and courage to take on politically sensitive \ncases.\n  I wish to say a few words about China's most famous human rights \nlawyer, a very courageous man named Gao Zhisheng.\n  It is 174 days now since Mr. Gao was last seen taken from his bed by \nmore than 10 men. His captors, apparently the ``national defense'' unit \nof China's public security agency according to the renowned China \nexpert Jerome Cohen, had threatened to kill the young lawyer during \nprevious detentions that were marked by horrific torture. What was his \ntransgression? Why is he in trouble with the Chinese authorities? He \nagreed to take politically sensitive cases as a lawyer, and represented \nsome of the most vulnerable people in China. He sought to use the law \nin China to battle corruption, to overturn illegal property seizures, \nto expose police abuses and defend religious freedom in China.\n  In October of 2005, Gao wrote an open letter to President Hu and \nPremier Wen detailing the torture of Falun Gong practitioners by \nauthorities. A month later, the authorities shut down his law firm and \nrevoked his license to practice law.\n  In 2006, he was convicted of ``inciting subversion of state power,'' \nand was placed under ``home surveillance'' which was harsher than \nprison, for Gao and his family.\n  In 2007, public security officers abducted him again. He was brutally \ntortured for 50 days. His abduction was prompted by the publication of \nan open letter he wrote to us in the U.S. Congress.\n  Think of that. A lawyer in China wrote an open letter to us, Members \nof the Congress. In it, he alleged widespread human rights abuses in \nChina and described the government's treatment of him and his family. \nHis captors called him a traitor. They warned him he would be killed if \nhe told anyone about being abducted and tortured.\n  Once released, he was placed again under ``home surveillance''. His \nfamily faced constant police surveillance and intimidation. His \ndaughter, barred from attending school, lost hope as a young girl. The \ntreatment became so brutal the family finally decided that their very \nsurvival depended on their escaping from China.\n  But Gao was too closely monitored and could not think of leaving \nwithout placing his family at great risk because he was monitored 24 \nhours a day. He did not want to be in a situation where he would leave \nhis family at even greater risk.\n  So in January of this year, Gao's wife, 6-year-old son, and teenage \ndaughter were smuggled out of China and into the United States. This is \na photograph of Gao, his wife Geng He, his son, and his daughter. This \nphotograph depicts a beautiful family living in China, Mr. Gao and his \nfamily, a lawyer who practiced law in support of the most vulnerable in \nChina. As a result, he ran afoul of the Chinese Government.\n  Mr. Gao disappeared 174 days ago, has not been seen or heard from \nsince. After his family fled China, Gao was abducted once again from \nhis home and no one has seen him alive. We know his situation is \nextremely grave. I have met with his wife. I have spoken about this on \nthe floor of the Senate previously. His wife came to Washington, DC, \nand was in the balcony when I and other colleagues spoke about the \nplight of Mr. Gao.\n  Of course, he may have been killed. The Chinese Government has not \nlet anyone know his whereabouts or given access to him despite repeated \nappeals by U.N. agencies, by our government, by foreign governments, \nNGOs, and the media. The Chinese Government has signed and ratified \nmany international agreements, human rights agreements, that would \nrequire it to come clean about Mr. Gao.\n  I have written to the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, and \nreceived a letter back from him that was a nonanswer. I call on the \nAmbassador again to answer the questions: Where is Mr. Gao being held? \nIs Mr. Gao alive? What is the Chinese Government doing to this poor \nsoul who had previously been tortured simply because he ran afoul of \nthe state by speaking out and practicing law on behalf of those who are \nvulnerable in China?\n  We call on the Chinese Government to give us information about Mr. \nGao, to allow him access to a lawyer and to his family and to publicly \nstate and justify the grounds for his continued abuse. The right to \nspeak freely and to challenge the government, all of these are \nenshrined in the constitution in China. Yet it appears the Chinese \nGovernment and the Communist Party seem intent on upholding the \nviolation of these rights in the case of Mr. Gao.\n  What has the Chinese Government done to Mr. Gao? How do they justify \nit? When will they allow his family to see him? The government's \ncontinued refusal to produce Mr. Gao makes this case resemble those of \nthe ``disappeared'' in Latin American dictatorships.\n  American law has the practice of habeas corpus. It is the legal \naction through which a person can seek relief from the unlawful \ndetention of themselves or another. I am aware of nothing similar to \nAmerica's habeas corpus that exists in Chinese legislation or\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\nlegal practice. But the U.N. Convention Against Torture, which China \nratified almost 20 years ago, obligates it to come clean about Gao.\n  I urge the government of China to disclose his whereabouts and \njustify the grounds for his continued detention. Once again, this is a \nphotograph of a very courageous man, a very courageous Chinese lawyer, \nwho has been incarcerated and tortured and now has been apparently \nabducted, perhaps killed. We do not know. I call on the Chinese \nGovernment to tell us what has happened to Mr. Gao.\n  Mr. Gao's family and Mr. Gao's wife continually await word now 174 \ndays after their father and husband--this courageous lawyer in China \nwas abducted. Having been abducted before and having been tortured \nbefore, they worry very much about the safety of their husband and \ntheir father. My hope is that our government, and other governments can \nexpect some word soon from the Government of China about the \nwhereabouts and the well-being of Mr. Gao.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CASEY. I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that morning business statements \nduring the consideration of this bill be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak for up to 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak of an issue that has \ndominated a lot of the time and attention--appropriately so--of this \nSenate, of the Congress overall, and the American people. Of course, \nthat is health care.\n  We have heard so far a vigorous debate but, in my judgment, a debate \nthat has not had nearly enough facts on the table. Some of those facts, \nof course, are the facts as they relate to what is in the legislation. \nRight now, what is before the Senate is one bill, the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions bill, which came out of our committee. I \nam a member of that committee. It came out a few weeks ago with 13 \nDemocrats voting for it, 10 Republican Senators voting against it.\n  We await anxiously the deliberation, further deliberation and the \nmarkup and the amendments which will lead to a vote in the Finance \nCommittee. We do await that with a lot of anticipation. That will cause \nfurther debate and properly so. But I rise to speak on two or three \ntopics as they relate to where we are now.\n  One is the question of the ``cost of doing nothing,'' the cost of \nstaying on the same road, the status quo, because that is one choice \nfor the American people. The other path is the path of change and \nreform, standing and working with President Obama to create the kind of \nstability the American people should have a right to expect from their \nhealth care system.\n  That stability should relate to and is framed by a number of \nimportant considerations--certainly stable cost. Too many Americans, \neven though they have coverage, see the costs going up all the time, \nand they cannot afford to pay them. Whether they are in a family or \nwhether they are running a small business, we need to give them, \nthrough this legislation, stable costs going forward into the future.\n  We also need to make sure we have stability as it relates to quality. \nMillions, tens of millions of Americans, are covered by a health care \nplan from a health insurance company but are not getting the kind of \nquality that they deserve. That is a real indictment of our system. \nStrong as it is in some other areas, it is pretty weak in some of our \nquality indicators.\n  Thirdly, I think we want to make sure we ensure stable choices. The \nAmerican people have a right to expect, at the end of the road of this \nlegislation, when it is sent to the President--I sure hope we can get \nthere; I think we can--that the President will be able to sign a bill \nthat has a sense of stability as it relates to choices.\n  Why is it the American people should not be given choices not only \nfrom a menu of private options but also be given the opportunity for a \npublic option--not a public option that is vague and overreaching but a \npublic option that has the same rules, that every insurance company has \nto develop a plan. In other words, that the plan will be solvent, that \nthe plan will be self-sustaining. All those features would be part of \nthe public plan.\n  But the threshold question still is: Do you want change? Do you want \nto stay on the road we have been on, the status quo? I speak about the \npeople of Pennsylvania, but I also know these numbers I will cite have \na national implication as well.\n  If we do nothing, if we stay on the path we are on--now it is 2009--\nby 2016, according to one report, by the New America Foundation, here \nis what happens in Pennsylvania if we do nothing, if we stay on the \nroad that is called the status quo, the do-nothing, let's not change \nroad.\n  Here is the result from page 86 of the report.\n\n       By 2016, Pennsylvania residents will have to spend nearly \n     $27,000 or close to 52 percent of median household income to \n     buy health insurance for themselves and their families. This \n     represents a 93 percent increase over 2008 levels and the \n     sixth highest premium cost in the country.\n\n  I have not found yet, and I do not think I ever will find, a family \nin Pennsylvania, rich, middle income or poor who will walk up to me and \nsay: You know what, you should not do anything about health care. \nEverything is fine. We should stay on the road we are on. When it comes \nto 2016, my family and I can afford to spend 52 percent of our income \non health care.\n  I do not think we are ever going to find anyone in Pennsylvania or \nAmerica who will be able to make that statement because no one can \nafford that.\n  But make no mistake about it, that is the path we are on right now as \nit relates to the cost to families across the country. Here is another \nsegment of this report on the same page--again, as it relates to \nPennsylvania.\n\n       People seeking family health insurance through their \n     employers in Pennsylvania will have to contribute--\n\n  Meaning by 2016--\n\n     more towards premiums than residents of all but one state.\n\n  The people of Pennsylvania\n\n     will also experience the second greatest percent change in \n     their premiums contributions nationwide. By 2016, people in \n     Pennsylvania seeking family coverage through their employer \n     will contribute almost $9,000 to the cost of the premium.\n\n  To be exact about it, we are talking about a premium increase from \n$3,510 in 2008 to $8,830, almost $9,000, for health care. I don't think \nI will run into anybody in Pennsylvania or America who says: Let's stay \nwhere we are. Everything is wonderful. Don't pass any bill. Don't worry \nabout getting it done. We can afford to stay on the path we are on.\n  In a word, that leads to, if anything, instability for a family, the \ninability to make ends meet for a small business. That is the road we \nare on right now. At some point in this debate, there are going to be \npeople in the Senate and House Members across the way who will have to \ndecide which team they are on. In my judgment, there are two teams: the \nreform and change team President Obama has developed and the set of \npolicies behind that or the ``let's not change, everything is OK, let's \nstay on the road we are on and let's stay with the status quo.''\n  In my judgment--and I know the people of Pennsylvania pretty well--\npeople will support change, because the road we are on now is a road to \nruin when it comes to our economy, when it comes to the bottom line of \nfamilies and small businesses.\n  Every week, 44,230 people lose their health insurance. That is \nunsustainable. We can do all kinds of positive things in our economy. \nWe can talk about creating jobs and doing all of the actions we hope to \ndo to build a strong economy, but when we are a country where 44,230 \npeople every week lose health insurance coverage, we are all in \ntrouble.\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\n  For Pennsylvania, between January of 2008 and December 2010, a little \nless than 3 years, 178,520 people are projected to lose health care \ncoverage. Again, I don't think we can stay on the road we are on right \nnow.\n  Let me share some thoughts about the other debate on cost. What I \nhave outlined is the cost of doing nothing. The cost of doing nothing \nis very high. In fact, it is unsustainable, if we are to have economic \ngrowth and families and small business stability. Two or three quick \nexamples of ways the Senate HELP Committee bill, the Health Choices \nAct, helps to bend the so-called cost curve to bring costs in line over \ntime.\n  In 2000, the Institute of Medicine conducted a comprehensive study of \nthe economic cost to society of the uninsured, arising from poor health \nand shorter lifespans. An update of that study by the New America \nFoundation estimates that the economic loss is now up to $207 billion a \nyear. By contrast, the CBO recently, when analyzing the House bill, \nsaid that it would cost some $202 billion in 2019--not today, 2019--\nless than the savings to the economy from covering the uninsured.\n  The bottom line is, we are spending currently per year $207 billion \nin terms of the cost resulting from poor health and shorter lifespans. \nOne doesn't have to be a math major to cost that out over 10 years. \nJust add the zero. It is entirely possible from this formulation that \nif we are losing $207 billion to poor health and shorter lifespans as a \nresult of the uninsured, we are talking over 10 years about $2 trillion \nby that estimate.\n  We can choose to stay on the road we are on, which means we lose more \nthan $200 billion every year because of what is happening to the lives \nof people who don't have health insurance. It is not free. By one \nestimate, every person pays about $1,000 a year because others are \nuninsured. The idea that if we cover more people somehow that is going \nto cost people money, it is already costing people money today.\n  I argue we should abandon the idea of doing nothing. We should \nabandon and not even discuss the idea of staying on the road we have \nbeen on. The road we are on right now means people in Pennsylvania will \npay more than half their income to health care, will continue to be \npart of the loss of revenue of over $200 billion each and every year. \nAnd finally, small businesses won't be able to make ends meet with \nthose kinds of numbers.\n  We will continue to talk about costs and how we can reduce cost. That \nis an essential item and priority in this debate. But we also have to \ntalk about what is happening to people right now and what is the cost \nof doing nothing. The cost of doing nothing is far too high for any \nAmerican and, candidly, for any country to sustain. We cannot stay \nwhere we are now. We have to bring about change. I believe we will do \nthat this year, if we choose to be on the right team in this debate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. While we are waiting for colleagues, some of whom will be \noffering amendments, I wanted to describe briefly an amendment I am \ngoing to offer.\n  Let me describe an executive order that was established by President \nClinton in 1993. That executive order was titled ``Deficit Control and \nProductivity Improvement in the Administration of the Federal \nGovernment.'' Essentially what the President did in 1993 was require \nFederal agencies to delineate between their program costs and their \noverhead costs or general administrative costs. He wanted to begin \ncutting overhead or administrative costs.\n  The first thing a business will do, by and large, to deal with a \ndownturn in business, is to begin tightening their belt on \nadministrative or general overhead expenditures. We can't yet do that \nwith Federal agencies, because there is no distinction between program \ncosts and administrative or general overhead costs. The minute you \npropose any reduction, they say: OK, what you are doing is you are \ntrying to cut these programs.\n  President Clinton issued an executive order in 1993 that required \nFederal agencies to separate out and report their administrative and \ngeneral and administrative overhead expenditures versus program costs. \nAlmost none of the agencies complied. So I began discussing with my \ncolleague Senator Coburn legislation that we have since introduced. We \nmay be an odd couple; we have different records on some issues, though \nnot all. In any event, we decided to introduce legislation that would \nreinstate the requirements of the 1993 executive order, but in this \ncircumstance make it stick and then, ultimately, begin a reduction in \noverhead expenditures.\n  The first step of that is to get the information with each of the \nmajor Federal agencies on what is general and administrative overhead \nexpense and what are their program expenditures.\n  Let me give you some examples of administrative waste that are real \nhead scratchers.\n  When the Transportation Security Agency was first created some years \nago, they had to hire airport screeners. That gave rise to some \nunbelievable overhead costs in trying to recruit. We held a hearing on \nthis. They had 20 recruiters begin a 7-week stay at the Wyndham Peaks \nResort and Golden Door Spa in Telluride, CO, a luxury resort hotel with \nan 18-hole golf course. After 7 weeks, the recruiters had hired a total \nof 50 people. On some days only one or two applicants showed up, but \nthey hung in there. They also, as I began to investigate that, had \nrecruiters show up at the Waldorf Astoria to interview people; the \nManele Bay Hotel in Lanai, HI; Hawk's Cay Resort in the Florida Keys. \nThey were recruiting people and having a grand time of it, and in the \nend they spent $700 million in this manner.\n  A couple years later TSA spent $1 million on an awards banquet. They \nhired a party planner for $85,000, three balloon arches for the party \nfor $1,400, seven cakes for $1,800, and $1,500 for three cheese \nplatters. That is some cheese.\n  I don't mean to pick on the TSA alone. Fore example, the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs spent $28,000 to send 14 of its most senior staffers to \na 4-day Tony Robbins motivational seminar. Overhead? It seems to me it \nis not overhead anybody ought to be supportive of. The participants in \nthat seminar were trained on how to ``shed excess weight quickly and \nenjoyably,'' and how to ``reignite the passion in your physical \nrelationship.'' They were also asked to walk on hot coals with minimal \ntraining. The $28,000 from the Bureau of Indian Affairs could have paid \nthe annual salary of a fifth grade school teacher at an Indian school.\n  A week or two ago, the Bureau of the Public Debt at the Treasury \nannounced it would hire a consultant to teach employees how to be funny \nin the workplace. The consultant was going to teach staff through the \nuse of cartoons. I pointed out that there is very little funny to the \ntaxpayers about the public debt. They scrapped that. In fact, I got a \nfairly upset letter from the cartoonist who bid the project.\n  My point is, there is fat in government agencies, especially the big \nagencies that have grown and have never had to trim overhead and \ngeneral administrative expenses.\n  That brings me back to the Clinton order of 1993 that has never been \ncomplied with by Federal agencies, a Presidential order that directed \ncertain things for which there has been no action. Senator Coburn and I \nintroduced S. 948 with the objective of reviving that executive order \nand having the information by which to begin trimming back some or belt \ntightening some with the Federal agencies on overhead expenditures. I \nwill not offer that bill in its entirety as an amendment to this \nlegislation, but I will instead offer an amendment that represents a \nfirst step, which is that the Federal agencies will identify their \noverhead and general and administrative expenses, separately from \nprogram expenses. We need to know and should know.\n  My hope is, once we do know that information, we will be able to at \nleast initiate some belt tightening because with the kind of Federal \nbudget deficit we have--deficits are growing; I think they are \nunsustainable and very dangerous for our country--we need to be\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\ntightening our belt in a wide range of areas.\n  The legislation we have introduced would begin to accomplish that. \nBut in order to accomplish that, the first step must be to get the \nunderstanding of what the separate expenditures are of general \nadministrative expenses and overhead expenses. So I will be offering \nthat amendment as we go along.\n  We will be here apparently for a longer period of time, and at some \nappropriate moment, I will offer that amendment and hope for its \ninclusion in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be glad to withhold my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator withholds.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. President, as the national debate over health care reform rages \non, some complain about the inherent inefficiencies of government \nprograms. Some are frightened by the prospect of Washington bureaucrats \ndeciding what treatment people receive. But these skeptics always fail \nto mention the massive inefficiencies--and widespread denial of \ncoverage--that is already present in the private market.\n  Private insurance companies are accountable to two groups: their \ncustomers and their shareholders. The competing interests of these two \ngroups make for a dangerous tightrope walk for insurers. Paying off too \nmany claims, or keeping insurance premiums too low, may lower profits \nand anger investors. Paying off too few claims, or raising premiums too \nhigh, could cause consumers to choose a different plan--if one is \navailable.\n  The problem is that consumers do not have options. In the past \ndecade, we have seen unprecedented consolidation in the insurance \nindustry. We have seen over 400 corporate mergers involving health \ninsurers over the past 13 years.\n  Mr. President, 94 percent of the Nation's insurance markets are now \nconsidered ``highly concentrated,'' meaning they pose antitrust \nconcerns. These localized monopolies stack the deck against consumers \nbecause there is no longer real competition or choice.\n  The result? At the beginning of this decade, the five largest \ninsurers increased their profit margins by at least 50 percent, and two \nof those companies increased margins by over 100 percent.\n  It is not surprising that, as the cost of Medicare skyrocketed over \nthe past decade, the price of health care insurance has increased at an \neven faster rate. While companies raise premiums, they also work on \ndevious new ways to deny claims.\n  Many insurers have created barriers to delay and limit care. \nPreauthorization requirements and burdensome, unnecessary paperwork \nmean that health care providers spend more time dealing with insurance \nindustry redtape and less time treating their patients. Whole \nindustries have sprung up around finding ways to deny insurance claims.\n  One insurance company boasted that they are ``Managing the Spiraling \nCost of Health Care.'' The company claims that their efforts can \n``reduce paid claims costs by up to 10% without changing benefits or \nmaking claim system upgrades.'' This means taking advantage of \nconsumers by denying claims based on mere technicalities.\n  Any of my colleagues who believe insurance companies should decide on \ntreatment options has never gone through the pain of a coverage denial. \nAll of the extra paperwork and administration required to deny claims \nactually costs a good bit of money. And that cost is passed directly--\nit is passed directly--on to the consumer.\n  What some people do not want to tell you is that government programs \nare actually much more efficient, not less. Administrative costs for \ngovernment insurance programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and \nTRICARE, are around 5 percent. Private costs are as high as 30 percent \nin the individual market, 23 percent in the small group market, and \n12.5 percent in the large group market.\n  These numbers speak for themselves. The insurance industry has become \ndistracted by their desire to maximize profits at the expense of those \nwho need care. We cannot stand by and watch as the American people are \ntaken advantage of, especially in a time of need when someone's health \nis on the line.\n  That is why I am proud to support a public plan that will complete--\ncompete--with private insurers. This option would provide a low-cost \nalternative to the private market, bringing back competition and \nchoice. It would press insurers to end their abusive practices and high \nprofit margins, and would help eliminate redtape at the same time.\n  No one would be forced to change insurance plans. No one would face \nhigher premiums. And no one would need to fear that their coverage \nwould be denied by a corporate giant for a few extra dollars' worth of \nprofits. A robust public option would help make insurance available to \nthose who do not have it, increase efficiencies, and reduce costs for \nevery American.\n  The time to act is now. We must not let another year go by without \nmeaningful reform. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a \nstrong public option. The time is now. It has been 50, 60, almost 70 \nyears that we have been working on this program for health insurance \nfor all Americans. It is time we get it done.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes, if I may, as \nin morning business.\n  Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, let me take a few minutes, if I may, on the subject \nthat I know is the preoccupation of many of us, even if you are not on \none of the committees. The discussion about health care is, obviously, \nthe dominant debate that is occurring here and in our Nation. I know \nour colleague from the State of Montana, Senator Baucus, along with \nSenator Grassley, is working in the Finance Committee.\n  As many of my colleagues, I know, are aware, I was asked to fill in \nfor Senator Kennedy, who is struggling with his own battles with brain \ncancer, as the acting chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee. We completed, as most of my colleagues are aware, \nour efforts about 2 weeks ago on our portion of the health care debate \ndealing with prevention, with quality, with workforce issues, with the \nfraud and abuse allegations in the Medicare, Medicaid systems, as well \nas coverage questions. The rest is left to the Finance Committee. At \nthe end of that process, the goal is to marry these two pieces of \nlegislation together in one bill.\n  So we made that effort. We spent about 5 weeks with over 23 sessions, \nand considered nearly 300 amendments in that process. In fact, we \nagreed to about 160 of my fellow colleagues' amendments from the \nRepublican side--good amendments, I might add. Some were technical, but \nmany were substantive, which I think added to the value of the bill.\n  While it did not turn out to be a bipartisan bill in terms of the \nvotes that were cast, if you can define at least one definition of \n``bipartisan'' to be that the bill itself reflected the contribution of \nideas from all people, then to that extent this bill is a bipartisan \nbill. But we are obviously waiting until the Finance Committee \ncompletes its process. I realize people want us, as they should, to \nhave a deliberate process, one for which we can say at the conclusion \nwe did our very best, that we evaluated the situation as well as we \ncould and came up with the best ideas we could to move forward.\n\n  It has been 70 years, as most people know, since we adopted the \nhealth care system we have in our country. Every\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\nPresident, from both political parties, and every Congress, since the \n1940s, has grappled with this issue unsuccessfully. Obviously, we \npassed Medicare and Medicaid and the SCHIP program and other ideas that \nI think have contributed to a large extent to the health care system we \nhave today. But certainly the overall reforms in the system to move \nfrom a sick care system to a truly health care system have defied \nresolution.\n  So we are at it once again to see if we cannot defy the odds and do \nthat which no other Congress and no other government has been able to \ndo for more than 65 years; and that is, to come up with an answer that \nwill give people primarily a sense of confidence, a sense of stability, \nto take away the uncertainty that many people feel about the present \nhealth care system.\n  Most of us, of course, in this country have health care insurance. A \nlot of those who are insured are underinsured. They have to pay a lot \nof out-of-pocket expenses or have very high deductibles, and so a lot \nof what they may face in terms of a health care crisis has to be paid \nfor out of their own pockets. Their insurance coverage does not cover \nthem. Others, of course, have no insurance at all. The numbers vary, \nbut I think most agree the number hovers around 45 million people who \nare uninsured. There are about 25 million or 30 million who are \nunderinsured in the country.\n  But, again, I state, most people have a plan they think is pretty \ngood and they do not want the government or anyone else fooling around \nwith it. So the first principle is to say: Leave well enough alone that \nwhich is working well. If you like your doctor, if you like your \nhospital, if you like your coverage, leave that alone. We are not out \nto change, nor should we, part of a health care system that works.\n  What we are trying to do is fix that which does not work, that which \nis costing us more than any other nation on the face of this Earth on a \nper capita basis--some $2.5 trillion a year. How do we increase access? \nHow do we improve the quality of health care? And how do we make this \naffordable so people do not end up paying more and more costs in \npremiums? Of course, how do we provide that sense of confidence, that \nsense of stability, that sense of certainty that a plan will be there, \nLord forbid, if I need it, if my spouse, my child, or I need that kind \nof health care coverage to pay for that unexpected accident, that \nunexpected illness that could afflict every family.\n  It is at that moment, that critical moment, that you want to make \nsure what you have will not put you into economic ruin, because all of \na sudden the fine print excludes the very kind of coverage which you \nwould anticipate based on the policy you have had for years. Or you \nfind yourself in a situation where even if it does, it limits the \namount you can receive to pay for that hospitalization or that care.\n  Those stories go on every single day. People want that notion that: \nIf you are going to change this, if you are going to reform this, the \nthing I am looking for more than anything else is that I will have the \nconfidence of knowing that policy I have is not going to bankrupt me in \ncosts and will be there when I need it. That, more than anything else, \nis what we are talking about.\n  The problem, of course, is while we are waiting to do this--and, \nagain, I emphasize that doing it right is certainly very important. I \nwould like to think in our committee, while we did not get unanimous \nsupport at the end of it, we listened to every one of our 23 Members in \nthat committee, over 5 weeks. There was extensive debate and discussion \nover all of these issues. So we have gone a long way, I think, in that \nprocess.\n  But while we are waiting, there is a cost to all of this. Let me \npoint out what has happened in terms of the numbers. Mr. President, \n14,000 people every day in our Nation lose their coverage. Again, that \nmay be due to job loss, that may be because all of a sudden the plan \nthey have does not cover the circumstances they are in. Since we have \npassed our bill in the HELP Committee 3 weeks ago, 182,000 of our \nfellow citizens have lost their health insurance. And 14,000 people do \nevery day--again, through no fault of their own: job loss, as I say, or \ndiscovering that a policy did not cover the events they thought it \ncovered and they find themselves in this situation.\n  While we are talking about doing this slowly, and waiting a while to \nget it done, it is important, I think, for those of us here who have \ngreat health care coverage--if you are a Member of the Senate, if you \nare a Member of the Congress, we have a Cadillac health care plan for \nevery one of us and our families, as do Federal employees. I certainly \nwelcome that. It is reassuring. It certainly gives you that sense, as a \nMember of Congress, that you have a stable, certain plan in place if \nyou are unfortunate enough to be hit with a health care crisis.\n\n  I merely make that point because, as I say, a lot of our fellow \ncitizens do not have that same sense of certainty and that same sense \nof confidence about their health care. Of course, if they are faced \nwith a health care crisis, we also know what can happen. We now know \nthat 62 percent of the bankruptcies in our country that have been \noccurring over the last several years are health care crisis related. I \nmight point out, which I think may surprise some people, that 75 \npercent of that 62 percent are people with health insurance. It wasn't \nthe person without health insurance who got caught with a tremendous \nhealth care cost and had no means to pay for it and thus went into \nbankruptcy. Seventy-five percent of those people actually had health \ncare coverage. Fifty-four percent of the foreclosures in our Nation are \nrelated to a health care crisis as well. As I say, 10,000 homes today \nwill receive a foreclosure notice.\n  So while we are waiting here and trying to get this right--and we \nshould--it is important to be mindful that while we are comfortable \nabout being assured that we have the coverage, millions of our fellow \ncitizens do not have that same sense of certainty and confidence they \nwould like to have as well, the certainty and confidence that they are \nnot going to get wiped out by rising premium costs to pay for someone \nelse, despite the fact that today most families write a check for about \n$1,100 a year as part of their health insurance to cover the uninsured \nwho show up in emergency rooms--the uncompensated care, as it is \ncalled. That is $1,100 a year, on the average, for a family, a check \nthey have to write because in our country, if you show up in an \nemergency room and you need health and care, I think virtually every \nmedical facility in our country takes you in and they will treat you. \nThey will care for you in that moment of an emergency, but it doesn't \ncome free of charge. The costs of that are borne by those who pay the \npremiums for their own coverage, and the pricetag per health insurance \npolicy, on average, is $1,100 a year. That is a tax we pay today as a \nresult of not having a more comprehensive health care system in our \nNation. So those 182,000 people who have now lost their health care in \nthe last 2 weeks, and the 14,000 who will lose it today, some I presume \nwill show up in an emergency room because of a condition or a tragedy \nthat befalls them. They will get health care under the status quo we \nhave today. They will get health care, but the rest of the country will \npay for it one way or the other. We have to change that. You cannot \nbankrupt the country by having a system that fails to provide for the \ncoverage as well as the cost of these matters on the present system we \nare living under. It will not be sustainable, in my view.\n  So these numbers are real. They happen every day. The longer we delay \nin getting this done, these numbers will mount. So it is important to \nnot do so recklessly, to not do it at such a speed that we don't know \nwhat we are doing, but we need to keep in mind that as we move along in \nthis process, it does not come without a cost to those out there who \nfind themselves in that free-fall, that terrible feeling--that terrible \nfeeling that if something happens, I can't take care of my family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has reached his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. If I may, I will ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Again, there are stories of people in my State, as I know \nthere are all across this country, who are losing this. I was going to \ntell the story of Mrs. Carrasco in Hartford, CT. She now\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\nskips her examinations, such as her colonoscopy and others things, \nbecause they are not paid for under her policy. Several months ago, she \nsaid she had an infection but didn't go to the doctor because she was \nafraid it would cost too much. Again, doesn't go and the problems can \nget worse.\n  Another woman in Connecticut, by the name of Theresa, has a cluster \nof autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis and connective \ntissue disease. Because she doesn't have health insurance, she doesn't \nsee the doctor. Those problems are going to get worse and she is going \nto show up and the cost goes up. So stability in terms of what we have, \nmaking sure the cost of these premiums doesn't outstrip the ability of \nworking families to meet them, is certainly a great challenge before us \nas well as improving the quality of care for all Americans.\n  Lastly, I would just say I spent a good part of Saturday this last \nweekend at the Manchester Memorial Hospital in Manchester, CT, looking \nat their new ICU unit as well as meeting with hospital personnel. It is \nremarkable what small hospitals do all across our country and how well \nthey serve the people in keeping down costs and increasing quality. \nMany of our hospitals do. Our providers are truly good Samaritans in \ncase after case after case. The nurse practitioners, the doctors, and \nothers who support the health care professions do a remarkable job \nevery single day. But we need more primary care physicians, we need \nmore nurses, if we are going to meet the demands of a growing \npopulation who has coverage. But we truly need to reform this system; \nleave in place that which works, fix that which doesn't. That is the \ngoal the President has laid out for us.\n  That is our collective responsibility. I am confident we can do it. \nIf we will sit down with each other and work through this process, we \ncan achieve that result to bring that level of stability and certainty \nthat people want when it comes to their health care needs.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1841\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish to return to the underlying bill. \nSenator Voinovich and I have offered an amendment, and I think it is \nNo. 1841. I am not going to call up the amendment now, but I wish to \ntalk a little bit about it.\n  As the chairman and our colleagues know, we receive in this country \nprobably 20 percent of the electricity that we consume from nuclear \npowerplants. All those nuclear powerplants were built several decades \nago. We have about 104 in all. A number of them are 40 years old. They \nwere licensed for 40 years and the utilities that own those powerplants \nhave to come back to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and ask for an \nextension, if you will, on the life of a license. They are asking for \n20-year extensions.\n  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has many jobs and one of those is \nto make sure the 104 nuclear powerplants that are in operation are \noperating safely every day. I like to say if it isn't perfect, make it \nbetter, to create a culture of safety and to make sure we don't have \nmistakes and errors that can cause great havoc.\n  In addition to that, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is charged \nwith--these nuclear powerplants are approaching the end of their \nlicense, their 40-year license, and so they apply for extensions. The \nNuclear Regulatory Commission has to go through with the utilities that \nown the plant the relicensure process. Add on to that, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission has now, I think, 18 applications to build 28 new \nnuclear powerplants in this country in the decades to come. Add to \nthat, there are a number of new designs for nuclear powerplants that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission has to say grace over, to evaluate, \nto wrap their brains around and to understand how they would work and \nwhether they would work safely for 40, 60 years. In short, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission has a lot on its operate plate, which is a good \nthing.\n  Nuclear power provides, among other things, electricity for 20 \npercent of our Nation's households and businesses and so forth, but it \nalso provides electricity that is carbon free. The emissions from \nnuclear powerplants do not include carbon dioxide, do not include \nsulfur dioxide, do not include nitrogen dioxide, which bothers our \nbreathing apparatus; does not include mercury which leads to brain \ndamage in unborn children. Nuclear powerplants don't put any of that \ninto the air. They don't contribute to the problems of global warming.\n\n  In order to make sure they are doing their job and the folks at \nnuclear plants and utilities are doing what they need to do to provide \nsafe nuclear power, the NRC has had to hire extra people. They have \nhired, I think, in the last year or two or three, about 1,000 extra \npeople. They have them spread out at different locations. The Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission is interested in trying to consolidate as many of \nthose people as they can for management purposes. I think it makes a \nlot of sense. Senator George Voinovich of Ohio, who has helped me at \none time or another, and I have helped him, to lead the Senate \nSubcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety--we believe it makes sense \nfor the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to collocate many of their \nemployees going forward.\n  We want to make sure, and we seek to do it with the language in \namendment No. 1841, that the NRC can use the language within the bill \nand for employee costs and other expenses to be able to get this \ncollocation process underway and provide additional spaces if they are \nneeded for an additional 1,000 employees. So my hope is our colleagues \nwill adopt this amendment.\n  I would also say the Nuclear Regulatory Commission does a competition \nwith, I think, every other Federal agency. It is a competition we don't \nhear a lot about, but the competition is for the recognition of best \nfederal agency to work for, best for employees, best for their \nfamilies, and for the last two or three years, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission has been selected as the very best place for Federal \nemployees to work. They do important work. They work hard. But they \nalso work in an environment where the employees feel it is good for \ntheir life--not only their professional life but also their families \ntoo. They have asked for this help from us and Senator Voinovich and I \nare pleased to lend our support and we hope our colleagues will join us \nin supporting amendment No. 1841.\n  With that being said, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are waiting to try to see if we can \nhave a vote on an amendment that has been offered. We, again, would ask \ncolleagues to come and offer their amendments. We have been patiently \nwaiting, Senator Bennett and I, to see if we could get amendments \ndebated and voted upon.\n  I have a photograph I wish to show on another matter. I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Electrocution Deaths in Iraq\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, at 8:30 p.m. on January 2 in 2008, fellow \nspecial forces soldiers found SSG Ryan Maseth on the floor in the \nbathroom at a security forces building in Baghdad, Iraq. His mother \nCheryl Harris was originally told, when she was informed her son had \ndied, that perhaps he had been in the shower with a radio and had been \nelectrocuted. He clearly had been electrocuted when he was found \nunresponsive in January of last year.\n  But Cheryl Harris, she wanted to get to the bottom of this, and she \nwould not let this drop. I held two hearings on this subject. We \ndiscovered that Kellogg, Brown, and Root had been in charge of fixing \nwidely reported problems at the shower facility where Sergeant Maseth \nhad been electrocuted, and had failed miserably.\n  Well, this week we obtained an inspector general's report, which \nshows that there were 230 electrical shocks of American soldiers in \nfacilities in Iraq because they weren't wired properly. Kellogg, Brown, \nand Root was the contractor, and they failed miserably. In\n\n[[Page S8170]]\n\nfact, they were awarded $83 million in award fees, bonuses, for \nexcellent work, which we now know was improper. They hired third \ncountry nationals who could not speak good English and didn't know the \nstandards and, in many cases, didn't even do basic grounding of the \nwiring. We know that Staff Sergeant Maseth was electrocuted. We know \nthere was a young man power-washing a Humvee who was electrocuted. We \nknow that the U.S. Army criminal investigation is now investigating a \nnumber of these circumstances.\n  But when I held the hearings, there was denial all around by Kellogg, \nBrown, and Root; no, we did great work, they said. By the Pentagon, the \nDefense Department; no, things were fine, they initially said. It turns \nout that wasn't the case. We had to ultimately get an inspector general \nto give us the facts. It is not only on this case. The same thing \nhappened on contaminated water brought to the military bases in Iraq. I \nheld two hearings. The Pentagon denied that KBR had provided unsafe \nwater to our troops. Kellog, Brown and Root--Halliburton, rather, in \nthat case, denied it. But I asked the inspector general to investigate, \nand they confirmed it. Nonpotable water that was more contaminated than \nraw water from the Euphrates was sent to our soldiers at bases in Iraq.\n  These are two inspector general reports. Inspector General, U.S. \nDepartment of Defense. There are two of them. They tell us what has \nbeen the result of improper wiring of facilities in Iraq. ``In the \nremaining 9 cases,'' they say, talking about electrocutions, not about \nthe 230 electrical shocks--I am talking about the nine who died. ``In \nthe remaining 9 cases, we determined that individuals were killed by \nimproper grounding or faulty equipment. The equipment malfunctions \ncould have related to whether equipment maintenance complied with \nproper electrical standards, or whether the respective chain of command \nacted responsibly in protecting servicemembers. As of June 30, 2009, \nfive of those nine cases remained under criminal investigation.''\n  Until I did the hearings, these were largely unknown. Even when I did \nthe hearings, KBR insisted that it had done nothing wrong.\n  In the case of SSG Ryan Maseth, specifically, let me read from the IG \nreport:\n\n       An engineering evaluation of the failed pump [this is a \n     pump that serviced the building] determined that insulation \n     on the internal wires melted, causing a short to the metal \n     pump housing. Failure to ground the pump and improper \n     grounding of the building electrical system allowed the metal \n     pump housing and water distribution pipes in the building to \n     energize.\n\n  This says this soldier was electrocuted while taking a shower because \ncontractors didn't do their job. It is not me saying that. I had \nhearings in which people working for that contractor showed up at the \nwitness table and said: We worked next to people who didn't know what \nthey were doing, and it subjected these soldiers to great risk.\n  As I indicated previously, in the Department of Defense, for this \nwork, which we now know was shoddy work and improper work that put \nsoldiers' lives at risk, for that work, this contractor got $83 million \nin bonus awards. It is unbelievable to me that this sort of thing goes \non.\n  I think there are some in the Pentagon, in the chain of command, and \ncertainly contractors, who have a lot to answer for. This Congress \nought to insist upon it.\n  This mother of this soldier, Cheryl Harris, wasn't going to let this \ndrop. Good for her. That is why I held these hearings to determine what \nis the truth, because we didn't get the truth from the people who \ntalked to the mother of the soldier who died. In the hearings, \nwitnesses who previously worked in Iraq told us that the KBR's wiring \nwas improper. Now we get the truth from the IG report. We should not \nhave to wait for the IG to confirm these things.\n  I would think the U.S. Defense Department would search more \naggressively for the truth than anyone because it was their soldiers \nwho were put at risk. Regrettably, the Defense Department has not \npursued this with the zeal you would have hoped for. It doesn't matter \nwhether it was the sodium dichromate case, where soldiers were exposed \nto the risks of cancer because of the water brought to the bases, which \nwas more contaminated than raw water from the Euphrates. There were \nfour or five cases. The contractor said it did nothing wrong in each \ncase, and the Pentagon by and large said that KBR had done nothing \nwrong; but the inspector general said that the problems were real, and \ndocumented how the contractor had failed, and the Defense Department \nhad failed to hold the contractor accountable.\n  This Congress deserves better than that from the Defense Department, \nthe taxpayers deserve better, and a mother such as Cheryl Harris should \nnot have had to wonder whether her son was in mortal danger through the \nmere act of taking a shower.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes this afternoon \nto discuss the recent developments on the health care issue and \nparticularly with Senator Bennett on the floor, my friend and \ncolleague, and the effort to make sure health care reform is \nbipartisan. Also, Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley on the Finance \nCommittee, on which I serve, are putting in killer hours now in an \neffort to come up with a bipartisan approach in the health care area.\n  I wanted to take a few minutes and talk about a particularly \nimportant part of the health care debate, and that is what the middle \nclass is looking for in terms of health care reform. I think when you \ntalk about middle-class folks, most of whom have health care coverage, \nthey are looking for a way to be wealthier, they are looking for a way \nto be healthier, and they want to make sure that if they leave their \nhealth care coverage, or their coverage leaves them, they can get \nportable coverage.\n  Perhaps as much as anything, middle-class folks want choice. They \nunderstand--and this is a matter that Senator Bennett and I have talked \nabout often--that if you are going to come up with a health care reform \neffort that is going to save money, create incentives for people to \nstay healthy and services to offer prevention, and coverage that is \nportable, you have to give everybody the chance to choose those kinds \nof health care plans and those services.\n  The President, to his credit, has made the matter of guaranteeing \nchoice--what I have put up here on the chart--President Obama has said \nthat is one of his bedrock principles for health care reform. The \nPresident has said every American must have the freedom to choose their \nplan and their doctor. He clearly is on target when he talked about \nchoice being one of the best ways to hold health care costs down, \nreward people for staying healthy and getting coverage that is \nportable.\n  For example, every Member of Congress has the capacity to choose a \nplan that is more affordable for them. When the sign-up period comes in \nthe beginning of each year, you get a menu of various health services, \nand you want to choose the one that is the most economical for you, the \none that rewards you for staying healthy. All Members of Congress have \nthe opportunity to do that. The President is absolutely right in saying \nthat choice ought to be a bedrock principle of health care reform. \nClearly, that is what middle-class folks in Colorado, Utah, and Oregon \nare looking for; they want to make sure they have choices. Frankly, \nthey wish to have as many choices as we have in the Congress.\n  So Americans want these kinds of choices. But for too many of our \ncitizens, under the health care reform bills that are now being \nconsidered in the Congress, lots of people won't have the kinds of \nchoices that Members of Congress have, or any choice at all. There are \nproposals in the Senate to create what is known as firewalls, to keep \npeople from being able to go to what is a ``farmer's market''--they are \ncalled insurance exchanges--where people could get these kinds of \nchoices, and these exchanges are to be created in the reform \nlegislation.\n  As odd as it sounds, Congress is going to be creating these insurance \nexchanges, designed to help people shop around for their insurance, but \nthen limit who can shop at these exchanges.\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\nIf you have coverage, for example, and somebody in the government says \nyou ought to consider it affordable, you ought to like it, you are not \ngoing to be able to go to this ``farmer's market,'' this exchange, and \nshop for a plan that is better for you and your family. You aren't \ngoing to be able to enjoy more choices; you aren't going to be in a \nposition to get more for your health care dollar. You aren't going to \nbe able to get an affordable package, because only some people will be \nallowed at these exchanges.\n  I think everybody ought to be able to shop for their health care \ninsurance like Members of Congress do today, and like our esteemed \ncolleague Senator Kennedy called for in a very fine essay last week.\n  I have been able, working with colleagues, to come up with a way to \ndo that. I call it the Free Choice proposal. Our Free Choice proposal \nlets workers who like what they have keep it. But it also lets workers \nwho don't like what they have choose other plans. Half of those \nfortunate enough to have employer-sponsored insurance today don't have \nany choice of health plans at all. Think about that. Most Americans \ndon't have the capacity to choose, like we can here in the Congress.\n  Unfortunately, under the health care reform plans that are being \nconsidered in the Congress, we are still going to leave millions and \nmillions of Americans without a choice of health services and health \ncare plans. Under our Free Choice proposal, everybody who has employer \ncoverage is going to have new choices. They can certainly keep what \nthey have. But if they choose, they can take what their employer now \npays for their insurance and go to the ``farmer's market'' and buy a \nplan that is a better fit for them and their families.\n  It also gives employers more options. If the insurer isn't going to \nsell them an affordable plan, the employer could then take the whole \ngroup to the exchange and get a discount.\n  What the distinguished Senator from Utah and I have been talking \nabout these many months is something that would give more clout to \nworkers and more clout to employers on day one. It would give employers \nand workers the ability to save money at the get-go, largely through an \nold-fashioned concept that is about as American as we have, which is \nchoice and freedom, and the ability, when you shop wisely, to benefit \nfinancially and, particularly, our employer approach, where the \nemployer could take the worker to the exchange on day one and get a \ndiscount. That the employer could get a discount is one that, in my \nview, is going to give employers the bargaining power in negotiating \nwith insurers that they don't have today.\n  This is a proposal we can do without making any adjustments to the \nTax Code. The independent analysis Senator Bennett and I got a few days \nago indicates we could save consumers $360 billion over the next \ndecade. Those are savings to our people. Those are savings in the \nhealth care system. It is an approach that is very much in line with \nwhat the President has identified as a bedrock principle for health \nreform.\n  I have talked about the value of choice, particularly this August in \nColorado, North Dakota, and around the country being able to tell all \nmiddle-class people they are going to have more choices. But what I \nthink is particularly useful about the Free Choice proposal, it is one \nof the pathways to getting more affordable coverage because once you \nhave these choices, just like Members of Congress--if at the beginning \nof the year the Senator from Colorado does not like one particular \nplan, he can go to one of the other plans that is a better fit for him \nand his family. We are talking about using the same principles that \nhave worked for Members of Congress for many years.\n  I believe that middle-class folks, as they try to sort through this \ndebate, are going to be looking at a handful of fairly straightforward \nprinciples. They are going to want to be wealthier, they are going to \nwant to be healthier, they are going to want coverage they can take \nwith them from job to job.\n  We have had 7 million people laid off since this recession; 3 million \nof them do not have health care. What happens to them is they go into a \nprogram called COBRA. COBRA is the only Federal program named after a \npoisonous snake. Given how hard it is for people to afford that \ncoverage and all the bureaucracy for employers and employees, we can do \nbetter by both workers and employers. Let's make coverage seamlessly \nportable. Senator Bennett and I have included that in our Free Choice \nproposal. On day one, more choices for the middle class. On day one, \nthe opportunity to save money. If you don't like the first plan, choose \none of the other plans. On day one, coverage that is portable. That is \nwhat I think middle-class folks are looking for.\n  That kind of market competition is what the Congressional Budget \nOffice has scored as actually producing savings in the private sector, \nnot in 10 years, not in 15 years, but in a matter of 2 or 3 years. It \nactually bends the cost curve downward without exploding the debt and \nthe deficit.\n  I hope my colleagues on the Finance Committee and here in the Senate \nand on the HELP Committee--I had a very constructive conversation about \nthe Free Choice proposal with Chairman Dodd recently. I hope colleagues \nwill see this is an approach that can win bipartisan support.\n  The guarantee of choice is a bedrock principle in President Obama's \nagenda. For the middle class who is asking now how this is going to \nwork, this is the path that is going to let middle-class people be \nwealthier, healthier, and protected when they lose their job or if they \nwant to get another opportunity. I am very hopeful that this bedrock \nprinciple of President Obama's agenda for fixing health care can win \nthe support of colleagues on both sides of the aisle because I think \nthat is the pathway to responding to the question middle-class people \nare asking all over this country today: How we are going to make this \nwork for them?\n  I hope colleagues who have additional questions about it will see my \nfriend from Utah or me. We will be happy to discuss it with them \nfurther.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I know we are on the bill. As the manager \non the Republican side, I want to stay on the bill, but, my colleague \nfrom Oregon having raised the issue with respect to the consumer choice \nand our proposal, I ask unanimous consent that I can proceed as in \nmorning business in order to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am grateful to Senator Wyden for the \nleadership he showed here and the tenacity with which he has pursued \nall of these issues. As I have sat here and listened to the various \ninterventions in morning business about health care, I found the common \ntheme that I want to comment on with respect to it. I think Senator \nWyden's comments helped me frame this theme.\n  The theme I have heard over and over again from speakers has been: We \ncan't stay where we are. And then the argument has been framed: We \neither have to move ahead with the President's program or stay where we \nare. As Senator Wyden has indicated, there are other alternatives \nbesides moving ahead with the President's program and staying where we \nare.\n  I would like to draw this analogy that I hope will help us understand \nat least this Republican's position. I won't try to speak for all \nmembers of my party, although I think many of them would be sympathetic \nwith what I am about to say.\n  Let's assume your neighbor's house is on fire. This is a serious \nproblem. Your neighbor comes to you and says: My house is on fire. Lend \nme your garden hose so I can put the fire out.\n  And you say: My garden hose isn't long enough to reach the fire.\n  You don't understand, your neighbor says, my house is on fire. There \nare children in the house. There are women in the house. They will die \nif you don't put out the fire. Lend me your garden hose.\n  I respond or you respond: I understand there are children in the \nhouse. I understand allowing the house to burn down is a tremendous \nmistake. But my garden hose won't reach. We need a different garden \nhose if we are going to put out the fire.\n  No, no, no, the fire is reaching now, it is down, it has destroyed \nthe top stories, it is getting down to the bottom\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nstories; people are fleeing. Give me your garden hose or you are a \nterrible person.\n  And you respond: I will be happy to give you a garden hose that would \nwork, but the garden hose I have right now will not solve your problem.\n  We need that kind of an understanding here.\n  I am not a Republican who says: I defend the present system. I \nlistened to the speeches being made about how terrible the present \nsystem may be, and I say I agree with them absolutely. I listened to \nthe letters being read from home States that say: I was denied coverage \nby an insurance company bureaucrat. I lost my job and I lost my \ncoverage. These are tragic, and I agree they are tragic, and I agree \nsomething ought to be done about it. It is just that, in my opinion, \nthe President's garden hose will not reach. In my opinion, the \nPresident's garden hose will not only not put out the fire but, to \nstretch the analogy beyond all credulity, will make it worse. We heard \nabout people who are being denied coverage under the present system. \nPeople will be denied coverage under the President's system.\n  If we look at other countries that have adopted similar public plans \nof the kinds we are talking about, we are going to see people whose \ncoverage is denied again and again. Indeed, the comment was made about \nSenator Kennedy and the brave battle he is putting on against his \nproblem. If he lived under the single-payer coverage of other \ncountries, he would be denied coverage because of his age. We don't \nwant that in America. We don't want people like that to be denied \nopportunities.\n  Senator Wyden and I have worked as hard as we can--back to the \nanalogy--to create a garden hose that will reach, to create a garden \nhose that will, in fact, put out the fire, solve the problems, and \nchange the present system.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for making it clear that there are \nalternatives to the present system that are not necessarily the bills \nthat are coming out of the two committees.\n  I am not going to embarrass my friend from Oregon by insisting that \nhe take the same position I take with respect to the bills that are \ncoming out of the two committees, but together we have formed a \nsolution that we think will solve the problem, we think will put out \nthe fire, we think will turn down the cost curve. And we have now a \ngrowing chorus of voices of people who are saying: You know, Wyden-\nBennett looks as if it will work; why don't we try it.\n  The only question I am asking here is, Why don't we try it? So far, \nneither committee has been willing to look at the details of what we \nare talking about. All we are asking is that they do so because we are \nconvinced that when they do, they will come to the conclusion that our \ngarden hose will, in fact, put out the fire and it will do it more \ncheaply and more efficiently than the proposals that are before us.\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his \nleadership and his tenacity in going forward with this proposal. I am \nhonored to be associated with him in this effort. I agree with all of \nthe speeches that have been made that the present system is not \nacceptable. I hope we can get together and solve the problem in a truly \neffective and bipartisan fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to take an additional minute. I \nthank my friend from Utah.\n  What is striking about this debate is the opportunity to bring both \nsides together. As I outlined the Free Choice approach and the pathway \nto savings for middle-class folks--portable coverage, incentives for \nprevention--it could work its way into a variety of different bills \nthat are being considered. Obviously, Senator Bennett and I feel very \nstrongly about our legislation, the Healthy Americans Act, but I was \nvery pleased with the discussion I had the other night over dinner with \nthe distinguished Senator from Connecticut, the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, who has some good ideas as well.\n  What I hope we will do, what Senator Bennett and I have sought to do \nlo these many months, is focus on some bedrock principles. I cited the \nthree that have been important to President Obama: the question of \nholding down costs, ensuring choice, maintaining quality.\n  I believe--Senator Bennett and I have worked together on this--that \nour approach with Free Choice in particular making sure we don't have \nall these firewalls that would prevent choice for millions of Americans \nwould--would actually reward Americans for shopping wisely.\n  I was very glad that both Chairman Baucus, who said he would look at \nour Free Choice proposal, and Chairman Dodd, the same openness at \nlooking at our proposal, captured that this would be a way to carry out \nthe President's agenda for addressing the questions middle-class people \nare talking about all over the country.\n  Obviously, Senator Bennett and I--and I am very pleased the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware has joined us. He is certainly a \nveteran of the Senate and what it takes to come up with bipartisan \ncoalitions. I am very pleased to be on the floor with two good friends \nwho know a lot about health care and what it takes to build bipartisan \ncoalitions.\n  What I wanted to do was to say that in addition to our legislation, \nwhich we obviously feel strongly about, this concept of Free Choice and \nmaking sure you reward individuals, as we do in so many areas of \nAmerican life, could really pay off quickly for middle-class people in \nterms of savings and access to quality health care.\n  I am very hopeful that as we go into these last couple of weeks \nbefore the recess--and we have offered this proposal to Chairman \nBaucus, the chairman of the committee on which I serve--Democrats and \nRepublicans can come together so that before the August recess, we will \nhave at a minimum identified some ideas.\n  Our Free Choice proposal is just one that will allow us through the \nmonth of August to show middle-class people that we are serious about \ntheir concerns.\n  Right now they are trying to sort this debate out. Suffice it to say, \nthey see a lot of arguing in Washington, DC. They hear a lot of the \ndiscussion about health care, which almost sounds like gibberish when \nyou listen to all the technical lingo. If we can come back with ideas \nsuch as Free Choice and say: Look, middle-class people, you and your \nfamily can be part of a system that is very similar to what my family \nenjoys--and it has paid off for my family at the beginning of the year \nwhen I was choosing a plan that is more economical for me, or rewards \nprevention--then we get behind proposals that bring Democrats and \nRepublicans together. I point out this is one area that the budget \noffice has indicated will actually score substantial savings--not in \n10, 12, 14 years from now, but in the second year after it is fully \nimplemented.\n  I thank my colleague from Utah for all his support and counsel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Bennett and I are similar to the \nMaytag repairman in the old commercials, waiting for someone to come \nand offer amendments. Many have been filed. No one, apparently, has \ncome to the floor to offer amendments.\n  I would not be surprised if at some point down the road someone will \nsay: Well, we did not get enough chance or opportunity to offer \namendments. Of course, in these intervening hours, there has been \nplenty of opportunity for someone to show up to offer amendments.\n  We had intended and hoped to have a vote at 4:30 on a relatively \nnoncontroversial amendment. But for the last hour or so, we have been \nwaiting, on a noncontroversial amendment, for a staff person to contact \nthe Senator who is apparently not able to be contacted to tell us \nwhether the Senate can vote on a noncontroversial amendment.\n  Such is the life of the Senate, a place where no one has ever been \naccused of\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\nspeeding. We only ask, having been here now yesterday and today, \nSenator Bennett and I only ask, having put together this bill that \nfunds all of our energy and water issues, if there are Senators who \nwish to offer amendments--and many have been filed--they would come \nhere and decide to offer them because we will not have floor time for \nthe entire week this week. We are not going to be able to be on the \nfloor. The time does not exist to allow us to be here all week.\n  Those Senators who wish to offer amendments are, it seems to me, \ngoing to find very little sympathy from me, and I hope from other \nMembers of the Senate, if they at some point down the road say: Well, \nwe did not have an opportunity. They have had plenty of opportunities. \nIt is they have chosen not to come to the floor to offer amendments.\n  It may be they feel the amendments do not have merit or are not very \nimportant or whatever. But if they do have merit and are important--I \nassume some do--I would hope they would come soon and give us the \nopportunity to entertain amendments and discuss them, debate them and \nhave votes on them so we can move this appropriations bill along.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would let the distinguished floor manager and the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah know that if someone does come to the \nfloor and wishes to do their thing with an amendment, please feel free \nto give me the high sign and I will conclude my remarks and allow the \nbusiness of the floor to proceed. I do not wish to keep anybody from \noffering an amendment, if they have one.\n  But I did wish to take the time to talk for a minute about our health \ncare system because I think people across the country are, right now, \nfinding our dialogue in the Senate a bit confusing about health care, \nand they are starting to wonder what is going on. In particular, \nparticularly for those who have insurance: What does this mean for me? \nWhy is this important for me that the Senate be doing this work? I \nalready have insurance. What do I stand to gain from all this?\n  There are a great number of things Americans stand to gain from all \nthis. But the issue I wish to focus on today is improvements in our \ndelivery system. It is important for Americans who are listening to \nrealize that the personal experiences so many of them have had are not \nunique. If you have had a loved one in the hospital and you have felt \nconstrained to stay with that loved one through their illness in the \nhospital, if you have felt you could not leave them alone in that \nhospital for fear that something might go wrong, some drug might be \nmisadministered, some call might go unanswered, if you feel that way, \nif you have had that experience, you are not alone.\n  That is an extraordinarily common experience. If you have felt you \nmissed an opportunity for the prevention of illness, nobody told you \nthat you should have had this test, nobody told you this was a health \nconsequence of something you were doing, that is an experience \nAmericans have across this country.\n  If you have had to ferry by hand your health records from place to \nplace or if, similar to many Rhode Islanders, you have been rushed up \nfor emergency specialty care in Boston and your paper records did not \ncome with you and you have been in real peril in a Boston emergency \nroom as they try to redo the tests they did not have access to because \nyou did not have a comprehensive electronic health record, you are \nsimilar to many Americans.\n  The consequences of that, of those problems, are renown throughout \nthe health care system. The problems they cause are real ones. There \nare 100,000 Americans who die, who lose their lives every single year \nbecause of completely avoidable medical errors, most of them hospital-\nacquired infections. That is intolerable. That is a plane crash a day. \nYet it is the status quo in the existing health care system.\n  We have the worst health care outcomes of essentially any civilized \ndeveloped country we compete with. The worst. Even though we pay twice \nas much per person for our health care than most of them, we have worse \noutcomes. That is the status quo of our health care system. The \nEconomist magazine has reported that the health information technology \ninfrastructure that supports our health care sector is the worst of any \nAmerican industry, except one, the mining industry.\n  That is not very reassuring, not in an industry where the \npossibilities for technology are so great, and where at the detection \nend and where at the treatment end, we are at the technological cutting \nedge of the world, but you get back to that back office and there you \nare with that paper record and no way to cross-reference for drug \ninteractions.\n  We are at a primitive stage with our health information \ninfrastructure. That is the status quo of our health care system. \nEverybody, I suspect, has had the experience themselves or of a loved \none who becomes sick unexpectedly who turns to their insurance company, \nthe insurance company they have been writing those big checks to year \nafter year, only to find out that when you turned to that insurance \ncompany in your hour of need, they turned on you, they turned against \nyou.\n  They tried to figure out a way to get you off coverage. They tried to \ntalk you out of the coverage and the treatment your doctor has \nindicated. They fought with your doctor about whether they would pay \nit. For many people, the experience is not just of being the patient, \nthe experience of being the spouse or the family member or the loved \none of the patient who has to cope, who has to become the person who \nanswers the deluges of mail, who makes the call after call after call, \nwho waits through dial tones and through the voice mail and the voice \nmessages to try to get to somebody to approve procedures the doctor has \nsaid you need. That is the status quo of our health care system--\nmillions of Americans told by their own insurance companies: Forget it. \nWe are not going to pay for the treatment your doctor says you need.\n  The major reason American families go into bankruptcy right now is \nbecause of health care expense. It is not just the uninsured. These are \ninsured families who find their coverage limits have been reached, who \nfind the insurance company has found a loophole, who find they have \nexceeded, in terms of all the peripheral costs of durable medical \nequipment and other things that might not be covered, but it is more \nthan they can bear to get by and they are struggling to get by and they \nare dropped into bankruptcy; the most prominent reason American \nfamilies go into bankruptcy.\n  That is the status quo of our health care system. Those can all be \nbetter. We can revolutionize all those areas. We can revolutionize the \nquality of care and the safety of Americans when they are in the \nhospital.\n  We can improve our health care outcomes so we are the pride of \ndeveloping nations, and not the lagger. We can improve so we do not \nhave the worst health information technology of any American sector. We \ncan eliminate denials of care by insurers for preexisting conditions. \nWe can provide adequate supports to Americans so bankruptcy is not a \ncommon symptom of illness in this country.\n  The problem is, if we do not do anything about those existing \nproblems, they are all going to accelerate. They are all getting worse. \nWhat do we have to look forward to? Well, we have to look forward to a \n$35 trillion Medicare liability, and we do not have $35 trillion to \nspend.\n  That is a future liability. It is coming toward us. The people who \nare going to cause it are alive right now. They are not going anywhere. \nThey are getting older every day. Time is not going to stop. And they \nare getting sicker every day because it is never going to happen that \nolder people are healthier than younger people.\n  There is a tsunami of health care costs bearing down on us. Just the \nMedicare slice of it is a $35 trillion liability for our country, and \nwe do not have the $35 trillion. So it is either going to wreck us or \nwe are going to have to take some very smart, very aggressive measures \nnow to reduce those costs.\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\n  If we do nothing, a family in Rhode Island in the year 2016--that is \nnot too far from now; that is 7 years from now--a family in Rhode \nIsland making $52,000, which is a pretty good income, a family making \n$52,000 will spend more than half their income on health care. By as \nsoon as 2016, a Rhode Island family making $52,000 will spend more than \nhalf their income on health care.\n  We use the word ``unsustainable'' around here. We are headed to where \nit is impossible for regular families to get health care. It is bad \nenough now, and it is getting worse. We have to act to stop it from \ngetting worse.\n  We have pretty close to lost our car industry. People used to say: \nWhat is good for GM is good for America. It was the emblematic American \ncompany. It is gone. It is in bankruptcy, and it is gone. It is now \ncoming back out of bankruptcy, but it had to be swept through a \nbankruptcy. The catastrophic effect on our country of the loss of those \njobs in the Midwest and then through the secondary providers across the \ncountry is a very real problem, and it is being felt in large part \nbecause those cars were so burdened with health care costs.\n  If you go to Starbucks, there is more health care money in your \ncoffee than there is coffee bean money. In those cars, there was more \nhealth care money than steel. The cost of health care per car was \ngreater than the cost of steel per car. It is pretty hard to compete \nwith Volvos and the Lexus and cars from places where they have a \nnational health care system and the price of the health care is not \nburied in the cost of the car. It put our workers at a terrible \ndisadvantage. That is only getting worse, and our manufacturing sector \nhas enough problems without continuing to load health care costs on to \nit. If we can't get the message from the collapse of the auto industry, \nwe are missing some very loud--indeed deafening--signals.\n  Our last Comptroller General warned that this health care mess will \nsink our ship of state. He phrases it as a national security issue to \nget this right. He left the job to go and spread the word around the \ncountry warning us of what is coming.\n  Not only is it bad now, it stands to get a lot worse. Here is the \nopportunity and the tragedy of this: It is that so much of this is \nwaste. One recent voice on this subject is a former Cabinet member from \nthe last administration. Paul O'Neill was the Secretary of the Treasury \nof the United States. He is no fool. He is a sensible and thoughtful \nman. He ran, for years, Alcoa, one of America's biggest corporations. \nHe has extreme business experience. He also ran something called the \nPittsburgh Regional Health Initiative which looked at improving the \nquality of care of hospitals in the Pittsburgh area. He was a leader in \nall of this. He knows his health care issues well. Here is what he \nwrote recently: There is $1 trillion of annual waste in the health care \nsystem that is associated with process failures. A trillion dollars a \nyear--even by Washington standards that is a big number. That is a \ntarget that is worth shooting for. That is a target that we shoot for \nhard in the legislation we are putting forward.\n  If we take a look at the President's own Council of Economic Advisers \nrecent report, on July 9, a few weeks ago, they put out the report on \nthe economic case for health care reform. They looked at the health \ncare system from two measures: one, if you compare to it foreign \ncountries and look at their gross domestic product share and \nextrapolate from that, what we could get our costs down to if we were \nsensible and thoughtful and didn't have such a wasteful health care \nsystem and, second, to look at the variation among the States, from \nState to State, from region to region, even as the recent article by \nAtul Gawande said, the differences within a State, between McAllen, TX \nand El Paso, TX.\n  If you look at those, that gives you another means of calculating \nwhat you could get the costs down to. If you could get the waste out of \nthe system, efficiency improvements in the U.S. health care system \npotentially could free up resources equal to 5 percent of U.S. GDP. \nFrom the Council of Economic Advisers, that is over $700 billion a \nyear. Maybe it is a trillion, maybe it is $700 billion. Per year that \nis a big number.\n  Looking at the internal discrepancies, they note:\n\n       [It] should be possible to cut total health expenditures by \n     about 30 percent without worsening outcomes [which] would \n     again suggest that savings on the order of 5 percent of GDP \n     could be feasible.\n\n  Again looking at the calculation two separate ways, coming to the \nsame number, $700 billion a year. The problem is, it will take some \nexecutive administration to get there. It is not easy. You don't just \nmake your decision, flip up or down the light switch, it goes on, and \nyou don't have to worry about it. This isn't like the sniper who lines \nup his shot, pulls the trigger, and the projectile goes. This is a \nproblem where you are like the pilot landing in rough weather. You have \nto continue to steer through it. You have to continue to seek the \nsavings. As the market adapts, you have to adapt with it. It takes \nexecutive leadership and administration to make this happen. That means \nthe Congressional Budget Office can't score it. All they can say is \nthat it promises a ``large reduction'' in American health care costs. \nBut they can't score it.\n  So the American public, with a lot of misinformation out there, has \nbeen beguiled into believing that what we are doing won't save money. \nWe are determined to save money doing it. The Medicare system and the \nAmerican health care system and the American economy will fail if we \ndon't save money doing this. The target is as big as $700 billion to $1 \ntrillion a year.\n  Our health care system has been described memorably as a ``carnival \nof waste.'' It is time to bring the carnival to an end and give \nAmericans the health care they deserve.\n  There are a couple of pretty sensible ways to do this. The \nadministration has focused on all of them. The first is, as I said \nearlier, health information infrastructure. Why should every American \nnot have an electronic health record? Why, when you go to McDonald's, \nshould the checkout person have a more robust health information \ninfrastructure backing them up and connecting to inventory and \nconnecting to sales than your doctor does? It makes no sense. We could \nsave enormous sums if we had a national health information \ninfrastructure--secure, confidential, reliable, interoperable. So if \nyou went to get a lab test, it went into your record. If you went to \nthe emergency room, it went into your record. If you stayed at the \nhospital, it went into your record. If you saw a specialist, it went \ninto your record. All of your practitioners would know what was going \non in your care. The more complex and chronic your conditions, the more \nvaluable that would be. We don't have that now. It is the worst of any \nAmerican industry except the mining industry.\n  Quality improvement: In Michigan, there was a fascinating project, \ncalled the Keystone Project, where they went into the intensive care \nunits in Michigan--not all of them but a great number of them--with \nprocess reforms in the intensive care units to reduce respiratory \nproblems from not being elevated, to reduce line infections from \ncatheters and from blood lines. The effect of that was, in 15 months, \nto save 1,500 lives and $150 million just in one State and not even all \nthe intensive care units. It proves the proposition that quality \nimprovement can save money and lives.\n  Prevention is obviously the same. We will be on the floor shortly to \ndebate Judge Sotomayor's nomination. She has lived with diabetes since \nshe was a child. She has taken good care of herself so she had not \ncreated a lot of cost for the health system, but many people who don't \nmanage their disease well, who don't get the prevention they need, end \nup with amputations, blindness, long and unnecessary hospital stays. \nThere are areas where, by investing in prevention, we can save \nfortunes.\n  Why don't we do this then? Why don't we have electronic health \nrecords on every doctor's desk for all Americans? Why don't we have \nevery intensive care unit participating in a Keystone-type quality \ninitiative? Why doesn't every community health center have a robust \ndiabetes prevention program? It has to do with the bizarre economics of \nour health care system. Because the same thing is true for all three \nentities. If you are a doctor and you want to put electronic health \nrecord systems in for your patients, if\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\nyou are a hospital and you want to improve the quality of care in your \nintensive care unit and put in a program that will do that, if you are \na community health center that wants to invest in prevention to help \nthe diabetic population stay healthy, you face the exact same \npredicament: The investment you have to make is 100 percent out of your \npocket. The risk of the investment is 100 percent on your neck. The \nadministrative burden is 100 percent on you. The hassle of it is 100 \npercent yours. All of the costs are on the desk of the doctor, on the \ndesk of the hospital administrator, on the desk of the community health \ncenter. But the benefits from the electronic health record, the \nbenefits and the savings from the quality improvement, the savings and \nthe benefits from the prevention don't find their way back to that same \ndesk. They go off to Medicare. They go off to the insurance industry. \nThey connect to the patient in better care, but investment doesn't get \nthe reward.\n\n  The basic principle of American capitalism, which is the connection \nbetween risk and reward, has been broken in the American health care \nsystem. That is one of the things we get after in this bill. We could \nhave electronic health records for every American, our hospitals and \ndoctors highly motivated to pursue all the quality initiatives that \nwill improve the quality of our care while it lowers the cost and \navoids unnecessary hospitalizations and delays and infections, and so \nforth, and we could have the best prevention program in the country, \nbut we have to make it work for people. That is part of what we are \nabout in this health care reform.\n  I will continue to explain why it is important that we reform our \nhealth care system and what the average American will gain from it. \nToday I focused on the elements of why delivery system reform can be \nimproved. But every American will see that in their lives, their \nparents' lives, and in their children's lives. When we look back to \nwhere we are today from where we can be and where, with President \nObama's leadership, we will be, we will look back and ask: My God, how \ncould we have been living that medieval setup? Look how good it is now.\n  That is our goal. That is our purpose. That is the promise of health \ncare reform.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1841\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, since there is no further debate on \namendment No. 1841, I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1841.\n  The amendment (No. 1841) was agreed to.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is an important bill, the Energy and \nWater appropriations bill. It is one of the 12 or 13 appropriations \nbills we have during the course of the year to prepare for spending in \nour new fiscal year, which starts October 1. Senator Dorgan and Senator \nBennett are shepherding this bill on the floor.\n  Meanwhile, in another room, not far from here, at least six \nSenators--maybe more--are meeting trying to work out the details of a \npiece of legislation that could literally affect every person living in \nAmerica. It is the question of health care reform. It is an interesting \nissue because it has been tried before. Previous Presidents--Theodore \nRoosevelt; Harry Truman; certainly, Bill Clinton--have tried their best \nto change the health care system in America to make it a system that is \nstable, secure, so people know what it will cost, what it will cover, \nand know, ultimately, they can have quality care available when they \nneed it for themselves or their family.\n  The simple fact is, in America health care has become extremely \nexpensive. We spend more per person in America--twice as much per \nperson--as the nearest nation on Earth. So we are spending a lot of \nmoney. And people see it, because the cost of health insurance premiums \nis going up much faster than their income, and they worry about it.\n  Many of the folks whom I talk to back in Illinois worry whether next \nyear there will be an increase in their hourly wage that will be \ncompletely consumed by increases in health insurance premiums. And they \nadd, incidentally: Senator, that new health insurance plan is not an \nadd-on. It usually covers less than the one before--the situation where \npreexisting conditions will eliminate coverage for things that are \ncritically important for individuals; where folks find when they reach \na certain age the cost of the health insurance premiums goes up so \nhigh.\n  There are battles that go on between doctors and hospitals and \ninsurance companies about whether they will actually cover something--\ncases we have seen in Illinois and around the country, where folks \nthought they had some insurance and guarantee that health insurance \ncovered their medical procedure only to find later it did not.\n  Many people who are out of work today are realizing for the first \ntime in their lives they do not have the protection of health \ninsurance. Some of them, with limited savings, battered by the recent \nstock market, wonder if tomorrow's accident or diagnosis will wipe out \neverything they have ever saved. That is the reality of the uncertainty \nand instability of our health care system today. People are looking for \nstable coverage they can count on; if they get sick today, that they \nwill be covered tomorrow. They can look, as well, for the kind of \nstable costs they can afford--even when they have lost a job--to make \nsure there is health insurance to protect their families. And they want \nto preserve their right to choose their doctor and hospital to give \nthem the best care in this country.\n  The obvious question is, can we reach that goal? And the obvious \nanswer is, only with the political will of this Senate, with \nRepublicans working with Democrats. I hope we can do this. I hope we \ncan find a bipartisan way to this solution.\n  President Obama has made it clear it is his highest priority--to \nimprove health care for America and its citizens, and it is his highest \npriority when it comes to our deficit. A lot of people say: Well, if \nyou are going to spend a trillion dollars on health care reform, think \ntwice. Well, we should think twice because we are facing deficits and a \nnational debt that has grown dramatically over the last 7 or 8 years.\n  But the fact is, untouched, our health care system over the next 10 \nyears will cost us more than $30 trillion. If spending a half a \ntrillion dollars over that period of time can change the system for the \nbetter, start bringing in practices that bring down overall costs, it \nis money well invested and money well spent.\n  First, we have to try to wring out of the system the fraud that goes \non. All of us know what is happening here. There are some health care \nproviders in America who are capitalizing on a system that rewards \ndoctors and hospitals for piling on the procedures, for piling on the \nexpensive pharmaceuticals and medical devices. There is little or no \nreward for good health outcomes. The reward for a physician and someone \nwho is using our system today is to do more, spend more. Well, that \nshould not be our goal. Our goal should be quality health care for \neveryone. It should not be a system of fee for service that rewards and \nincentivizes spending that does not result in good health care.\n  There are a lot of people who have come to the Senate in committee \nand otherwise to express their opinions about what will work and what \nwill not. The Congressional Budget Office has been called on from time \nto time to\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\nask whether these health care reform bills will actually save money. \nTestimony about the status quo is obvious. If we continue the way we \nare going, it is going to be a bad outcome. We know if we do not change \nthis current system, it will become so expensive the average family \nwill not be able to afford to pay the premiums. If we do not change the \nabuses in health insurance, we are all vulnerable to preexisting \nconditions and new costs and discrimination against people based on \ntheir gender, where they live. That has to change.\n  We know there are ways to save money within our system. One of them \nrelates to preventive care, wellness strategies. There is not enough of \nthat today. A man by the name of Steve Burd is the CEO of Dominicks and \nSafeway, and he has a program for his management employees where he \ncreates a financial incentive for them to take care of themselves and \nto get healthier. It is voluntary for those who want to participate. \nThey come forward. They get examined. If they find they are overweight, \nthey set a goal to reduce their weight. If they find their cholesterol \nis too high, they set a goal to reduce their cholesterol; the same \nthing with blood pressure, and the management of diabetes.\n  If they meet these goals, if they show they are changing their \nlifestyles--they quit smoking; they are getting healthier--they get a \nfinancial reward. For the business, the reward is lower health care \npremiums.\n\n  We need to have wellness strategies in America. Some of the problems \nwe are facing are problems that will cost us dramatically in years to \ncome. The incidence of diabetes among our children today is alarming. \nIf it does not stop, if we will not deal with the issues of obesity and \ndiabetes and other related issues, believe me, we cannot enact enough \nlaws and put enough money into a health care system that does not deal \nwith this.\n  We also have to realize the health records and medical records need \nto be put on computers so they can be exchanged between health care \nproviders. These electronic records can reduce the number of mistakes \nthat are made, improve the care that is given to individuals, and save \nus money.\n  We also need to take a look at chronic diseases--I mentioned \ndiabetes--and make certain there is an incentive there for wellness and \nfor preventive care before people reach terrible stages in that disease \nthat costs dearly and can be compromising to their health and maybe \neven their life.\n  So if we can come together with a system of health care that provides \nstable coverage that you can count on, stable costs that you can \nafford, and quality that strives for excellence, and the kind of choice \nevery American family wants, then the outcome of the meeting, not far \nfrom here, of these Senators will be one that America can cheer.\n  Fortunately, the President has invested his political capital in this \neffort. He has told all of us this is the most important single thing \nhe is working on and wants to achieve. He is prepared to spend his \ntime, obviously, and his political capital to achieve it. It is our job \nas elected officials to respond to this national need. For many of us \nthis may be a once in a political lifetime opportunity to change health \ncare in America for the better.\n  It is the job of those in government to consider its budgetary \nimpact. But some of them are not charged with coming up with a \nsolution. We have to look beyond the budget in some respects to the \nlong-term benefit. The President has said we are going to pay for \neverything we do. But the long-term benefit, for example, of preventive \ncare may be difficult to measure today. We know it is going to be an \nultimate benefit to our country. Most of the savings in health care may \nnot be reflected in the Federal budget. The savings will accrue to the \npeople of this Nation, though, to give them the peace of mind they have \nhealth care they can count on that will be there when their family \ndesperately needs it.\n  We have to make certain this is part of our charge here, and this is \nthe time to do it. I hope the Senate Finance Committee, before we leave \nin about 10 days or 11 days, can produce a bill. And I hope the House \nof Representatives can pass one, and then, when we return, we will come \nto the floor of the Senate and work together in a bipartisan fashion to \npass it. I am certain it will require compromise by all of us. I have \nmy idea of what health care reform should look like, and I am sure \nothers do as well. But in the spirit of good faith, we can come \ntogether and make a difference and provide the kind of health care \nreform and changes that will give people peace of mind across America--\na stable and secure health care system that continues to make this \ngreat Nation on Earth a nation of healthy individuals and families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask my distinguished friend if he \nwould yield for a minute to call up an amendment?\n  Mr. INOUYE.

I appreciate it \nvery much.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inouye and Mr. Akaka are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1814\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be set aside to call up amendment No. 1814 which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1814 to amendment No. 1813.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to carry out any project or \n site-specific location identified in the committee report unless the \n  project is specifically authorized or to carry out an unauthorized \n                             appropriation)\n\n       On page 68, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) None of the funds appropriated under this Act \n     may be used to carry out--\n       (1) any project or site-specific location identified in the \n     committee report accompanying this Act unless the project is \n     specifically authorized; or\n       (2) an unauthorized appropriation.\n       (b)(1) In this section, the term ``unauthorized \n     appropriation'' means a ``congressionally directed spending \n     item'' (as defined in rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate)--\n       (A) that is not specifically authorized by law or Treaty \n     stipulation (unless the appropriation has been specifically \n     authorized by an Act or resolution previously passed by the \n     Senate during the same session or proposed in pursuance of an \n     estimate submitted in accordance with law); or\n       (B) the amount of which exceeds the amount specifically \n     authorized by law or Treaty stipulation (or specifically \n     authorized by an Act or resolution previously passed by the \n     Senate during the same session or proposed in pursuance of an \n     estimate submitted in accordance with law) to be \n     appropriated.\n       (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), an appropriation is not \n     specifically authorized if the appropriation is restricted or \n     directed to, or authorized to be obligated or expended for \n     the benefit of, an identifiable person, program, project, \n     entity, or jurisdiction by earmarking or other specification, \n     whether by name or description, in a manner that is so \n     restricted, directed, or authorized that the appropriation \n     applies only to a single identifiable person, program, \n     project, entity, or jurisdiction, unless the identifiable \n     person, program, project, entity, or jurisdiction to which \n     the restriction, direction, or authorization applies is \n     described or otherwise clearly identified in a law or Treaty \n     stipulation (or an Act or resolution previously passed by the \n     Senate during the same session or in the estimate submitted \n     in accordance with law) that specifically provides for the \n     restriction, direction, or authorization of appropriation for \n     the person, program, project, entity, or jurisdiction.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It would \nprohibit funds from being spent on any of the hundreds of earmarks \nlisted in the committee report that accompanies this bill--I emphasize, \nthat are listed in the committee report, not part of the basic \nlegislation. It would prohibit those funds from being spent on any of \nthe hundreds of earmarks unless that project is specifically \nauthorized.\n  As we all know, committee reports do not have the force of law. They \nare meant to serve as explanatory statements for what can often be \ncomplicated legislative bill text. Unfortunately, around here \nAppropriations Committee reports now are treated as\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\nif they were law and are routinely loaded up with millions, if not \nbillions, of dollars in unrequested, unauthorized, unnecessary, \nwasteful earmarks.\n  When Congress establishes its funding priorities, it should do so \ndecisively, without cause for subjective interpretation or reference to \nmaterial outside the bill passed by Congress and signed into law by the \nPresident. These funding priorities should have the binding force of \nlaw subject only to the President's veto power. Yet here we are again, \nwith a committee report that contains 622 ``congressionally directed \nspending items''--that is a great name: congressionally directed \nspending items--totaling over $985 million. None of these projects were \nrequested by the administration. Many of them were not authorized or \ncompetitively bid in any way. No hearing was held to judge whether \nthese were national priorities worthy of scarce taxpayer dollars, and \nthey are in the bill for one reason and one reason only: because of the \nself-serving prerogatives of a few select Members of the Senate, almost \nall of whom serve on the Appropriations Committee. Sadly, these Members \nchose to serve their own interests over those of the American taxpayer.\n  Earlier this year, in response to criticism about the number of \nearmarks in the Omnibus appropriations bill, one of the Senators stood \non the floor and proclaimed:\n\n       Let me say this to all the chattering class that so much \n     focuses on those little, tiny, yes, porky amendments: The \n     American people don't really care.\n\n  If the American people don't really care, then on behalf of the \nAmerican people, I suggest we remove some of the ``little, tiny, \nporky'' items that are listed in this report. Here are just a few:\n  There is $1 million for the Bayview Gas to Energy Project in Utah. My \ncolleagues and people who pay attention to these processes will know \nthat almost every one of these projects has a location. Again, usually \nthey are located in the home State of a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee. So $1 million for the Bayview Gas to Energy Project in Utah. \nI have never heard of the Bayview Gas to Energy Project. I have never \nheard a thing about it. I have never read about it. I am sure that \nmaybe it is known in Utah, but I have no way of knowing whether it is a \nworthwhile project or not. The most important thing: Are there other \ngas to energy projects in other parts of the country? Maybe so. Maybe \nnot. These are earmarked.\n  We have $500,000 for the Ben Franklin Technology Partners in \nPennsylvania--the Ben Franklin Technology Partners in Pennsylvania. \nFrom the reading of that, I have not a clue, nor would anyone else \nknow, what the Ben Franklin Technology Partners is all about.\n  We have $600,000 for biodiesel blending in Wisconsin; $1 million for \nthe Black Hills State Heating and Cooling Plant in South Dakota; \n$250,000 for a gas heat pump cooperative training program in Nevada; \n$1.5 million for the genetic improvement of switchgrass, not in South \nCarolina but in Rhode Island; $1 million for a high-speed wind turbine \nnoise model with suppression in Mississippi; $5 million for an offshore \nwind initiative in Maine; $2 million for the Algae Biofuels Research in \nWashington; $750,000 for the Algae to Ethanol Research and Evaluation \nin New Jersey; $1.2 million for the Alternative Energy School of the \nFuture in Nevada--the Alternative Energy School of the Future. We have \n$6 million for the Hawaii Energy Sustainability Program, Hawaii; $6 \nmillion for the Hawaii Renewable Energy Development Venture, Hawaii; \n$2.25 million for the Montana Bioenergy Center of Excellence, Montana; \n$10 million for the Sustainable Energy Research Center in Mississippi.\n  My colleagues may get a little thread that runs through this: \nMississippi, Nevada, South Dakota, Utah, et cetera--it goes on and on.\n  We have $10 million for the Sustainable Energy Research Center, \nMississippi; $450,000 for the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation in \nVermont; $1.2 million for the Hydrogen Fuel Dispensing Station, West \nVirginia; $1.25 million for the Long Term Environmental and Economic \nImpacts of the Development of a Coal Liquefaction Sector in China, West \nVirginia; $1 million for the Alaska Climate Center, Alaska; $5 million \nfor the Computing Capability, North Dakota; $1 million for the \nPerformance Assessment Institute in Nevada; $1 million for the New \nSchool Green Building in New York.\n  It goes on and on. There are 22 pages worth, and my colleagues might \nbe interested at some of the innovative names and may be interested in \ntrying to find out what those projects are. You won't find an \nexplanation in the report.\n  So let me be clear on one point. I don't question the merits of these \nprojects. There is no way to find out what the merits are. Many of them \nmay be very worthy of Federal funds. If that is the case, one should \nwonder, if they are national priorities in desperate need of scarce \nFederal funds, why they haven't been authorized by a congressional \ncommittee. Why haven't we had a single hearing to talk about the \ndesperate need for a hydrogen fuel dispensing station in West Virginia? \nIf genetically improved switchgrass was such an imperative at this time \nof economic crisis, why was the funding not requested by the \nadministration?\n  I just wish to point out again, contrary to popular belief, contrary \nto what members of the Appropriations Committee will continue to tell \nus, earmarking funds in an appropriations bill is not the way the \nCongress has operated historically.\n  It is similar to any other evil--it has grown, grown, and grown \nlarger every time, just about. After various scandals, it has leveled \noff or decreased some, but after the scandal dies down, the earmarks \nreturn. Yes, 9,000 of them were in the Omnibus appropriations bill and, \nof course, the stimulus package as well.\n  So there was a time when earmarks were nonexistent, or at least very \nrare. Guess what. We didn't have $1.8 trillion worth of deficit for the \nyear. I am proud to have served in the House with a man by the name of \nCongressman William Natcher, chairman of the House Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services. He prevented \nearmarks in his committee. I am sorry there are not more William \nNatchers still in the Congress of the United States.\n  Citizens Against Government Waste has tracked the growth of earmarks \nsince 1991. According to Citizens Against Government Waste, in 1991, \nthere were 546 earmarks, totaling $3.1 billion. In 2008, there were \n11,106 earmarks, totaling $17.2 billion. That is an increase of 337 \npercent in 17 years.\n  Obviously, it is not pleasant for my colleagues from the \nAppropriations Committee, and it is not particularly pleasant for some \nof my other colleagues, for me to come down here to, day after day, \nyear after year, fight against these earmarks and porkbarrel projects. \nThe fact is, they have bred corruption. It wasn't inadequate disclosure \nrequirements that led Duke Cunningham to violate his oath of office and \ntake $2.5 million in bribes in exchange for doling out $70 million to \n$80 million of taxpayers' funds to a defense contractor. It was his \nability to freely earmark taxpayer funds without question.\n  So here we are with a $1.8 trillion deficit and 22 pages of earmarks, \nmost of which have a State earmark next to them so there is no \ncompetition, there is no revealing of the details of the project and, \nmeanwhile, we have places being raided by the FBI around the country \ndue to the allegations that criminal activity has taken place, which \ncan be traced back to this earmark porkbarreling process.\n  I don't expect to win this vote, but I intend to keep up this fight \nuntil such time as the American people rise and demand that we exercise \nsome kind of fiscal discipline. I will tell my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee the reason why I think the chances are better \nand better, because they are having trouble staying in their homes, \neducating their kids, and the unemployment rate is now 9.5 percent and \npredicted to go higher.\n  The present President of the United States campaigned and said he \nwould change the culture in Washington. One of my deep disappointments \nis that the President has not fulfilled his commitment to go line by \nline, item by item, in every appropriations bill and not allow this \nporkbarreling earmark practice to continue. The American people will \nnot stand for it forever.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Senator Dorgan is temporarily away.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, do we have the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the moment, no.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am sure there will be a sufficient second when Senator \nDorgan has returned.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the statement \nby Senator McCain. I rise with some responses to the comments he has \nmade, which I hope will clarify the situation. Senator McCain, the \nranking member on the Armed Services Committee, serves with great \ndistinction and has helped manage that bill on the floor. In the \nDefense authorization bill, which he helped manage, there are specific \nauthorizations for every defense program, and there is a Defense \nauthorization bill that passes every year.\n  If, indeed, we had a similar situation with respect to those items \nunder the jurisdiction of this appropriations bill, I would be more \nsupportive of the position Senator McCain has taken with respect to the \nprovisions of the bill. However, this is not a defense bill and not \nevery department authorizes, each and every year, the same way the \nDepartment of Defense does.\n  Indeed, this is not the way Congress intended the Department of \nEnergy to operate. When the Department of Energy was organized in 1977, \nmaking it one of the more recent departments, its organic statute \nprovided broad authorities to support a diverse research and \ndevelopment mission with the goal of energy independence. This is not a \nproject-based account and, therefore, it doesn't receive annual \nauthorization.\n  Recently, there has been more attention on energy, which has resulted \nin two Energy bills in the past 4 years. But you need to go back 13 \nyears, before the 2005 bill, to find another Energy bill passed by \nCongress. Obviously, the organic statute creating the Department \nanticipated that there would be an organic authorization for these \nitems, and they would be handled in the appropriations bills. If we \npassed Senator McCain's amendment, it would eliminate any discretion of \nthis subcommittee or of the Congress itself, for that matter, to make \nchanges in the Department of Energy's budget priorities for spending \nplans. The Appropriations Committee would, therefore, become a \nrubberstamp for the administration's budget. Since we do not pass \nsomething like the Defense authorization bill, and there is no \ncorresponding authorization bill for the Department of Energy, we would \nsimply take the President's proposal and pass the money to support it, \nand I do not believe that is acceptable.\n  Senator McCain ran through a list of projects for which he had little \nor no patience because he said he did not understand them, and they \nstruck him as being projects that possibly had questionable merit. I \nhave a list of projects that were funded by the administration out of \nthe blanket authority the Congress gave the Secretary in what we call \nthe Stimulus Act. We passed the Stimulus Act without any specific \nearmarks. We simply said: Here is your money and you get to decide how \nit is spent. Congress will not intervene. I voted against the stimulus \nbill for a variety of reasons, but we now have the announcements from \nSecretary Chu as to the specifics of the wind program funding awards.\n  To quote Senator McCain in his comments about the earmarks in this \nbill: ``It may be that every one of these projects is legitimate and \nevery one of them has merit.'' But this is the way the administration \nhands out money compared to the way the Congress hands out money. \nThe Mountain Institute, Inc., in Morgantown, WV, overcoming barriers to \nwind development in Appalachian coal country, $99,000; the West \nVirginia Division of Energy, in Charleston, WV, overcoming the \nchallenges in West Virginia, $100,000; in Austin, TX, $118,000 to fund \nsolutions for wind developers and bats; for the board of trustees of \nthe University of Illinois in Champaign, IL, studying ``are flying \nwildlife attracted to, or do they avoid wind turbines?''; Kansas City \nUniversity in Manhattan, KS, the environmental impact of wind power \ndevelopment on population biology on greater prairie chickens; Texas \nTech University in Lubbock, TX, an assessment of lesser prairie chicken \npopulation distribution in relation to potential wind energy \ndevelopment; Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc., in Cheyenne, WY, \n$100,000 to study greater sage and sage grass telemetry for the Simpson \nRange Resource area; finally, in Kalamazoo, MI, the Western Michigan \nUniversity receives $99,933 to study genetic approaches to \nunderstanding the population level impact of wind energy development on \nmigratory bats.\n\n  These, as I say, may all be very worthwhile items. I don't think they \nare any more worthwhile items than the items we put in our bill. I say \nto those in support of the McCain amendment, if the McCain amendment \npasses, you take away from the Congress the right to determine how this \nmoney is spent and you turn it over to the President entirely and let \nhim or his administration decide. It does not mean the money will be \nsaved; it simply means the money will be spent in the way the \nadministration wants it rather than in the way Members of Congress want \nit. The last time I read the Constitution, article I of the \nConstitution gives the power of the purse to the Congress and says \nCongress shall determine how much money shall be raised and how much \nmoney shall be spent, and that is what the Congress has done. It has \ngiven an organic statute to the Department of Energy, and then it \nallows the Congress, under that statute, to come up with the specifics \nof how the money is spent.\n  The Senator talked about report language not being binding in the \nbill. The bill, by legislative language, incorporates the specific \nprojects in the report by reference. Therefore, it does become binding.\n  If we pass the amendment Senator McCain has proposed, it would have a \ndevastating impact on the Department's environmental cleanup \nrequirements. These are cleanup programs that receive annual \nauthorization for cleaning up sites and projects under the Defense \nAuthorization Act. But it also has similar authorization on sites that \nare outside the Defense Department.\n  Included in this nondefense category are ongoing cleanups in the \nfollowing places--and I will repeat that again: ongoing cleanups. These \nare not new starts or projects that have come out of nowhere; these are \nitems that are going forward, that have been authorized by past \nCongresses, under the organic statute of the Department of Energy: \nPaducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; Moab, UT; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, \nin Tennessee; Idaho National Laboratory, in Idaho; Brookhaven National \nLaboratory, in West Valley, NY; Santa Susana, in California; Hanford, \nWA; Argonne National Laboratory, in Illinois; Los Alamos National \nLaboratory, New Mexico.\n  If I might focus on the one in Moab, UT, this is a cleanup of a \nuranium site, where there was a uranium plant during the boom times, \nwhen we were mining uranium as rapidly as we could, processing that, \nand we left behind tailings that have been judged as being damaging. \nThese tailings are very close to the Colorado River. Indeed, the \nSenator's own State of Arizona is downstream from this tailing site.\n  By appropriating this money in this bill in a manner that would be \noutlawed by the Senator's amendment, we are accelerating the cleanup \nprocess in this time of economic difficulty, adding more jobs, more \nactivity, and, quite frankly, lower prices, as contractors are anxious \nto gain work and will bid lower than they would otherwise; it is the \nlogical thing to do. It would be dropped from the bill if we proceeded \nwith the Senator's amendment.\n  For these reasons, I think the Senator's amendment would be a \nmistake. I urge my colleagues to vote it down.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Bennett and I have discussed the\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\nMcCain amendment. Senator McCain has offered his amendment. I will \nspeak briefly in opposition to the amendment. I believe Senator Bennett \nalso has spoken. We are prepared to have a vote at 6 o'clock. I ask \nunanimous consent the Senate proceed to a vote on the McCain amendment \nat 6 o'clock. I further ask consent that no second degrees be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me withhold for a moment.\n  I ask my unanimous consent request be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the McCain \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in response to Senator McCain's amendment, \nhe has come to the floor to talk about legislative-directed spending. \nWe have some disagreements on that subject. I respect the opinions of \nSenator McCain on some of these issues. I disagree, however, with the \nproposition that somehow what is in a President's budget, that is the \nrecommendation of a President in the President's budget, has any \ngreater import than the recommendations of Senators about what kind of \nprojects have merit.\n  The Constitution of this country provides that the President proposes \nand Congress disposes. The power of the purse is here. It is the \nCongress that raises the funds and it is the Congress that is \nresponsible for the expenditure of those funds.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about ``earmarks.'' \nCongressionally directed spending is spending that has been \ndramatically reformed. We have substantially reduced the number of \nprojects in this bill.\n  By the way, I indicated when I began discussing the bill that Senator \nBennett and I have brought to the floor, talking about the number of \nearmarks the President has requested, a very large number of earmarks \nare in the President's request about what he believes we should pursue \nwith respect to projects and how they should be funded. We have agreed \nwith him in most cases, disagreed in a few cases, and in those areas \nwhere we have disagreed, we have not funded that which the President \nhas requested because we didn't think it appropriate to fund it. We \nhave in other cases funded other proposals that have come to us from \nSenators that have, we believe, more merit.\n  I do not believe the executive branch always gets it right and the \ncongressional branch or legislative branch never gets it right. I think \nsomewhere between represents the best of what both can offer. That is \nwhy we have preserved a substantial majority of what President Obama in \nhis budget to the Congress has requested.\n  If you look back in history you will see there are a good many \nexamples of projects that started out as legislative-directed spending, \nor funding, that have had major national implications. In 1873, \nCongress appropriated funds for the Indian police to keep order and \nprohibit illegal liquor traffic on Indian reservations. That was \nthrough a congressional add-on or earmark. Only later, then, were \nIndian tribal police forces and court systems authorized and included \nin the President's budget. But it was Congress that initiated the law \nenforcement approach that appropriated funds for Indian police.\n  In 1883, the U.S. Navy began moving from wooden to steel ships. That \ncame as a result of a decision by the Congress. The Congress said we \nwant to move from wooden to steel ships. That was appropriated in the \nNaval Service Appropriations Act. It directed the Navy to construct two \nsteel steam cruising vessels from funds appropriated but not required \nfor repairing wooden ships.\n  In 1943, the National School Lunch Program was established through a \n$50 million earmark in the 1944 Agriculture Appropriations bill. Of \ncourse, that turns out to have been a wonderful idea. The school lunch \nprogram is a remarkable success.\n  In 1987, it was the Congress that earmarked funding to what was \ncalled gene mapping, which later became the Human Genome Project. That \ndidn't come from some bureaucrat or somebody down in an executive \nagency who said, You know what we should do, let's begin mapping human \ngenes. Instead, it came from here, in the Congress. In fact, former \nSenator Domenici had a lot to do with that. So Congress originated the \nHuman Genome Project. Guess what. We now have the first owners manual \nfor the human body. It is changing everything about medicine. That \ndidn't come because somebody in the executive branch said let's do \nthat. That came because someone on the floor of the Senate here said \nlet's do this because it has merit.\n  These are only a few examples of things that represent substantial \nprogress as a result of ideas that come from the Congress. Despite what \nyou hear from opponents of that sort of thing, if you got rid of all of \nthe ideas that came from the Congress about how to spend money in the \nEnergy and Water bill, we would still be spending the same amount of \nmoney because what we spend in this subcommittee is up to the \nallocation given us by the Budget Committee. The Budget Committee says \nhere is what is going to be spent. That decision is made by the Senate. \nThen an appropriation, called a 302(b) allocation, I should say, goes \nto this subcommittee and that is what we allocate. That is what we \ndecide we will have to spend.\n  If we did not do that, then that money goes down to an agency and \nsomeone in the Federal agency says here is what we are going to spend \nit on. So eliminating all of the legislative-directed funding would not \nreduce the Federal budget deficit at all. I know that is claimed but it \nis simply not the case. It just is not the case.\n  Let me also say the issue of legislative-directed funding is \nsomething we have dramatically transformed. No. 1, we have cut the \namount of legislative-directed funding requests in half. By requests I \nam talking about those that made it into the bill. We have cut it by \nhalf. We got rid of half of it because I think it went way too far, so \nwe cut it back by 50 percent. Second, every single request has to now \nbe publicly disclosed and every single piece of legislative-directed \nfunding that is in this bill is described by who asked for it, how much \nit is, and what its purpose is.\n  As I indicated before, what we are doing in this bill is investing in \nimproving this country's infrastructure, improving and investing in \nthis country's energy future and putting people to work, doing things \nthat will pay dividends for decades to come. That is what this \nsubcommittee does. This is not some routine subcommittee, this is the \nsubcommittee that funds the substantial amount of energy projects and \nresearch in this country that will have implications for decades.\n  This is the subcommittee that funds all of the water projects--the \ndams, the harbors, the navigation, all of those issues that are so \nimportant to this country's water development and water conservation. \nSo this is not some routine kind of expenditure, this is an investment \nthat will create substantial jobs in the future. It will transform our \nenergy future, in my judgment.\n  I described earlier the importance of the national laboratories we \nfund, the science laboratories, the energy laboratories, the weapons \nlaboratories that represent the repository of the most breathtaking, \ncutting-edge, world-class research in so many different areas. All of \nthat is done in this subcommittee.\n  I am pleased to have spent time with Senator Bennett. We Republicans \nand Democrats on this committee worked through a lot of requests, \nrequests from President Obama, from his team, about how they want to \nfund a wide range of issues and requests from our colleagues.\n  I would say Secretary Chu had requested a number of research hubs he \nwanted to do, kind of a transformation in the Department of Energy. We \ndecided to proceed with three of those hubs. It makes sense to us to \nbegin to try moving down that road in a range of areas where you \nprovide real focus on specific areas of energy and research into those \nareas.\n  If the McCain amendment were to be agreed to, my understanding is \nthey would be considered not authorized and therefore not allowed. That \ndoesn't make any sense to me. There has been, for a long period of \ntime, general authorization for the programs in the Department of \nEnergy. We routinely have\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\nnever authorized every year that which we are doing here. We fund \nprograms that generally have been ongoing within the larger framework \nof the authorization of the Department of Energy.\n  I very much oppose the McCain amendment. I respect our colleague, \nSenator McCain. He is a good legislator. We have come to disagreement \non this subject. I hope my colleagues will join myself and Senator \nBennett in defeating the amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 1814.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment so I may call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has made a \nunanimous consent request. The Senator from Tennessee has the floor.\n  Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, has the Senator provided \ncopies of the amendment to our side?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I have provided it to the desk. I guess the answer is \nno, but I will be happy to do so.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator from Tennessee will visit with me just \nbriefly, I object for the moment so I may take a look at the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Tennessee still has the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if the manager of the bill is \ncongenial with my idea of going ahead and talking about the amendment \nwhile he considers the terms, I will see that he has a copy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, why don't we ask the Senator to proceed \nto discuss the amendment, and let's look at the language.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \ncourtesy, and I will ask that my staff get copies of the amendment to \nSenator Dorgan.\n  I am offering today the auto stock for every taxpayer amendment. This \nis an amendment I and a number of other Senators, including Senators \nBennett, Kyl, and McConnell, have introduced before. It basically would \nrequire the Treasury to distribute to all Americans who pay taxes on \nApril 15 all of the government common stock in the new General Motors \nand Chrysler within 1 year following the date of emergence of General \nMotors and Chrysler from bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, General \nMotors, we are glad to say, has now emerged from bankruptcy \nproceedings, so the amendment becomes very timely.\n  The amendment would prohibit the Treasury from using any more TARP \nfunds to bail out GM or Chrysler, and it would require that the \nSecretary of the Treasury and his designee have a fiduciary \nresponsibility to the American taxpayer to maximize the return on their \ninvestment as long as the government holds stock in these companies.\n  This is the best way to get the auto companies out of the hands of \nWashington bureaucrats and politicians and into the hands of the \nAmerican people in the marketplace where the companies belong.\n  There is a great deal of sentiment on the Democratic side as well as \nthe Republican side about this. I know Senator Nelson of Nebraska had \nintroduced legislation along the lines of finding a way to move the \nstock of auto companies out of the hands of government and into some \nother hands as quickly as possible, taking the very sensible notion \nthat the job of the U.S. Government is not to operate automobile \ncompanies in the United States. And Senator Thune, Senator Corker, and \nSenator Johanns all have offered amendments to that effect.\n\n  I would like to suggest to my colleagues that this amendment, which I \nhope we have a chance to consider, is the most responsible way to take \nthe taxpayers' investment in General Motors and Chrysler, maximize the \nreturn on the investment, get it out of Washington, DC, so we \npoliticians are not tempted to meddle with it, and get it back out in \nthe hands of the American people in the marketplace. It will create a \nsort of ``Green Bay Packers'' fan base for Chevrolets and whatever else \nGeneral Motors decides to produce.\n  Most Americans know that in the National Football League there are a \nlot of teams who have a lot of loyalty, but the Green Bay Packers have \nmore loyalty than most. One reason is that the fans own the team. In \nthis case, the taxpayers would own General Motors and the taxpayers \nwould own Chrysler or at least part of it. They would own 60 percent of \nGeneral Motors and about 8 percent of Chrysler. That would give about \n120 million Americans who pay taxes on April 15 a few shares in General \nMotors and Chrysler. And it might make them a little more interested in \nthe next Chevrolet, and produce a little consumer interest.\n  That is not the best reason to do this. The most important reason to \ndo this is that the American people, by overwhelming margins, \nunderstand what I think most of us understand: that the federal \ngovernment has no business trying to run a car company. We do not know \nanything about running car companies. Yet, if we own it, we cannot keep \nour hands off of it. We have seen many examples of this on both sides \nof the aisle, I may say.\n  I started giving out car czar awards a few weeks ago. I gave the \nfirst one to the distinguished Congressman from Massachusetts who \ncalled the president of General Motors and said to him: Don't close a \nwarehouse in my congressional district. And, lo and behold, the \nwarehouse was not closed. Well, the Congressman said he was only doing \nwhat any Congressman would do about a warehouse in his district. I \nthink he is right about that. But the problem is, the Congressman owns \npart of the company. He happens to be the chairman of the House bailout \ncommittee--the Financial Services Committee--in addition to that. So it \ncreates a political incestuousness that we need to end.\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\n  Now, lest my colleagues on the other side think I am trying to pick \non Democratic car czars, I had to give the second car czar award to \nmyself because, lo and behold, General Motors came around visiting the \ndelegations of Michigan, Indiana, and, yes, Tennessee to try to see \nwhere they might build a plant for small cars. Now, what was I to do, \nas a Senator from Tennessee and as the Governor who helped recruit \nSaturn to Spring Hill, TN, 25 years ago? I got with Senator Corker, and \nwe got with the Governor, and we had a meeting in my office, and we met \nwith the General Motors executives, and we put our best case forward.\n  Of course, we own 60 percent of the company. I counted up that there \nare about 60 committees and subcommittees in the House and the Senate \nthat conceivably could have jurisdiction over General Motors and \nChrysler and could hold hearings about the color of their cars and why \nthey are buying a battery for the Chevy Volt in South Korea when they \ncould be buying it from Tennessee, or why they do not make a car that \nis this big or that big or that many miles per gallon. Or what about \nthe dealers? That has been a matter of great concern in the Congress. \nThere is legislation pending that would overrule whatever the \nmanagement's decision on dealers is. You name it, we have a reason to \nmeddle. And most of us have been meddling.\n  So what do we have here? We have these chief executives of major \ncompanies for which we have now paid almost $70 billion of taxpayers' \nmoney for 60 percent of the stock in General Motors and 8 percent in \nChrysler. And what do these CEOs do? They are reduced to the status of \nsome assistant secretary, driving their congressionally approved hybrid \ncars from Detroit to Washington to testify. They dare not fly in an \nairplane or we would want to know what kind of airplane they are flying \nin. So they come to Washington. They testify all day before the \ncommittee. Of course, they have to get prepared for that, which takes \nsome time. Then they turn around and drive back home. My question is, \nHow many cars did they design that day? How many cars did they build \nthat day? How many cars did they sell that day while they are up here \ntalking to all of their distinguished owners--Senators, Congressmen--\nall of us who are here in Washington, DC?\n  Now, we are well meaning, and they are well meaning. But my point is, \nthe chief executives are never going to be able to succeed if we are \nconstantly meddling in their business. So this amendment would make \nsure we move the ownership of stock from the government in Washington, \nDC, into the marketplace. Madam President, I see the manager of the \nbill. I would be glad to yield to him for a moment, if I could retain \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if Senator Alexander would yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I would like to be able to reclaim my \ntime.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, without the Senator losing his right to the floor. \nWe think the way we would like to proceed is for the Senator from \nTennessee to go ahead and offer his amendment and then finish his \nstatement, after which we will go into a period of morning business, \nfor not more than 10 minutes for each presentation. I believe Senator \nKaufman has morning business.\n  So the point is, Senator Bennett and I have discussed it, and we feel \nit appropriate for the Senator from Tennessee to offer the amendment at \nthe end of his discussion, after which we will go into morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy. \nAnd I see the Senator from Delaware. I will take just a few more \nminutes, if I may, to explain the amendment.\n  So the reasons for doing this, to summarize, is that all of us seem \nto say--the President has said he does not want to micro-manage the \nauto companies. But if we own the companies, it is kind of hard for him \nnot to do that. He fired the president of General Motors. His \nrepresentatives are appointing the board. The President himself called \nthe mayor of Detroit and seemed to get on the side of the issue of \nwhere the General Motors headquarters would be--in Warren, MI, or in \nDetroit. He has an Auto Task Force, whose business it is to pay a lot \nof attention to how these companies are running. There is a pay czar \nover in the White House whose job it is to check on the pay of certain \nexecutives in General Motors and Chrysler.\n  It is hard for me to see how General Motors and Chrysler--with all \nthey have to do and the challenges they have ahead of it--how they are \ngoing to compete with Honda and Nissan and Toyota and Ford, which \nposted a big profit. If General Motors is spending a large percent of \nits time responding to meddlesome questions and directives by its \nmajority owner, the U.S. Government.\n  I am not the only one who thinks that. According to the Nashville \nTennessean, an AutoPacific survey reports that 81 percent of Americans \npolled ``agreed that the faster the government gets out of the \nautomotive business, the better.''\n  Ninety-five percent disagreed ``that the government is a good \noverseer of corporations such as General Motors and Chrysler.'' Ninety-\nthree percent disagreed ``that having the government in charge of (the \ntwo automakers) will result in cars and trucks that Americans will want \nto buy.'' According to a Rasmussen Poll done in June, 80 percent \nbelieve the government should sell its stake in the auto companies to \nprivate investors ``as soon as possible.'' According to the Wall Street \nJournal on June 18, 70 percent of those surveyed said ``they had \nconcerns about federal interventions into the economy, including Mr. \nObama's decision to take an ownership stake in General Motors Corp.''\n  But I do not think that is news to any of us. I think almost every \nMember of Congress understands that General Motors and Chrysler would \nbe better off if we did not own them.\n  So that leaves the remaining question: What is the best way to get \nthe stock from where it is in the government to where it needs to be, \nwhich is in the marketplace?\n  There have been a variety of good proposals made. I mentioned Senator \nNelson's proposal, Senator Corker's, and Senator Thune's. But I would \nargue that a straight, simple stock dividend, which is what I am \nproposing, is the simplest and most effective way to accomplish this \njob. It is called a ``corporate spinoff,'' in corporate terms, or a \nspinout. It is a new entity formed by a split from a larger one.\n  It often happens with very large companies. It usually happens when a \nmajor company--in this case, the U.S. Government--has a subsidiary--in \nthis case, General Motors and Chrysler--which has very little to do \nwith the business of the major company. Well, surely operating a car \ncompany is not the main business of the U.S. Government, which has a \nlot on its plate, when we go from health care, to climate change, to \nenergy, to the budget, et cetera.\n\n  Examples of corporate spinoffs are pretty familiar to us. Procter & \nGamble did a spinoff with Clorox in 1969. In other words, Procter & \nGamble owned Clorox. Procter & Gamble declared a stock dividend. It \ngave its shareholders shares in Clorox, and Clorox and Procter & Gamble \nwere severed. Time Warner did a spinoff with Time Warner Cable in March \n2009. Time Warner stockholders received a pro rata share of Time Warner \nCable common share stock. That is the same idea I am proposing here \ntoday. Then PepsiCo did a spinoff with its restaurant business--KFC, \nPizza Hut, and Taco Bell in 1997. This is also something familiar. \nPepsiCo shareholders each received 1 share in the new restaurant \ncompany for every 10 PepsiCo shares they held.\n  The idea of Americans owning stock is not a new idea in the United \nStates. Fifty-one percent of families hold stocks in publicly traded \ncompanies directly or indirectly. And many big companies have many \nshareholders.\n  Several of us Congressmen and Senators were on a phone call with \nFritz Henderson, the General Motors chief executive officer, several \nweeks ago. The question came up about, what is the government going to \ndo with all this GM stock after the bankruptcy? Mr. Henderson made very \nclear that was not his decision, it was the Treasury's decision to \nmake. But he said this is a ``very large amount'' of stock and that the \norderly offering of those shares to establish a market might have to be \n``managed down over a period of years.''\n  Well, if the government in Washington holds the shares of General \nMotors and Chrysler for a ``period of years,'' I cannot think of \nanything that will make it less likely that General\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\nMotors will succeed because we will be meddling every single day, and \nGM will never have time to design, build, and make cars. Instead, the \ngovernment could declare a stock dividend within the next few months, \nwhich should be relatively easy to do because we have the names and the \naccounts of the 120 million people who pay taxes on April 15. The \nprinciple here is: they paid for it, they might as well own it. So if \nthe taxpayers own it, and that is good for them, and if getting rid of \nthe stock from the government is good for the government and good for \nGeneral Motors--just like creating a fan base of 120 million Americans \nwho might be interested in the next Chevy, like Green Bay Packers fans \nare interested in the next quarterback--then, it seems to me this is a \nvery wise idea.\n  I have talked with a number of corporate lawyers and bankruptcy \nlawyers and securities lawyers. I have discussed it with Governors. I \nhave discussed it with financial officials. And I have talked about it \nwith average Americans who are not happy about the fact that the \ngovernment owns 60 percent of General Motors. They all think this stock \ndistribution is a good idea.\n  I am afraid some of my colleagues think: Well, he is just making a \npoint. He is just being facetious. I am not. We need to get rid of this \nstock. We almost all agree with that. It will take us years to do it if \nwe sell it just in an orderly way over a period of time. The single \nbest familiar way to get the stock out of the hands of the government \nand into the hands of the marketplace is a stock dividend. Give the \nstock to the people who have now paid almost $70 billion for it--the \n120 million people who pay taxes on April 15--and let's get this \neconomy moving again.\n  Not many weeks ago, a visiting European auto executive said to me, \nwith a laugh, that he was in Washington, DC, which he referred to as \n``the new American automotive capital: Washington, DC.'' Well, it would \nbe a little humorous if it were not so sad. None of us like the fact \nthat we are in the situation we are in. But to give General Motors and \nChrysler a chance to succeed, let's get our auto companies out of the \nhands of Washington, DC, and back into the marketplace. And the sooner \nthe better. The amendment I offer will achieve that purpose.\n\n  At this point, I wish to once again ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1862.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1862 to amendment No. 1813.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Madam President, all Americans hope that the ``green \nshoots'' we have been seeing recently--evidence of the economy turning \naround--won't wither. One thing that will help make our recovery strong \nand sustainable is the return of investor confidence. That is why \nmaking certain our financial markets operate fairly and openly is so \nimportant.\n  Free and fair markets and democracy are America's two greatest \npillars of strength. Our financial markets have long been the engine of \nAmerican growth and the envy of the world. Efficient and free capital \nmarkets are essential to all of what makes America great: investment in \nprivate enterprise, the availability of capital to expand and grow our \neconomy through innovation and new ideas, and the ability to save for \nretirement in hopes that investment will result in comfort for our \nlater years. But we have seen what happens when you take the referees \noff the field, when we fail to have clear and fair rules for everyone. \nIt is the job of our democratic government to set those rules and to \nkeep the referees--our financial regulators--on the field.\n  I rise today because we continue to see that our financial markets \nsimply do not operate on a level playing field for all investors. That \nis a threat to the credibility of our financial markets and, as a \nresult, to our country's economic well-being.\n  We have an unfair playing field that leaves us with, in effect, two \nmarkets: one for powerful insiders and another for average investors; \none market for huge volume, high-speed players who can take advantage \nof every loophole for profit, and another market for retail investors \nwho must play by the rules and whose orders are filled without any \nspecial priority. This situation simply cannot continue. It is the \nnational equivalent of ``separate and unequal.''\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\n  I offer my colleagues three examples of this two-tier system which \nundermines the fairness and efficiency of our financial markets. First, \ntoday the biggest players on Wall Street are using their automated, \nhigh-speed trading programs to engage in short selling of stocks. \nInformed observers believe organized ``bear raids''--short selling \ncombined with coordinated ``misinformation'' campaigns--contributed to \nthe demise of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, key elements in the \ncollapse of our financial markets last year. With the repeal of the \nuptick rule in 2007 and no substantial substitute in its place, the \nthreat of such damaging manipulation is still with us.\n  Since March 3, I have spoken frequently about the urgent need for the \nSEC to restore the substance of the uptick rule. This rule required \ninvestors simply to pause and to wait for an uptick in price before \ncontinuing to short sell. Without such a rule in place, investors who \nown those stocks are more vulnerable to hedge fund bear raiders.\n  So far, the SEC has initiated rulemaking and conducted on April 8 a \nroundtable discussion among key experts on some kind of price test that \ncould substantially replace the uptick rule in today's high-speed, \nhigh-tech markets. While that process has begun, we have yet to see it \nbear fruit.\n  Second, big market players can engage in naked short selling--selling \nstock for which they have no legal claim and for which they cannot \ndeliver. Since my first speech on this subject in March, I have come to \nthe floor several times and coauthored letters with my colleagues about \nthe need for the SEC to end naked short selling. In that abusive \npractice, traders bet on shares losing value--shares they have not \nborrowed and in some cases never even intend to borrow--in time for \nsettlement.\n  Yesterday, the SEC made permanent a temporary rule they had enacted \nlast fall and proposed some new transparency measures, and the \nCommission announced plans for a roundtable discussion on September \n30--2 months from now. The Commission will finally begin to discuss \npublicly the potential solutions that a bipartisan group of Senators \nand I have been urging: either a pre-borrow requirement or a \ncentralized ``hard locate'' system. The Depository Trust and Clearing \nCorporation tells us it has the capacity and the willingness to \nimplement that system but only if the SEC requires it through a rule.\n  That is some progress, but we need more urgency at the SEC to \nimplement tougher rules that will stop naked short selling through an \nenforceable system. This is imperative, because the current \n``reasonable belief'' standard is virtually unenforceable, even against \nthose who engage in concerted action to manipulate prices downward.\n  Yesterday's announcement by the SEC admits that the rule they made \npermanent yesterday has only reduced fails to deliver by 57 percent. \nThat leaves a lot of room for improvement. Why not have an enforceable \nsystem such as that proposed last week by seven Senators of both \nparties that could end naked short selling once and for all? I am \nhopeful we will soon see movement on this.\n  Third, we have the most recent revelation of so-called ``flash \norders'' by high frequency traders. These allow exchange members who \npay a fee to get a first look at share order flows before the general \npublic. By viewing this buy and sell order information for milliseconds \nbefore it goes in the wider market, these investors gain an unfair \nadvantage over the rest. Today I join Senator Schumer in urging the SEC \nto prohibit the use of these flash orders used in connection with \noptional display periods currently permitted by DirectEdge, Bats \nExchange, and NASDAQ.\n  As the New York Stock Exchange complained to the SEC on May 28, \nselling flash orders for free provides:\n\n       Non-public order information to a select class of market \n     participants at the expense of a free and open market system.\n\n  To use a baseball metaphor, flash orders allow some batters to pay to \nsee the catcher's signals to the pitcher while the rest of us don't see \nthem. We have to make an informed judgment with a normal amount of \nrisk. Markets that permit a privileged few to have special access to \ninformation cannot maintain their credibility.\n  I ask: Is this what is happening on Wall Street today? When millions \nof Americans have lost so much money in the stock market, do Wall \nStreet actors continue to make record trading profits by exploiting \nloopholes using high-speed computers?\n  William Donaldson, former chairman of the SEC and the New York Stock \nExchange, has said:\n\n       This is where all the money is getting made . . . If an \n     individual investor doesn't have the means to keep up, \n     they're at a huge disadvantage.\n\n  As Senator Schumer wrote in his letter:\n\n       If allowed to continue, these practices will undermine the \n     confidence of orderly investors and drive them away from our \n     capital markets.\n\n  America simply cannot afford this loss of integrity of its financial \nmarkets.\n  Amazingly, it is a loophole in current regulations that allows this \nunfair practice. This can and should be fixed immediately.\n  Flash orders, the uptick rule, and naked short selling are not just a \nlist of complaints. I believe they are interconnected. They are \ninterconnected by an unsupported faith in the religion of self-\nregulation and liquidity. That religion believes that no price is too \nhigh for deeper liquidity--maximizing the volume and frequency of a \ntransaction--because it reveals the greatest amount of information \nabout stock values. There is one more article of faith--that innovation \nby market players is always beneficial.\n  When the financial markets were decimalized and the uptick rule \nrepealed, the SEC and leading market institutions claimed that the \ntechnology would lead to deeper liquidity and market efficiencies \nbenefiting all investors. High-speed trading, sophisticated algorithms, \nand high volume short selling all have grown exponentially in recent \nyears.\n  MIT, our Nation's greatest engineering school, sent 11 percent of its \n2008 graduates to work on Wall Street. All this, some say, has led to \ndeeper liquidity.\n  America was founded with a spirit of entrepreneurship and a \ncelebration of economic innovation. There are so many things Wall \nStreet does right, and historically Wall Street was built on a \nfoundation of trust and credibility. But America was also born from the \nprinciple of equal opportunity. While we should keep encouraging the \nkind of commercial ingenuity that fuels the prosperity of financial \nmarkets, we must ensure that technology is not employed to advantage \none small group over the rest. That is not what free market is about.\n\n  Indeed, there is a place in our markets for high-speed arbitrage \nfunctions, because they can and have narrowed bid-ask spreads and \nlowered the cost of trading for all. High-speed arbitrage also helps \nprice discovery and keeps the prices of similar assets traded in \ndifferent markets more closely aligned.\n  When it comes to flash orders, however, I think most investors, even \nthose who trade regularly, are waking up very surprised to learn that \nthese practices are even permitted, just as we were surprised last year \nto learn about the rampant extent of naked short selling. Many \ninvestors have been suspicious for years that insiders on Wall Street \nhold built-in advantages over average investors. Flash orders are a \nclassic example of being taken aback not by what is illegal but by what \nis legally occurring directly under the nose of our financial \nregulators and leading market institutions.\n  Since I began speaking out against naked short selling, I have heard \nfrom some of the biggest companies in America that are concerned about \nthe effects of naked short selling. But they do not want to speak out \nbecause they fear that any hint of vulnerability they admit even \nprivately to public officials will leak out and make them the target of \nthese predatory raiders.\n  I have also heard from investors around the country. They have \ncomplained that large broker-dealers are somehow permitted to trade \nahead of most investors. These average and even sophisticated investors \nrelate that in their experience they never seem to be able to execute \ntrades at the best available published bid or asking price. They \ncomplain that large orders always seem to get a priority over their \nsmaller orders. Until now, I never knew what to make of these claims.\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\n  In the New York Times this past Friday, on investor blogs for weeks \nnow, and in a comment letter filed by the New York Stock Exchange on \nMay 28, commentators have begun to explain how flash orders work to, \nquite literally, ``pick the pockets'' of the average investor. In \nessence, these traders get a very quick look at all pending orders in \nadvance and through technology can trade ahead of these orders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Times article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 24, 2009]\n\n             Stock Traders Find Speed Pays, in Milliseconds\n\n                          (By Charles Duhigg)\n\n       It is the hot new thing on Wall Street, a way for a handful \n     of traders to master the stock market, peek at investors' \n     orders and, critics say, even subtly manipulate share prices.\n       It is called high-frequency trading--and it is suddenly one \n     of the most talked-about and mysterious forces in the \n     markets.\n       Powerful computers, some housed right next to the machines \n     that drive marketplaces like the New York Stock Exchange, \n     enable high-frequency traders to transmit millions of orders \n     at lightning speed and, their detractors contend, reap \n     billions at everyone else's expense.\n       These systems are so fast they can outsmart or outrun other \n     investors, humans and computers alike. And after growing in \n     the shadows for years, they are generating lots of talk.\n       Nearly everyone on Wall Street is wondering how hedge funds \n     and large banks like Goldman Sachs are making so much money \n     so soon after the financial system nearly collapsed. High-\n     frequency trading is one answer.\n       And when a former Goldman Sachs programmer was accused this \n     month of stealing secret computer codes--software that a \n     federal prosecutor said could ``manipulate markets in unfair \n     ways''--it only added to the mystery. Goldman acknowledges \n     that it profits from high-frequency trading, but disputes \n     that it has an unfair advantage.\n       Yet high-frequency specialists clearly have an edge over \n     typical traders, let alone ordinary investors. The Securities \n     and Exchange Commission says it is examining certain aspects \n     of the strategy.\n       ``This is where all the money is getting made,'' said \n     William H. Donaldson, former chairman and chief executive of \n     the New York Stock Exchange and today an adviser to a big \n     hedge fund. ``If an individual investor doesn't have the \n     means to keep up, they're at a huge disadvantage.''\n       For most of Wall Street's history, stock trading was fairly \n     straightforward: buyers and sellers gathered on exchange \n     floors and dickered until they struck a deal. Then, in 1998, \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission authorized electronic \n     exchanges to compete with marketplaces like the New York \n     Stock Exchange. The intent was to open markets to anyone with \n     a desktop computer and a fresh idea.\n       But as new marketplaces have emerged, PCs have been unable \n     to compete with Wall Street's computers. Powerful \n     algorithms--``algos,'' in industry parlance--execute millions \n     of orders a second and scan dozens of public and private \n     marketplaces simultaneously. They can spot trends before \n     other investors can blink, changing orders and strategies \n     within milliseconds.\n       High-frequency traders often confound other investors by \n     issuing and then canceling orders almost simultaneously. \n     Loopholes in market rules give high-speed investors an early \n     glance at how others are trading. And their computers can \n     essentially bully slower investors into giving up profits--\n     and then disappear before anyone even knows they were there.\n       High-frequency traders also benefit from competition among \n     the various exchanges, which pay small fees that are often \n     collected by the biggest and most active traders--typically a \n     quarter of a cent per share to whoever arrives first. Those \n     small payments, spread over millions of shares, help high-\n     speed investors profit simply by trading enormous numbers of \n     shares, even if they buy or sell at a modest loss.\n       ``It's become a technological arms race, and what separates \n     winners and losers is how fast they can move,'' said Joseph \n     M. Mecane of NYSE Euronext, which operates the New York Stock \n     Exchange. ``Markets need liquidity, and high-frequency \n     traders provide opportunities for other investors to buy and \n     sell.''\n       The rise of high-frequency trading helps explain why \n     activity on the nation's stock exchanges has exploded. \n     Average daily volume has soared by 164 percent since 2005, \n     according to data from NYSE. Although precise figures are \n     elusive, stock exchanges say that a handful of high-frequency \n     traders now account for a more than half of all trades. To \n     understand this high-speed world, consider what happened when \n     slow-moving traders went up against high-frequency robots \n     earlier this month, and ended up handing spoils to lightning-\n     fast computers.\n       It was July 15, and Intel, the computer chip giant, had \n     reporting robust earnings the night before. Some investors, \n     smelling opportunity, set out to buy shares in the \n     semiconductor company Broadcom. (Their activities were \n     described by an investor at a major Wall Street firm who \n     spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his job.) The \n     slower traders faced a quandary: If they sought to buy a \n     large number of shares at once, they would tip their hand and \n     risk driving up Broadcom's price. So, as is often the case on \n     Wall Street, they divided their orders into dozens of small \n     batches, hoping to cover their tracks. One second after the \n     market opened, shares of Broadcom started changing hands at \n     $26.20.\n       The slower traders began issuing buy orders. But rather \n     than being shown to all potential sellers at the same time, \n     some of those orders were most likely routed to a collection \n     of high-frequency traders for just 30 milliseconds--0.03 \n     seconds--in what are known as flash orders. While markets are \n     supposed to ensure transparency by showing orders to everyone \n     simultaneously, a loophole in regulations allows marketplaces \n     like Nasdaq to show traders some orders ahead of everyone \n     else in exchange for a fee.\n       In less than half a second, high-frequency traders gained a \n     valuable insight: the hunger for Broadcom was growing. Their \n     computers began buying up Broadcom shares and then reselling \n     them to the slower investors at higher prices. The overall \n     price of Broadcom began to rise.\n       Soon, thousands of orders began flooding the markets as \n     high-frequency software went into high gear. Automatic \n     programs began issuing and canceling tiny orders within \n     milliseconds to determine how much the slower traders were \n     willing to pay. The high-frequency computers quickly \n     determined that some investors' upper limit was $26.40. The \n     price shot to $26.39, and high-frequency programs began \n     offering to sell hundreds of thousands of shares.\n       The result is that the slower-moving investors paid $1.4 \n     million for about 56,000 shares, or $7,800 more than if they \n     had been able to move as quickly as the high-frequency \n     traders.\n       Multiply such trades across thousands of stocks a day, and \n     the profits are substantial. High-frequency traders generated \n     about $21 billion in profits last year, the Tabb Group, a \n     research firm, estimates.\n       ``You want to encourage innovation, and you want to reward \n     companies that have invested in technology and ideas that \n     make the markets more efficient,'' said Andrew M. Brooks, \n     head of United States equity trading at T. Rowe Price, a \n     mutual fund and investment company that often competes with \n     and uses high-frequency techniques. ``But we're moving toward \n     a two-tiered marketplace of the high-frequency arbitrage \n     guys, and everyone else. People want to know they have a \n     legitimate shot at getting a fair deal. Otherwise, the \n     markets lose their integrity.''\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, in America where all are created equal, \nWall Street technology has permitted the powerful to exploit loopholes \nthat make some investors now more equal than others.\n  The most basic principle of a free market system is that anyone can \ntransact goods at prices based on a free and open market, not based on \nsome kind of insider status. These flash order practices fly in the \nface of Regulation NMS, which the SEC issued to guarantee that trades \nare executed at the best price as soon as orders become available. With \nflash orders, there doesn't seem to be any guarantee of this anymore.\n  I call again for the SEC to act quickly to protect investors in four \ncritical areas. First, we need to implement a rule that provides the \nsubstantive protections removed when the uptick rule was rescinded in \n2007.\n  Second, the SEC must end naked short selling. No one should be able \nto short a stock unless they have located specified shares of stock and \nobtained a contractual claim to borrow the stock in time for delivery. \nThe SEC's announcement yesterday of plans for more discussion does not \naccomplish this. We need concrete action soon by the SEC.\n  Third, the SEC must prohibit the use of flash orders. No one--no \none--should be permitted to use information asymmetry that permits \nhigh-speed computer trading to have an advantage over average \ninvestors.\n  Finally, the SEC should establish disclosure and transparency \nequality. The disclosure requirements that apply to pooled funds worth \ngreater than $100 million should apply uniformly to all, including \nhedge funds, for both long and short positions, and the level of \ntransparency for order flows should be the same for all.\n  I truly believe our new SEC chairman is focused on these issues and \nshe is making progress on a number of fronts. But it is the job of \nCongress to urge regulators to fix problems. SEC Chairman Schapiro \ninherited an SEC that had made many mistakes. I respect the fact that \nChairman Schapiro is working hard every day to right a foundered ship. \nThe other commissioners are joining her in that task.\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\n  In closing, I implore the SEC once again to act urgently to fulfill \nits core mission: protecting investors. The reason protecting investors \nis so important is that by doing so, the SEC ensures the credibility of \nthe financial markets. If the SEC refuses to restore a level playing \nfield to rebuild investor confidence in our market, then we in Congress \nwill have to step in and do it ourselves.\n  Protecting investors is too important to the Nation, to the integrity \nof our financial markets, and to our economic recovery. I say again \nthat legitimate capital markets and arbitrage functions have value, \nlike legitimate short-selling has value. But exploiting an unequal \nplaying field only skims our Nation's wealth. It doesn't create wealth \nor value, except for a privileged few. That harms the integrity of our \nfinancial markets and, by doing so, threatens the very foundation of \nour economic well-being.\n  As Americans, we must have faith in our institutions, both the \nmarkets and government, and we must believe that if we work hard and \nplay by the rules, all will be treated equally. That is what is at \nstake. Our financial industry and capital markets can be a powerful \nengine for the American economy. But the SEC and Congress must work \ntogether to restore investor quality, integrity, and credibility of our \nfinancial markets.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

Mr. President, last week I spoke on the Senate floor about \nthe importance of the health care reform bill that passed the Senate in \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  I spoke about how the legislation would reduce costs for families and \nbusinesses, how it would protect consumer choice of doctors, hospitals, \nand insurance plans, and how it would assure health care stability and \nsecurity for all Americans.\n  I spoke about how the bill's public option would increase competition \nin the insurance market, spurring private insurers to offer better \npremiums and better coverage.\n  I explained how the bill's insurance market reforms would prevent \ninsurers from dodging and weaving to avoid paying claims--an experience \nmost of us have had.\n  Today, I am here to talk about a provision in the HELP Committee bill \nthat I am not proud of--a provision that none of us should be proud of. \nThe committee adopted an amendment that would discourage medical \ninnovation and perpetuate inflated prices for the medicines that \nmillions of Americans need. This provision locks taxpayers into paying \nextraordinarily high prices for medicines covered by Medicaid and \nMedicare, covered by the VA system, and covered by the military's \nTRICARE system. The provision also means huge payments by corporations \nand small businesses that insure their employees, and the provision \nlocks patients into paying astronomical out-of-pocket costs for \nmedicines they cannot do without. The medicines I am talking about are \nknown as biologics. They are medicines used to treat conditions such as \nmultiple sclerosis, arthritis, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer. \nSpending on brandname biologics is growing faster than spending on any \nother type of medicine.\n  All too often, the pricetag for this type of drug is simply too high \nfor the patient who needs it. For instance, annual treatment for breast \ncancer with the brandname biologic drug Herceptin costs $48,000. Even \nif you are lucky enough to have health insurance and you are paying 20 \npercent copay, that is $9,600 a year. More than 192,000 American women \nwill be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009. How are they going to \nafford that kind of drug?\n  Annual treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with the brandname biologic \ncalled Remicade costs $20,000. Again, even if you are lucky enough to \nhave insurance--pretty good insurance--you will probably have a copay \nof 20 percent, which is $4,000 a year. That is $80 every single week, \nin addition to all your other health care expenses, and maybe the fact \nthat you don't have income because you are going through rheumatoid \narthritis treatment. At least 1.3 million Americans suffer from \nrheumatoid arthritis.\n  Annual treatment for colon cancer with the brandname biologic Avastin \ncosts $100,000. Again, if you are lucky enough to have good health \ninsurance, and you are paying a 20 percent copay, that is $20,000. That \nis $400 a week just for your copay, on your drug, in order to deal with \nyour colon cancer. This is far too expensive for many of the 112,000 \nmen and women in America who are diagnosed with colon cancer each year.\n  The typical household income in Ohio, which is not too much different \nfrom the State of the Presiding Officer, Colorado, is $46,000 a year.\n  We are talking about a drug that costs $20,000, another drug that \ncosts $48,000, and another drug that costs $100,000 a year, and you are \ntrying to pay with an income of $46,000 a year? Even if you have good \ninsurance, your copay alone will break the bank. You get the picture.\n  More than two decades ago, in response to consumer outrage over the \ntraditional price of drugs, Congress passed the Drug Price Competition \nand Patent Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. That \nact created a generic pathway for traditional medicines. Prior to that \nbill, the FDA had no approval process to get generic drugs, competitive \ndrugs, similar drugs after they have gone off patent, identical drugs \nthat can cure you just like brandname drugs can, but there was no \nallowance to bring those generic drugs to market.\n  A quarter century ago, Congress took care of that. We need a similar \ngeneric pathway for biologics. But legislation granting 12 years of \n``exclusivity''--a better term is 12 years of ``monopoly''--protection, \non top of the 20 years of patent protection--so these companies already \nhave patents, and I understand sometimes several years of their patents \nare used up, and several years of the 20-year patents are used up \nduring the approval process--maybe even 10 years. But on top of that, \nwe are going to give them 12 years of monopoly protection, 12 years of \nexclusivity--the way we talk here--12 years of monopoly protection, the \nway that most people understand it. That gives a drug company a \nmonopoly that no other drug in the market enjoys and no other product \non the market enjoys.\n  What we have done is taken these drugs that cost $12,000 a year, \n$20,000 a year, $40,000 a year, or $100,000 a year, and set them in a \ndifferent category to protect them--a protection that nobody else in \nour entire economic system of protection, monopoly protection, and \nnobody else in our economic system enjoys. These are drugs that save \npeople's lives. These are treatments for people they cannot get any \nother way.\n  Why do we carve out monopoly protection for these drug companies, \nwhen we don't do it for any other kinds of drugs--so-called orphan \ndrugs--or any other consumer product? Why do we do it? It could not be \nbecause the biotech companies are really good lobbyists, could it or \nbecause of the campaign contributions they make to my colleagues--it \ncouldn't be that, could it? I don't know the explanation.\n  Americans are worried that their employer will drop their health care \ncoverage because of the cost of biologics. A 12-year biologic monopoly \nballoons the cost of employee-sponsored health care. Consumers worry \nthat they won't be able to afford individual coverage. You will see, in \nsome cases, some employers totally ending their health care coverage \noverall--the insurance they have for employees--because of the cost of \nbiologics. Imagine you are a company with 100 employees, and you are a \ngenerous employer and you pay your people pretty well, and you are \ndoing OK in this economy--not great but you have insurance for \neverybody; and of these 100 employees you have, say 4 or 5 get really \nsick. Say one takes Herceptin and one takes Remicade and one takes \nanother one of these drugs--say, the $100,000 drug, Avastin. Do you \nknow what that employer is going to have to do because of the cost? \nThey are probably going to have to end health care coverage for all of \ntheir\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\nemployees because they have three or four employees taking these drugs.\n  We must fight back for Kyl and his family from Franklin County in \ncentral Ohio. Kyl's sister nearly lost her house because of the costs \nof fighting a series of immune-related diseases. Kyl's father works 50 \nhours a week in a food service job, with no health care benefits. Yet \nhe has diabetes and heart trouble. Kyl writes that his father had to \nstop taking medications because he cannot afford the cost.\n  We are asking them to wait 12 years so that biotech companies can \nmake even more--give them 12 years of monopoly protection.\n  I want these companies to do well. That is why I support more NIH \nfunding. A lot of these companies get started by using taxpayer dollars \nfor their research. Taxpayer-funded research is a good thing. It means \ninventions. And biologics are wonderful. I want them to be profitable \nand to innovate and to have incentive to do that. But 12 years of extra \nmonopoly protection that nobody else in our system has?\n  We must fight for Laura and her family, from Lake County, OH. She is \nan 80-year-old mother of two sons who have struggled with serious \nmedical conditions. One son is a brain cancer survivor, who cannot \nafford medicine or health insurance. He cannot get it because of his \npreexisting condition. Her other son has battled years of illnesses, \nmainly rheumatoid arthritis. His existing insurance coverage doesn't \ncover Remicade, which is the drug I talked about earlier. Remicade \ncosts $20,000 a year, about $2,000 a month. If you have some insurance, \nmaybe you can get it for a little less. But this employer wouldn't \ncover the brandname drug. Laura writes that her sons' health care costs \nfar exceed their ability to pay.\n\n  Remember that traditional medicines receive only 5 years of monopoly \nprotection. I am not the only one on the floor who thinks 12 years of \nunchecked monopoly protection is an irresponsible and inefficient \npathway to biologics. President Obama has recognized the need to create \nan approval process for generic biologics with 7 years of market \nexclusivity.\n  Consumer groups, patient safety advocates, insurance companies, labor \nunions, and medical professionals, and many companies, because they are \npaying the freight, want a safer and more efficient pathway to generic \nbiologics. They suggest 5 years, as my legislation originally did.\n  Groups from AARP to Families USA, to the National Organization for \nRare Disorders, to the Service Employees International Union, to Blue \nCross/Blue Shield have called for 7 years or less of monopoly \nprotection.\n  The FTC released a report which found that lengthy periods of \nexclusivity will actually harm patients, diminish innovation, and delay \naccess to affordable generic biologic drugs.\n  That is the only argument these biologics have, as they spread \ncampaign contributions around. They lobby the halls of Congress and \nhave spent literally millions already, and it is only July of 2009, but \nthey spend millions of dollars lobbying. The only argument they have is \nthey need 12 years of monopoly protection because, otherwise, they are \nnot going to innovate.\n  The FTC said if they have 12 years, they will get fat and lazy. They \nwon't innovate for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 years, because \nwhy innovate if they are getting $20,000, or $48,000, or $100,000 a \nyear for their drug? The FTC explodes the only argument they have.\n  Interestingly, the FTC study is the only study out there examining \nthis that is not paid for by the industry. The industry studies say one \nthing; the study paid for by the government and taxpayers, which \ndoesn't have a dog in this hunt, says something very different.\n  I find myself disagreeing with every issue from Medicare, to trade, \nto the Iraq war, to everything else. Even the Post today said:\n\n       With a name like the Affordable Health Care Choices Act, \n     you would think the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \n     Committee this month would have made an effort to provide \n     affordable health choices. But, instead, the bill includes a \n     provision that would create a 12-year market exclusivity \n     period [monopoly protection] for brand name biologic drugs. \n     This would drive costs to consumers above even current levels \n     [like the biotech companies aren't making enough with \n     $100,000 dollars a year drugs] making the title little more \n     than a mockery.\n\n  This is a very important issue. I hope when the health care reform \nbill comes to the floor, Congress will get involved on behalf of the \nAmericans they serve, the patients and taxpayers, and on behalf of \nAmerican business.\n  Let's hope Ohioans from Paulding to Preble, from Montgomery to \nMorrow, from Gallia to Guernsey--Ohioans suffering from MS, arthritis, \nAlzheimer's, cancer, diabetes, and Parkinson's--can afford these \nmedicines. Let's hope Congress will shake off, will ignore the pleas \nfrom lobbyists and recognize a 12-year monopoly reserved exclusively \nfor biologic manufacturers is more than a bonus--it is a boondoggle.\n  Let's hope that we in Congress take a stand for fiscal \nresponsibility, for common sense, and for the Americans we serve by \nratcheting down the 12-year monopoly sweetheart deal that the big drug \ncompanies are peddling.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to CDR Duane G. \nWolfe, a sailor from my home State of California who paid the ultimate \nprice in service to our country in Iraq.\n  Commander Wolfe, of Los Osos, CA, died on May 25, 2009, from injuries \nsuffered when his convoy was hit by a roadside bomb southeast of \nFallujah, Iraq.\n  He is the oldest Californian to have lost his life in either Iraq or \nAfghanistan to date, electing to continue to serve as a member of the \nU.S. military despite having the option to retire.\n  Commander Wolfe enlisted in the Navy in 1972 shortly after graduating \nhigh school and served on Active Duty for 5 years. In 1978, he joined \nthe Navy Reserves, where he served until his death. He also worked for \n24 years as a civilian employee at Vandenberg Air Force Base, rising to \nthe position of civilian deputy commander for installation support for \nthe 30th Mission Support Group.\n  As a member of the Navy Reserves, Commander Wolfe deployed to Iraq in \nDecember 2008 for a 6-month assignment. He served as the officer in \ncharge of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Al Anbar Area Office, \nleading a team that oversaw nearly $300 million in construction \nprojects including many that provide essential services to the Iraqi \npeople. He was due to return home on July 10, 2009.\n  In addition to his military service, Commander Wolfe was a longtime \ndeacon for the Los Osos Church of Christ where he taught Bible classes \nand occasionally filled in as a substitute preacher. He was a skilled \nlifelong athlete who loved golfing and playing basketball, and a \ntalented mechanic, with a particular aptitude for both construction and \ncar repair.\n  At the age of 19, Commander Wolfe met his wife Cindi, to whom he was \nmarried for 34 happy years. He and his wife have three children, \nCarrie, Katie and Evan, who remember their father for his kindness, \nwarmth, and dedication to his family and country.\n  Commander Wolfe will be posthumously awarded the Bronze Star with \n``V'' Device for Valor, the Purple Heart, the Navy Combat Action \nRibbon, the National Defense Service Medal with Service Star, the Iraqi \nCampaign Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with ``M'' Device for \nMobilization, and the Overseas Service Ribbon, commemorating his \ncourage and extraordinary sacrifice in service to our country.\n  Nothing can fully account for the loss suffered by Commander Wolfe's \nfamily and all those who loved him.\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\nBut I hope they can take comfort in the knowledge that he will be \nforever honored and remembered by a grateful nation.\n  As we remember Commander Wolfe and honor his service to the United \nStates, we are also reminded of the eight other Californians who have \nbeen killed in Iraq since April 21. This brings to 879 the number of \nservicemembers either from California or based in California that have \nbeen killed while serving our country in Iraq.

Mr. President, I appreciate the assistance of the \nchairman and ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services last \nweek in clearing an amendment I offered to the fiscal year 2010 \nNational Defense Authorization Act dealing with irregular warfare \naircraft. As the conference committee prepares to resolve the \ndifferences between the House and Senate versions of the NDAA, I want \nto provide in the Record some context for this provision.\n  Years of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq have shown that insurgents \ntake refuge among regular civilians to complicate our ability to find \nthem and increase the chances of civilian casualties that inflame local \npopulations. We also have learned that fighting insurgencies requires \nan enormous amount of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, \nISR, data. Our highly advanced tactical aircraft can perform close air \nsupport, light strike, and ISR missions, but repeatedly using such \nfighters for these missions shortens their lifespan without ever \nemploying their most advanced capabilities. It is like buying a laptop \ncomputer to use as a calculator.\n  Indeed, smaller, lighter planes designed for counterinsurgency \nmissions can provide the firepower and intelligence data the warfighter \nneeds at a fraction of the cost to purchase and operate bigger, faster \naircraft. Moreover, such aircraft would allow us to provide ideal \nplatforms to partner nations struggling to develop their own air forces \nand deal with local insurgencies.\n  Secretary Gates, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General \nSchwartz, and other officials from the Air Force, Navy, and special \noperations forces have commented recently that the Department of \nDefense needs to consider developing a light strike, light \nreconnaissance aircraft specifically designed for irregular warfare. \nAnd to their credit, the Air Force and Navy are beginning to explore \nthe utility of such aircraft in detail.\n  I want to ensure, however, that the Department of Defense makes the \nbest possible use of money Congress has already spent in this area. \nOver the past 2 fiscal years, Congress has appropriated $8.4 million to \nthe Air National Guard for a project to demonstrate the capabilities of \na light strike, light reconnaissance aircraft. In fact, the \ndemonstrator aircraft in that project made its first flight yesterday \nand will demonstrate its capabilities over the course of the rest of \nthis year. The knowledge gained in this demonstration program should be \nincorporated into the Air Force, Navy, and special\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\noperations discussions of manned irregular warfare aircraft.\n  My amendment, then, simply declares it the sense of Congress that the \nSecretary of Defense should include the reserve components when \nestablishing requirements for manned airborne irregular warfare \nplatforms. Congress has led the way in examining the concept of a light \nattack, light reconnaissance aircraft. In this era of constrained \ndefense budgets, it is vital to make every dollar count. I am pleased \nthat in this amendment the Senate signaled the importance of reserve \ncomponent work on this concept, and I hope that the language is \nretained in conference so the House can send a similar signal. It is \nincreasingly clear that the Nation needs this capability, and the \ncombined efforts of all components at the Defense Department will bring \nthese aircraft to the warfighter sooner rather than later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8189-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE ELEMENT\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, there are some very important provisions \nin the Armed Services Committee bill, S. 1390, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2010, regarding the Ground-based \nMidcourse Defense, GMD, element of the Ballistic Missile Defense \nSystem, BMDS. GMD is a system designed to protect the homeland against \nlong-range missile threats. Would the chairman agree that GMD plays an \nimportant role in the architecture of the overall BMDS?\n  Mr. LEVIN. GMD is an important element of the overall Ballistic \nMissile Defense System. It is important that the GMD element be an \noperationally effective, cost-effective, affordable, reliable, \nsuitable, and survivable system capable of defending the United States \nfrom the threat of long-range missile attacks from nations such as \nNorth Korea and Iran, and that adequate resources be available to \nachieve such capabilities.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, Alaska plays a critical role in GMD. The \nmajority of infrastructure currently required to support deployment of \nthe GMD system is located at Fort Greely in Alaska. Recently, the \nMissile Defense Agency determined that in order to ensure the best \ninfrastructure is available to support deployment of interceptors from \nAlaska in defense of the Nation, a seven-silo configuration in Missile \nField 2 is warranted to replace older, less reliable, silos in Missile \nField 1. In the Armed Services Committee report accompanying S. 1390, \nthe committee expressed the view that, if the Department of Defense \nbelieves there is a benefit to completing the seven silos at Missile \nField 2 during fiscal year 2010, the committee would look favorably \nupon a reprogramming request from the Secretary of Defense to provide \nthe funds to complete the seven-silos in fiscal year 2010. Would the \nchairman agree that providing a seven silo capability in Missile Field \n2 is beneficial to GMD in defense of the homeland?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with my colleague from Alaska that Fort Greely \nplays an integral role in supporting the GMD element of Ballistic \nMissile Defense System, and will continue to do so in the future. \nConstructing Missile Field 2 in a seven-silo configuration to replace \nthe older silos at Missile Field 1 will provide updated and more \nreliable infrastructure in support of GMD. If the Department of Defense \nbelieves there is a benefit to completing the seven silos in fiscal \nyear 2010 and the Secretary submits a reprogramming request to do so, I \nbelieve the committee would look favorably upon such a request, \nalthough subject to evaluation of course. If the Department does not \nsubmit such a reprogramming request, I believe the Department will \nrequest the funds to complete construction of the seven-silos in fiscal \nyear 2011.\n  Mr. BEGICH.: I thank the chairman for his response. Section 243 of S. \n1390, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010, \nwould require the Department of Defense to submit to Congress early \nnext year two reports concerning the GMD element. Would the chairman \nagree that until the reports required in section 243 of S. 1390 are \ndelivered to Congress the Department of Defense should not make any \nirreversible decision concerning operational silos in Missile Field 2 \nat Fort Greely, and that decommissioning of Missile Field 1 should not \nbe completed until the seven-silos have been emplaced at Missile Field \n2?\n  Mr. LEVIN. During consideration of S. 1390, the Senate adopted an \namendment, offered by the Senator from Alaska, that would require the \nSecretary of Defense to ensure that Missile Field 1 does not complete \ndecommissioning until seven-silos have been emplaced at Missile Field \n2. It would also require the Secretary to ensure that no irreversible \ndecision is made with respect to the disposition of operational silos \nat Missile Field 2 until 60 days after the reports required by section \n243 are submitted to Congress.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the chairman and appreciate his work on improving \nGMD and recognizing Alaska's infrastructure is necessary to support GMD \nin defense of the homeland now and in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8189-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8189-S8190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               U.S.-CHINA STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC DIALOGUE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the meeting of the U.S.-China Strategic \nand Economic Dialogue this week in Washington is an important \nopportunity. It is a chance to advance a comprehensive relationship \nbetween our two countries and to highlight the importance of \nfundamental rights to that relationship.\n  I am chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. The \nCommission examines human rights and rule of law developments in China. \nIn recent years, I have witnessed human rights concerns being pushed to \nthe margins of the U.S.-China relationship. This is due in part to \nChina's growing financial, diplomatic and military strength. Sidelining \nour human rights concerns with China is a strategic mistake for the \nU.S.\n  The advancement of human rights concerns with China is more important \nto U.S. interests than ever. The reporting of the Commission I chair \nmakes this crystal clear.\n  Press censorship in China makes it possible for toxic food and public \nhealth crises to spread globally.\n  The harassment of whistleblowers and the suppression of criticism and \ndissent remove internal checks against environmental damage that not \nonly hurts ordinary Chinese citizens but has a global impact.\n  Abuses of low-wage labor compromise goods that come to the U.S. have \nharmed U.S. consumers, as well as Chinese consumers.\n  The government's control of mass media and the internet allow it to \nstoke nationalist anger against the United States in moments of crisis. \nThis can be terribly dangerous.\n  Let there be no doubt--I have enormous respect for China. I respect \nthe progress China has made by lifting hundreds of millions of people \nout of poverty. I admire its rich and remarkable culture and immensely \ntalented people. But I firmly believe that its people should be free to \nspeak their minds and practice their chosen faiths without fear.\n  The news is not all bad. There have been positive developments in \nrecent years. The government has enshrined in its Constitution the \nstate's responsibility to protect and promote human rights. The \nCongressional-Executive Commission on China has also reported on \nChina's recent adoption of new labor protections, and the relaxing of \nrestrictions on foreign journalists inside China. These and other gains \nwere made partly as a result of sustained international pressure. The \nmeeting of the Strategic Economic Dialogue presents another opportunity \nto press for more such gains.\n  But let us be clear: Nothing we ask of China regarding human rights \nis inconsistent with commitments to international standards to which \nChina in principal already has agreed. So we are not necessarily \nlooking just for more agreements. We are waiting for action. We are \nwaiting for China's leaders to demonstrate true commitment, not just in \nwords but in deeds, to prioritizing human rights, including worker \nrights, and the development of the rule of law in no lesser way than \nthey have prioritized economic reform.\n  In closing, the Strategic and Economic Dialogue this week provides an \nopportunity to underline how advancing the welfare of citizens must not \nbe separated from a demonstrated commitment to human rights and the \nrule\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\nof law. To remain faithful to our pursuit of basic American values, we \nmust seize that opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8190-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SERVICE OF BRETT NILSSON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Brett Nilsson \nas he nears the completion of his service as the chairman of the \nIndependent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, IIABA.\n  If I may, let me just start by saying I am proud to count Brett as \nboth a constituent and a friend. Indeed, it goes without saying that \nfor close to 20 years Brett has been a very busy man and is someone who \nhas been dedicated to both our Nation and to Utah through the service \nhe has provided.\n  On the national level, Brett has served on IIABA's Communications and \nFinance Committees, the later of which, I might add, he chaired from \n1999 to 2003. After his chairmanship of the association's Finance \nCommittee, Brett was then elected to IIABA's Executive Committee in \n2003 and then nominated as the association's chairman last September in \n2008. In Utah, Brett spent a year serving as president of the \nIndependent Insurance Agents of Utah from 1992 to 1993 and as the \nnational board director from Utah for 9 years. All of this, of course, \nis in addition to his own personal career where he is the senior vice \npresident for the Buckner Company in Ogden, UT.\n  Founded in 1896, IIABA is the Nation's oldest association of \nindependent insurance agents and brokers. At last count the association \nrepresents an astounding network of more than 300,000 agents, brokers, \nand their employees. Throughout his tenure as chairman of the \nassociation, Brett has been the lead on a number of issues including \nhealth insurance reform and insurance regulatory reform. Additionally, \nBrett has worked assiduously to build the Trusted Choice brand and \nadvance the association's InVEST Program, which is a school-to-work \ninsurance program that partners with community college and high school \neducators to offer a practical and innovative program of study for \nstudents.\n  Above all, and perhaps most-importantly, Brett has been committed to \nhis family, his business, and our community in Utah. He was a vice \npresident of the Ogden Jaycees, he participated on several chamber of \ncommerce committees, and he is a past president of the Ogden Golf and \nCountry Club. He has served on a number of different insurance company \nagent advisory councils. He was awarded Utah's Agent of the Year, and \nYoung Agent of the Year and, as if those recognitions were not enough, \nin 2001 he also received an IIABA Presidential Citation. All of this, \nhowever, has only served as icing on the cake when, in 2003, Brett \nreceived our State association's highest individual honor, the Burgener \nAward--a unique distinction awarded only five other times in the \nhistory of the association in Utah.\n  Today, Mr. President, I join with many Utahns and people from across \nthe Nation in thanking Brett for his work with IIABA over the years and \nfor his dedication to his professional career, our community, and our \nState. His efforts are greatly appreciated and have not gone \nunrecognized. For that, I wish him, his beautiful wife Nancy, and their \nfour children and eight grandchildren the very best in their future \nendeavors, adventures, and service to others. I am certain they are \nlooking forward to having a little more free time with grandpa, and I \nknow we are all looking forward to next chapter of Brett's career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8190-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          HONORING THE SERVICE OF CLARENCE ``CAL'' W. MARSELLA\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to offer congratulations and \ngratitude to Clarence ``Cal'' W. Marsella on the occasion of his \nretirement as general manager of the Denver Regional Transportation \nDistrict, RTD.\n  Under Cal's leadership, the Denver region has become a national model \nof how effective public transit service can improve the quality of \nlife, environment, and energy efficiency of a region. Cal was able to \nbring local, State, and Federal officials together behind a shared \nvision for our region, build a transit system matched to our region's \ngrowth patterns, and help us all remain committed to preserving one of \nthe Nation's most unique and precious environments. At the same time, \nhe has been a national champion for the idea that mass transit is the \nkey to our energy independence.\n  Cal Marsella was hired as RTD's general manager in August 1995. \nDuring his service, he oversaw the completion of three new light rail \nlines on time and on budget, including the T-REX light rail project \nthat opened November 17, 2006. Reflecting his performance and the \nstrong public trust in RTD, metro area voters in 2004 overwhelmingly \napproved the FasTracks transit expansion program for the entire eight-\ncounty metro area. This represents the largest transit-only voter \napproved program in the entire country. With Cal's skill, \ndetermination, and effort, progress on the FasTracks program has moved \nahead swiftly, and construction is currently underway on the new West \nCorridor.\n  Mr. Marsella began his transportation career in the highway \nengineering division of the State of Connecticut Department of \nTransportation in 1974, armed with a masters' degree in public affairs \nand a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Connecticut. He \nnow serves on the National Academy of Sciences Transportation Research \nBoard and regularly guest lectures at the University of Denver and the \nUniversity of Colorado master's degree programs in transportation and \npublic administration. In recent years, Cal has received national \nhonors commensurate with his leadership and achievements. He was \nselected by the American Public Transportation Association as the \nOutstanding Public Transportation Manager in 2006 and, under his \nmanagement RTD, was selected as the Outstanding Transportation Agency \nin North America in both 2003 and 2008.\n  I congratulate and extend my sincere gratitude to Cal Marsella for \nhis service to the Denver region and the State of Colorado. I wish him \ncontinued success and all good fortune in his work ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8190-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8190-S8191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             150TH ANNIVERSARY OF VERMILLION, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 150th \nanniversary of the founding of one of South Dakota's great cities, \nVermillion. Sitting atop a bluff on the Missouri River in the southeast \ncorner of the State, Vermillion is the county seat for Clay County. \nWith its growing economic development, strong workforce, and diverse \ndemographics, Vermillion has an exceptional quality of life, and I am \nproud to call it my hometown.\n  Deriving its name from the Sioux word for ``red stream,'' Vermillion \nwas founded in 1859 after first being visited by French fur traders. \nJust 3 years later in 1862 the University of South Dakota was founded, \nmaking it the State's oldest institution of higher education. After a \nharsh winter, the city of Vermillion faced what would later become \nknown as the Great Flood of 1881. By the flood's end, over 100 \nbuildings were destroyed, and transportation was stalled for months due \nto damage to railroads and bridges. The town's businesspeople quickly \nresponded and rebuilt the town on top of the bluff. After relocating, \nthe city continued to flourish with the advance of technological \ninnovations at the turn of the century. In 1895, the Vermillion Milling \nCompany received a franchise to operate an electric utility and provide \nelectric lights. In 1902, Vermillion saw the installation of a city \nsewer system and steam powered automobiles on its streets. Throughout \nits rich and colorful history, Vermillion has continued to grow and \nprosper.\n  Today, Vermillion boasts a wide variety of educational, cultural, and \nrecreational opportunities. It is home to many places of interest \nincluding the Shrine to Music Museum, founded in 1973. This national \nmusic museum is one of the greatest institutions of its kind in the \nworld. The facility holds many instruments from renowned collections \nand has been recognized as ``A Landmark of American Music'' by the \nNational Music Council. Additionally, the city's attractions include \nthe Austin-Whittemore House, the Oscar Howe Gallery, the Dakota Dome, \nthe W.H. Over Museum, Spirit Mound, and beautiful riverside trails.\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\n  Vermillion is celebrating its sesquicentennial with a variety of \nevents including tours of the newly completed Vermillion City Hall, a \ncommunity barbeque, school reunions and dances, a 5K Fun Run/Walk, an \nairshow, and a concert by Ratingen Youth Wind Orchestra from \nVermillion's Sister City of Ratingen, Germany. These activities will \nserve as a reminder of the shared history of the community and bring \nthe tight-knit people of Vermillion even closer together. Vermillion is \nholding a flag design contest to pay additional tribute to this \nhistoric milestone. The city has previously unveiled its official \nsesquicentennial logo, designed by Erin Helsa, a 2006 graduate of \nVermillion High School.\n  As a native of Vermillion, I am pleased to publicly honor the \nachievements of this wonderful South Dakota community as they reach \nthis juncture. I congratulate the citizens of Vermillion on their \naccomplishments over the last 150 years and look forward to seeing \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8191-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ANNIVERSARY OF FARMERS STATE BANK IN HOSMER, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, with great honor, I wish to \nrecognize the 90th anniversary of Farmers State Bank in Hosmer, SD.\n  After being chartered in 1919, Farmers State Bank opened its doors to \nthe public on August 2, 1920. In the following years, Farmers State \nBank was able to withstand the Great Depression and operate on a sound \nbasis. In 1931, it consolidated with Hillsview State Bank and stayed \nunder the Farmers State Bank name. John, Arthur, and Helen Haerter were \namong the bank's first stockholders and served as the first president, \nvice president, and cashier, respectively. Throughout its history, the \nbank has remained within the Haerter family. Today, the current members \nof the board of directors are Bruce Haerter, Joyce Haerter, John A. \nHaerter, Doris Haerter, and John Schwan.\n  After 90 years of growth, Farmers State Bank still embodies the \nentrepreneurial health of South Dakota and the spirit of community in \nour local lending institutions. I strongly commend all the Farmers \nState Bank's employees on their years of hard work and dedication, and \nI am very pleased that the institution and its people are being \npublicly honored and celebrated on this memorable occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8191-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING DEBORAH WEINSTEIN\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

A Bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \ngrant program to provide supportive services in permanent supportive \nhousing for chronically homeless individuals and families, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator Burr, in \nreintroducing the Services for Ending Long-Term Homelessness Act, \nSELHA.\n  It is estimated that between 2.5 and 3.5 million Americans experience \na period of homelessness in a given year. With the current economy, \nwith more Americans losing their jobs and their homes, it is likely \nthat the total has risen. While the majority of these individuals will \nonly be homeless for a brief period of time, a growing segment is \nexperiencing prolonged periods of homelessness. Roughly 124,000 \nAmericans fall under the category of chronically homeless. In my state \nof Rhode Island, approximately ten percent of homeless individuals \ncycle in and out of homelessness.\n  In March 2003, former Department of Health and Human Services \nSecretary Tommy Thompson issued a report that defined the issues and \nchallenges facing the chronically homeless and developed a \ncomprehensive approach to bringing the appropriate services and \ntreatments to this population of individuals who typically fall outside \nof mainstream support programs.\n  The same year, the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health also \nrecommended the development of a comprehensive plan to facilitate \naccess to permanent supportive housing for individuals and families who \nare chronically homeless. Affordable housing, alone, is not enough for \nmany chronically homeless to achieve stability. This population also \nneeds flexible, mobile, and individualized support services to sustain \nthem in housing.\n  Since the Commission made the recommendations, approximately 60,000 \nunits of permanent supportive housing have been developed and currently \nanother 30,000 are under development. Numerous studies conducted by \ncities and states across the country demonstrate that supportive \nhousing can save local governments between $15,000 and $30,000 that \nwould otherwise be spent in publicly funded shelters, hospitals--\nincluding VA hospitals--and prisons. The savings nearly pays for the \ncost of supportive housing and the outcome is much different; indeed it \nis much improved. Permanent supportive housing results in better mental \nand physical health, employment, greater income, fewer arrests, better \nprogress toward recovery, self sufficiency, and less homelessness.\n  However, funding for supportive services to complement these housing \nefforts continues to be an issue. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday is critical to the development and implementation of more \neffective strategies to combat chronic homelessness through improved \nservice delivery and coordination across federal agencies serving this \npopulation. It directs the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, SAMHSA, to coordinate its Federal efforts with the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, other Federal departments \nthat provide supportive housing, and various agencies within HHS that \nprovide supportive services.\n  This bipartisan measure is designed to help improve coordination and \nensure access to the range of supportive services that the growing \nnumber of chronically homeless Americans need to get back on their \nfeet. Our bill brings together permanent supportive housing and \nservices, the essential tools to enable these individuals to begin to \ntake the steps necessary to once again become productive and active \nmembers of our communities.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues toward passage of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Corker, \n        Mr. Risch, and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 1524. A bill to strengthen the capacity, transparency, and \naccountability of United States foreign assistance programs to \neffectively adapt and respond to new challenges of the 21st century, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for the past 6 months, the administration \nhas been busy laying the groundwork for a new development agenda.\n  First, the President issued a bold 2010 international affairs budget \nthat significantly increases funding for vital programs in Pakistan and \nAfghanistan, begins to rebuild our diplomatic and development capacity, \nand renews our commitment to essential programs from education to HIV/\nAIDS and hunger.\n  Then, earlier this month, President Obama and other G8 leaders \nannounced a $20 billion food security partnership to provide small \nfarmers in poor countries with the seeds, fertilizers, and equipment \nthey need to break a decades-long cycle of hunger, malnutrition and \ndependency. Finally, the State Department unveiled plans for a \n``Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review,'' a comprehensive \nassessment designed to improve policy, strategy, and planning at the \nState Department.\n  While we are still awaiting a nominee to head the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development I am confident that a name will soon be \nforthcoming.\n  These are welcome changes that demonstrate this Administration's \ncommitment to a vigorous reform process and a bold development plan. \nCongress will be a strong partner in those efforts--providing the \nresources, legislation, and authorities to ensure that our development \nprograms are funded and designed to meet our priorities.\n  While there is some debate on what form foreign aid reform should \ntake, there is a broad consensus in the development community about why \nreform matters.\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\n  Experts agree that the strength of our development programs is \ndirectly linked to success or failure in front-line states like \nAfghanistan and Pakistan.\n  They agree that USAID is more critical to achieving our foreign \npolicy objectives than ever before--yet it lacks the tools, capacity \nand expertise to fulfill its mission.\n  They agree that too often decision-makers lack basic information \nabout the actual impact of our development programs.\n  They also agree that excessive bureaucracy and regulations and \nfragmented coordination are hampering our efforts to swiftly and \neffectively deliver assistance.\n  And they agree that even as we plan for broad, fundamental reform, \nthere are many steps we can take in the interim to dramatically improve \nthe effectiveness of our foreign aid efforts.\n  We assembled a small bipartisan Senate working group to formulate \nlegislation that makes short-term improvements while setting the stage \nfor longer-term reform. Senators Lugar, Menendez, Corker and I have \nbeen developing initial reform legislation that we believe goes a long \nway towards improving our short-term capacity to deliver foreign aid in \na more accountable, thoughtful and strategic manner.\n  One provision in the bill that we believe is particularly important \nestablishes an independent evaluation group, based in the executive \nbranch, to measure and evaluate the impact and results of all U.S. \nforeign aid programs, across all departments and agencies. This new \ninstitution--the Council on Research and Evaluation of Foreign \nAssistance--can address a fundamental knowledge gap in our foreign aid \nprograms--quite simply, it will help us understand which programs work, \nwhich do not, and why.\n  I want to emphasize, this legislation only represents the first step \nin a longer reform process. But we believe it sends an important \nbipartisan signal that foreign aid reform will be a priority for this \ncommittee in the years ahead. I am pleased that Senators Risch and \nCardin will join as original cosponsors to the bill.\n  When John F. Kennedy spoke at the founding of USAID, in 1961, he \narticulated a basic truth about our foreign policy. We cannot escape \nour moral obligation to be a wise leader in the community of free \nnations. Kennedy warned that--``To fail to meet those obligations now \nwould be disastrous; and, in the long run, more expensive. For \nwidespread poverty and chaos lead to a collapse of existing political \nand social structures which would inevitably invite the advance of \ntotalitarianism into every weak and unstable area. Thus our own \nsecurity would be endangered and our prosperity imperiled.''\n  Just substitute violent extremism for totalitarianism and the quote \nis as accurate today as it was then. Just as we did in Marshall's time \nand Kennedy's time, America today has a chance to return to a foreign \npolicy that is not just seen by people everywhere, but felt and lived, \none that translates our promises into real value and real progress on \nthe ground--one that improves people's daily lives, inspires them, and \nearns their respect.\n  The good news is that, as we rebuild our civilian institutions, there \nwill so many chances to lead in the process. We are living in a moment \nof volatility, but also--emphatically--a moment of possibility.\n  Infant mortality rates dropped by 27 percent worldwide since 1990. By \n2015, let us cut under-five mortality by 2/3. Life expectancy is eight \nyears higher than it was in 1990--but we can do better by cutting \nhunger and poverty in half and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDs, \nmalaria and other major diseases. Primary school enrollment has \nincreased by 10 percent--it is time we made it universal. While we are \nat it, let us eliminate gender disparity in education once and for all.\n  History teaches us that America is safest and strongest when we \nunderstand that our security will not be protected by military means \nalone. It must be protected as well by our generosity, by our example, \nby powerful outreach, and by instilling a palpable sense in the people \nof the world that we understand--and share their destiny. That has \nalways inspired people, and it always will. It undercuts our enemies, \nit empowers our friends--and it keeps us safer.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nJohn Kerry, in introducing the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and \nAccountability Act of 2009. Our colleagues, Senators Corker, Menendez, \nRisch, and Cardin, join us in this effort as original cosponsors.\n  The role of foreign assistance in achieving U.S. foreign policy \nobjectives has come into sharper focus since 2001. President Bush \nelevated development as a third pillar of the U.S. National Security \nStrategy. President Obama pledged to double foreign assistance, and \nannounced new initiatives on global food security and health. Secretary \nClinton announced a quadrennial review of diplomacy and development. \nThese initiatives are likely to have far reaching implications for \nforeign assistance policy and organization.\n  For development to play its full role in our national security \nstructure, the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, must \nbe a strong agency with the resources to accomplish the missions we \ngive it. Earlier this month, Secretary Clinton stated: ``I want USAID \nto be seen as the premier development agency in the world, both \ngovernmental and NGO. I want people coming here to consult with us \nabout the best way to do anything having to do with development.'' I \nshare the sentiments expressed by Secretary Clinton, and I have \nconfidence in the extraordinary development expertise housed at USAID.\n  But during the last two decades, decision-makers have not made it \neasy for USAID to perform its vital function. Even as we have \nrediscovered the importance of foreign assistance, we find ourselves \nwith a frail foundation to support a robust development strategy. We \nhave increased funds for development and elevated its priority, while \nallowing USAID to atrophy. Many new programs have been located outside \nUSAID with roughly two dozen departments and agencies having taken over \nsome aspects of foreign assistance, including the Department of \nDefense. Each of these agencies naturally considers itself the lead \nagency in its sector, provoking competition among agencies rather than \ncoordination and coherence. We do not really know whether these \nprograms are complementary or working at cross-purposes.\n  USAID's staffing and expertise have declined markedly since the \n1980s. There are only five engineers left; 23 education officers are \ntasked with overseeing different programs in 84 countries. Decisions to \nreorganize in pursuit of better coordination between the Department of \nState and USAID resulted in the latter's loss of evaluation, budget, \nand policy capacity. Much of the work of running America's development \nprograms is now farmed out to private contractors.\n  I believe the starting point for any future design of our assistance \nprograms and organization should not be the status quo, but rather the \nperiod in which we had a well-functioning and well-resourced aid \nagency. To be a full partner in support of foreign policy objectives, \nUSAID must have the capacity to participate in policy, planning, and \nbudgeting. The migration of these functions to the State Department has \nfed the impression that an independent aid agency no longer exists.\n  It the administration pursues the goal of doubling foreign assistance \nover time, it is crucial that Congress has confidence that these funds \nwill be used efficiently. USAID must have the capacity to evaluate \nprograms and disseminate information about best practices and methods \nand it must have a central role in development policy decisions.\n  The legislation that we introduce today promotes capacity, \naccountability, and transparency in U.S. foreign assistance programs. \nIt has received strong initial support from outside groups led by the \nModernizing Foreign Assistance Network. There are three deficiencies we \nare trying to address.\n  First, the evaluation of assistance programs and the dissemination of \nknowledge have deteriorated in the last couple of decades. While USAID \nwas a respected voice in this regard during the 1980s, its evaluation \ncapacity has been allowed to wither. The bill strengthens USAID's \nmonitoring and\n\n[[Page S8200]]\n\nevaluation capacity with the creation of an internal evaluation and \nknowledge center. The bill also re-establishes a policy and planning \nbureau. It is crucial that USAID be able to fully partner with the \nState Department in decisions relating to development.\n  Second, U.S. foreign assistance programs are littered among some two \ndozen agencies with little or no coordination. We do not have adequate \nknowledge of whether programs are complementary or working at cross-\npurposes. The bill requires all government agencies with a foreign \nassistance role to make information about its activities publicly \navailable in a timely fashion. It designates the USAID Mission Director \nas responsible for coordinating all development and humanitarian \nassistance in-country. It creates an independent evaluation and \nresearch organization that can analyze and evaluate foreign assistance \nprograms across government.\n  Third, staffing and expertise at USAID have declined since the early \n1990s, even as funding for foreign assistance programs has increased. \nThis decline in capacity has resulted in other agencies stepping in to \nfill the gap. While Congress has begun to provide the necessary \nresources to rebuild this capacity, the agency does not have a human \nresources strategy to guide hiring and deployment decisions. The bill \nwould require such a strategy and a high-level task force to advise on \ncritical personnel issues. The bill also encourages increased training \nand inter-agency rotations to build expertise and effectiveness.\n  It is especially important that Congress weigh in on this issue \nbecause the Administration has yet to appoint a USAID Administrator or \nfill any confirmable positions in the agency. Without an Administrator \nin place, USAID is likely to have less of a role in the current State \nDepartment review than it should have. The State Department review \nprocess should include strong voices advocating for an independent aid \nagency.\n  Both Congress and the State Department should be offering proposals \non how to improve development assistance. Our legislation does not rule \nout any options that the State Department may propose as a result of \nits review. But ultimately, Congress will have to make decisions on \nresources for development programs. Given budget constraints, it is \nessential that Congress has confidence in how development resources are \nspent. Building capacity at USAID will be an important part of this \ncalculation.\n  The issues that we face today--from chronic poverty and hunger to \nviolent acts of terrorism--require that we work seamlessly toward \nidentifiable goals. I look forward to working with colleagues to \nimprove and support the development mission that benefits our long-term \nsecurity.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, with my \ncolleagues Senators Kerry, Lugar, and Corker, legislation that will \nhelp strengthen the foreign assistance efforts of the United States. We \nhave put together a piece of legislation that helps move our collective \nforeign assistance efforts in the right direction.\n  I am pleased that we have worked very closely and in a bipartisan \nfashion on this legislation and I want to thank my colleagues for their \nwork. Foreign assistance is something that is of great interest to many \nmembers of the Foreign Relations Committee. While we may disagree on \nthe overall resources that should be devoted to development assistance, \nI think we all agree that the resources we do provide should be used in \nthe best way possible.\n  I also want to thank the broader community of people who have been \nsupportive of these efforts for years. I cannot tell you how many \nletters from people in New Jersey and from around the country I have \nreceived on these issues. These individuals, and the groups who help \nadvocate for these issues are an important voice in the process.\n  President Obama has pledged to double foreign assistance by 2012. In \nthis context, it is now more important than ever for the Congress to \nknow which U.S. Government programs are the best investments. Right \nnow, we have too little evidence that is objective and independent \nabout which U.S. Government Agencies should have their budgets \nincreased and which should be held constant or decreased. This \nlegislation will help provide a more objective basis for this kind of \ndecisionmaking. It will help both the Congress and the administration \nto make smarter, more analytical decisions about which agencies should \ncarry out what programs, and help build more rigorous analysis across \nU.S. Government programs that may be working on similar issues.\n  Foreign assistance is not just an issue of morality or an issue that \nis driven by a sense of doing what is right for the most \ndisenfranchised around the world--these issues are directly in our \nnational interests and our national security interests. Every time we \nprovide credit to a farmer who is displaced or training to a woman who \nwants to run a business out of her home, we are making inroads to the \nbread and butter issues that people care about. When we provide an \neffective alternative to illicit economic activity, we are dealing a \nblow against drugs coming to the streets of New Jersey, and helping to \nbuild the institutions around the world that will provide the framework \nfor stable and prosperous societies. We all want to live in a community \nwhere we can walk freely without fear of persecution, and without fear \nof our personal safety. No matter where you come from, these are a \nbasic set of principles that resonate with all of us.\n\n  Congress needs to see results, the American people need to see \nresults, and so do the millions of people around the world whose lives \nliterally depend on our ability to carry out these programs in the \nsmartest way possible. This is why we have included an independent \nmonitoring mechanism to evaluate the impact of our foreign assistance \nprograms. It's one thing to say that we handed out 500 textbooks or \ntrained 200 teachers, but it's far different to say that we improved \nthe aptitude of school children and that these improvements help \nconnect them to meaningful employment, which raised their household \nincome, which allowed them to eat better, access medical services, and \nso on . . . it's the difference between outputs and outcomes that we \nare trying to get at with the independent evaluation unit, as outlined \nin the legislation we are introducing today.\n  I have long believed that foreign assistance is a critical part of \nour overall engagement overseas and I have been a consistent advocate \nof stepping up our efforts in this area. In recent years, I have \nfocused on building up the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, USAID, from the inside out--I have called for building-up \nthe staff of USAID in a coherent and strategic manner--this bill will \nhelp do that.\n  Now that USAID is working alongside the Department of Defense in \nplaces like Iraq and Afghanistan, and immersed in complex situations \nlike those in Pakistan, Sudan, or Sri Lanka, we need an agency that is \nnimble, responsive, and ahead of the curve. From staffing, resources, \nand training, our development tools need to be, at the very least at \npar, if not ahead of our diplomatic and defense efforts.\n  One way to start us along this path is to focus on USAID's \nleadership. It needs credible and high-profile leadership that can work \nin partnership with the Congress, the Department of State, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the National Security Council. The \n``development voice'' in our Government needs to be a ``heavyweight \nvoice'' that commands respect both in Washington and around the world.\n  I believe USAID needs to take back resources and programs that have \nslowly been moved over to the Department of Defense. Having the \nDepartment of State or the Department of Defense control development \nstrategy and resources, with USAID simply serving as an implementing \nagency, has caused confusion and ambiguity. We ask our military to plan \nand execute a lot of missions; development should not be one of them. \nCivilian resources should be appropriated to civilian agencies.\n  Staff at USAID needs to be rebuilt--not just with more people, but we \nneed to make sure we have the right people and make sure we are \nattracting and retaining the best possible candidates. This bill will \nhelp us get there with the comprehensive human resource strategy that \nis mandated for human resources. We need to build up our foreign \nassistance programs not just where they used to be, but to where they \nneed to be.\n\n[[Page S8201]]\n\n  I look forward to continuing our work on these programs. This \nlegislation is a start, but there is much more work to be done. Let me \nbe clear--this bill, combined with additional resources is not going to \nfix everything--foreign assistance has its limits. However, I believe \nwe have not yet approached this limit. More resources, and better-spent \nresources, combined with active diplomatic and economic engagement will \nhelp build the institutions that will create more stable political, \nsocial, and economic systems.\n  Only until we recognize that the success of those systems is deeply \nconnected to the success of our own, will we begin to adequately \naddress the joint challenges that threaten our national security, our \neconomy, our way of life.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1526. A bill to establish and clarify that Congress does not \nauthorize persons convicted of dangerous crimes in foreign courts to \nfreely possess firearms in the United States; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the No \nFirearms for Foreign Felons Act of 2009. This bill would close a \nloophole that currently exists in law, by ensuring that people \nconvicted of foreign felonies and crimes involving domestic violence \ncannot possess firearms. I imagine that most Americans may be \nsurprised--as I was--to learn that foreign felons actually have greater \ngun rights than American citizens convicted of felonies and crimes of \ndomestic violence in our own courts.\n  In 1968, Congress passed the landmark Gun Control Act, ensuring that \nit was illegal for felons to possess firearms. I have been working \nsince 1994 to build upon that legacy and protect American families from \nsenseless gun violence.\n  Unfortunately, in 2005 the Supreme Court created a gaping loophole in \nthis longstanding felon-in-possession law. In the case of Small v. \nUnited States, a majority of the Court held that foreign felony is not \na bar to gun possession when those felons come to the U.S.\n  At the time, the Supreme Court was very much aware that its ruling \ncould lead to unintended consequences. Justice Clarence Thomas noted in \nhis dissent, ``the majority's interpretation permits those convicted \noverseas of murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, terrorism and other \ndangerous crimes to possess firearms freely in the United States.''\n  The majority of the Court identified a fundamental flaw in the Gun \nControl Act of 1968. Simply put, Congress was not clear enough. \nAlthough the law states that a person convicted of a felony ``in any \ncourt'' could not possess a firearm, the Court said that the phrase, \n``any court,'' applied only to American courts.\n  The federal felon-in-possession laws outlined in the Gun Control Act \nof 1968 has been applied to foreign felons from 1968 until the Small \ndecision in 2005. However, the Court found these arguments \nunpersuasive.\n  In their dissent, Justices Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy accused the \nmajority of creating a novel legal construction that would ``wreak \nhavoc'' with established rules of extraterritorial construction. But \nwhatever we may think of the Court's legal analysis, there is no doubt \nthat the Small decision is now the law of the land.\n  We must now make every effort to close this dangerous loophole and \nthe only way to do that is to pass the No Firearms for Foreign Fellons \nAct of 2009. The bill I am introducing today would do just that. Under \nthis bill, the Gun Control Act of 1968 is amended to ensure that \nconvictions in foreign courts are included. Similar changes would be \nmade in other sections of the Gun Control Act, where there are \nreferences to ``state offenses'' or ``offenses under state law''--the \nbill would expand these terms to include convictions for felony \noffenses committed abroad.\n  In other words, the bill would make it clear that if someone is \nconvicted in a foreign court of an offense that would have disqualified \nhim from possessing a firearm in the U.S. the same laws relating to gun \npossession would be applied.\n  As introduced, the only exception would involve a conviction in a \nforeign court that was invalid. In that specific situation, this bill \nwould allow a person convicted in a foreign court to challenge its \nvalidity. Under the bill, a foreign conviction will not constitute a \n``conviction'' for purposes of the felon-in-possession laws, if the \nforeign conviction either: resulted from a denial of fundamental \nfairness that would violate due process if committed in the United \nStates, or, if the conduct on which the foreign conviction was based \nwould be legal if committed in the U.S.\n  I expect that these circumstances will be fairly rare, but the bill \ndoes take them into account, and will provide a complete defense to \nanyone with an invalid foreign conviction under these specific \ncircumstances.\n  The need for action is clear. In 2001, U.S. law enforcement outfitted \nin bullet proof vests raided the New York City hotel room of Rohan \nIngram. Ingram was found with 13 different firearms, had an extensive \ncriminal background, including at least 18 convictions for crimes such \nas assault and use of deadly weapon. He was known to law enforcement as \n``armed and dangerous'' and they rightfully took all of the necessary \nprecautions to protect themselves. However, because all of his crimes \nhad occurred in Canada, his felon-in-possession of a firearm charge was \neventually thrown out of court. This is a direct result of the Supreme \nCourt case and illustrates a very dangerous loophole in our criminal \njustice system.\n  What we need to do as an institution is clear. We cannot keep in \nplace a policy that allows felons convicted overseas to possess \nfirearms. It simply makes no sense. In a country filled with senseless \ngun violence, we cannot continue to give foreign-convicted murderers, \nrapists and even terrorists an unlimited right to buy firearms and U.S. \nassault weapons in the U.S. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Recordd, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1526\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the \nPoultry Products Inspection Act to authorize the Secretary of \nAgriculture to order the recall of meat and poultry that is \nadulterated, misbranded, or otherwise unsafe; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nUnsafe Meat and Poultry Recall Act, to grant the Secretary of \nAgriculture the authority to order the recall of meat and poultry that \nis adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise unsafe.\n  Sadly, and in some cases tragically, in recent years recalls of \nunsafe food products has seemingly become a regular occurrence in our \nNation. Last week, a Denver-based grocery chain recalled 466,236 pounds \nof ground beef products that were distributed to stores in Colorado, \nKansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Utah, Wyoming, and my State of New Mexico. \nThe tainted meat is blamed for fourteen cases of salmonella and 6 \nhospitalizations.\n  Last year, the USDA requested a recall of 143 million pounds of beef \nfrom a slaughterhouse that was being investigated for unsafe practices. \nIn this instance, like most, the recalled beef had been distributed \nthroughout the country, including to my state of New Mexico where the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture's Commodity Foods Program had sent 3,000 \ncases of the questionable beef to the state's Human Services Department \nto be distributed to school lunch programs. Luckily, most of the beef \nwas found before it was served, but putting New Mexico's children at \nsuch a risk is clearly unacceptable.\n  The number of people affected annually from ingesting tainted meat \nand poultry products illuminates this proposition: 5,000 people die \nfrom food-borne illnesses each year; nearly 76 million people get sick \nannually from eating tainted food, of these individuals, 325,000 \nrequire hospitalization.\n  Shockingly, the USDA does not have the authority to issue mandatory \nrecalls of tainted meat and poultry products. Complying with agency \nrecalls, therefore, is at the industry's discretion. The meat industry \nsays that it has never failed to cooperate with a recall request from \nthe USDA, rendering mandatory recalls of tainted meat unnecessary. \nHowever, when the USDA asks for a recall, a negotiation process ensues \nbetween the agency and the industry. Meanwhile, thousands of people are \nat risk of eating the potentially harmful meat in the marketplace \nduring the ongoing negotiations.\n  It is the responsibility of the USDA to see that the poultry and \nmeatpacking industry produces only safe meat products. It is the right \nof American consumers to feel safe purchasing the meat sold in their \ngrocery stores. And it is the right of our cattle producers to know \nthat the beef they produce is being handled properly and sent into the \nmarket safely.\n  My bill would finally give the Secretary of Agriculture the power to \nensure that the meat in our Nation's markets is clean and safe.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1528. A bill to establish a Foreign Intelligence and Information \nCommission and for other purposes; to the Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwould establish an independent, bipartisan Foreign Intelligence and \nInformation Commission to significantly reform and improve our \nintelligence capabilities. On July 16, the bill was approved, on a \nbipartisan basis, by the Senate Intelligence Committee as an amendment \nto the Fiscal Year 2010 Intelligence Authorization bill. The bill is \nsimilar to the one I introduced in the last Congress with Senator \nHagel, which also had bipartisan support in the Intelligence Committee, \nand it is my hope and expectation that it will soon become law. The New \nYork Times has also expressed its support for the commission.\n  The work of this commission is critical to our national security. For \nyears, our intelligence officials have acknowledged that we lack \nadequate coverage around the world and that we have gaps in our ability \nto anticipate threats and crises before they emerge. The 2006 Annual \nReport of the Intelligence Community described how current crises \ndivert resources from emerging and strategic issues. In 2007, the \nDeputy Director of National Intelligence for Collection testified that \nwe need to ``pay attention to places that we are not.'' In 2008, the \nDNI testified that current crisis support ``takes a disproportionate \nshare'' of intelligence resources over emerging and strategic issues. \nEarlier this year, during his confirmation process, the current CIA \nDirector expressed his concern about the broad set of issues to which \ninsufficient resources are being devoted. The problem, in other words, \nis not new, nor is it unique to any administration. It is systematic \nand it results from structural problems in how we develop priorities \nand allocate resources.\n  These structural problems afflict the Intelligence Community, but \nthey are also much broader. Around the world, information our \ngovernment needs to inform our foreign policy and protect our country \nis obtained openly by State Department officials. Yet there is no \ninteragency strategy that integrates the capabilities of our diplomats \nand other embassy personnel with the activities of our clandestine \ncollectors. The result is big gaps in what we know about the world--\ngaps that don't necessarily require more spying.\n  This information pertains to instability and civil conflict, threats \nto democratic institutions, human rights abuses and corruption, and \nwhether we can count on the support of a country for our policies. This \ninformation is also directly related to the threat from al Qaeda, its \naffiliates and other terrorist organizations. The 9/11 Commission \nrecommended that our government identify and prioritize actual or \npotential terrorist sanctuaries. Yet, as the Director of the National \nCounterterrorism Center testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee, \n``much of the information about the instability that can lead to safe \nhavens or ideological radicalization comes not from covert collection \nbut from open collection, best done by Foreign Service Officers.'' The \nsolution, then, is to ensure that, if State Department or other U.S. \nofficials are best suited to gather this kind of critical information, \nthey have the capabilities and resources to do so.\n\n  At the core of the commission's mandate is the need for an \ninteragency strategy that asks and answers four key questions: ``What \nis it that the U.S. Government needs to know?'' ``How do we best \nanticipate threats and crises around the world, before they emerge?'' \n``Who in our government, within and outside of the Intelligence \nCommunity, is best equipped to get this information, report on it, and \nanalyze it?'' ``And how do we develop missions and provide resources so \nthat we are using all of our capabilities on behalf of our national \nsecurity?'' The commission will provide recommendations on how the \ngovernment can and should develop this strategy and whether new \nlegislation is needed to clarify the authority of existing executive \nbranch entities or create a new one. And it will provide \nrecommendations on how to ensure that the budget process reflects the \nbest and most efficient means to collect, report on and analyze \nintelligence and information, rather than the influence of individual \nbureaucracies.\n  The reform recommendations made by this commission will provide a \ncritical and welcome boost to everyone, in the executive branch and in \nCongress, responsible for defending our national security. The \nIntelligence Community, as its own leadership has attested, needs \nguidance if it is to reprioritize global coverage and long-term \nthreats. It also needs help in areas that need not be its top \npriorities: if State Department or other U.S. officials outside the \nIntelligence Community are best equipped to obtain certain information \nand are given sufficient resources, the IC can focus on areas where \nclandestine collection is most needed. The State Department will \nbenefit from an interagency process that recognizes the critical \nreporting capabilities of the diplomatic service and allocates \nresources accordingly. The President will be provided with \nrecommendations on interagency reforms that extend beyond the purview \nof any one department or agency.\n  Implementation of the commission's recommendations will allow the \ncongressional intelligence and foreign relations committees to conduct \noversight of the Intelligence Community and the State Department in the \ncontext of a clearly defined strategy. The\n\n[[Page S8203]]\n\nbudget committees and the appropriators as well as authorizers will \nhave an interagency strategy that explains the rationale for the \nPresident's budget request. Congress as a whole will be provided \nrecommendations on whether new legislation is needed to reform the \nprocess.\n  This is not just a step toward good governance. It will ensure that \ntaxpayer dollars are used more efficiently and effectively. Most of \nall, it will make us safer. This bill is not partisan, and it has \nnothing to do with who is in the White House. The commission will not \ninvestigate anyone, nor cast blame for long-standing structural \nproblems. It seeks only to identify the reforms still needed and to \nprovide recommendations, to the executive branch and to Congress, on \nhow to achieve them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Webb, and Mr. \n        Warner):\n  S.J. Res. 19. A joint resolution granting the consent and approval of \nCongress to amendments made by the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth \nof Virginia, and the District of Columbia to the Washington \nMetropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact; considered and passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 19\n\n       Whereas Congress in title VI of the Passenger Rail \n     Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (section 601, Public \n     Law 110-432) authorized the Secretary of Transportation to \n     make grants to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \n     Authority subject to certain conditions, including that no \n     amounts may be provided until specified amendments to the \n     Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact have \n     taken effect;\n       Whereas legislation enacted by the State of Maryland \n     (Chapter 111, 2009 Laws of the Maryland General Assembly), \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia (Chapter 771, 2009 Acts of \n     Assembly of Virginia), and the District of Columbia (D.C. Act \n     18-0095) contain the amendments to the Washington \n     Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact specified by the \n     Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 \n     (section 601, Public Law 110-432); and\n       Whereas the consent of Congress is required in order to \n     implement such amendments: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONSENT OF CONGRESS TO COMPACT AMENDMENTS.\n\n       (a) Consent.--Consent of Congress is given to the \n     amendments of the State of Maryland, the amendments of the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia, and the amendments of the District \n     of Columbia to sections 5, 9 and 18 of title III of the \n     Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact.\n       (b) Amendments.--The amendments referred to in subsection \n     (a) are substantially as follows:\n       (1) Section 5 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) The Authority shall be governed by a Board of eight \n     Directors consisting of two Directors for each Signatory and \n     two for the federal government (one of whom shall be a \n     regular passenger and customer of the bus or rail service of \n     the Authority). For Virginia, the Directors shall be \n     appointed by the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission; \n     for the District of Columbia, by the Council of the District \n     of Columbia; for Maryland, by the Washington Suburban Transit \n     Commission; and for the Federal Government, by the \n     Administrator of General Services. For Virginia and Maryland, \n     the Directors shall be appointed from among the members of \n     the appointing body, except as otherwise provided herein, and \n     shall serve for a term coincident with their term on the \n     appointing body. A Director for a Signatory may be removed or \n     suspended from office only as provided by the law of the \n     Signatory from which he was appointed. The nonfederal \n     appointing authorities shall also appoint an alternate for \n     each Director. In addition, the Administrator of General \n     Services shall also appoint two nonvoting members who shall \n     serve as the alternates for the federal Directors. An \n     alternate Director may act only in the absence of the \n     Director for whom he has been appointed an alternate, except \n     that, in the case of the District of Columbia where only one \n     Director and his alternate are present, such alternate may \n     act on behalf of the absent Director. Each alternate, \n     including the federal nonvoting Directors, shall serve at the \n     pleasure of the appointing authority. In the event of a \n     vacancy in the Office of Director or alternate, it shall be \n     filled in the same manner as an original appointment.\n       ``(b) Before entering upon the duties of his office each \n     Director and alternate Director shall take and subscribe to \n     the following oath (or affirmation) of office or any such \n     other oath or affirmation, if any, as the constitution or \n     laws of the Government he represents shall provide: `I, , \n     hereby solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and \n     defend the Constitution of the United States and the \n     Constitution and laws of the state or political jurisdiction \n     from which I was appointed as a director (alternate director) \n     of the Board of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \n     Authority and will faithfully discharge the duties of the \n     office upon which I am about to enter.' ''.\n       (2) Subsection (a) of section 9 is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(a) The officers of the Authority, none of whom shall be \n     members of the Board, shall consist of a general manager, a \n     secretary, a treasurer, a comptroller, an inspector general, \n     and a general counsel and such other officers as the Board \n     may provide. Except for the office of general manager, \n     inspector general, and comptroller, the Board may consolidate \n     any of such other offices in one person. All such officers \n     shall be appointed and may be removed by the Board, shall \n     serve at the pleasure of the Board and shall perform such \n     duties and functions as the Board shall specify. The Board \n     shall fix and determine the compensation to be paid to all \n     officers and, except for the general manager who shall be a \n     full-time employee, all other officers may be hired on a \n     full-time or part-time basis and may be compensated on a \n     salary or fee basis, as the Board may determine. All \n     employees and such officers as the Board may designate shall \n     be appointed and removed by the general manager under such \n     rules of procedure and standards as the Board may \n     determine.''.\n       (3) Section 9 is further amended by inserting new \n     subsection (d) to read as follows (and by renumbering all \n     subsequent paragraphs of section 9):\n       ``(d) The inspector general shall report to the Board and \n     head the Office of the Inspector General, an independent and \n     objective unit of the Authority that conducts and supervises \n     audits, program evaluations, and investigations relating to \n     Authority activities; promotes economy, efficiency, and \n     effectiveness in Authority activities; detects and prevents \n     fraud and abuse in Authority activities; and keeps the Board \n     fully and currently informed about deficiencies in Authority \n     activities as well as the necessity for and progress of \n     corrective action.''.\n       (4) Section 18 is amended by adding a new section 18(d) to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(d)(1) All payments made by the local Signatory \n     governments for the Authority for the purpose of matching \n     federal funds appropriated in any given year as authorized \n     under title VI, section 601, Public Law 110-432 regarding \n     funding of capital and preventative maintenance projects of 1 \n     the Authority shall be made from amounts derived from \n     dedicated funding sources.\n       ``(2) For the purposes of this paragraph (d), a `dedicated \n     funding source' means any source of funding that is earmarked \n     or required under State or local law to be used to match \n     Federal appropriations authorized under title VI, section \n     601, Public Law 110-432 for payments to the Authority.''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND, OR REPEAL.\n\n       The right to alter, amend, or repeal this Act is expressly \n     reserved. The consent granted by this Act shall not be \n     construed as impairing or in any manner affecting any right \n     or jurisdiction of the United States in and over the region \n     that forms the subject of the compact.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the importance \nof the senior caregiving community. In the U.S., over 36 million people \nare 65 years of age or older, which is approximately 12 percent of the \npopulation. That number is expected to double by the year 2025 as the \nbaby-boomers fully enter their golden years.\n  Thus, while senior caregivers are playing an important role now, this \nprofession will be even more important in the future. The people who \nprovide care to millions of seniors across this country provide a great \nservice not only to these individuals, but also to their families and \nour communities, as a whole.\n  It is estimated that 25 percent of all seniors need some level of \nassistance to complete their daily activities. Senior companions \nprovide a wide-range of services, such as medication reminders, \nhousekeeping, meal preparation, travel assistance, and general \ncompanionship. These services enable seniors to stay in their own homes \nand stay engaged in their communities--which can make all the \ndifference in the world when it comes to their happiness.\n  I have talked to seniors who are helped by caregivers and they use \nwords like guardian angel and lifesaver to describe them. Senior \ncaregiver services are a much preferred alternative for seniors who \ndesire to maintain their independence. They also offer families peace \nof mind, knowing their loved one is being taken care of in a safe and \naffordable manner.\n  The senior caregiving profession is part of the solution to the \nchallenges our country faces as we continue to age. Currently, an \nestimated 44 million adults in this country provide care to adult \nrelatives or friends, and an estimated 725,000 non-family, privately-\npaid individuals are senior caregivers. The caregiving profession will \ncontinue to grow in prominence and demand as the senior population \nrises.\n  That is why I am happy to introduce a resolution with my colleague, \nSenator Casey, to honor senior caregivers and the private home care \nindustry. We salute those who provide such quality care for so many \nAmericans. It also encourages individuals to reach out and provide \nthese services to their family, friends, and neighbors.\n  We need to examine federal policy alternatives to make caregiving for \nseniors more accessible and more affordable for families. If we can \nkeep seniors in their homes, instead of nursing facilities, we \naccomplish a number of goals. We preserve the independence and dignity \nof our seniors. That alone is significant. But, it also saves money in \na health care system facing skyrocketing costs and soon-to-be insolvent \nprograms.\n  This resolution encourages the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto continue working to educate aging Americans about the assistance \noptions available for seniors. Senior caregivers are doing a great \nservice to this country and I commend them for it.\n  It is an indisputable fact that we will all grow old, thus this issue \nwill sooner or later affect every American. Therefore, it is important \nto have access to quality, affordable caregiving services in every \ncommunity. Caregiving is a profession that will continue to grow in \nprominence and need as the senior population rises. Again, I thank the \nsenior caregivers for their service to Americans throughout this \nnation, and I am pleased to offer this resolution on their behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8204-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8204-S8205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1842.

Mr. President, 50 years ago next month, the 85th Congress \nof the United States voted to allow a tiny island archipelago made up \nof people of every race and creed and situated in the middle of the \nPacific Ocean entry into the Union.\n  August 21, 2009, marks the 50th anniversary of the execution of \nProclamation 3309, signed by President Dwight David Eisenhower, which \nadmitted Hawaii into the Union as the 50th State.\n  On a personal note, 50 years ago today, I was elected by the people \nof Hawaii to serve as the first Member of the House of Representatives \nfrom the State of Hawaii. It is a moment I shall never forget. And on \nAugust 25, 1959, I had the great honor and privilege of standing behind \nthe great President of the United States, Dwight David Eisenhower, when \nhe signed Proclamation 3309.\n  The territory of Hawaii was annexed to the United States in 1898 by a \njoint resolution of Congress based on a treaty signed with the Hawaiian \ngovernment. For many years thereafter, many delegations of Congressmen \nand Senators visited the territory of Hawaii to consider the pleas \nsubmitted by generations of our people requesting statehood. Finally, \nduring the 85th Congress in 1959, members of the Committee on Interior \nand Insular Affairs and the Subcommittee on Territorial and Insular \nAffairs, led by Congressman Leo W. O'Brien, visited the territory of \nHawaii to make an inquiry into granting it statehood. The members of \nthe committee met with local leaders and government officials in Hawaii \nand noted that the islands of Hawaii formed a unique and successful \nracial melting pot and claimed that if the rest of the Nation could mix \nas well, our democracy would be advanced by a century.\n\n  The State of Hawaii has been a rich cultural addition to the United \nStates, thanks to the ancient culture of Native Hawaiians, the diverse \nmultiracial society created by generations of Asian and European \nimmigrants, and the stunning natural beauty of our tropical climate. \nHawaii has produced the first Chinese and Japanese American Members of \nCongress, the first woman of color in Congress, and the first Native \nHawaiian in the Senate. The Honorable Barack Obama, the first African-\nAmerican President of the United States, was born and raised in \nHonolulu, HI.\n  Hawaii is much more than hula dancing, lovely beaches, and beautiful\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\nweather. For example, 300 years ago, before Christopher Columbus \ncrossed the Atlantic Ocean in search of India, Polynesians boarded \ndouble-hulled canoes and sailed north seeking a place called Havaiki. \nThese ancient voyagers found Havaiki and settled there and slowly built \ntheir society and government. A kingdom emerged and a monarchy grew to \ngain the respect of nations around the world. The kingdom of Hawaii \nentered into treaties with the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and the \nUnited States. That kingdom was overthrown with the assistance of the \nU.S. military forces. But the Congress of the United States, realizing \nthat the takeover was not done in a democratic fashion, recently issued \nan official apology to the people of Hawaii. It takes a great country \nlike America to admit its wrongs.\n  Hawaii's location in the middle of the Pacific between the U.S. \nmainland and the nations of Asia has made it a major center of military \ndefense for the United States. Pearl Harbor serves as a critical naval \noutpost, allowing our fleet to connect to the United States, Asia, and \nother Pacific nations. So critical is Pearl Harbor's location to our \nnational defense that it was targeted by our enemies at the beginning \nof World War II. The bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, \nbrought the United States into World War II and revealed the loyalty \nthe people of Hawaii had for the United States and the sacrifices they \nwere willing to make for their country. Thousands upon thousands of \nyoung men from Hawaii volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army during \nWorld War II. Senator Dan Akaka and I were two of the volunteers.\n  Nearly 8 billion visitors from around the world each year are drawn \nto Hawaii's breathtaking beaches, scenic sites, and unique culture. \nHawaii is home to one-fourth of the endangered species in the United \nStates. We have eight national parks, including the Hawaii Volcanoes \nNational Park, which is the home to Kilauea, the most active volcano on \nEarth. Hawaii has truly added to the diversity and richness of the \nUnited States--culturally, racially, ecologically, and geographically.\n  Today, the Congress of the United States celebrates Hawaii as the \n50th State to enter the Union.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the resolution offered \nby my colleague and dear friend, Senator Inouye, and passed by this \nbody. It is a resolution honoring the historic milestone of Hawaii's \n50th anniversary of statehood.\n  In the center of the Pacific on islands rising from the bottom of the \nocean, Hawaii joined our great and diverse Nation as its 50th State 50 \nyears ago. Similar to the 49 States that came before it, Hawaii has \nsomething unique to share with the world.\n  Everyone who is born in Hawaii or comes to Hawaii embraces the aloha \nspirit as a value and way of life. The aloha spirit is good for the \nUnited States and it is good for the world.\n  I was a teacher at Kamehameha Schools when Congress voted to make \nHawaii the 50th State in March of 1959. Fire crackers and sirens went \noff across the island of Oahu in celebration. The bells at historic \nKawaihao Church started to ring and hundreds of people gathered there.\n  The next day, the newspaper headlines hailed the good news. My \nbrother, Rev. Dr. Abraham Akaka, who was minister at Kawaihao Church, \ndelivered the sermon. Brother Abe named Hawaii ``The Aloha State,'' and \n50 years later we still call it that.\n  I would like to quote a few words my brother said on that historic \nday in March of 1959:\n\n       Aloha consists of this new attitude of heart, above \n     negativism, above legalism. It is the unconditional desire to \n     promote the true good of other people in a friendly spirit, \n     out of a sense of kinship. Aloha seeks to do good, with no \n     conditions attached. We do not do good only to those who do \n     good to us. One of the sweetest things about the love of God, \n     about Aloha, is that it welcomes the stranger and seeks his \n     good. A person who has the spirit of Aloha loves even when \n     the love is not returned. And such is the love of God.\n\n  This is the meaning of aloha, Hawaii's gift to the cultural fabric of \nthe United States and the world.\n  While we celebrate this landmark anniversary next month, we must \nremember that the privileges of statehood came with obligations. Hawaii \nand the United States have a sacred trust relationship with the \nindigenous people of Hawaii that still remains to be fulfilled.\n  In admitting Hawaii as the 50th State, Congress and the people of \nHawaii have recognized the importance of addressing the needs of Native \nHawaiians and preservation of their culture and traditions. I am proud \nto continue this legacy as we move forward with that promise.\n  I congratulate Hawaii and its people on 50 years of statehood. I am \nproud to represent this great State in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8211-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MIAMI DADE COLLEGE LAND CONVEYANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S.J. Res. 19, introduced \nearlier today.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 19) granting the consent and \n     approval of Congress to amendments made by the State of \n     Maryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the District of \n     Columbia to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \n     Regulation Compact.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will adopt the final \nmeasure required to authorize $3 billion in dedicated Fcderal and local \nfunding for the Washington, DC, regional Metrorail system. Today, the \nSenate will give its consent and approval to amendments made by the \nState of Maryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the District of \nColumbia to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation \nCompact.\n  This compact amendment, jointly agreed to by Maryland, Virginia and \nDC, makes the changes required by Federal legislation enacted last year \nwhich authorizes capital and preventive maintenance projects for the \nWashington Metro system.\n  A joint resolution of Congress is needed to authorize any changes in \ninterstate compacts. This resolution which I introduced today with my \ncolleagues, Senators Mikulski, Webb and Warner, simply provides that \nnecessary congressional consent.\n  The National Capital Transportation Amendments Act, often referred to \nas the Metro funding bill, was included as title VI of Division B of PL \n110-432, legislation requiring significant improvement to rail safety \nnationally. The Metro funding bill authorizes $1.5 billion over 10 \nyears for capital and preventive maintenance of the Metro system. It \nprohibits these funds from being used for system expansion, which \nrequires separate authorization.\n  The Metro funding bill includes three provisions requiring changes to \nthe regional compact that governs the system. First, it requires an \nexpansion of the governing board to include two Federal members with \nvoting rights. Second, it requires that the non-Federal jurisdictions \nprovide dedicated\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\nfunding to match, dollar for dollar, Federal funds. Finally, the \nlegislation requires a change in the governing compact to establish an \nOffice of Inspector General for the system.\n  The jurisdictions acted with great speed, enacting,these changes to \nthe compact during their legislative sessions this spring. On June 17th \nthey jointly sent a letter to Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member \nSessions requesting the Congress's consent to the changes that the \njurisdictions have approved.\n  Today we will provide our consent to these compact amendments and in \nso doing we have adopted the final measure required to authorize $3 \nbillion in dedicated Federal and local funding for the Washington, DC, \nregional Metrorail system.\n  Earlier today, I spoke on the Senate floor about the horrible tragedy \nthat claimed nine lives on the Metrorail system. I offered my \ncondolences to those who lost loved ones. I also took note of the \nunique Federal responsibility we have for the Metro system, which is \nreally America's subway. During rush hour, more than 40 percent of \nMetro riders are Federal employees.\n  Today we mourn those lost in a tragic accident. But we must do more \nthan extend our sympathy. We must also act. That is why I am proud to \nhave offered the resolution adopted by the Senate today, and why I will \ncontinue to fight to ensure that this body is doing everything it can \nso that a similar tragedy is never repeated.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be read three times and passed, the preamble be agreed to, \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate, and that any statements relating to the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (S. J. Res. 19) was ordered to be engrossed for \na third reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 19\n\n       Whereas Congress in title VI of the Passenger Rail \n     Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (section 601, Public \n     Law 110-432) authorized the Secretary of Transportation to \n     make grants to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \n     Authority subject to certain conditions, including that no \n     amounts may be provided until specified amendments to the \n     Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact have \n     taken effect;\n       Whereas legislation enacted by the State of Maryland \n     (Chapter 111, 2009 Laws of the Maryland General Assembly), \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia (Chapter 771, 2009 Acts of \n     Assembly of Virginia), and the District of Columbia (D.C. Act \n     18-0095) contain the amendments to the Washington \n     Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact specified by the \n     Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 \n     (section 601, Public Law 110-432); and\n       Whereas the consent of Congress is required in order to \n     implement such amendments: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONSENT OF CONGRESS TO COMPACT AMENDMENTS.\n\n       (a) Consent.--Consent of Congress is given to the \n     amendments of the State of Maryland, the amendments of the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia, and the amendments of the District \n     of Columbia to sections 5, 9 and 18 of title III of the \n     Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact.\n       (b) Amendments.--The amendments referred to in subsection \n     (a) are substantially as follows:\n       (1) Section 5 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) The Authority shall be governed by a Board of eight \n     Directors consisting of two Directors for each Signatory and \n     two for the federal government (one of whom shall be a \n     regular passenger and customer of the bus or rail service of \n     the Authority). For Virginia, the Directors shall be \n     appointed by the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission; \n     for the District of Columbia, by the Council of the District \n     of Columbia; for Maryland, by the Washington Suburban Transit \n     Commission; and for the Federal Government, by the \n     Administrator of General Services. For Virginia and Maryland, \n     the Directors shall be appointed from among the members of \n     the appointing body, except as otherwise provided herein, and \n     shall serve for a term coincident with their term on the \n     appointing body. A Director for a Signatory may be removed or \n     suspended from office only as provided by the law of the \n     Signatory from which he was appointed. The nonfederal \n     appointing authorities shall also appoint an alternate for \n     each Director. In addition, the Administrator of General \n     Services shall also appoint two nonvoting members who shall \n     serve as the alternates for the federal Directors. An \n     alternate Director may act only in the absence of the \n     Director for whom he has been appointed an alternate, except \n     that, in the case of the District of Columbia where only one \n     Director and his alternate are present, such alternate may \n     act on behalf of the absent Director. Each alternate, \n     including the federal nonvoting Directors, shall serve at the \n     pleasure of the appointing authority. In the event of a \n     vacancy in the Office of Director or alternate, it shall be \n     filled in the same manner as an original appointment.\n       ``(b) Before entering upon the duties of his office each \n     Director and alternate Director shall take and subscribe to \n     the following oath (or affirmation) of office or any such \n     other oath or affirmation, if any, as the constitution or \n     laws of the Government he represents shall provide: `I, \n     hereby solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and \n     defend the Constitution of the United States and the \n     Constitution and laws of the state or political jurisdiction \n     from which I was appointed as a director (alternate director) \n     of the Board of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \n     Authority and will faithfully discharge the duties of the \n     office upon which I am about to enter.' ''.\n       (2) Subsection (a) of section 9 is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(a) The officers of the Authority, none of whom shall be \n     members of the Board, shall consist of a general manager, a \n     secretary, a treasurer, a comptroller, an inspector general, \n     and a general counsel and such other officers as the Board \n     may provide. Except for the office of general manager, \n     inspector general, and comptroller, the Board may consolidate \n     any of such other offices in one person. All such officers \n     shall be appointed and may be removed by the Board, shall \n     serve at the pleasure of the Board and shall perform such \n     duties and functions as the Board shall specify. The Board \n     shall fix and determine the compensation to be paid to all \n     officers and, except for the general manager who shall be a \n     full-time employee, all other officers may be hired on a \n     full-time or part-time basis and may be compensated on a \n     salary or fee basis, as the Board may determine. All \n     employees and such officers as the Board may designate shall \n     be appointed and removed by the general manager under such \n     rules of procedure and standards as the Board may \n     determine.''.\n       (3) Section 9 is further amended by inserting new \n     subsection (d) to read as follows (and by renumbering all \n     subsequent paragraphs of section 9):\n       ``(d) The inspector general shall report to the Board and \n     head the Office of the Inspector General, an independent and \n     objective unit of the Authority that conducts and supervises \n     audits, program evaluations, and investigations relating to \n     Authority activities; promotes economy, efficiency, and \n     effectiveness in Authority activities; detects and prevents \n     fraud and abuse in Authority activities; and keeps the Board \n     fully and currently informed about deficiencies in Authority \n     activities as well as the necessity for and progress of \n     corrective action.''.\n       (4) Section 18 is amended by adding a new section 18(d) to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(d)(1) All payments made by the local Signatory \n     governments for the Authority for the purpose of matching \n     federal funds appropriated in any given year as authorized \n     under title VI, section 601, Public Law 110-432 regarding \n     funding of capital and preventative maintenance projects of 1 \n     the Authority shall be made from amounts derived from \n     dedicated funding sources.\n       ``(2) For the purposes of this paragraph (d), a `dedicated \n     funding source' means any source of funding that is earmarked \n     or required under State or local law to be used to match \n     Federal appropriations authorized under title VI, section \n     601, Public Law 110-432 for payments to the Authority.''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND, OR REPEAL.\n\n       The right to alter, amend, or repeal this Act is expressly \n     reserved. The consent granted by this Act shall not be \n     construed as impairing or in any manner affecting any right \n     or jurisdiction of the United States in and over the region \n     that forms the subject of the compact.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY.\n\n       It is intended that the provisions of this compact shall be \n     reasonably and liberally construed to effectuate the purposes \n     thereof. If any part or application of this compact, or \n     legislation enabling the compact, is held invalid, the \n     remainder of the compact or its application to other \n     situations or persons shall not be affected.\n\n     SEC. 4. INCONSISTENCY OF LANGUAGE.\n\n       The validity of this compact shall not be affected by any \n     insubstantial differences in its form or language as adopted \n     by the State of Maryland, Commonwealth of Virginia and \n     District of Columbia.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from the Governors' Representatives on Colorado \nRiver Operations related to language included in the report to \naccompany the House Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2010, H.R. 3183.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Governor's Representatives on Colorado River Operations: \n           States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New \n           Mexico, Utah and Wyoming,\n                                                    July 27, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: the undersigned Governor's \n     Representatives on Colorado River Operations (States) are \n     writing to express our serious concerns about recommendations \n     contained in the committee report on H.R. 3183, the FY 2010 \n     Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, relating to \n     operations of Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River. The \n     relevant language in the committee report on H.R. 3183, \n     states:\n       ``Glen Canyon Dam. The Committee continues to support the \n     goals of the Grand Canyon Protection Act (GCPA) and the \n     resulting duties placed upon the Bureau of Reclamation. \n     However, the Committee is concerned that many of the \n     procedural requirements in the GCPA and Charter for the Glen \n     Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Work Group are being \n     disregarded. The result appears to be that Federal \n     responsibilities have been neglected and public transparency \n     compromised. Specifically, the Committee strongly encourages \n     that the Bureau of Reclamation, in cooperation and \n     concurrence with the National Park Service, revisit the \n     Operating Criteria for Glen Canyon Dam. The five-year review \n     required by the Operating Criteria should be an open public \n     process consistent with the GCPA and 1997 Operating Criteria \n     requirements (62 FR 9447-9448).''\n       The Glen Canyon Adaptive Management Work Group (AMWG) is a \n     the federal advisory committee that includes 26 \n     representatives from multiple federal agencies, the Colorado \n     River Basin States, tribes, recreation interests, power \n     customers and environmental organizations. It was authorized \n     in the Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 to provide the \n     Secretary of the Interior advice and recommendations relative \n     to the operation of Glen Canyon Dam. The States continue to \n     support the AMWG collaborative stakeholder process and are \n     also supportive of the Bureau of Reclamation's reporting on \n     Glen Canyon Dam operations consistent with the Grand Canyon \n     Protection Act and the Colorado River Basin Project Act of \n     1968.\n       However, the States strongly disagree with the assertion in \n     the committee report that ``federal responsibilities have \n     been neglected and public transparency compromised'' and \n     strongly oppose giving the National Park Service an elevated \n     role in the AMWG or a new role in determining the operations \n     at or Operating Criteria for Glen Canyon Dam.\n       Under existing law, the Bureau of Reclamation is the lead \n     agency in establishing and reviewing the Operating Criteria \n     for Glen Canyon Dam and developing the Annual Operating Plan. \n     The language contained in the committee report would create a \n     grave imbalance among the stakeholders by requiring the \n     ``concurrence'' of the National Park Service relative to Glen \n     Canyon Dam operations and effectively give this single \n     purpose federal agency veto authority over the operation of a \n     facility that is critical to maintaining a stable and \n     dependable water supply for over 30 million people in the \n     western United States. The States are concerned that the \n     Committee's recommendations may have been based on less than \n     complete information and believe that significant changes in \n     the responsibilities of federal agencies with regard to dam \n     operations on the Colorado River, such as those proposed in \n     the committee report, should not be made without a full \n     discussion among stakeholders and affected agencies.\n       Finally, as you may not know, a number of issues relating \n     to the Grand Canyon Protection Act and the operations of Glen \n     Canyon Dam are currently the subject of litigation. For this \n     additional reason, the States do not believe it is \n     appropriate for Congress to make recommendations for changes \n     in the process and roles of the federal agencies with respect \n     to Colorado River water management at this time and through \n     this mechanism.\n       We urge you to work to ensure that the recommendations in \n     the committee report on H.R. 3183 do not become part of the \n     final House/Senate report on the FY 2010 Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations Bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Herbert R. Guenther,\n       Director, Arizona Department of Water Resources.\n     Dana B. Fisher, Jr.,\n       Chairman, Colorado River Board of California.\n     Jennifer Gimbel,\n       Director, Colorado Water Conservation Board.\n     Patricia Mulroy,\n       General Manager, Southern Nevada Water Authority.\n     George Caan,\n       Director, Colorado River Commission of Nevada.\n     John D'Antonio,\n       Secretary, New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission.\n     Dennis Strong,\n       Director, Utah Division of Water Resources, Utah Interstate \n     Stream Commissioner.\n     Patrick Tyrrell,\n       State Engineer, State of Wyoming.\n\n       The following Colorado River contractors and utilities \n     endorse the position of the Governor's Representatives on \n     Colorado River Operations stated in this letter: City of \n     Aurora; Central Arizona Water Conservation District; \n     Coachella Valley Water District; Colorado River Water \n     Conservation District; Colorado Springs Utilities; Denver \n     Water; City of Grand Junction; Metropolitan Water District of \n     Southern California; Northern Colorado Water Conservancy \n     District; Board of Water Works of Pueblo, CO; Southeastern \n     Colorado Water Conservancy District; Southwestern Water \n     Conservation District; and Upper Colorado River Commission.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of S. 1436, Energy and Water Development \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2010.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $33.8 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2010, which will result in new outlays of $19.8 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $43.2 billion.\n  The Senate-reported bill matches its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and for outlays.\n  The Senate-reported bill includes several provisions that make \nchanges in mandatory programs that result in\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\nan increase in direct spending in years following the budget year, 2011 \nto 2019. Each of these provisions is subject to a point of order \nestablished by section 314 of the 2009 budget resolution. The bill is \nnot subject to any other budget points of order.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       S. 1436, ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES\n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-reported bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     General\n                                          Defense    Purpose     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................     16,886     16,864     33,750\n    Outlays............................     18,571     24,630     43,201\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........     33,750\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........     43,201\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................     16,367     16,931     33,298\n    Outlays............................     18,219     24,508     42,727\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................     16,563     17,830     34,393\n    Outlays............................     18,353     24,124     42,477\n \n                    Senate-Reported Bill Compared To:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........          0\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........          0\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................        519        -67        452\n    Outlays............................        352        122        474\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................        323       -966       -643\n    Outlays............................        218        506        724\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                               \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8214-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

I have said there are certain things we have to get done \nbefore we leave. I hope we do not have to have this cloture vote on \nThursday. I hope we can get to the bill and move to the Agriculture \nappropriations bill. If not, then we are going to have to work through \nthe weekend because there are certain things--it is not a very long \nlist--we have to do before we leave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/28/senate-section/article/S8214-4", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
