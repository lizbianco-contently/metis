Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, most Americans breathed a sigh of \nrelief in January when it looked like the Democrats' partisan plan for \nhealth care was done for. Most people saw the outcome of the \nMassachusetts Senate race as an opportunity to start over on what they \nwanted, which is a step-by-step plan that would target costs without \nraising taxes or insurance premiums, without cutting Medicare, and \nwithout using taxpayer dollars to cover the cost of abortions.\n  Unfortunately, the proponents of this plan are still determined to \nforce this distorted vision of health care reform on a public who is \nalready overwhelmingly opposed to it. So this afternoon the President \nwill outline yet another version of the Democratic health care plan we \nhave been hearing about all year long. The sales pitch may be new, but \nthe bill is not.\n  We got a preview of the administration's new sales pitch yesterday in \na letter from the President, in which he said he is now willing to \nincorporate a few Republican ideas into the Democratic bill. But this \nis not what the American people are asking for.\n  Americans do not want us to tack a few good ideas onto a bill that \nreshapes one-sixth of the economy, vastly expands the role of \ngovernment, and which raises taxes and cuts Medicare to pay for all of \nit. They want us to scrap the underlying bill--scrap it altogether--and \nstart over with step-by-step reforms that target cost and expand \naccess.\n  This whole exercise is unfortunate and completely unnecessary. It is \nalso a disservice to the American people. The fact is, the longer the \nDemocrats cling to their own flawed vision of reform, the longer \nAmericans will have to wait for the reforms they want.\n  Last week's health care summit could have served as the basis for a \nseries of step-by-step reforms that both parties could support and \nwhich the general public would embrace. Unfortunately, Democrats in \nWashington have decided to press ahead on the same kind of massive bill \nthey were pushing before the summit. Even worse, they now seem willing \nto go to any length necessary--any length necessary--to force the bill \nthrough Congress.\n  Well, Americans do not know how else to say it: They do not want the \nmassive bill. It is perfectly clear. They want commonsense, bipartisan \nreforms that lower costs, and they want us to refocus our energy on \ncreating jobs and the economy. They have had enough of this year-long \neffort to get a win for the Democratic Party at any price to the \nAmerican people. Americans have paid a big enough price already in the \ntime we have lost focusing on this bill.\n  They do not want it, and they will not tolerate any more backroom \ndeals or legislative schemes to force it through Congress on a partisan \nbasis. History is clear: Big legislation always requires big \nmajorities. This latest scheme to lure Democrats into switching their \nvotes in the House by agreeing to use reconciliation in the Senate will \nbe met with outrage.\n  So we respectfully encourage the administration to consider a new \napproach to reform, one that does not cut Medicare to fund a trillion-\ndollar takeover of the health care system or impose job-killing taxes \nin the middle of a recession, and one that will win the support of \nbroad majorities in both parties. We encourage the administration to \njoin Republicans and Democrats in Congress in listening to what the \nAmerican people have been telling us for more than a year now.\n  At the risk of being redundant, here is what they are saying: \nAmericans are telling us to scrap the bills they have already rejected \nand start over with commonsense, step-by-step reforms we can all agree \non. Now is not the time to repeat the same mistakes that brought us \nhere. It is time to listen to the people and to start over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last night, I met the mayor of Kankakee, \nIL. She told me about a problem she has. Kankakee has 28,000 residents. \nThe economy has hurt them. They have lost sales tax revenues. They do \nnot have the income they had just last year. Their annual budget is $20 \nmillion for the city of Kankakee. That is for all the services they \nprovide.\n  Ten percent of that budget--$2 million--goes for the health insurance \nof the workers in that town; about 200 of them--10 percent, $2 million. \nSo they went to their insurance company and said: What will the \ninsurance cost us this year? The health insurance company said: Your \nrates are going up 83 percent--83 percent. What had cost them $2 \nmillion last year will cost them almost $4 million this year.\n  When I listened to the speech from the minority leader, the \nRepublican leader, who says: Start over, go slow, baby steps, we do not \nwant to do anything that is big or addresses this problem in any kind \nof comprehensive way, I think to myself: Does he understand the reality \nof what businesses, families, small towns, and large cities are\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\nfacing across America? The Kankakee example is not unique. Just a \ncouple weeks ago, in California, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield \nannounced a 39-percent increase in health insurance premiums next year.\n  If you look at what the average family paid for health insurance 10 \nyears ago, it was about $6,000 a year--$500 a month. It is a lot of \nmoney. But that was 10 years ago, and it has doubled in the last 10 \nyears. It is now $12,000, the average premium paid by a family of four \nacross America.\n  But what will happen in the next 8 to 10 years? It will double again. \nCan you imagine the job you will need 10 years from now that will \ngenerate $2,000 a month just for health insurance premiums, before you \ntake the first penny home to pay your mortgage or feed your family or \nprovide for your kids' college education? That is the reality of the \ncall by the Republican side of the aisle to go slow, start over.\n  No. Their go slow, start over can be translated into two words: \n``Give up.'' We are not going to give up. They call for common sense. \nOur approach to health care reform is grounded in common sense. Let me \ntell you what the basics are.\n  The basics are, small businesses across America need to have choice \nand competition. We create insurance exchanges. I went to the \nPresident's health care summit last week, and I listened to the \nRepublicans say: Do you know what is wrong with the health care reform \nbill? No. 1, it is a government-run program. Well, it is not. It is \nprivate health insurance companies brought together by the government \nto compete for the business of individuals and small businesses. They \nsaid: Do you know what else is wrong? They put minimum requirements on \nhealth insurance plans, minimum requirements of what they will cover. \nYou ought to let the health insurance companies offer whatever they \nwant. If they want to offer something that is virtually worthless, that \nis their business. Let the consumers decide.\n  I said at that health care summit meeting: Isn't it amazing that \nMembers of Congress, who are part of the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program, including the Republican House and Senate Members who \nsat in that summit, have their families protected by a government-run \nhealth care plan, which establishes minimum requirements for health \ninsurance to protect our families? Yet when we suggest doing that for \nthe rest of America, the conservative Republicans say: You have gone \ntoo far. That violates some basic values and principles.\n\n  If they were honest about it, they would have walked right out of \nthat summit and turned in their Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram cards and said: We are out of here. This is socialism. We are \nnot going to be part of it. But, no, they want to enjoy the benefits of \na government-run plan, with minimum benefits outlined and described for \ntheir families. They do not want other people to have it. That is \nwrong. It is not only wrong, but it is unfair. It is unfair to the \nfamilies across America who deserve the same kind of protection in \nhealth insurance Members of Congress have.\n  So the first commonsense part of our health care reform is insurance \nexchanges, where private companies compete for the health insurance \nbusiness of small businesses and individuals--competition and choice.\n  The second commonsense part of health care reform says, it does no \ngood to own a health insurance policy which isn't there when you need \nit. You pay a lifetime of premiums, and with one accident, one \ndiagnosis, you are stuck with a huge amount of medical bills, and the \nhealth insurance company says: We took a close look at your application \nfor health insurance, and you failed to disclose you had acne as a \nteenager--I am not making this up--so we are going to deny you coverage \nfor the cancer therapy you are going to need--I am not making this up--\nor they say: You didn't tell us you had an adopted child in your \nfamily. That is another preexisting condition. Did you know that? It \nis. In the list of preexisting conditions, it includes things such as \nthat, and that is what happens--the tricks and traps in health \ninsurance that yank coverage from you when you need it the most.\n  This bill, the health care reform bill we are working on, starts to \nchange that relationship and gives the consumers across America a \nfighting chance to fight back when they are denied coverage for a \npreexisting condition, to fight back when they say there is a cap on \nthe total amount they are going to pay in your lifetime, to fight back \nwhen they say you cannot take your insurance with you when you leave a \njob, to fight back when parents realize when their kids get out of \ncollege, the family health insurance plan cannot cover them anymore.\n  Those are basic health insurance reforms that embody common sense. \nThe Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, comes here and says: We have \nto junk this big government plan. It is so wildly unpopular. Is it \nunpopular to offer choice and competition to small businesses? Is it \nunpopular to give consumers a fighting chance against health insurance \ncompanies?\n  There is a third aspect too. We asked the Republicans at the health \ncare summit: If you accept the obvious--that 50 million uninsured \nAmericans get sick, go to hospitals, are treated, and the cost of their \ncare is then passed on to everyone else--if you accept that, what are \nyou going to do about it? They said: Oh, we have an answer to that. \nFifty million uninsured Americans? We will deal with that. We will take \ncare of 3 million of them--3 million of them. Six percent of them we \nwill take care of.\n  Well, the bill we are supporting, the health care reform bill we are \nsupporting, takes care of 30 million. I wish it were 50 million, but it \ntakes care of 60 percent, over half of them. The hospital administrator \nat Memorial Medical Center in Springfield, IL, said to me: Senator, if \nI don't have to give out all this charity care, I can contain my costs \nand build the hospital and even make it greater for this community. But \nI have to absorb charity care for uninsured people because we do that \nin America. Put more of them on insurance and we will have more revenue \ncoming in. I would not have to transfer their cost burden to other \nfamilies. I will do better as a hospital. We will do better as a \ncommunity.\n  I think he is right. It is common sense. The Senator from Kentucky \nsays we need common sense. That is part of it. I think we also need \ncommon sense when it comes to Medicare. Medicare, of course, was \ncreated almost 50 years ago. Those who opposed it said: Too much \ngovernment. Those who supported it said: How else can we provide for \nthe elderly and retired, giving them basic health care protection, if \nwe do not have an insurance plan across America that we contribute to \nas we work and is available for us when we retire?\n  What happened when Medicare was passed? Senior citizens started \nliving longer, better, more independent lives. The record is there. It \nis clear. It worked. We want it to continue to work. But the problem \nis, as the costs of health care skyrocket because of baby steps and no \nsteps recommended by the other side of the aisle, as the costs \nskyrocket, Medicare costs do as well. It only has about 9 years left \nbefore it goes into the red.\n  Well, the bill we are proposing, the health care reform bill, will \nextend the life of Medicare another decade. I wish it were longer. But \nit certainly is a step in the right direction. How do we extend the \nlife of Medicare? We look at the waste in Medicare today, and there is \nwaste. Let me give you a couple numbers to compare. These numbers \nreflect the average cost for each Medicare recipient annually in each \ncommunity. In my hometown of Springfield, IL--central Illinois, small \ntown America I am honored to represent--$7,600 a year, average cost per \nMedicare recipient. Rochester, MN--home of one of the greatest \nhospitals in America, the Mayo Clinic, a place I dearly love and \nrespect for the treatment they have given to my family--it is about the \nsame, $7,600 a year, average cost for Medicare recipients. Now go to \nChicago--a big city--$9,600 a year, average cost for Medicare \nrecipients.\n  Now go to Miami, FL. The average cost for Medicare recipients, \n$17,000 a year. It costs more to live in Miami than it does in \nSpringfield or even Rochester, MN, but twice as much? No. Something is \nwrong. Overpayments are obvious in Miami, FL, in McAllen, TX.\n  We can pick them out, and we can see we are wasting our tax dollars \nwith too many tests, too many procedures, not\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\nfocusing on quality but quantity. Can we make this a better system? Can \nwe keep seniors healthy and reduce costs? Of course we can. We can \neliminate a lot of the waste. We can raise questions about self-dealing \nby doctors who make sure they send their patients to their own \nlaboratories, using their own machines over and over again. We can do \nthat. In doing so, we are not going to compromise the basic care \nMedicare recipients want.\n  So the Senator from Kentucky says: Too big. It is a big government \nprogram. We need to go step by baby step here. No. We need to take a \nlook at the obvious. If we do not address Medicare and reform it the \nright way, in 9 years it will be in the red, going broke. We cannot let \nthat happen. Baby steps from the other side of the aisle will not take \nus on this important journey to the goal we all share.\n  I also wish to say a word about the deficit. President Obama said to \nus when we started this debate: I know what our goals are, but in \nreaching those goals, do not add to America's debt. We came up with \nways to reduce health care costs, to increase taxes on people making \nover $200,000 a year; not dramatic increases but, in fact, increases in \ntaxes for them. The Congressional Budget Office says that as a result, \nin the first 10 years, our bill, the health care reform bill, will \nreduce the deficit by $130 billion, and in the second 10 years it will \nreduce it by $1.3 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in the \nhistory of the United States. This approach is fiscally sensible, \nfiscally sound.\n  A word before I close--I see my colleague from Iowa is on the floor \nand I wish to yield to him--about reconciliation. Senator Grassley is \non the Finance Committee. He has served on that committee for a number \nof years and he understands how the Senate works. When President Reagan \nwanted to initiate his tax cuts, he used a process called \nreconciliation. Reconciliation basically says no filibuster; you come \nto the floor, you offer your amendments and, ultimately, it is a \nmajority vote. That is what reconciliation says.\n  So President Reagan used reconciliation for tax cuts. Speaker Newt \nGingrich used reconciliation for his Contract With America. We have \nused reconciliation to create the COBRA program to provide health \ninsurance for unemployed workers across America. Time and again we have \nused reconciliation for major issues involving taxes and revenue. It \nhas been done 21 times in the last couple decades. More often, it is \nused by the Republican side of the aisle than the Democratic side of \nthe aisle. To brand this process as somehow un-American and unfair is \nto suggest that all of the efforts by the Republicans to use this \nprocess have been un-American and unfair. I don't think that is true. \nIt wasn't true then; it isn't true now.\n  What we have is a bill that has passed the Senate, the health care \nreform bill, which is now over in the House. The House of \nRepresentatives will decide whether they can enact the Senate version \nof health care reform. The follow-on bill is likely to be the \nreconciliation bill which will make some changes in that health care \nbill. It is not the total health care bill, but it will include \nchanges. Some of the changes that are being contemplated are ones that \nI think most Members on both sides agree to. Should we close the \ndoughnut hole? Well, what is the doughnut hole? It is a gap in coverage \nin Medicare prescription drug coverage for seniors. Should we close \nthat gap? I think we should. That is part of it.\n  Second, should we try to make health insurance more affordable? Our \nunderlying bill puts almost $450 billion in tax cuts on the table for \nsmall businesses and for individuals who cannot afford their premiums. \nThe reconciliation bill will try to make it even more affordable.\n  Can we help the States with their Medicaid burdens? We should. In my \nState of Illinois, in Iowa, and in New Mexico, Governors are \nstruggling. With folks on unemployment, more and more people need \nMedicaid. We should help to pay for it.\n  None of these ideas behind reconciliation--and there are other \naspects to them; we are working out details on them--is radical. None \nof them is comprehensive in terms of changing health care dramatically \nin America, but they do improve on a bill that has already passed in \nthe Senate.\n  The Republican leader comes to the floor and tells us this is un-\nAmerican and unfair. I couldn't disagree more. Every time we hear the \nRepublican side of the aisle say start over, I ask them, how much \nlonger should America wait? We have been at this in the Senate now \nalmost nonstop for over a year. The Senator from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, was part of a bipartisan effort, with Senator Baucus, a \nDemocrat, that went through 61 separate meetings to try to find \nbipartisan agreement, and it didn't. I salute Senator Grassley and \nothers for trying, but it didn't. We had to move forward.\n  So should we start over? Should we give up the things I have talked \nabout? Should we give up this effort to give small businesses choice \nand competition? Should we give up on the effort to make sure we have a \nfighting chance against insurance companies? Should we give up on the \neffort of trying to make sure that a substantial number of uninsured \nAmericans have that protection? Should we give up on the effort of \nextending the life of Medicare for 10 years? Should we give up on the \neffort to reduce our deficit by reducing health care costs, not only \nfor our government but for businesses and families? No. We cannot give \nup. We cannot give up on America. We cannot give up on this challenge. \nI urge my colleagues to stay the course.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, are we now on the pending legislation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, we are.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3352 to Amendment No. 3336\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent--and I think this has been \ncleared with the other side--that the pending amendment be set aside \nfor the purpose of my offering an amendment and giving short debate on \nmy amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself, Mr. \n     Crapo, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Roberts, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3352 to amendment No. 3336.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, March 2, 2010, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a couple of days ago I stated that I had \nworked in early February to put together a bipartisan package with my \ncolleague, Finance Committee Chairman Baucus, to address some time-\nsensitive matters that needed to be considered. So I find it surprising \nwe are taking up a package this week that, as was last week's exercise, \nis still a partisan product belonging to the Senate Democratic \nleadership. We are not taking up the bipartisan package I put together \nwith Finance Committee Chairman Baucus.\n  The Senate Democratic leadership arbitrarily 2 weeks ago decided to \nreplace the Baucus-Grassley bipartisan bill with one that is \ndramatically different. That partisan package is almost three times the \nsize and significantly greater in cost than the bipartisan bill Senator \nBaucus and I announced on February 11. It is unfortunate that the \nDemocratic leadership failed to ensure that these critically needed \nMedicare provisions were extended at the end of last year, and then \nthey failed to extend the provisions that had expired in 2009 for over \n2 months.\n  So, today, this present situation I just described brings me to the \noffering of this amendment. This amendment would ensure that Medicare \nprovisions are fully offset, and my amendment would also extend the \nphysicians update through the end of this year. The words ``physician \nupdate'' are directly related to the formula used to determine Medicare \npayments to physicians. On February 28, the extension expired and \nphysician payments were scheduled to be cut by 22 percent under the \nexisting formula, except just recently that was extended so that \ndoesn't actually happen. But this on-again, off-again situation that \ndoctors are put in\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\nought to end, and this amendment I offer will make sure that doesn't \nhappen through all of 2010.\n  I wish to make very clear this isn't just for doctors, even though it \naffects just doctor payment. These provisions are also essential to the \nhealth and well-being of every Medicare beneficiary. This is the \nfiscally responsible way to extend them. We ought to pay for them.\n  These Medicare provisions have been routinely supported by both \nsides, fully offset, and passed repeatedly in recent years. Now, of \ncourse, it is March 3. Medicare beneficiaries around the country are \nsuffering from the Democratic leader's decision to abandon the Baucus-\nGrassley bipartisan package my colleagues and I had worked out weeks \nago.\n  First, there is the urgently needed physician payment update, and \nsometimes around this town we refer to this as the doctors fix for \nshort, to fix the formula, to bring the formula up to date so those 22-\npercent cuts don't go into effect. There was a doctors fix at the end \nof last year through a 2-month extension that expired, as I said, on \nFebruary 28. So as of March 1, physicians and nurses and other health \ncare professionals were subject to these severe cuts of 22 percent. \nThen, because we get a lot of calls--and my office got these calls as \nwell--from doctors concerned about how they are going to keep their \noffices open, we now have a 30-day extension passed last night so these \nphysician payments that would have been a 22-percent cut now, for 3 \ndays, won't take place until, unless we act, the end of March. That is \nnot a very good way to do business if you have to worry about a doctor, \nparticularly in rural America, keeping their offices open and paying \ntheir help, so we ought to do it on a more consistent basis instead of \nrunning month to month.\n\n  These cuts to physician payments cannot be allowed to occur, and as \ndamaging as these would be to beneficiary access to care anywhere, \nthese cuts are even more disastrous for access to care in rural America \nsuch as in Iowa where Medicare reimbursement is already at least 30 \npercent lower than in other areas.\n  I am appalled that seniors' access to physicians and needed medical \ncare has been handled this way because of political games that are \nbeing played by the majority leadership. Should these cuts remain in \nplace, they will have a truly devastating effect on the ability of \nseniors to find doctors who take Medicare patients. Many beneficiaries \nhave already been affected by Medicare provisions that the Senate \nDemocratic leadership allowed to expire even last December.\n  One of the most urgent situations involves limitations that Medicare \nplaces on the amount of certain kinds of treatments for beneficiaries. \nMedicare places annual limits on the amount of outpatient physical \ntherapy, speech language pathology therapy, and occupational therapy \nthat a beneficiary can receive. In other words, the government is \nsaying, regardless of how much health care you need in these areas of \ntherapy, you can only get up to so much dollar amount.\n  Well, laws that have lapsed have allowed special cases to be taken \ncare of contrary to what the law specifically says on dollar limit. In \n2005, the law was changed to provide an exception process to these \ntherapy caps for situations when additional therapy is medically \nneeded, and that needed protection for beneficiaries then expired when \nthe doctors fix expired on December 31. Medicare beneficiaries who have \nsuffered strokes or serious debilitating injuries such as a hip \nfracture have significant rehabilitation needs.\n  So we are in this situation of extending this doctor fix from month \nto month. Situations where patients need this rehabilitation have \nalready exceeded the caps for 2010.\n  Those with the greatest need for therapy will be the hardest hit. \nHere, again, with the 30-day extension bill having passed last night, \nthis problem has been only temporarily fixed. This is another case \nwhere Congress is playing political games with Medicare. These should \nhave been taken care of at the end of last year, and they could have \nalready been resolved if the Senate had taken up the original Baucus-\nGrassley bill instead of replacing it with a cutback, partisan piece of \nlegislation that the Senate handled last year or, one might say, being \nhandled right now with this legislation now on the floor of the Senate \nto which my amendment is being added.\n  Other essential provisions we need to be looking at for extension are \nadditional payments for mental health services. This benefits Medicare \nbeneficiaries in need of mental health counseling, as well as veterans \nsuffering from post-traumatic stress and other disorders since TRICARE \nis based on Medicare rates.\n  Another issue concerns additional payments for ambulance services \nthat many ambulance providers need to keep their doors open. Those \nprovisions also expired at the end of last year, but they were not \nextended in the 30-day bill voted on last night.\n  Another important issue affects community pharmacies. Pharmacies that \nhave not gone through the accreditation process will soon be forced to \nturn away Medicare beneficiaries. A provision in my amendment would \nensure that beneficiaries who need vital medical supplies, such as \ndiabetic test strips, canes, nebulizers, and wound care products, can \ncontinue to have access to these products through their community \npharmacy.\n  Many eligible professionals, such as physicians, nurse practitioners, \nphysical therapists, and others, have been specifically exempted from \nthis accreditation requirement. This provision would also exempt \ncommunity pharmacies under certain conditions.\n  A number of other expired provisions are extended in this package. \nThey include improved payments for hospitals, especially rural \nhospitals, that rely on these provisions just to keep their doors open. \nLike many others, these problems are not fixed in the simple 30-day \nbill passed last night. These problems remain.\n  The impact of a hospital shutting its doors would be especially hard \non rural and underserved areas where hospitals offer the only access to \nhealth care.\n  We need to pass this critically needed and fiscally responsible \namendment now. I urge my colleagues to support it. That is what I have \nto say on my amendment.\n  I would like to take a couple minutes to respond to a couple issues \nthat Senator Durbin brought up. I am not here to refute anything he \nsaid but to give an addendum to what he said on a couple points.\n  One is the use of reconciliation and the opposition that I think is \npretty unified on this side of the aisle that the name of the game \nshould not be changed. He did not say anything inaccurate. But when it \ncomes to reconciliation on a massive 2,700-page bill that we call \nhealth care reform--that is a partisan bill--the same bill that passed \nChristmas Eve in this body, never has reconciliation been used to \nreorganize one-sixth of the entire economy. In other words, about $2.5 \ntrillion out of a $14 trillion economy is being reorganized by that \nhealth care reform bill.\n  I say to Senator Durbin, that is quite a bit different than using \nreconciliation for a tax bill or for a Medicare reform bill or to save \nmoney on certain entitlement programs. It is like peanuts compared to a \nmassive restructuring of one-sixth of the economy. That is why we say \nreconciliation should not be used.\n  A second point for not using reconciliation is the fact that this \nbill has been turned down by the vast majority of the American people. \nThere is overwhelming opposition to this 2,700-page bill, albeit not \noverwhelming opposition to the issue: Is the present health care system \nadequate and should it be changed. I think a slight portion of the \nAmerican people would say yes, and I think most of the 100 Senators \nwould say yes to that. But for this 2,700-page bill, 70 percent of the \nAmerican people have said it needs to be started over again with a \nclean sheet of paper.\n  Then on the issue he brought up of extending Medicare for 10 years, \nthat is true if you use the double accounting in the bill. The \nCongressional Budget Office has stated that it is using double \naccounting. That is not the way you can intellectually count money \ntwice. The Congressional Budget Office, in a paper I read to the \nPresident at the summit last week, claims it is double accounting. That \nis not the way to do business.\n  You can extend the viability of any program by a lot if you are going \nto count money twice, but you cannot do\n\n[[Page S978]]\n\nthat. Some of the problems with the 2,700-page bill, the American \npeople understand. That is why they rejected it. That is why we say \nreconciliation should not be used, and that is why we say we should \nstart over and do things incrementally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3353\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the amendment I want to speak on is No. \n3353. This amendment is extremely simple and it is extremely \nstraightforward.\n  At a time when millions of senior citizens, veterans, and persons \nwith disabilities have slipped out of the middle class and into \npoverty; at a time when the cost of prescription drugs, medical care, \nand heating oil have gone through the roof in many parts of our \ncountry; at a time when millions of seniors have seen the values of \ntheir pensions, their homes, and their life savings plummet; at a \ntime--and here is the important point--for the first time in 36 years, \nseniors will not be receiving a COLA in their Social Security benefits.\n  The amendment I am offering today with Senators Dodd, Leahy, Schumer, \nKerry, Whitehouse, Mikulski, Gillibrand, Lautenberg, and Begich will \nprovide over 55 million senior citizens, veterans, and persons with \ndisabilities $250 in much needed emergency relief. This $250 emergency \npayment is equivalent to a 2-percent increase in benefits for the \naverage Social Security retiree, and it is, as you will recall, the \nsame amount seniors received last year as part of the Recovery Act. In \nother words, what we are doing now is exactly the same as we did last \nyear with the Recovery Act.\n  I do not know about New Mexico, but I do know that in Vermont, a lot \nof senior citizens and disabled veterans are wondering this year why \nthey are not receiving a COLA. They have written to my office and they \nare saying to me: Hey, I don't know what you are talking about because \nmy costs have increased over the last year. That is because, in fact, \nwhile inflation may not have gone up in general, those areas elderly \npeople and people who have health problems utilize--prescription drugs, \nhealth care, other health-related issues--those costs have gone up very \nsubstantially. I think there is an awareness all over this country that \nwe cannot, in the midst of this recession, turn our backs on disabled \nveterans and seniors.\n  This amendment has widespread support from organizations representing \ntens of millions of Americans. Among the organizations that are \nsupporting this amendment are the AARP, the largest senior group in \nAmerica; the American Legion, the largest veterans group in America; \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars; the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare; the Disabled American Veterans; AMVETS and OWL \nand many other organizations.\n  Money directed to this population will go almost immediately into the \neconomy. So when we talk about stimulus, I don't know of a better way \nto get money out into the economy than passing this amendment.\n  I am also very happy and delighted that President Obama is very \nstrongly supportive of a $250 emergency payment to seniors. As you \nknow, the President has spoken out on this issue, he has also included \nit in his budget, and he has also recommended that it be included in \nthe underlying legislation we are debating today.\n  Here is what President Obama has said about this issue:\n\n       Even as we seek to bring about recovery, we must act on \n     behalf of those hardest hit by this recession. That is why I \n     am announcing my support for an additional $250 in emergency \n     recovery assistance for seniors, veterans, and people with \n     disabilities to help them make it through these difficult \n     times. These payments will provide aid to more than 50 \n     million people in the coming year, relief that will not only \n     make a difference for them, but for our economy as a whole, \n     complementing the tax cuts we've provided working families \n     and small businesses through the Recovery Act. This \n     additional assistance will be especially important in the \n     coming months as countless seniors and others have seen their \n     retirement accounts and home values decline as a result of \n     this economic crisis.\n\n  That is the end of the quote by President Obama. I very much \nappreciate the President speaking out and fighting for senior citizens \nand the disabled with regard to this issue.\n  I can tell you that just on Monday I had a meeting with senior \ncitizens and senior citizens organizations in the State of Vermont. It \nwas a very distressing meeting. When we talked, for example, about \nnutrition programs, the Meals on Wheels program or the congregate meals \nprograms by which seniors come to senior citizens centers to get a \ndecent lunch, what people are telling me is that for the first time in \nmany years, when seniors are asked to put money into an envelope--and \nvery carefully, the senior centers don't want to know what people \ncontribute. They ask for, say, $2 or $3, but people can contribute \nwhatever they want. What they are noticing now is that more and more \nseniors are putting nothing into the envelope or maybe just $1. They \nare seeing the same process when people get out in their cars and they \ndeliver Meals on Wheels to very fragile and frail people, often in \nrural areas, and people don't even have the money, now, to even pay $2 \nfor a lunch.\n  All over this country, seniors are hurting. I think they are upset \nand distressed that they are not getting a COLA this year. Essentially, \nwhat this payment is about is a substitute for a COLA. It is a 1-year \npayment, and it is the equivalent of about a 2-percent COLA.\n  Let me mention the response of some of the veterans organizations. \nThis amendment, importantly, will be helping our disabled veterans. \nHere is what the VFW said in support of this amendment:\n\n       This year, veterans and seniors will not receive a COLA. \n     This could not come at a worse time. Your legislation would \n     provide a one-time check of $250 to 1.4 million veterans, \n     48.9 million Social Security recipients, and 5.1 million SSI \n     recipients. We believe that this will provide some relief to \n     those veterans and seniors living on fixed incomes who rely \n     on a COLA to keep up with daily living expenses. The VFW \n     commends you for concentrating on changes that can positively \n     impact the lives of others and looks forward to working with \n     you and your staff to ensure passage of this legislation.\n\n  I thank the Veterans of Foreign Wars for the great work they do and \nfor supporting this amendment. We appreciate their support.\n  Let me quote a letter I recently received from another organization \nthat has been very strong for many years in fighting for senior citizen \nrights; that is, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare. This is what the national committee says:\n\n       The National Committee strongly urges you to pass \n     legislation to provide a $250 payment to our Nation's seniors \n     who did not receive a COLA this year. It is vitally important \n     that we provide help for seniors of modest means who have \n     been adversely affected by the economic recession and rapidly \n     rising health care costs. Seniors have been especially hard \n     hit by the 20 percent to 30 percent decline in the value of \n     employer pensions, IRAs and 401(k)s, as well as the steep \n     drop in housing values. And, unlike younger Americans, the \n     elderly are much less likely to recover their savings losses \n     due to their shorter economic horizon.\n\n  That is from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare. We very much appreciate their support for this amendment.\n  Here is a quote from the AARP, which represents over 40 million \nAmericans, and we very much appreciate their support. This is what the \nAARP says:\n\n       For over three decades, millions of Americans have counted \n     on annual increases to help make ends meet. In this economy, \n     having this protection is even more critical for the \n     financial security of all older Americans. AARP applauds the \n     President for urging Congress to extend for 2010 the $250 \n     economic relief provided to older Americans last year. The \n     65-plus population is facing extreme financial hardship. \n     Older Americans are paying more out of pocket for medical \n     care, have experienced a real decline in their retirement \n     accounts and in housing values, face longer periods of \n     unemployment for those who need work, and low returns on \n     interest bearing accounts. Without relief, millions of older \n     Americans will be unable to afford skyrocketing health care \n     and prescription drug costs as well as other basic \n     necessities. AARP will continue to work with Members of \n     Congress from both sides of the\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\n     aisle to provide $250 in economic relief to millions of \n     seniors who count on Social Security to pay their bills.\n\n  Here is the point, the point the VFW has made, the national committee \nhas made, the AARP has made. Some people may say $250 is not a lot of \nmoney, but the truth is, if you are a senior in the State of Vermont or \nin any other State in this country and your health care costs are going \nup and your prescription drug costs are going up and your heating bills \nare going up and you are not getting any COLA this year, you are in \ntrouble. You are in real trouble. I do not want to give any illusion \nthat this $250 is going to turn people's lives around. It is not. But \nit is going to make a real difference in giving people a little bit of \nsupport, making their lives just a little bit easier.\n  This is extremely important legislation, and it is important \nlegislation that I hope can have widespread bipartisan support.\n  Once again, I thank all the organizations that are supporting this \namendment; that is, the AARP, the American Legion, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare, the Disabled American Veterans, AMVETS, and OWL as well.\n  The bottom line is, we are in the midst of a very serious recession. \nWe are doing our best to try to figure out ways to create the millions \nof good-paying jobs working people need. We are going to pass COBRA to \nmake sure when people lose their jobs they do not lose their health \ninsurance. We are going to extend unemployment benefits. But in the \nmiddle of all of that, let's not forget our parents and our \ngrandparents. Let's not forget senior citizens and disabled veterans. \nLet's pass this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Reforming the Senate\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would like to take a couple of minutes \nthis morning to talk about something that not only affects the \nlegislation currently on the floor but everything we are currently \nworking on in the Senate.\n  Before coming to the Senate a little over a year ago, I spent my life \nin the real world--the world of business, of local government, of \npublic schools and, most importantly of all, of family. But since \ncoming to Washington, I have discovered that many people learn to live \nin an entirely different world, an echo chamber, shut off from the \nreality of life in America that defies common sense at every turn and \nuses anonymous holds to defy the rule of reason.\n  I used to tell my little girls that ``Alice in Wonderland'' was just \na fairy tale. But now I am not so sure. If you come from the real \nworld, when you get to Washington, to Wonderland, the logic can seem \nupside down or inside out or just plain wrong. Here, it turns out that \nfolks attack you when you do not cut backroom deals at the taxpayers' \nexpense. Here, a lot of people seem to think that saying they are for \ndoing something, such as extending unemployment benefits or passing a \njobs bill, is exactly the same thing as actually rolling up their \nsleeves and getting it done. They think that blaming failure on their \nopponent is the same thing as fighting for real change.\n  Coloradans and Americans are reading their papers and watching their \ntelevisions, and what they see drives them nuts. It should because all \nthey find are talking heads yelling at each other on cable news and \ncynical, reckless partisanship paralyzing their government. This phony \npolitical conversation will not do when we need real change.\n  But Washington cannot seem to get out of its own way. That is why I \nwill introduce legislation to end lobbyist abuses, reform the ways of \nthe Senate, stop the outside influences of special interests, and put \nWashington to work for the people of Colorado.\n  First, we need to hold Congress accountable. We should freeze the pay \nand office budgets of every Member of Congress until we have four \nquarters of job growth. Our salaries and office budgets should not go \nup when the rest of the country is struggling. Members of Congress \nshould lose their taxpayer-funded health insurance until we pass health \ninsurance reform. If Congress cannot get its act together on health \ncare, then the American people should not subsidize health care for \nCongress. That goes for Democrats and Republicans. It turns out the \ndysfunction in Washington is just another kind of preexisting condition \nthat allows the insurance companies to get their way.\n  Second, we need real lobbying reform that restores power to the \nvoters. We need to ban Members of Congress from becoming lobbyists when \nthey leave office. We need to do something about the revolving door \nbetween Congress and K Street. We need stronger rules and tighter \nstandards for lobbyist registration and real penalties for those who \nbreak the rules. We need to end the corporate subsidy for Members of \nCongress who fly on corporate jets. Every Member of Congress should pay \ntheir fair share and disclose every person who is on the plane with \nthem.\n  Third, real reform will not be complete without earmark reform. The \npeople of Colorado pay taxes, and they deserve a government that works \nfor them. I have no issue with Members of Congress fighting for \nprojects they think are valuable for their States or for their \ndistricts. I am proud, for example, of the funding we secured for \nprojects, such as the Arkansas Valley Conduit, which languished in the \nSenate since President Kennedy first promised it to the people of \nColorado. But this funding should be done in the light of day, \ncompletely transparent and accountable, not behind closed doors, hidden \nfrom the American people.\n  Under my legislation, Members of Congress will be required to post \nevery earmark request they receive and every request they make for \nfunding. But we should not wait for the law to change. There is no \nreason to wait for the law to change. We can start doing this now.\n  Second, every earmark should be listed in earmarks.gov. The Web site \nshould be easily searchable and user friendly.\n  Third, Members of Congress should be held accountable for their \nrequests. Larger earmark requests should go before the Appropriations \nCommittee, and we should end airdrops of earmarks in conference \ncommittee.\n  Finally, earmark recipients should be held accountable. This means \nrandomly auditing earmarks every year and publishing the results for \nour constituents to see.\n  Next, we need to deal with the challenge of passing real campaign \nfinance reform that reduces the outside influence of special interests. \nI intend to support the bill that Senator Schumer and Congressman Van \nHollen have put together, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Finally, we need to reform the institution of the Senate itself. The \nfilibuster has been used in the Senate for quite some time. It has been \nused by the minority to slow down debate, have their voices heard, and, \nin some cases, stall legislation.\n  I would remind members of my own party that just the threat of a \nfilibuster stopped the privatization of Social Security. However, \nduring this session of Congress, the right to filibuster has been \nabused. It has become a normal part of business, a way to stall every \npiece of legislation and simply slow the Senate to a crawl.\n  Three months ago, we spent weeks debating the extension of \nunemployment benefits. The bill passed 98 to 0. The Senate has spent \ndays, weeks, and sometimes months holding up nominees who passed with \nmore than 90 votes. To add insult to injury, one Senator held up the \nentire Senate, preventing us from extending unemployment benefits and \nCOBRA. The country deserves much better than that.\n  I will introduce legislation that reforms Senate procedure to \nencourage the two parties to work together to get things done. It will \neliminate anonymous holds. If Senators want to single-handedly stop a \nnominee from being\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\napproved, then they should have the courage to do so publicly.\n  It will introduce a new procedure to allow us to reduce the time of \ndebate so we can move on legislation that has broad bipartisan support.\n  Third, it will eliminate the filibuster on the motion to proceed. It \nis one thing to try to block a piece of legislation; it is another \nthing to prevent it from even being debated in the first place.\n  Finally, my legislation would change the rules of the filibuster to \nforce the two parties to actually talk to each other and not past each \nother. The President reminded us during the State of the Union that our \njob is not to get elected. I have heard the same thing from thousands \nof Coloradans in hundreds of living rooms and townhalls. It is easy to \nthrow our hands up in the air and wait for someone else to make the big \nchanges we need. But we all know the American people deserve better. I \nknow the people of Colorado expect much more. They know the Senate \nneeds a big dose of Colorado common sense.\n  I know this is not easy. I know there are 100 different reasons, \nmaybe 1,000 different reasons. Some will say: We cannot get this done. \nBut I also know our country needs a government that works for them. I \nhope my colleagues from both sides of the aisle will work with me and \nothers to make sure we get it done.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3337\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have been talking about having a \nbipartisan effort to rein in spending and some of the things that we \ncan do in that regard. So I am pleased to share a few thoughts today on \nthe legislation that my Democratic colleague, Claire McCaskill of \nMissouri, and I have offered that would ensure that we show some fiscal \ndiscipline in our spending habits.\n  It is not a dramatic change in what we should be doing and what I \nthink we can do, but I think it is an action that would send a message \nto the financial markets in the world that we are beginning to get the \nmessage from our constituents that this recklessness and this kind of \nspending cannot continue.\n  Our legislation received bipartisan support last time. Fifty-six \nSenators voted for it, which is a pretty good number. But you do need \nto get 60 votes to pass the legislation. I think this time, with our \nnew colleague from Massachusetts, we might be at 57 or 58, and at this \npoint, I think others may be evaluating whether this is the kind of \naction they would like to support.\n  Let me take a minute or two to explain what our legislation attempts \nto do, how it can work, how it has worked in the past, and why this \nstep is important. It would set a much firmer cap on spending. It would \nmake it more difficult to enact spending levels that violate the \nbudget. I wish to explain why it is something Members of both parties \ncan support.\n  What we are talking about is moving beyond the budget caps that are \nonly good for 1 year and take those budget caps, extend them for 4 \nyears and make them statutory. It is not something that can't be \nchanged. If there is an emergency, we can vote to change them. In fact, \nCongress can, with 60 votes, eliminate the whole statute and write a \nnew statute, if we believe it is too severe. So Congress clearly would \nhave the ability to act, if it chooses, to get around these limits on \nspending.\n  Back in the early 1990s, legislation was passed that put a statutory \ncap on spending. I have a chart I will show. It is kind of upside down \nin a way. This shows the deficits in the early 1990s. This is when we \npassed the legislation, the statutory cap on spending. The deficits \nwent down until we hit surplus for 4 years in the late 1990s, early \n2000.\n  Then this statutory cap expired. That is when deficits started going \nup, and they are continuing to rise. Last year's deficit was three \ntimes this amount from the year before--three times that amount--one \nthousand four hundred billion in debt last year, and it is expected to \nbe one thousand five hundred billion in deficit this year, for 1 year. \nThis is an unsustainable path.\n  This is a proven technique to gain control of spending. Why it was \nallowed to expire and not extended in 2002, I do not know. I know a \nnumber of people argued that it should be kept, and it was not.\n  Secondly, what is the cap? What would it be? The limit we would place \non spending would be the amount President Obama asked for in his \nbudget. It is 1 to 2 percent in the spending accounts. If you went \nabove that, you would have to have a serious bipartisan vote of two-\nthirds to break that cap the President has set as the proper goal. \nParenthetically, since the President submitted that budget, he has \nindicated he wishes to see a freeze on spending, on nondefense \ndiscretionary accounts, a flat freeze. I would be supportive of that. I \nwould support the President in that. First, if we can get a hard limit \non the 1 to 2-percent increase, we believe we will have done something \nworthwhile.\n  How would this work? If somebody came in and proposed spending levels \nthat exceeded the specific budgetary limits as set by President Obama's \nbudget, it could only be surpassed by waiving the statutory cap. That \ntakes a two-thirds vote. This would have some teeth to it. We have gone \nback and checked. For the last 30 years and every time there has been \nan emergency, such an as an earthquake, an ice storm or a hurricane, \nthe Congress has waived the budget and enacted emergency legislation \nwith 90 votes, 100 votes, high 70 votes every single time. It is \nunlikely that we would see a genuine emergency not being promptly \nfunded with emergency spending, if the Nation has to do that. I don't \nthink that is a problem.\n  What we are saying is, when we have legislation come up that is not \npaid for, that is not accounted for, a person would be able to make a \nbudget point of order and say: You should not have expended moneys at \nmore than a 1-percent or 2-percent increase in this budget account, and \nI make a budget point of order. It would take a two-thirds vote of the \nSenate to waive it. It gives some real teeth to the President's budget, \nthe same kind of teeth President Clinton had during his time in office, \nhis or the congressional budget that was actually passed by the Senate \nand the House. That budget was enforceable. When it was enforceable, we \nachieved a surplus.\n  Let's be frank. It will be more difficult today to achieve a budget \nsurplus than in the 1990s. We have a lot of different factors at work \nhere. One of them is that the deficit is so much larger, and we have \nsome real problems getting there. But we have to begin.\n  You say: Well, you have a budget. Why is this a problem? Why can't \nyou use your budget point of order and stop spending and contain it \nthrough a rate close to inflation and lower rates than we have seen in \nthe past?\n  It didn't work last year. This chart is the 2010 base increases in \nthe year we are in today, the fiscal year 2010. It shows you how \nspending has increased. The chart I have does not include the \nbreathtakingly huge $800 billion stimulus bill. Each one of these \naccounts got money out of that bill. I haven't even included those \namounts. But look what we did the year we are in. The budget had levels \nbelow this, but eventually this is what we passed: Foreign operations, \nforeign aid, State Department got a 32.8-percent increase. Interior \nDepartment got a 16.6-percent increase. CJS, Commerce-Justice-State, is \na 12.3-percent increase. THUD, Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, received a 23-percent increase. Agriculture received a \n14.5-percent increase. Defense, the lowest one, received a 4.1-percent \nincrease. All of these are well above the inflation rate.\n  What I am saying is, this is unsustainable. Every witness we have had \nat the Budget Committee hearing, Democrats and Republicans, Brookings \nand Heritage Foundation, all of them are saying: This is an \nunsustainable course. It has the potential to threaten our economy and \nour political future. One of the witnesses recently said: When you run \nup debts, such as we are doing today, and you get to the very top of \nthe amount of debt this Nation can carry--and we are heading to that\n\n[[Page S981]]\n\ndirection--bad things can happen quickly, unanticipated. You have a \nserious collapse in Greece. The New York Times today reports real \ninstability with regard to the Brits and their debt. If you think \nGreece has an impact on our economy because of their reckless spending, \nthe British economy is far larger and would have an even greater \nimpact. We are not far behind. In fact, in some ways we are ahead of \nthe Brits in the amount of money we are spending and the amount of debt \nwe are accumulating. We are threatening our economy, if we don't watch \nit, in a way that we can't anticipate.\n  There were some private prognosticators who predicted the dramatic \nevents of 2007 and 2008, when we had the Wall Street collapse and the \nfinancial collapse. Some people saw the balloon that was rising and \npredicted bad things would happen. But none of our leaders did. Mr. \nBernanke is supposed to be so great and they brag about him. If he is \nso smart, where was he when all that happened? Our people are suffering \ntoday because of bad decisions.\n  I have a simple view. That is, nothing comes from nothing, and \nnothing ever could. Everything you take today, somebody has paid for \nand bought. If you don't have the money today and you grasp something \nof value, somebody is paying for it. In our case, we are borrowing the \nmoney.\n  We can do better. We did better in the 1990s. We are not going to be \nable to slash spending in record amounts, but in some of our accounts, \nwe absolutely could eliminate spending. Some of the government programs \nhave been independently evaluated as being not worth the money we are \nspending on them. They should be ended. We should not be spending money \non a program that doesn't produce a return worthy of the investment we \nare putting into it. Even if we call it a jobs bill, if we are going to \nhelp people have jobs, if it doesn't produce jobs, how can we spend \nmoney on it? We need to be more vigorous in analyzing it.\n  Please look at this amendment. A few more votes and we could have a \nbipartisan statement that we are going to stick by the budget we \npassed, the budget President Obama submitted. If the President comes in \nand helps us and we battle for it, maybe we can spend less than even \nthis legislation would control. We could even reduce spending in \ncertain accounts. I hope that is possible.\n  This isn't the final word, but it would send a message to the world, \nto Wall Street, and to our constituents that we hear their concerns. We \nare going to take firm steps. We are not going to be waltzing in here \nevery week or two with some other bill that is not paid for and \ntreating it as an emergency and increasing our debt.\n  I see Senator Bunning. A lot of people didn't understand what it was \nhe objected to with regard to the bill containing unemployment \ninsurance. The legislation that came up essentially declared that this \nwas an emergency, that we are going to spend another $10 billion on top \nof the budget amounts, and the budget would not apply to it. Every bit \nof that would have to be financed by borrowing on the world market. \nSenator Bunning said: I am willing to support an unemployment insurance \nextension, but I wish to start paying for it for a change and end this \ncycle of increasing debt and the ease by which we go about it.\n  We are in a big battle right now. Let me say a bipartisan word about \nmy legislation. Because there is so much intensity this year about our \nspending, Senator McCaskill and I have altered the legislation from the \none we voted on a few weeks ago that got 56 votes, 17 Democrats voting \nfor it. We have altered it so it begins next year. So we will have this \nfight this year and each bill will have its own battle. We will have \nour own votes over it, but it only applies to next year. I think that \nis a good-faith way to reach-out to our colleagues and say: Let's at \nleast do that. Let's at least take the caps that we put in place as \npart of our budget, as part of President Obama's budget, and let's put \nthem into effect. We will start it next year.\n  If we go above that and somebody has an idea of going above it, it \nwon't be so easy. It will take a two-thirds vote to do so. So if you \ndon't believe we ought to make it tougher to bust the budget, don't \nvote for it. But if you believe, as I think most constituents believe, \nwe are showing too little fiscal discipline, then you should vote for \nit. It would give us a proven ability to contain spending and get us \nbeginning on the right track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 3360 and 3361 to Amendment No. 3336\n\n               (Purpose: To offset the cost of the bill)\n\n                (Purpose: To provide additional offsets)\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside so I can call up my two amendments which are at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendments.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] proposes amendments \n     numbered 3360 and 3361 to amendment No. 3336 en bloc.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendments are printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, anyone who has paid attention to the \nfloor of the Senate for the last week knows what my amendments are \nabout. I am offering Senators two ways to pay for this spending bill.\n  First of all, I would like to submit for the Record the CBO scoring \nof this current bill that is before us--both the scoring and the \noffsets. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S982]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS03MR10.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S983]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS03MR10.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. The first amendment is to use unspent stimulus funds and \nthe second is by shutting down unnecessary or duplicate Federal \nprograms. In other words, I am saying we should use money we have \nalready set aside that has not been spent or eliminate wasteful \nspending to pay for the benefits that are in this current bill.\n  Over the last few days, many Senators on the other side of the aisle \nhave come to the floor and said unemployment benefits are the best form \nof stimulus available. They say the families who are getting those \nbenefits turn around and spend the money immediately. Well, if that is \ntrue, I cannot think of a better use of the money from last year's so-\ncalled stimulus bill. Why leave that money sitting around unused in a \ngovernment account somewhere when those funds could get into the hands \nof people who need them the most and will put them into the economy \nright away? What is so sacred about the stimulus bill that we should \nkeep that money sitting around until it can be spent later this year or \nnext year or even in 2012 and beyond? Why not help the people now?\n  But for the Senators who think the stimulus money is so sacred that \nit cannot be touched, I am proposing another way to pay for this bill. \nSenator Coburn, my colleague from Oklahoma, has identified well more \nthan $120 billion worth of savings from waste, fraud, and abuse. These \nsavings include closing the Federal employee tax gap; that is, making \nsure all Federal employees pay all the taxes they owe, and stopping the \npayment of benefits to people and companies that are not entitled to \nthose benefits.\n  The amendment would also be paid for by ending Federal programs that \nare no longer needed or duplicates of other government programs and \nmaking existing programs run more efficiently. I think the President's \nbudget itself has hit on many of those programs he would like to see \neliminated or partially eliminated. I think it is safe to call that \nwasteful spending, and I think the taxpayers who are footing the bill \nfor those programs would agree.\n  Families all across America have to tighten their budgets when times \nget tough, and government should do the same. That is all I am trying \nto do with these two amendments.\n  I am sure some will accuse me of being against the programs in this \nbill. But the record should be clear by now that I support helping \npeople in their time of need. In fact, every Member of the Senate who \nwas able to make the votes last night supported extension of those \nbenefits, either in my pay-for version or in the version that added to \nthe debt. My amendments are not about whether we should extend these \nprograms. No. My amendments are about whether we should pay for \nextending these programs or whether we should keep piling more debt on \ntop of the $14 trillion-plus debt we have already. I think the answer \nis very clear.\n  Last night, I thought we had a deal worked out to give me an up-or-\ndown vote on my amendment to pay for the short-term extender bill. \nInstead, one Senator raised a budget point of order against the \namendment, and I expect someone will try to do the same thing today \nwith my amendments. That was her right as a Senator, but it is \ncertainly not within the spirit of the agreement I tried to reach to \nfind a way forward on these important programs.\n  But I think the larger question raised by that move is, What are the \n53 Senators who voted to block my amendment afraid of? Are they afraid \nthe Senate might pay for something we do? Are they afraid we might take \na step toward balancing the Federal budget? Are they afraid we will \nbring Washington spending, which is out of control, just a little bit \nunder control and live under the same rules as ordinary American \nfamilies?\n  Is it too much to ask that we pay for what we spend? Last night, 53 \nSenators said yes, it is too much to ask for. But I think it is not. \nToday, every Senator will have an opportunity to join me in saying it \nis not too much to ask or they can vote against my amendments and add \nanother $100 billion-plus to the national debt. That is the emergency \nspending in this present bill--over $100 billion. So that goes onto the \nbottom line of the Federal debt.\n  I urge every Senator to vote for my amendments to pay for this \nspending, to put away the taxpayers' credit card, and to put an end to \nthe debt madness. I have examples of those spending rescissions.\n  As an example, there is $245 million from congressional office \nbudgets, to end some of the perks congressional leadership and \ncongressional offices have; to end the Forest Service Economic Action \nProgram, $5 million. I think the President put this in his budget. The \nprogram duplicates an existing USDA program--Urban and Community \nForestry--that has been poorly managed.\n  Another is to end the Public Telecommunications Facilities Grant \nProgram, $18 million. I am positive this was in the President's budget. \nThis program is intended to help public broadcasting stations construct \ntelecom facilities. Since the transition to digital broadcasting has \nbeen completed, there is no more need for this program.\n  On down the line--end HUD's Brownfields Economic Development \nInitiative, $17 million; reduce the historic preservation services \nwithin the Interior Department by $55 million. This is a grant program \nduplicated by other programs at the Interior Department.\n  This is one I am very familiar with because when I was in the House, \nwe thought this was a necessary program to put our economic footing on \nforeign soil, the same as other foreign-based companies did when they \ncame to America. End the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, $52 \nmillion. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation loans private U.S. \ncompanies funding for foreign investments and insurance. The U.S. Trade \nand Development Agency does the very same thing.\n  Another is to eliminate $28 million in the Department of \nTransportation that has been directed at transportation museums--\nmuseums. I do not think we should be building new museums with \nDepartment of Transportation funds. I think we should be building \nroads.\n  Those are just a few examples of some of the rescissions I would like \nto see in the second amendment I have offered today. I think there will \nbe ample time to discuss these later on, but I wanted to make sure we \noffered these amendments early on so we could have a good and thorough \ndebate on these programs as this bill proceeds through the Senate.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3356\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this morning because I am offering \nan amendment on youth summer jobs that will build on and extend the \nextremely successful summer jobs program we included in last year's \nRecovery Act. Last summer's program put over 313,000 young people to \nwork and provided a much needed shot in the arm to them, their \nfamilies, and businesses and communities around the country. I have \npersonally heard stories from young men and women who participated in \nthe program who told me how much it changed their lives and gave them \nthe skills and the experience they know they need to exceed in school \nand in the workforce. That is why, while we are focusing on legislation \nthat will support unemployed Americans and help workers get back on the \njob, we should also continue investing in a successful program that \nhelps our young people get to work.\n  The amendment I am offering today will provide $1.5 billion through \nthe Workforce Investment Act to create 500,000 temporary jobs for young \npeople across the country. It will invest in critically needed \nemployment and learning programs that will help stimulate our local \neconomies while providing meaningful short-term work and learning \nexperiences for the young people who really need it the most.\n  In addition to the summer jobs program, this amendment also supports \nyear-round employment and longer term efforts to help our young people \nobtain a postsecondary degree or credential.\n  Growing up, I had every different kind of summer job you can ever \nimagine. I started out working in my father's five-and-ten-cent store \non Main Street in Bothell, and, along with my brothers and sisters, I \ndid everything from stocking the shelves, to working the cash register, \nto sweeping the floor. Later on, I worked at a summer job at Sacajawea \nState Park in Pasco, where\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\nI did weeding, kept the restrooms clean, and helped make the park \npresentable. One summer, I answered phones at a glass company in my \nhometown of Bothell. I also, one summer, worked at a psychiatric ward \nat the VA during a summer in college.\n  Looking back, I can tell that each one of those jobs I held as a \nyoung person helped me in a very unique way. Each one of them taught me \nskills and lessons I have been able to use throughout my life. Those \njobs taught me everything from the value of hard work to the daily \nchallenges of running a small business, how to dress and act in a \nprofessional work setting, but, most of all, those jobs helped me be \nexposed to new experiences and new people and new challenges. In fact, \nmy time working at the Seattle VA that summer gave me an appreciation \nof our veterans and health care workers that has driven me to fight for \nthem every single day I am in the Senate now.\n\n  It is not just me. Summer jobs have been proven to teach skills and \nlife lessons for everyone. Studies have shown that people who get early \nwork experience as teenagers make more money as adults. In fact, early \nwork experience has been shown to raise earnings 10 to 20 percent over \na lifetime.\n  However, as we all know, today teens are finding it especially \ndifficult to find a job. Over the past 2 years, the number of employed \nteens in the United States has declined by nearly 25 percent, and their \noverall employment rate fell to a new post-World War II low of 25 \npercent by the end of last year, more than 18 percentage points below \nthe rate in 2000. In fact, the total proportion of young people who \nwere employed last July, the traditional peak time for youth jobs, was \nonly 51.4 percent. That is the lowest July rate on record.\n  Today, with families who are cutting their spending so they can pay \ntheir bills and businesses having to freeze hirings so they can pay \ntheirs, that means even fewer jobs for young people today.\n  I don't think we should forget teen jobs will help stimulate our \nlocal economies because, as anybody who has had a teenager at home \nknows, young people are a lot more likely to spend their paychecks in \ntheir communities than pocket them. When a young person does, in fact, \nsave their wages, oftentimes they are saving for college or making a \ncritical contribution to their families in this very difficult time.\n  Sometimes I hear people talk about these big national programs and \ntoo often forget there are real people being impacted, real families \nbeing helped, and real young people being offered such an important \nhelping hand. I wished to share with everyone a story about what this \nfunding meant for a program in King County, WA, last year for a young \nman who had the opportunity to participate because of the funding we \nprovided last year.\n  Back in 2007, King County was able to provide 200 local youth jobs \nfor that year. They were able to provide about the same number--200 or \nso--in 2008. Then, last summer, with the funding we secured for them in \nthe Recovery Act and under the leadership of a great CEO, Marlena \nSessions, they were able to provide 900 young people with summer work \nexperience. Nine hundred young people in King County last summer had \nthe opportunity to productively engage in their community and avoid \nthat high risk in criminal activity we worry about and, importantly, \nlearn the 21st century skills employers value, such as critical \nthinking and teamwork and problem solving and communication.\n  One of those participants in King County was a young man named Ryan. \nHe spent his summer last year working at a maritime supply company in \nSeattle, a company called Washington Chain. Ryan had gotten into a lot \nof trouble in his life in the past. He was actually on work release \nfrom prison. He didn't have many of the skills employers are looking \nfor in employees, so he went out and applied for job after job, fast \nfood restaurants and more of the same. He actually put out 200 \napplications in total without a single one willing to take a chance on \nhim after they found out about his record.\n  Well, Ryan heard about the Seattle King County Summer Jobs program, \nand you know what. It changed his life. Ryan was accepted into a \nprogram that was a partnership between a youth service provider and a \ncommunity college. He spent 3 weeks in class, followed by 3 weeks in a \npaid internship at Washington Chain. The company wasn't planning on \nhiring any new full-time employees, but at the end of last summer, this \nexperience changed Ryan so much and they were so impressed with Ryan \nand his work capability that the company found a full-time job for him. \nIt was a real job for Ryan, with a decent salary and good benefits and \na future. For the first time in his life, Ryan was able to take pride \nin his work and finally support himself and his young children.\n  After the program was over, Ryan said the program was ``one of the \nbest things that ever happened to me.'' His boss at Washington Chain \nsaid the company was lucky to find Ryan. He said Ryan had been \n``willing to do just about everything we have asked him.''\n  The summer jobs program we passed last year gave Ryan and many more \nlike him an opportunity they would not otherwise have had. It is a new \nlease on life for him, and doors opened to him that had always been \nclosed to him. Ryan is far from alone. There are hundreds of thousands \nof young people around the country whose lives were changed by the \nexperiences they had last summer.\n  So if this amendment I am offering today passes, there will be \n500,000 more by this time next year. Five hundred thousand young people \nwill be providing much needed services in hospitals and daycare \ncenters, in senior centers, in parks, in public and in private \norganizations, staying off the streets, helping their communities, \ngaining the skills and the experiences they need to put them on a \nbetter path to success in school and life. Yes, by the way, they will \nbe spending those paychecks and contributing to our economic recovery.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this amendment. The underlying bill \nwe are considering today is going to help millions of families across \nthe country who need some help right now getting back on their feet. \nThis amendment will help young people across this country start their \nprofessional lives by firmly planting them on moving toward a \nsuccessful, productive, and fulfilling career. I hope all our \ncolleagues take the time to think back and think about what happened to \nthem and people they know in their lives, where they had a summer job \nexperience that helped set them on a path they may have never thought \navailable to them and that it is our responsibility, in this Chamber, \nto now provide that same opportunity for young people who are following \nin our footsteps.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank Senator Thune. He \ngave me permission to speak before him. I will be brief in my strong \nsupport for the Murray amendment to provide $1.5 billion for youth jobs \nprograms through the Workforce Investment Act for summer and year-round \nemployment.\n  This amendment will help create up to 500,000 temporary jobs for \nyoung people.\n  We know the youth jobs program works. Funds included in the Recovery \nAct for youth jobs provided over 300,000 young adults with employment \nopportunities last summer, stimulating local economies all across the \ncountry. Young adults who work not only help supplement family incomes, \nthey also spend the money they earn in their communities. According to \nthe Northeastern University Center for Labor Market Studies, every \ndollar earned by a young adult returns $3 to the local economy.\n  Youth jobs programs also help disadvantaged young adults become \nactive members of their communities.\n  The many local workforce investment groups in my State of California \nnot only provide disadvantaged young adults with short-term employment, \nthey also offer job training and mentoring programs, help them advance \ntheir careers with educational opportunities, and teach critical life \nskills.\n  We also know right now there are not enough work opportunities for \nteens and young adults. The unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds \nis above 25 percent. For 16 to 19-year-old African Americans, the \nunemployment rate is\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\nnearly 50 percent. Youth jobs programs help keep our kids off the \nstreets, which is important to all our communities.\n  I wish to highlight one of the many Recovery Act youth jobs success \nstories in California. The Placer Herald reported that last summer the \nGolden Sierra Investment Board worked with 23 disadvantaged teens in \nRocklin, CA, to construct a permanent storage facility at a local high \nschool. The participants helped design the facility using computer \ndesign technologies. They built the mainframe, painted and dry-walled \nand installed solar lighting. Without Recovery Act youth job funds, \nthis program wouldn't have been possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article \nfrom the Rocklin, CA, Placer Herald. It is a wonderful story about the \nhigh school students taking on this building project.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Placer Herald, July 30, 2009]\n\n             High School Students Take on Building Project\n\n                           (By Lauren Weber)\n\n       With a little strength, time and sweat, a group of youth \n     from Rocklin have created a permanent structure for Whitney \n     High School.\n       It took more than 200 hours of service, but 23 teens built \n     a 24-by-48-foot storage center to house the ground's \n     equipment for the school. The hands-on project had the \n     students framing the structure, installing solar lighting, \n     putting up dry walls and painting the exterior green.\n       ``They really did this from the ground up,'' said Sherry \n     Mauser, Whitney High School assistant principal.\n       Mauser oversaw the process and was instrumental in getting \n     the $25,000 grant that funded the project. She contacted \n     Golden Sierra, an employment and training service for people \n     in Placer, Alpine and El Dorado counties and a partnership \n     was formed.\n       Sharon Williams, a summer youth coordinator for Golden \n     Sierra, said President Barack Obama's stimulus project gave \n     money for summer programs.\n       ``They encouraged the agencies to get bids on either in-\n     school projects or some of our projects are out-of-school \n     projects,'' Williams said.\n       The grant went toward the purchase of materials, safety \n     equipment like hard hats and salaries for the adults on-site, \n     Mauser said. The district also contributed some money from \n     their facilities fund for the construction of a larger \n     building.\n       The teens are paid as well and for many it was their first \n     job.\n       ``It's been a real learning project for these kids,'' \n     Williams said.\n       Williams was on-site to also oversee that child labor laws \n     were upheld, such as no one under 18-years-old on the ladder.\n       Many of the students, both from Rocklin and Whitney high \n     schools, had never taken on construction jobs before. But \n     with a little assistance from experts, they became \n     knowledgable in Computer-Aided Design drawings, how to put up \n     dry wall and build the frame.\n       Kyle Balance, 19, and a recent Whitney High School grad, \n     said his favorite aspect of the project was the framing and \n     said he was impressed with how quickly it went up.\n       Rocklin High School junior Alessio Alba said he enjoyed the \n     more computer-related aspect.\n       ``I liked using the CAD system,'' he said.\n       The group came up with computer drawings, which paved the \n     way for the beginning of the project in June.\n       From start to finish, the students were deeply involved, \n     Mauser said.\n       ``Everybody worked as a team on this one,'' she said.\n       Last week, the students were in the last stages, finishing \n     up the drywall and getting ready to paint the interior. \n     Whitney High School student Mike Mello said although he'd \n     never been part of a construction project, it is something he \n     has enjoyed.\n       ``This is fun,'' he said. ``I like working with my hands, \n     being out in the field.''\n       Rocklin High School student John Wong has a four-mile \n     commute on his bike to get to the project site everyday, but \n     has been dedicated, Mauser said.\n       His father owns a door company, so he's been around \n     construction before and may pursue a career in the \n     construction field, he said. This hands-on opportunity may \n     have aided his future career.\n       Construction of the space was complete Wednesday and the \n     students will be recognized at the Rocklin Unified School \n     District school board meeting Aug. 5.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. So this amendment is very important. As our economy \ncontinues to recover, we all know jobs are lagging. We need to do all \nwe can to try to replicate what happened in Rocklin, CA.\n  When you give a young person opportunity, a job opportunity, I think \nit stays with them the rest of their life. I remember the jobs I held \nwhen I was a teenager. One gave me a sense of self that I could help \nthe company I was working for. I did many different jobs as a youngster \nin the summer. I was very fortunate to have that experience that I \nbrought to other jobs later in my career.\n  So this amendment will create up to 500,000 summer jobs. It will \nstrengthen local economies.\n  I do thank Senator Murray and the other cosponsors in the Senate. In \nclosing, I wish to acknowledge Congresswoman Barbara Lee and the \nCongressional Black Caucus, who are leading the fight in the House to \nsupport critical youth job programs for our disadvantaged young people. \nWhen I talked to Congresswoman Lee, she said: Barbara, can you do \nsomething in the Senate. I remembered Senator Murray had this bill, and \nI called Senator Murray. We have this amendment here. I think the fact \nthat it has been offered early in this bill is good because this is \nsomething we can do for our young people. They want so much to get job \nexperience. They are struggling so much in this recession.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Murray and the other cosponsors. I \nhope we have strong bipartisan support for this amendment.\n  Again, I thank Senator Thune for allowing me to speak, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TRANSFER OF STIMULUS FUNDS.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 5 of the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub.

Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that Senators \nBennett and Roberts be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday, one of my colleagues criticized \nme for trying to redirect unspent stimulus funding to pay for tax \nrelief for small businesses by citing all the jobs the stimulus bill \nsupposedly created. I, as many people do, have my doubts about some of \nthese estimates, but I can guarantee this much: none of these jobs have \nbeen created or saved by the unspent funds.\n  There is a lot of money in the stimulus bill that has yet to be \nspent, according to recovery.org, which is the\n\n[[Page S988]]\n\nadministration's Web site. About 38 percent of the stimulus money \napproved last year out of that $1 trillion amount--round numbers--has \nbeen spent. So there is a lot of unspent and unobligated money.\n  Frankly, many of us, at the time it passed last year, suggested it \nwould be a much wiser use of those funds if we directed those toward \nsmall businesses. Small businesses are the creators of jobs in our \neconomy. They create two-thirds of the jobs. They are the economic \nengine that drives the economy in this country. Ironically, less than 1 \npercent of that $1 trillion that was approved last year in stimulus \nfunding was directed at incentives for small businesses to create jobs. \nWe put money into all kinds of other things which, to date, have shown \nlittle evidence that any jobs have been created. It seems to me, at \nleast, and the argument that was made at the time by many of us, was \nthat allowing or creating more of these incentives, putting more \npolicies in place that would incentivize small businesses to create \njobs would have been a much better use of stimulus money.\n  What my amendment very simply says is, of those unspent, unobligated \nfunds--and that universe of funds represents about $160 billion that \nhas not only not been spent but not obligated--we use some of those \nfunds to do what we should have done in the first place; that is, to \ncreate incentives for small businesses to hire new people, to put \npeople back to work, and to make capital investments.\n  I take issue with what was said on the floor yesterday, that somehow \nmy amendment was going to cut the Economic Recovery Act short. It \ndoesn't do that at all. In fact, what this does is simply say those \nfunds that have not been spent, not been obligated in the stimulus bill \nthat was passed last year, be redirected toward these particular \nprovisions that will provide incentives for small businesses to create \njobs. Very simply, what are those? It extends by 1 year the bonus \ndepreciation that allows small businesses to accelerate the way they \nwrite off equipment purchases; accelerated depreciation schedules so \nthey can take more of that cost upfront as a deduction.\n  It also makes permanent the section 179 deduction and increases that \nas well so that small businesses are able to expense more of those \ntypes of investments--again, an incentive for them to invest more, \nhopefully to create jobs.\n  It eliminates the capital gains tax on investment in small \nbusinesses. By the way, that is something the President, in his State \nof the Union speech, came out in support of. So this is something the \nWhite House has already endorsed.\n  Finally, it provides for a 20-percent deduction for small businesses \nagainst their income. Why is that necessary? Many small businesses, \nand, in fact, half of small business income, we are told, when tax \nrates go up next year would be subject to that higher tax. If a small \nbusiness that passes through their income to their individual tax \nreturn is currently paying at the 33-percent tax rate, they are going \nto see that tax rate go up to 36 percent of that income. If they are \ncurrently paying at the 35-percent tax rate, they are going to see \ntheir tax rate go up to 39.6 percent starting next year, in 2011. This \nallows them to take a 20-percent deduction against their income that \nwill help in some ways limit or mitigate the impact of the higher tax \nrates that they will be subject to beginning in 2011.\n  Again, I think it is a fairly straightforward amendment, and I simply \nargue, again, to my colleagues that it makes sense for us, in my view, \nto be making investments, be putting policies in place that will \nincentivize job creation in this country, and that job creation, again, \noccurs in the private economy with small businesses.\n  Small businesses, we are told, create two-thirds of the jobs in our \neconomy and, in fact, about half of the people in this country who \nwork, who are employed currently, work for small businesses. They have \na tremendous impact on our economic well-being, on job creation.\n  It is important, in my view, that we take steps here that will add to \nthe ability of our small businesses to get out there and do what they \ndo best; that is, make investments and create jobs.\n  I take issue with what was said yesterday about this amendment: that \nit would cut short the Economic Recovery Act. It does not do that at \nall. These are not funds that have currently been spent or obligated. \nThese are funds that are unspent, unobligated out of the $1 trillion \nbill passed last year which, as we all know, to date has not created \nthe jobs promised. In fact, since the bill passed last year, we have \nlost 2.7 million jobs in our economy.\n  I think, frankly, one of the reasons for that is it was misdirected \nin the first place. We should have been focused on job No. 1, and that \nis helping those job creators in our economy, which are small \nbusinesses.\n  I want to point out that the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, which is the largest trade organization representing small \nbusinesses in this country, at least the largest small business \nadvocacy organization, has written a letter in support of my amendment. \nI want to read one paragraph from that letter. It says:\n\n       The Thune amendment is a necessary step in helping to \n     provide more certainty to small businesses about their future \n     tax liability, whether to make long term capital \n     expenditures, and hire more workers. We hope this amendment \n     will provide momentum to clear other obstacles in the path to \n     job creation.\n\n  I guess what I would say by way of closing is that although there is \na great debate here about how best to create jobs, I think we can all \nagree a lot of the $1 trillion stimulus bill that passed last year has \nnot been spent. The argument that it would be timely, targeted, and \ntemporary, I think all of those criteria have not been met. More \nimportant, the ultimate metric by which I think we judge whether it has \nbeen a success or not has not been met either, and that is job \ncreation.\n  Look at the economy today. Unemployment stands at 9.7 percent. The \ncommitment made when the bill was passed a year ago was that if we pass \nthis stimulus bill, we will hold unemployment below 8 percent. We know \nit is well past that.\n  If you look again at the job numbers and the number of people in this \ncountry still looking for work, still struggling, still struggling with \nthe loss of income, the best thing we can do is get them back to work, \nand the best way to do that is not to create jobs in Washington, DC, or \ninvest in government programs; it is, frankly, to get the small \nbusinesses in our economy, the creators of jobs, the engine that drives \nthis economy forward, liberated in a way, providing certainty with \nregard to tax policy so they know that in 2011, when their tax rates go \nup--at least those who pass their income through their individual tax \nreturn--they are going to have some relief, allowing some relief with \nregard to capital gains taxes by exempting small business investment, \nallowing for bonus depreciation so they can write off business \npurchases, and increasing section 179 expensing, that deduction that \ncurrently exists in the Tax Code making that permanent.\n  Those are all steps, small steps, but at least important steps, in my \nview, that will move this economy forward and do what I think many of \nus want to see done; that is, create the conditions and the economic \nclimate where jobs can be created where we get people back to work.\n  We are going to have a vote on this amendment this afternoon. Again, \nmy colleagues who were debating an underlying bill that has tax \nextenders, COBRA extension, unemployment benefits extension--all of \nthose sorts of things, all of which I understand are important, \nparticularly right now when we have a lot of people who are out of \nwork. But, again, the best remedy we can offer to the American people \nis to create jobs and get people back to work. That will make it less \nnecessary for us to act on the legislation we have to act on today that \naddresses all the economic dislocation and hurt the American people are \nexperiencing as a result of this economy.\n  A year ago when this stimulus bill passed, less than 1 percent of the \nmoney was directed toward small businesses. We can fix that today with \nthis amendment by directing these tax incentives, using unspent, \nunobligated stimulus money to do it. It is all paid for. It is all \noffset. It does not pass debt to future generations. It does not add to \nthe deficit. It is all paid for. It puts the money where it should have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\nput in the first place and directs it in a way that will be adding to \njob creation in this country.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it will be \nvoted on in a couple of hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I will offer an amendment to the pending \nlegislation, amendment No. 3342. It is my intention to call up that \namendment after the votes on the pending amendments this afternoon, but \nI would like to take a few minutes to explain to my colleagues the \nnature of this amendment and why I believe it is important.\n  This amendment basically says if you are an executive at one of the \ncompanies that received more than $5 billion in the TARP bailout, the \nfinancial bailout that occurred when we began our economic crisis, and \nif you receive in addition to your compensation a bonus in excess of \n$400,000, then that amount above $400,000--which is the approximate \ncompensation of our President--will be taxed at 50 percent, and the \namount it is taxed will be returned to the American taxpayers for \ndeficit reduction.\n  It is a very simple amendment. It is a one-time amendment based on a \nunique situation in this country when the American taxpayers had to \nbail out our major companies in order to stabilize our economy.\n  This is not class warfare. It is not a continuing windfall profits \ntax. But I believe it is very proper for us to institute this on a one-\ntime basis. Estimates we have had, when I offered this amendment as \nindependent legislation a short while ago, along with Senator Boxer, \nwere that you could recoup in the neighborhood of $10 billion back into \nour economy by this very fair tax assessment.\n  I want to go back to two opinion pieces that have been written over \nthe last couple of years from people with great standing in the \nfinancial community and great philosophical differences. Then I want to \nremind my colleagues the process we had to enter into when the TARP \nlegislation was first voted on.\n\n  On July 14, 2008, Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, \nwrote a piece in the New York Times. I came to the floor at that time \nand quoted from his piece. He was talking about the beginning of what \nbecame our crisis, and he made the point:\n\n       It's the belief of investors--\n\n  He was talking at this point about the situation with Fannie and \nFreddie, to quote from his article.\n\n       It's the belief of investors if they fail, the federal \n     government will come to their rescue.\n\n  Then he wrote:\n\n       The implicit guarantee means that profits are privatized \n     while losses are socialized.\n\n  What he meant by that and what we actually have seen play out as our \neconomy, thankfully, has begun to recover is, with the situation we \nentered into with TARP, risk was socialized. That means the average \nworker in this country--the person out there driving a truck, the nurse \nworking in a hospital, the people doing the day-to-day work--had to put \ntheir tax dollars in to stabilize these banking systems, but the reward \nfrom the stabilization has become personalized to the executives who \nwere running these companies, who then have benefited through these \nlarge bonus systems once our economy began to stabilize.\n  It is my strong belief, as someone who is a supporter of people who \nare willing to take risks and create the right kind of environment for \ngrowth in our economy, that they should be happy once they have reached \na point where they have been compensated and they have had a $400,000 \nbonus. They should be happy to take the money beyond that $400,000 \nbonus and divide it up with the average worker out here who may not \neven own stock who had to put their tax dollars in to stabilize the \neconomy.\n  The second article I would like to quote from is from the Financial \nTimes which, as all of my colleagues will recognize, is one of the most \nconservative newspapers in the world when it comes to capitalist \nenterprise, risk taking, rewarding the people who get out and lead in \nour business sector.\n  Martin Wolf wrote an editorial on November 19, 2009, not that long \nago. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the entire \narticle after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, Martin Wolf said this:\n\n       Windfall taxes are a ghastly idea. . . . No sensible person \n     should support them. So why do I now find the idea of a \n     windfall tax on banks so appealing? Well, this time, it \n     really does look different.\n\n  Mr. Wolf goes on to point out:\n\n       Ordinary people can accept that risk takers receive huge \n     rewards. But such rewards for those who have been rescued by \n     the state and bear substantial responsibility for the crisis \n     are surely intolerable. . . . The public finances will be \n     devastated for decades: taxes will be higher and public \n     spending lower. Meanwhile, bankers are about to reap huge \n     rewards. This damages the legitimacy of the market economy.\n\n  Mr. Wolf went on to support the very concept I am putting on the \ntable today; that is, a one-time windfall profits tax on moneys that \nwere earned in 2009 when this American taxpayer rescue of our financial \nsystem occurred, when earnings that occurred through work in 2009, \nwhich are paid in 2010--this is not a retroactive tax; one shot, \nbalance the playing field and reward the people who stepped forward to \nhelp save our economy.\n  Sometimes it is hard for us to remember the circumstances that took \nplace when we were asked to vote for TARP back in September of 2008 \nbecause so much has happened to our economy and to the debate in this \ncountry since then. But we should remember that in September of 2008, \nSecretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke put us all on a conference \ncall. They told us if we did not put $700 billion of taxpayer money \ninto a program to assist our major Federal financial institutions that \nthe world as we knew it economically was going to fall into cataclysm. \nWe voted in support of this $700 billion--I voted for it--in order to \nhelp these financial institutions solve the problems, undo their \nsystems of bad assets--which had taken place, quite frankly, through a \nlot of bad judgment in their leadership--free up our economic system \nand get credit going again. And we did it with the explicit \nunderstanding that it was the American taxpayers who were putting the \nmoney in and who, when the system righted itself, would get their money \nback. So this one-shot deal is designed to help do that.\n\n  It is fair to all parties. It allows the executives in these 13 \ncompanies that received more than $5 billion each of taxpayer money to \nstill reward their executives and at the same time share these profits, \nor these benefits that go beyond a $400,000 bonus, with the people who \nbasically pulled their fat out of the fire.\n  I hope we can get a vote on this amendment. I trust my colleagues \nwill understand the care with which it was designed and the equity we \nare trying to deal with.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Financial Times, Nov. 19, 2009]\n\n                    Tax the Windfall Banking Bonuses\n\n                            (By Martin Wolf)\n\n       Windfall taxes are a ghastly idea. They are a sop to \n     prejudice, a burden on risk-taking and a form of arbitrary \n     confiscation. No sensible person should support them. So why \n     do I now find the idea of a windfall tax on banks so \n     appealing? Well, this time, it really does look different.\n       First, all the institutions making exceptional profits do \n     so because they are beneficiaries of unlimited state \n     insurance for themselves and their counterparties. As Andrew \n     Haldane of the Bank of England argues, the state has ``become \n     the last resort financier of the banks''. In the UK, total \n     support amounted to a staggering 74 per cent of gross \n     domestic product. These must be the largest business \n     subsidies ever.\n       Second, the profits being made today are in large part the \n     fruit of the free money provided by the central bank, an arm \n     of the state. The state is giving the surviving banks a \n     licence to print money.\n       Third, the case for generous subventions is to restore the \n     financial system--and so the economy--to health. It is not to \n     enrich bankers, particularly not those engaged in the sorts \n     of trading activities that destroyed the financial system in \n     the first place.\n       Fourth, ordinary people can accept that risk takers receive \n     huge rewards. But such rewards for those who have been \n     rescued by the state and bear substantial responsibility for \n     the crisis are surely intolerable. What makes them yet more \n     so is that the crisis has devastated the prospects of tens, \n     if not hundreds, of millions of innocents all over\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\n     the globe. The public finances will be devastated for \n     decades: taxes will be higher and public spending lower. \n     Meanwhile, bankers are about to reap huge rewards. This \n     damages the legitimacy of the market economy.\n       Fifth, it is hard to argue in favour of exceptional \n     interventions to bail out the financial sector at times of \n     crisis, and also against exceptional interventions to recoup \n     costs when the crisis is past. ``Windfall'' support should be \n     matched by windfall taxes.\n       Finally, these are genuine windfalls. They are, as George \n     Soros has said, ``hidden gifts'' from the state. What the \n     state gives, the state is entitled to take back, if it is not \n     used for the state's purposes.\n       So the question, in my mind, is not whether a windfall tax \n     can be justified but whether it can be designed successfully. \n     All taxes have unintended consequences. One must be \n     particularly careful with this one.\n       Since the aim of policy is to recapitalise the banks, the \n     tax should not reduce their ability to do so. It would be far \n     better then to impose a tax on contributions made to the \n     bonus pool. There is no public interest in such payments. \n     Since it would be a one-off event, it should not affect \n     incentives (unless banks plan to create systemic crises every \n     few years). If the tax applied to all banks operating within \n     a given jurisdiction, it would not affect competitiveness \n     among them. The case seems strong--even more so if the tax \n     could be implemented across major jurisdictions, \n     simultaneously.\n       Yet windfall taxes cannot contain financial excess, \n     precisely because their goal is not to affect incentives. So \n     what is to be done?\n       As Mr. Haldane notes, we have seen ``a progressive rise in \n     banking risk and an accompanying widening and deepening of \n     the state safety net''. As the liabilities of the banks have \n     become ever more socialised and so equity cushions have \n     become increasingly redundant, the incentive for both limited \n     liability shareholders and employees to game the taxpayer has \n     risen greatly. It is rational for banks to choose risky \n     strategies because they take the upside and taxpayers much of \n     the downside.\n       Over the past half century, UK bank capital has remained at \n     between 3 per cent and 5 per cent of assets, these assets \n     have risen tenfold, relative to GDP, and returns on equity \n     have averaged 20 per cent. Such high returns, in an \n     established industry, must mean either high barriers to entry \n     or excessive risk-taking. The former are undesirable and the \n     latter terrifying, particularly in view of the huge rise in \n     the state's exposure to the risks.\n       We will never have a better opportunity than now to redress \n     the deteriorating terms of trade between the banks and the \n     state. A big part of the solution must be to shift \n     incentives. The more credible are the pre-announced limits on \n     support from government, the more effective will be the \n     changes in incentives inside banks, and vice versa. The less \n     we are able to shift these incentives, the more important it \n     will be to impose heavy regulation. The combination of \n     today's incentives with today's safety nets and yesterday's \n     ``light touch'' regulation was devastating.\n       Yet, regardless of the success of reforms of incentives \n     in--and regulation of--the financial sector, it is reasonable \n     to recoup not only the direct fiscal costs of saving banks \n     but even some of the wider fiscal costs of the crisis. The \n     time has come for some carefully judged populism. A one-off \n     windfall tax on bonuses would make the pain ahead for society \n     so very much more bearable. Try it: millions will love it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Webb for offering \nthis amendment, which is the same text as our bill that we introduced \nabout a month ago. I think Senator Webb has made an excellent case for \nthis very important amendment which will reduce the deficit. It is an \namendment that I believe reflects fairness and justice and the American \nway.\n  In 2008 and 2009, the financial sector, as well as the automobile \nindustry, received generous and unprecedented aid from taxpayers. It \nwas done in order to stave off another Great Depression. It was a tough \nvote to make, and we did it because we believed we were on the brink of \nanother Great Depression and, frankly, a financial collapse. If we \nremember back to those days, credit was frozen, businesses couldn't \nborrow, and we were hearing predictions that this could be the end of \ncapitalism. We heard that from Republicans and Democrats alike. So what \nwe did has worked. We have avoided a Great Depression. The economy is \ngrowing, although we are very worried about the slow pace of job \ncreation, which is why we are working so hard to continue to create new \njobs.\n  But if we take a look at the financial institutions which received \nthis huge bailout, what we see is they showed a resounding economic \nrecovery in 2009. Thanks to taxpayer assistance, many of these \ncompanies are posting record profits. So you have these companies \nposting record profits, that benefited when times were bad with \ntaxpayer help, and now they are paying out multimillion dollar bonuses \nto their top executives.\n  The United States pays its President--our highest paid Federal \nofficial--$400,000. These company leaders are earning millions of \ndollars, and then, on top of that, bonuses. So what Senator Webb and I \nare saying is this: If you have received a bonus of $400,000 or more \nfrom one of the top recipients of the taxpayer bailout, you should pay \na special one-time fee--50 percent of that bonus, which is on top of \nyour salary. Fifty percent of the bonus of $400,000 or more should go \nback to the taxpayers and reduce our deficit.\n  It is hard for me to imagine how these financial companies, which \nwere bailed out by taxpayers, could have such a deaf ear to the plight \nof America's workers and why they would embark upon these enormous \nbonuses, especially since they are not lending the monies that we think \nthey ought to lend to businesses. They are actually cutting back on \nlending to qualified businesses--I think it is an 18-percent reduction \nin loans to businesses--yet they are paying out these enormous bonuses. \nSo what Senator Webb and I are saying is we want a one-time, 50-percent \nfee paid on the bonus that exceeds $400,000. This fee would only affect \nthose recipients at the largest and most major companies who received \nthis bailout.\n  I want to reiterate this. The fee is paid on the bonuses that exceed \n$400,000. We don't touch the bonuses $400,000 or less. We are making a \npoint. And even though we have been fair, it will return to the \nTreasury about $10 billion, is our estimate, over time.\n  It is only fair that these institutions, which were so greatly \nassisted in 2009, should help our Nation with our fiscal problems. We \ninherited those problems from this economic collapse. We know that when \nPresident Bush handed the keys over to President Obama there already \nwas a huge deficit in place, but President Obama had to act. We had to \npass an economic recovery act. We had to make sure credit was flowing. \nSo it added still more to the debt, and it seems to me only fair that \npeople who are at those institutions that were bailed out--which only \nexist because of the generosity of taxpayers, because we knew if they \nfailed there would be big trouble--if their bonuses are over $400,000 \nthey ought to pay this special one-time fee back to taxpayers.\n  Reducing the deficit is important and fairness is important. I want \nto thank my colleague from Virginia for working with me on this \nlegislation, and I urge the Senate, in a bipartisan way, to join us in \nsupporting this commonsense measure. We hear a lot of talk around here \nabout the deficit, the deficit, the deficit. That is a very important \npriority for us--to reduce this deficit. Here is a way to do it that is \ntotally fair and just. People who work at the institutions that got the \nbiggest bailouts from Uncle Sam to save them, and those people who are \nnow getting these enormous bonuses, ought to make a contribution to \ndeficit reduction. We need it, we think it is right, and we hope there \nwill be a big bipartisan vote in favor of the Webb-Boxer amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3338\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment submitted by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  This amendment cloaks itself in the guise of fiscal responsibility, \nbut nothing could be further from the truth. The amendment would \nrescind funding from the American Recovery Act--the so-called stimulus \nbill--to pay for the cost of program increases for small businesses. We \ncan all agree that we should do more to support small business, but it \nis nonsensical to rescind funding from the Recovery Act, which is also \ncreating jobs. I understand all too well that some on the other side of \nthe aisle have argued that the stimulus bill was a mistake, but the \nfacts are proving just the opposite.\n  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office--the CBO--released a \nreport on the impact of those stimulus funds which have already been \nspent. The Congressional Budget Office report notes the extremely \nbeneficial impact from this act. The report states that the stimulus \nfunds are responsible for\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\nan increase of somewhere between 1.5 and 3 percent in the gross \ndomestic product during the last quarter of 2009, and with an estimated \nincrease in this first quarter of up to 3.9 percent. Moreover, the CBO \nstates that the stimulus bill accounted for an increase of at least 1 \nmillion jobs in the fourth quarter of 2009, and possibly as many as 2.9 \nmillion jobs. This is something to ponder.\n  The one thing the American people all agree upon is that we need to \nbe doing more to create jobs. The American Recovery Act is doing just \nthat. CBO estimates that the level of jobs created through 2010 from \nstimulus funds could be as high as 3.4 million jobs. That would mean a \ndecline in unemployment of 1.8 percent in this country. No other action \nby this Congress has provided this kind of positive impact on the job \nmarket. So what possible logic is there in rescinding funds from this \nact which is providing so many benefits to the American people? Why \nwould we support an amendment to cut funding from the act which is \nclearly helping to reduce devastating job losses?\n  No one can argue that the stimulus bill isn't working. The proof is \nat least a million jobs created last quarter. It has had an immensely \nfavorable impact on our economy. I know some of those who oppose the \nbill don't want to hear it, but that is reality. The numbers from CBO \ntell the story.\n  The Thune amendment fails to offer any guidance to which programs it \nwould cut. That is a rather strange amendment. Clearly, it is more \npolitically expedient to simply cite a dollar figure to cut rather than \nidentifying which specific programs the amendment would impact. The \nThune amendment offers no direction as to which recovery programs it \nwould shut down. The result could be cuts to the highway funding, new \nenergy technology or reversing efforts to make government buildings and \nlow-income housing more energy efficient.\n  Moreover, this amendment doesn't even allow the Congress to determine \nhow the funds should be reduced. Instead, it directs the Office of \nManagement and Budget--OMB--to determine where to reduce funding. I \ncannot believe the authors of this amendment want the Senate to give up \nthe power of the purse to the bureaucrats at OMB to determine where we \nshould spend our taxpayers' funds, but this is what this amendment \nwould do.\n  For many reasons, this is a bad amendment. It is exactly what the \ncountry does not need at this time. We all know that the No. 1 malady \nfacing the country today is unemployment. We now have proof from the \nCongressional Budget Office that the stimulus bill was the exact right \nmedicine to treat this illness. I urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment and allow our stimulus funds to work as planned: making wise \ninvestments in America and putting our people back to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we all know, yesterday the President \nissued a letter that said he was agreeing on ``four policy priorities \nidentified by Republican Members at the meeting'' that we had. And he \nsaid, ``I am exploring. I said throughout this process,'' I quote from \nthe President's letter, ``that I'd continue to draw on the best ideas \nfrom both parties, and I'm open to these proposals in that spirit.''\n  So he mentioned several of them. In it, he talks about the four areas \nhe would be considering: One by Senator Coburn, a proposal; another one \nthat a number of people had discussed concerning demonstration projects \nthrough Health and Human Services for resolving medical malpractice \ndisputes; one on Medicaid reimbursements; and then expanded health \nsavings accounts.\n  He said: ``That's why my proposal does not include the Medicare \nAdvantage provision, mentioned by Senator McCain at the meeting, which \nprovided transitional extra benefits for Florida and other States. My \nproposal eliminates those payments, gradually reducing Medicare \nAdvantage payments across the country relative to fee-for-service \nMedicare,'' et cetera.\n  Then he says, ``In addition, my proposal eliminates the Florida FMAP \nprovision, replacing it with additional federal financing'' in all \nStates.\n  Of course, this raises, I think, first of all, the legitimate \nquestion: How did this stuff get in there to start with? How did it \ntake weeks of examining a 2,400-page bill? What about the other \nsweetheart deals that were included behind closed doors in this 2,400-\npage legislation? What about the deal for Vermont, a 2.2-percent \nMedicaid bonus for 6 years for their Medicaid Program? What about the \nMassachusetts deal, a .5-percent Medicaid bonus for 3 years? Hawaii? It \nadds money for Hawaii hospitals. Hospitals in Michigan and Connecticut \nhave the option to benefit from higher payments; Connecticut, $100 \nmillion for a university hospital. The Senate beneficiary of this \nprovision was not originally known. Montana, South Dakota, North \nDakota, Wyoming had increased Medicare payments for those States.\n  What is unique about those States? Libby, MT, Medicare coverage for \nindividuals exposed to environmental health hazards, asbestos mining. \nThat may be a worthy cause, but shouldn't it be the subject of an \nauthorization and debate and appropriations?\n  Then, of course, we had the special deals that were cut with the \nspecial interests, not just PhRMA. The White House negotiators--the \nWhite House negotiators not congressional negotiators--extracted an $80 \nbillion deal to gain more offsets from the drug industry, and their $2-\nmillion-a-year lobbyists confirmed the deal in news reports. In \nexchange for PhRMA supporting the Democratic Senate bill, PhRMA spent \n$150 million in advertising support. And to further lock in the deal, \nthe White House and Senate Democrats agreed to oppose drug \nreimportation and a shorter pathway for generic biologics.\n  To sum all this up, there is no better description of it than what is \nby the majority leader of the Senate, who, on Christmas Eve, when these \ndeals became known as we examined the 2,400 pages, Senator Reid, the \nmajority leader, said--this, I think, encapsules, summarizes the entire \nprocess they went through:\n\n       A number of States are treated differently from other \n     States. That's what legislation is all about. That's \n     compromise.\n\n  I want to repeat that. I want to repeat that quote from Senator Reid.\n\n       A number of States are treated differently from other \n     States. That's what legislation is all about. That's \n     compromise.\n\n  That is not compromise. That is not the word. ``Compromise'' is an \nagreement between two parties on both sides of the aisle who reach an \nagreement. This is backroom wheeler dealing, special interest \ninfluence, and vote buying. That is what this was. Why would a State be \ntreated differently from another State? Why would we have disparate \nimpact on different States?\n  One of the reasons I have focused a lot of my attention on the \n800,000-person carve-out in the State of Florida, as the President has \nsaid that would be changed, is because there are 330,000 Medicare \nAdvantage enrollees in my State. Why should it ever happen that the \nresidents of one State who are in the same program, the exact same \nFederal program, have different advantages over another State?\n  I am pleased the President's letter concerning the issue of the \n800,000 people in Florida who will receive different coverage, that \nthat would be fixed. But I also point out, as I just chronicled, that \nis one of many proposals, many sweetheart deals, many backroom deals. \nIt has to be put in the context of the fact that the President of the \nUnited States promised the American people that we would change the \nclimate in Washington. Eight times the President of the United States \nsaid all of these negotiations on health care reform will take place \nwith C-SPAN cameras in the room.\n  My understanding of the process now is that there is going to be a \nvote in the House on the Senate bill and then there will be a \nreconciliation of 51 votes, which, of course, is offensive to the \nAmerican people. But I assume, then, the Senate bill as passed will \nhave all of these provisions in it that are these secret, backroom, \nunsavory deals that were made.\n  So let me just say it is disappointing, the contrast of the \nPresident's statement, when we have learned that last week's health \ncare summit was not really a true effort. In other words, the summit at \nthe Blair House did not reflect what the overwhelming majority\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\nof the American people are demanding; that is, we start over and we \nstop what has been done.\n  One of the reasons they want it stopped is because they have become \naware of these special deals for special interests and vote purchasing. \nThat is what they have become aware of. So that is one of the major \nreasons they want us to start over.\n  At the townhall meetings I have, people are as upset about the \nprocess we went through as they are the actual legislative outcome, \nalthough they are very unhappy about that.\n  Let me just say I know a bit about working in a bipartisan fashion. I \nknow people want us to get things done together. I know the approval \nratings of Congress are extremely low, and there is a great disconnect \nbetween the people of this country and what we are doing in Washington, \nand they want us to work together, adhering to principle and addressing \nthe enormous challenges that face them. But that means starting over.\n  We did identify areas on which we could agree. We did identify the \nfact that there are some areas. But unless we start over, then how in \nthe world can we put lipstick on a pig? It is still a pig. It is still \na bad and unsavory process that we went through in order to reach the \nlegislative package we have now.\n  What we really need to do is start over and then we can get rid of \nall of these. We can get rid of the ``Louisiana purchase,'' and Vermont \nand Massachusetts and Hawaii and Michigan, Connecticut--Connecticut \ntwice, one $100 million for a hospital and then higher payments--\nMontana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming. We can get rid of all of \nthese if we start over.\n  I point out, finally, because we are going to be talking a lot about \nthis--and I know other colleagues of mine are waiting to speak--I just \npoint out again this whole issue of reconciliation. A lot of Americans \nhad never heard that word before, certainly not in this context before \nthis came up. But the word ``reconciliation'' means we would reconcile \ndifferences on small issues between the two bodies. It was the product \nof Senator Robert Byrd, who has said unequivocally that health care--\nthat Medicare and health care should not be included in this process. \nIt was Senator Robert Byrd who specifically exempted Social Security \nfrom being a part of reconciliation. He said, and I quote from Senator \nRobert Byrd:\n\n       I was one of the authors of the legislation that created \n     the budget reconciliation process in 1974 and I am certain \n     that putting health care reform and climate change \n     legislation on a freight train through Congress is an outrage \n     that must be resisted.\n\n  That was the author. Of course, all during the time when the other \nside of the aisle was in the minority they complained bitterly, and I \nthink with some justification, that reconciliation was used as a means \nof getting legislation through this body, bypassing the 60-vote \nrequirement.\n  I would like to point out--and it may be a bit self-serving, but I \nwould like to point out that when the so-called nuclear option was up, \nwe would move to a process that only 51 votes would be required in \norder to confirm judges in this body, I and 13 others joined in a \nbipartisan fashion, and we said no. We will have circumstances that \nwill attend our votes on confirmation and, for the good of the body, we \npreserved the 60-vote majority rule that has been the custom in this \ninstitution of the Senate in modern times.\n  The American people are watching very carefully what we are doing. \nThere may be some belief that a lot of Americans are not appreciating \nwhat apparently is the plan, and that is to move serious legislation \nthrough the Senate with a 51-vote majority, legislation that would \naffect one-sixth of our gross national product.\n  I urge my colleagues, as I did when we were considering the ``nuclear \noption on judges,'' that this nuclear option also be rejected and go \nback to the 60 votes and maintain the 60-vote majority requirement that \nbasically governs our proceedings in the Senate.\n  Let's start over. Let's listen to Warren Buffett, a strong supporter \nof the President of the United States. He noted that this legislation \nincludes nonsense, backroom deals for special interests.\n  He said:\n\n       Democrats should cut off all the kinds of things like the \n     800,000 special people in Florida or the Corn Husker \n     kickback, as they called it, or the Louisiana Purchase, and \n     we are going to get rid of the nonsense. We are just going to \n     focus on costs and we are not going to dream up 2,000 pages \n     of other things.\n\n  I hope we will heed the words of Warren Buffet, which basically is \nthat he and the American people want us to start over. They certainly \ndo not want to have legislation enacted by a bare majority. Again, I \nwould remind my colleagues of history. Every major reform that has been \nenacted by this body, whether it be the Civil Rights Act, whether it be \nMedicare, whether it be other major reform, it has always been done \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  It is not too late. Let's go back to the beginning. Let's start over. \nWe have identified areas we can work together on and certainly reject \nthis idea of 51 votes governing the way this body functions. I think it \nposes great danger to the future of this institution that all of us who \nhave the privilege of serving here love as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that Senator Menendez of New \nJersey be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, as senior citizens and disabled \nveterans all over this country know, this is the first year since \n1975--36 years ago--that there will not be a Social Security cost-of-\nliving adjustment or COLA. In my view, the fact that people in need--\nseniors, disabled veterans, people who have disabilities--will not be \nreceiving a COLA this year is wrong and it is an issue we have to \naddress and I hope we will address it successfully this afternoon, in \nterms of the amendment I will offer.\n  The reality is, in recent years, senior citizens, veterans, and \npersons with disabilities have slipped out of the middle class and into \npoverty. That is a reality--out of the middle class and into poverty. \nThe reality is, today prescription drug costs are soaring, medical care \ncosts for seniors and disabled people are soaring, and heating oil has \ngone through the roof, especially relevant to those of us in cold-\nweather States.\n  At a time when millions of seniors have seen the value of their \npensions, their homes, and their life savings plummet, we cannot turn \nour back on some of the most vulnerable people in this country. They \nare hurting and they need our emergency support and that is why I am \noffering, today, along with Senators Dodd, Leahy, Whitehouse, \nGillibrand, Lautenberg, Begich, Stabenow, and Menendez, an amendment \nwhich will provide over 55 million seniors, veterans, and persons with \ndisabilities $250--a one-time payment--in much needed emergency relief. \nThis $250 emergency payment is equivalent to a 2-percent increase in \nbenefits for the average Social Security retiree, and it is the same \namount seniors received last year as part of the Recovery Act.\n  Two percent is not a lot of money, but it will, in fact, provide much \nneeded help to millions of people who are demanding we not turn our \nback on them. This amendment is supported by a wide array of seniors \nand veterans organizations representing tens of millions of Americans. \nLet me give some of the organizations that are supporting this \namendment: the AARP, which is the largest senior group in America; the \nAmerican Legion, the largest veterans group in America; the Veterans of \nForeign Wars; the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare; the American Federation of Teachers Program on Retirement and \nRetirees; the Disabled American Veterans; the Alliance for Retired \nAmericans; Easter Seals; the Military Officers Association; the Vietnam \nVeterans of America; the National Council on Aging; AMVETS; and many \nother organizations.\n\n[[Page S994]]\n\n  One of the side benefits of this amendment is that funds directed to \nthis population will go almost immediately into the economy. These are \nfolks who will spend that money, providing the quickest possible \nstimulus to local economies and thus creating jobs in every community \nin our country. President Obama is strongly supportive of this $250 in \nemergency relief to seniors. The President has included it in his \nbudget, and he has also recommended it be included in the underlying \nlegislation we are debating today.\n  Here is what the President has said about this issue:\n\n       Even as we seek to bring about recovery, we must act on \n     behalf of those hardest hit by this recession. That is why I \n     am announcing my support for an additional $250 in emergency \n     recovery assistance to seniors, veterans, and people with \n     disabilities to help them make it through these difficult \n     times.\n\n  I very much appreciate the President's support for what we are trying \nto do here today.\n  In Vermont and all across this country, ordinary people believe the \nCongress is way out of touch with the realities of their lives. They \nbelieve that we just do not get it, that we do not understand that all \nover this country millions of people are hurting and that sometimes \nthey are hurting desperately, that people are frantically trying to \nkeep bread on their tables. People are trying to make sure they and \ntheir families can live with dignity, and they wonder if we in Congress \nget it. They know we are there for Wall Street. They know that. They \nknow we are there to take care of big banks and insurance companies and \ndrug companies, but they are not quite sure we are there to take care \nof vulnerable people who are elderly and who are disabled veterans.\n  Let me read some quotes from organizations and individuals on this \nissue. This is what the VFW has to say in support of this legislation:\n\n       This year veterans and seniors will not receive COLA. This \n     could not come at a worse time. Your legislation would \n     provide a one-time check of $250 to 1.4 million veterans, \n     48.9 million Social Security recipients, and 5.1 million SSI \n     recipients. We believe that this will provide some relief to \n     those veterans and seniors living on fixed incomes. . . .\n\n  We thank the VFW very much for their support.\n  Let me quote very briefly from the National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare:\n\n       The National Committee strongly urges you to pass \n     legislation to provide a $250 payment to our Nation's seniors \n     who did not receive a COLA this year. It is vitally important \n     that we provide help for seniors of modest means who have \n     been adversely affected by the economic recession and rapidly \n     rising health care costs.\n\n  Here is a quote from AARP, a group that represents over 40 million \nAmericans age 55 and older, in support of this amendment. This is what \nthey say:\n\n       For over three decades, millions of Americans have counted \n     on annual increases to help make ends meet. In this economy, \n     having this protection is even more critical for the \n     financial security of all older Americans. AARP applauds the \n     President for urging Congress to extend for 2010 the $250 \n     economic relief provided to older Americans last year.\n\n  Let me quote again from another statement by AARP which I think makes \nthis case very cogently. I think they nail it, and they tell us why it \nis absolutely imperative that we pass this legislation.\n\n       Last year, the Social Security Administration announced \n     that for the first time since it began in 1975, seniors will \n     not receive an automatic cost of living adjustment for 2010. \n     Although the lack of a COLA was triggered by low overall \n     inflation--\n\n  And here is the point--\n\n     the costs of the things seniors depend on most--prescription \n     drugs and health care--have continued to increase above \n     inflation. Seniors spend an average of 30 percent of their \n     income on health care costs, 6 times greater than what those \n     with employer-sponsored health care coverage spend, and these \n     prescription drug costs, premiums, and copays have \n     skyrocketed.\n\n  I think that is the main point to be made today. That is why we \nshould support this one-time payment.\n  AARP, of course, is a large national organization.\n  Let me give some quotes from letters I have received from Vermont and \nfrom around the country.\n  A gentleman from central Vermont writes:\n\n       As you know, Social Security has not given a COLA increase \n     on benefits in 2010, based on the CPI. I did some research \n     and found these increases from January 2009 to January 2010.\n\n  This is what he has calculated.\n\n       Power rates are up by 7 percent; heating oil up by 15 \n     percent; propane up by 24 percent; property taxes up 3.7 \n     percent; gasoline up 16.6 percent; food up, conservatively \n     speaking, 3 percent.\n\n  Here is where he said:\n\n       The CPI was obviously done by statisticians on vacation in \n     Jamaica while sipping some tropical concoctions that impaired \n     their judgment. These things above add up to nearly $3,000. \n     To cover this, I would require a 12 percent increase in my \n     disability benefits.\n\n  This is from central Vermont. I do not agree with the writer of this \nletter that the statisticians came to their conclusions by sipping \ntropical concoctions in Jamaica. I don't think that is the case. But I \ndo believe he is correct in suggesting that the methodology by which \nCOLAs for seniors are established is not right. Here is why. COLA \nincreases are determined by a look at the purchasing practices of the \nentire population--all of us--and that is not fair to seniors today, \nwhose purchasing needs are very different from the average person's. As \nthe AARP pointed out, seniors spend a very disproportionate amount of \ntheir limited incomes on health care, prescription drugs, et cetera. \nThose costs have gone up. In other words, while costs may have gone \ndown for younger people who may be purchasing laptop computers, IPODs, \nGPSs, flatscreen TVs, cell phones, and other products, they have not \ngone down for millions of seniors who are dependent and spend a whole \nlot on health care. By the way, that is why, when I was in the House, I \noffered legislation which received very strong bipartisan support to \ncreate a separate index for seniors in determining their COLAs. I do \nbelieve that is the direction we have to go.\n  I have received many letters. Let me read one more.\n  This comes from New Jersey. This is Claire from New Jersey:\n\n       I am 82 years old. Having been widowed and bankrupt at age \n     37 to raise my 3 young children alone, I thought that with my \n     Social Security and my small pension plus by savings, I would \n     never have to depend on my children to care for me in my old \n     age. But now that my savings have been depleted by 30 percent \n     and my health care insurance is costing me $3,200 a year, I \n     am very worried if my savings will last me much longer.\n\n  Elizabeth in Spur, TX, writes:\n\n       Social Security is my main source of income. I have bills \n     that I couldn't pay if it wasn't for this income. I think \n     that it is a disgrace that the Government will bail out the \n     banks and car manufacturers but not sure if the elderly will \n     get a COLA. The elderly are the people that have kept this \n     country together for years and they are considering not \n     giving them a little raise? I wish that some Members of the \n     Congress and the Senate had to live on the income that we \n     have to and see how they can manage, like the saying goes, if \n     the shoe was on the other foot.\n\n  Let me conclude by pointing out that there is bipartisan support for \nthe concept we are talking about today, especially in the House of \nRepresentatives. In that body, in the House, Congressmen Walter Jones, \nRodney Alexander, Phil Gingrey, and Roscoe Bartlett--all Republicans--\nhave introduced legislation which, frankly, goes further than the \namendment I am offering. Instead of a one-time payment, they are \nproposing a 2.9-percent COLA for Social Security, which ends up, \nobviously, costing a lot more than a one-time payment of about 2 \npercent.\n  Here is what Congressman Alexander, a Republican from Louisiana, said \nabout his legislation:\n\n       Although the annual adjustment is a small increase, it is a \n     much-needed benefit for our Nation's seniors to help them \n     compensate for inflation and to sustain the skyrocketing \n     prices of health care and prescription drugs. It is evident \n     that the current Social Security system is not keeping up \n     with our seniors' basic needs. Congress must take action \n     today so that our Social Security beneficiaries are protected \n     tomorrow.\n\n  That is from Congressman Alexander, a Republican from Louisiana. I \nagree with the Congressman, and I hope all of my colleagues, Democrats \nand Republicans, will agree that seniors need emergency relief and they \nneed it now.\n  Over 90 percent of the individuals who will receive this emergency \nrelief make less than $75,000 and over 8 million who will receive help \nunder this amendment make less than $14,000 a year.\n\n[[Page S995]]\n\n  That is where we are. Millions of people are wondering whether, in \ntheir times of need, when their costs are going up, when they are \nstruggling to maintain their dignity--they are wondering whether a \nCongress that was there for Wall Street, a Congress which over a period \nof years has been there for the wealthiest people in this country, \nwhether that same Congress will be there for disabled veterans and our \nseniors. I hope and believe we will be, and I ask for support for the \namendment that will be voted on soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3352\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand we will have two amendments \nwe will be voting on shortly; they will be the Thune amendment and the \nGrassley amendment. Let me say a few words about each--first, the \nGrassley amendment.\n  The Grassley amendment essentially extends the formula under which \ndoctors are paid, reimbursed for Medicare services, by 3 more months. \nThe underlying bill, in the formula known as sustainable growth rate, \notherwise known as SGR, extends it for 7 months. Frankly, it is my \npreference, strange as it may sound, that the extension be not 7 months \nbut 3 months, but when we negotiated out these provisions, it turns out \nthe extension was 7 months.\n  You might ask why I favor a 3-month extension rather than 7 months. \nThere are two reasons. The main reason is that I firmly expect health \ncare reform to be passed within 3 months. If the formula, the \nsustainable growth rate, is extended for 3 months, that enables us, as \nsoon as health care reform is passed, to then address how we then get a \nmuch better solution to the SGR, the sustainable growth rate, and my \npreference would be a permanent solution. I am afraid if we extend this \nfor, say, 10 months and then health care reform is passed, fixing the \npermanent formula will not have the same urgency as it otherwise would.\n  So I do very much believe what we have now in the bill--7 months--is \nbetter than a 3-month extension. Another way of saying it, as much as I \nadmire my good friend from Iowa, it would not be appropriate to adopt \nhis amendment. In fact, I do not favor his amendment.\n  The second reason is probably more compelling, and that is, although \nhe does pay for his amendment by extending the formula for 3 more \nmonths, he does so by taking the funds out of a fund which is used for \nMedicare. It is called the MIF, the Medicare Improvement Fund.\n  The Medicare Improvement Fund is very--it is almost essential so that \nwe have funds to pay for the underlying health care bill. It is very \nimportant that the underlying health care bill be deficit neutral. We \nare working on certain modifications to the health care reform bill, \nthe bill that has passed the Senate. As we know, it is over in the \nHouse.\n  As the President announced just a few minutes ago, he wants us--I \nthink it is the right thing to do--to pass a modification to that bill \nby a majority vote. If we are going to do that, we have to make sure it \nis deficit neutral. In fact, I would like it even better than deficit \nneutral; that is, that it would reduce the deficit. This Medicare \nImprovement Fund can help very much toward assuring us that the \nunderlying bill, the health reform bill, is in fact deficit neutral.\n  So for those two reasons: One, I think it is better for us to pass \nhealth care reform using some of the funds in the Medicare Improvement \nFund so we can make it deficit neutral, pass it, and then we can work \non improving and finding a permanent solution to the sustainable growth \nrate formula, a formula that has bedeviled us for many years.\n  For those two reasons, I very much urge us to--as much as I \nappreciate the efforts of my good friend from Iowa, discretion is the \nbetter part of valor here. It would be better for us not to adopt that \namendment because we do need those dollars to help make sure we can pay \nfor the underlying health care reform bill.\n  There is another amendment we will be voting on soon. It is No. 3338, \nthe Thune amendment. I support many of the small business tax relief \nconcepts outlined by Senator Thune. In fact, many of these will be \ndiscussed as part of the small business jobs bill to be introduced \nquite shortly. By that I mean in the next maybe week or two. I am not \nsure exactly when, but quite soon the Finance Committee will be marking \nup a small business jobs bill.\n  I spoke with Senator Landrieu, who is the chairperson of the Small \nBusiness Committee. We put together a small business jobs package which \nwe think will be quite effective in helping small business people be \nmore prosperous and have more people able to work for small business \nfirms.\n  I might say, however, that Senator Thune's amendment is problematic \nfor two reasons. First, his amendment makes several provisions \npermanent. This is not the time for that discussion. Making these \nprovisions permanent is expensive, and, therefore, permanent provisions \nneed to be discussed as part of comprehensive tax reform.\n  Second, Senator Thune's amendment would be offset with unspent and \nunallocated mandatory spending of stimulus funds. I might say there is \ngrowing evidence that the recovery package is working. There has been \nsome debate over that proposition, but I think the wave of evidence is \nthat the stimulus funds in the recovery package have had a significant \npositive effect. The Congressional Budget Office has said so.\n  Over the last 6 months of 2009, for example, the overall economy grew \nat an annual rate of 4 percent. I am quite confident that had we not \npassed the stimulus measure, the growth rate would not be at that rate; \nit would be lower.\n  In the fourth quarter of 2009, the gross domestic product grew at an \nannual rate of 5.7 percent. Now, that might be somewhat artificially \nhigh because of inventory, but, nevertheless, that was the number. One \nyear earlier, in the fourth quarter of 2008, it was actually declining \nat an annual rate of more than 5 percent.\n  Manufacturing in the United States expanded in August for the first \ntime in 19 months. Just think of that. Manufacturing in our country \nexpanded in August for the first time in 19 months.\n  Housing prices in many parts of the country have stabilized; some are \neven increasing. The Case-Shiller index of home prices has now risen 7 \nmonths in a row.\n  Unemployment is improving. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, last year's Recovery Act added between 1 million and 2.1 \nmillion people to our country's payroll. The Recovery Act--that is the \nstimulus bill I am talking about--lowered the unemployment rate by \nbetween .5 percent and 1.5 percentage points from where it otherwise \nwould have been.\n  In addition, the Federal Reserve and many independent economists have \ncredited the stimulus with playing a role in stabilizing the economy. \nBut we still have work to do. The national unemployment rate stands at \n9.7 percent. The CBO estimates that 8 million jobs have been lost over \nthe course of the ``Great Recession.'' They also say unemployment may \nnot be in its natural state of 5 percent until the year 2016.\n  Revoking stimulus funds now would send exactly the wrong signal to \nthe American economy and to unemployed people in our country. Just \nthink of that. Revoking stimulus funds now. Just think of the signal \nthat would send. We know there are more funds in the pipeline. The \nstimulus program is working. We take that away, just think of the \nsignal that would send across our country.\n  We passed stimulus to give a needed boost to our economy. The bill is \ndesigned to work over 2 years--2 years. We are in the second year now, \njust beginning the second year now. We have successfully started down \nthe road to recovery, and the economy would falter if these funds were \nwithdrawn.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3338, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:45 p.m., the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the following amendments, in the order \nlisted, with no amendments in order to the amendments prior to this \nvote; that prior to each vote there be 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form: Thune amendment No. 3338, as \nmodified, and that prior to the vote it be further modified with the\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\nchanges at the desk; and the Grassley amendment No. 3352.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 4 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 3338, as further modified, offered by the \nSenator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  Who yields time? If no one yields time, time will be charged equally.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the first two votes will be on the Thune \namendment and the Grassley amendment. The Thune amendment has its heart \nin the right place. It is trying to help small businesses and provide \njobs. But, frankly, it has two very significant problems. Therefore, I \nurge it not be adopted.\n  First, it makes permanent many provisions of the tax law that \nactually should be considered in tax reform. This is not the place to \nbe writing tax reform. Our code is riddled with inconsistencies. Many \nof the provisions in the code fit together. Some don't. There are \nloopholes. There is a lot of overhaul needed, if we are going to have \nsignificant tax reform. We should address those issues at the right \ntime and the right place but not here. It does not make sense to make \ncertain provisions in the Tax Code permanent.\n  The second flaw is, to pay for his provisions, Senator Thune uses \nexcess stimulus funds, funds out of the Recovery Act. The CBO says the \nRecovery Act is working well.\n  Last month CBO issued its report on the effects of the Recovery Act \nin the fourth quarter. In that report, CBO said:\n\n       CBO estimates that in the fourth quarter of calendar year \n     2009, the [Recovery Act] added between 1 million and 12.1 \n     million to the number of workers employed in the United \n     States, and it increased the number of full-time-equivalent \n     jobs by between 1.4 million and 3 million.\n\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\n\n  They say the Recovery Act created or saved between 1 and 3 million \njobs. That is why we need to defeat efforts such as those of the \namendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota. The Recovery Act is \nworking. Most economists say it is working. If it is working, we should \nlet it continue working. We should not take away dollars from it.\n  I urge the Thune amendment not be adopted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time in favor of the amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't see Senator Thune. It may be a bit presumptuous, \nbut I ask unanimous consent that the time be yielded back, although it \nis not my place to make that request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand he is on his way.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I was going to inquire of the chairman if \nhe had locked in a speaker after the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, it has not been locked in, but I will do so right \nnow. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from North Dakota, \nSenator Dorgan, be recognized to speak immediately after the next \nseries of votes and that the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, be \nrecognized to speak thereafter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \nThune amendment violates section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I move to waive the applicable section of the Budget Act \nwith respect to the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and \nsworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to. \nThe point of order is sustained and the amendment fails.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3352\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3352 \noffered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I oppose the Grassley amendment for two \nreasons. I oppose it reluctantly. Senator Grassley is a very decent \nman. His heart is almost always in the right place. It is in the right \nplace here, but I oppose this amendment.\n  First, the amendment seeks to extend a stopgap measure for the \npayments of doctors under Medicare, but we should not prolong stopgap \nmeasures. We should pass a short-term stopgap, and then we should make \nmeaningful payment reform for the payment of doctors under Medicare. \nThat is what doctors want. That is what would be very much in the best \ninterests of seniors, and that is the responsible way to govern.\n  Second, the Grassley amendment takes its offsets away from the \nunderlying health care bill; that is, the bill we are trying to pass in \nthis next several weeks. Thus, it would undercut health care reform. We \nneed the savings we included in the health care bill, especially the \nhealth reform bill. We should not be robbing the health care bill of \nits offsets. For those reasons, I oppose the Grassley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenators Bond and Bennett as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my amendment extends critically needed \nMedicare provisions for all of 2010, not just part of it. It replaces \nthe provisions that are not fully offset with fully offset provisions, \nand it adds an additional 3 months for the physician update through the \nend of 2010. This amendment draws additional funds from the Medicare \nimprovement fund to ensure these provisions are fully offset.\n  My friend from Montana said that is not the place to take the money \nfrom, but his substitute amendment takes money from the very same fund. \nI take a little bit more, yes, but I don't think a few billion in \nfunding needed here will make much of a difference when it comes to the \n$2.5 trillion cost of health care reform, as was suggested earlier. So \nI don't see that as a valid argument for not paying for these Medicare \nprovisions.\n  Going back to the situation at hand, the 30-day extension that passed \nlast night only prevents payment cuts until the end of March. \nPhysicians and Medicare beneficiaries need to have certainty and be \nensured access to care. This is the fiscally responsible way to pay for \nthese important Medicare provisions.\n  We need to pass this very essential amendment now, so I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 57 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is very simple: $10 billion is $10 \nbillion. This amendment takes $10 billion away from health care reform. \nWe must pass health care reform this year, and we need the dollars we \ncan get. Ten billion dollars is a lot. Right now, as we are trying to \nput this bill together, we are very close to making sure this budget is \ndeficit neutral. In fact, we would like it to be better than deficit \nneutral. This $10 billion counts. We should not rob health care reform \nin order to pay for an extension of the doc fix that is not needed at \nthis time. We will take care of the doc fix after we take care of \nhealth care reform.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, do I have some time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 26 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Good. I am glad I have 26 seconds. His amendment takes \n$8 billion away from the Medicare improvement fund, mine takes $10 \nbillion away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for all those reasons, I move to table the \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S999]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mrs. Hutchison).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 34 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Hutchison\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that following my \npresentation, Senator Gregg is going to be recognized, or a Republican \nspeaker. I ask unanimous consent that following the Republican speaker, \nSenator Stabenow be recognized on our side. I do that with the consent \nof the chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cobell Lawsuit\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss two amendments, one of \nwhich I have filed and one of which I will file shortly. Before I do \nthat, I have spoken with Senator Inouye, Senator Feinstein, and some \nothers about something that is very important. It is the settlement of \nthe Cobell lawsuit. The Cobell lawsuit has been in the Federal courts \nfor 13 years. After a long period of negotiation between the Secretary \nof the Interior, other parts of our Federal Government, and the \nplaintiffs in lawsuit, there is finally an agreement that has been \nreached. The agreement would provide $3.4 billion to settle outstanding \nclaims and address issues going back well over 100 years in which the \nFederal Government was supposed to be taking care of the trust accounts \nof American Indians. Some of those trust accounts were fleeced, stolen, \nand mismanaged.\n  This lawsuit has been going on for a long period. The agreement \nsettles the claims of American Indians who lost their money, lost their \nassets, and lost their income. Many American Indians have died during \nthe process of this lawsuit.\n  Now that a settlement has been reached, there is an April 16 \ndeadline. The parties to the settlement agreement set an end date by \nwhich the Congress must act, or the parties may return to litigation. \nMy hope is that the Congress will be able to meet that deadline. We \nreally do need to put this issue behind us. It is a sorry chapter in \nthis country's history. For over a century we have mismanaged the \nproperty, income, and royalties of American Indians. All of this \nresulted in the filing of a lawsuit.\n  I commend the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Salazar, who has \nworked so hard to reach this agreement.\n  Having said that, let me describe two amendments I wish to offer to \nthis legislation. One is an amendment I have offered on a number of \noccasions over the years. It is important to offer it again this year \nand get it done.\n  President Obama mentioned during his State of the Union Address that \nhe wanted this legislation passed by the Congress. It is painfully \nsimple. My amendment says when an American business shuts down its \nmanufacturing plant in this country, locks the doors, fires the \nworkers, and then moves the jobs overseas someplace for the purpose of \nselling the product they produce overseas back into our country, they \nshould not get a tax break. Yet, under today's Tax Code, they, in fact, \nare rewarded with a tax break.\n  This amendment would end that ill-advised tax break and say: You are \nnot going to be rewarded anymore in our Tax Code by shipping jobs \noverseas and then selling the product back into our marketplace. This \nshould have been corrected long ago. It should be corrected now.\n  The amendment I filed is amendment No. 3375. My hope is we will be \nable to debate and vote on this amendment.\n  I described the other day this issue we have of trying to find new \njobs and seeing how we can incentivize the creation of new jobs in our \ncountry. About 17 million people woke up this morning in this country \nwithout work, without a job, and wanting a job and are going to spend \ntoday looking for work and not be able to find it. We are trying to \nfind ways to incentivize the creation of jobs. That bill is the faucet, \ntrying to put more jobs in this economy.\n  What about the drain? What about all these jobs leaking out of this \neconomy to China and elsewhere? Let me describe some of them, if I \nmight. These are well known. I have told other stories on the floor \nmany times.\n  Levis, the product of America. America invented Levis. People wear \nLevis all around the world, except Levis are made virtually everywhere \nin the world except the United States. They are all gone. We do not \nmake one pair of Levis in the United States. Fruit of the Loom \nunderwear; gone to Mexico; gone to Asia. Samsonite went to Mexico, then \nto China. Maytag now makes their appliances in Mexico and Korea. \nHershey's chocolate. You know, Hershey's chocolate advertises York \nPeppermint Patties and they say: The cool, refreshing taste of mint \ndipped in dark chocolate will take you miles away. Well, apparently so \nmany miles it ends up in Mexico--Mexico.\n\n  I have mentioned often the cookies made by the Nabisco Company--Fig \nNewtons. If somebody says to you: How about going to have a Mexican \ndinner, just buy a package of Fig Newtons. They left New Jersey and \nwent to Mexico. I don't know if it is cheaper to shovel fig paste in \nMexico than it is in New Jersey, but it is made by a company called \nNabisco. You know what that stands for? The National Biscuit Company. \nExcept the national biscuit, in this case, is made in Mexico.\n  Well, the list goes on and on and on. Hallmark Cards. Hallmark Cards \nwas here for a century--a privately held Kansas City, MO, company, \nfounded by a high school dropout who started the company in 1910 with a \nshoebox full of postcards. He made a living by selling them while \nworking out of a YMCA in Kansas City, and it became an unbelievably \nsuccessful greeting card company. All of us know that. Under its \ncurrent management, despite annual revenues, I understand, of over $4 \nbillion, they started to move jobs from Kansas City to three plants in \nChina. You know, the company who cares enough to send you the very \nbest? In this case, it sends you the very best from China.\n  My point is that I understand there are a whole lot of companies \ngoing to search for people who work for 50 cents an hour and whom they \ncan work 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day, and that is better for \ntheir bottom line. It enhances their profit when they can do that. But \nwhen they leave America, deciding they are going to produce Etch A \nSketch in Shenzhen, China, and then ship it back to a Walmart here in \nthe United States to sell--when that happens, and that town in Ohio \nthat was known for producing Etch A Sketch, the little toy that all of \nus have used as a child--we ought not be saying good for you, we will \ngive you a tax break.\n  When the Radio Flyer little red wagon--the wagon we have all ridden \nin, started by a guy in Chicago, and for 110 years they made Radio \nFlyer little red wagons in the United States--when they moved the \nproduction of little red\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\nwagons to China, we shouldn't give a tax break for those that are sold \nback into this country--a company that moves their jobs elsewhere in \norder to produce and then sell back into our country. We ought to say: \nYou know what, you are not going to get a tax break for that.\n  Let me give an example of two companies, and two companies that make \nbicycles; all right? They are made in factories that are on the same \nstreet corner but on different sides of the street. One is called Huffy \nBicycles. Most people have known the Huffy Bicycles and ridden them in \ntheir youth. The other is ABC Bicycle, hypothetically. Huffy Bicycles \ndecides they are paying $11 an hour to their American workers, plus \nbenefits, and they think that is way too much to pay an American worker \nso they leave America and go to China. And by the way, that is true. \nThey did. The other company stays here and says: No, we are going to \nkeep our American workers and keep our American plant open and keep \nthese jobs in America. What is the difference between the two? When \nthey are competing at Sears or Walmart or Kmart in this country, what \nis the difference between the two bicycles? Well, one was rewarded with \na tax break because their production was sent overseas, and the other \nhas a competitive disadvantage because it was made here by American \nworkers. And that ought not stand.\n  This President asked during his State of the Union Address for us to \nplug this hole. It raises money, reduces the Federal budget deficit and \nfinally says to American workers: We are on your side. We are not going \nto give a tax break to companies that ship their jobs overseas and sell \ntheir products back in America.\n  It is a very simple amendment. I don't know anyone who would wish to \nvote against this amendment. Yet, interestingly enough, I have offered \nit for many years and have not been successful for a number of reasons. \nOccasionally, we have had a vote, but most often it gets thrown off in \na parliamentary procedure of some type. But this is a bill that is open \nto amendment on revenue issues, and my hope is that at last--at long, \nlong last--at a time when so many millions of Americans wish they had a \njob and don't, at a time when we still have so many companies moving \ntheir jobs away from our country to other countries only to sell back \ninto our country that which they made in China or elsewhere, my hope is \nthat finally we will say we won't allow this to happen any more with a \nreward in our Tax Code for those that do it.\n  I was on an airplane a while back, and I sat next to a guy who was \nwearing casual clothes--sweat pants and so on--and we said hello to \neach other. I said: Where are you headed? He said: Asia. That is why I \nam dressed this way; I have 25 more hours of flying. I said: What are \nyou going to do when you reach Asia? He said: Well, I am going to \nThailand, Singapore, and I am going to China. He said: What we are \ntrying to do with my company is we are trying to move our jobs from the \nUnited States to Asian locations and save some money in the production \nof these products we make. So I am going out now to Thailand and \nSingapore and China to scout out locations for our new manufacturing \nplants in Asia because we are going to move our jobs.\n  I was sitting next to this guy thinking: You know, there will be \nhundreds and hundreds of American workers who, that morning, instead of \ngetting on an airplane as he and I did, are going to a manufacturing \nplant somewhere to make a product for his company, but they don't know \nyet that he is on an airplane to try to find a way how to move their \njobs to Singapore or to China or to Thailand. And isn't that a shame?\n  Some will listen to this and say: Well, that is just protectionism. \nListen, closing a tax break that rewards people from moving jobs \noverseas isn't protectionism. Keeping that tax break open is, in my \njudgment, ignorance. Standing up for fair play and standing up for \nAmerican jobs is not protectionism, it is doing everything we ought to \ndo to be supportive of the kind of economy we want and the kind of good \njobs we want in this country's future.\n  That is one amendment. The second amendment deals with an issue that \nmost people, I am sure, can hardly believe their ears when they hear \nabout it. This is an issue I have spoken about previously, and some of \nthis issue has been resolved but not all of it. As is usually the case \nwhen something abusive is happening, it gets shut down in part but not \nin total, because you say: Okay, let's stop it as of this date.\n  I am talking about something called SILOs and LILOs especially SILOs, \nor sale-in/lease out transactions. Most people don't know what that \nmeans--sale in, lease out. It doesn't mean they aren't smart. It is a \ntitle in the Tax Code that describes an activity that was created by \nsome people who wanted to avoid paying U.S. taxes. They want everything \nAmerica has to offer, they just don't want to pay taxes to their \ncountry.\n  Let me describe what has been happening in the last couple of \ndecades, and this is almost a perfect description of the perversion in \nour economy and the greed in our economy by some--not all, but by \nsome--who steered this place into the ditch. Here it is: A cross-border \nlease of Dortmund, Germany's streetcars--a company called First Union \nBank, which is now something else because it has been bought two \nadditional times. So First Union Bank in America wants to lease \nstreetcars in Germany. Why would it want to lease streetcars in \nGermany? Because it wants to run German streetcars? No, because from a \nGerman city it can lease the city's streetcars and take those assets in \na lease-in/ leaseback transaction and get tax breaks so it can avoid \npaying U.S. taxes.\n  Transactions involving streetcars is one thing, but here is a tunnel \nthat one of our American companies bought--a tunnel in Antwerp, \nBelgium. Think of that, an American company deciding to buy a tunnel in \nAntwerp, Belgium. Why? Because they like tunnels, know something about \ntunnels? They don't have the foggiest idea about Belgian tunnels. It is \na sale leaseback transaction used to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  But here is one that really struck my interest. Wachovia Bank which, \nby the way, has now been purchased by someone else. They ended up with \na belly full of bad assets. And we ought to ask the question how did \nthat happen? How did it happen that a massive amount of toxic bad \nassets landed in the belly of this bank--Wachovia Bank? But Wachovia \nBank bought a sewer system in Bochum, Germany. Why would Wachovia Bank \nwant to own a sewer in Germany? Because they have people on the board \nof directors who are experts in German sewers? I don't think so. Do we \nthink maybe they have hired a new class of MBAs who are specialists in \nsewer valuations in Germany? I don't think so. An American bank wants \nto buy a German sewer system for the fact that it is a sale and \nleaseback. The German sewer system is sold to an American bank. Does \nthis bank ever go over and seize possession of a sewer pipe? They never \neven see a sewer pipe. All they want is a paper transaction so they can \ndepreciate the property to avoid paying U.S. taxes. And in this case it \nis reported on Frontline that Wachovia Bank saved $175 million by this \nscam of buying a German city's sewer system. Unbelievable.\n\n  By the way, this has been going on for some while before we were able \nto shut most of it down. I would also say that I often speak of the \nfact that there are some companies that are now stepping forward to the \nIRS--I believe about 45 companies have now stepped forward--and said \nthey are willing to pay for the benefits they received, even prior to \nthe time this was shut down. But there are some transactions that were \nallowed to continue, and we have American companies that continue to \nget the benefit of those transactions. My position is simple: This is \nabusive, it is unmitigated greed, and it should have been shut down--\nall of it shut down. The Internal Revenue Service, by the way, is still \ngoing back even beyond that date which was in the Federal law and \nchallenging these in court. In fact, there are a couple of very large \ncompanies at this point that are still disputing this and saying these \nare perfectly reasonable transactions. Shame on them. This doesn't meet \na third grade laugh test--an American company picking up a German sewer \nsystem.\n  In fact, one American company bought a city hall from a German town, \nand the auditor in that town said: Well, we don't understand it, but\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\nif that is what the Americans want to do with their money, God bless \nthem. It wasn't their money. What they were doing was sucking money out \nof the coffers of this government, because in many cases they are \ncompanies that are trying to find every way possible to avoid their \nFederal tax obligations. Yes, they want all the benefits America has to \noffer, except they don't want the obligation of paying their full \nmeasure of taxes, as most people do.\n  Most people who go to work in the mornings work an honest day, they \ncome home, and at the end of the year, when it is time, they file their \ntax return. They have had their withholdings and they pay their taxes \nto our country, to our government. But there are a whole lot of \ninterests that are much bigger that find ways to send people around the \nworld not only to move their jobs to where they can find 50-cent-an-\nhour labor, but perhaps while they are there, they might pick up a \nsewer system to boot so they can avoid paying U.S. taxes. That way they \ncan move your job overseas and avoid paying taxes at the same time, \nbecause you get a tax break for shutting your American plant down and \nmoving your American jobs overseas, which I hope to shut down with my \nfirst amendment; and then you get a tax break by buying a German sewer \nsystem and depreciating it and getting a tax break under the Tax Code.\n  Both of these amendments deserve to be passed. Both would raise money \nfor the Federal Government, both would reduce the Federal deficit and \nboth have substantial merit. Will I get a vote on these? I hope so. One \nis now filed and the other will be filed in a short period of time. I \nhope very much that I will be able to get the opportunity to have a \nvote here in the Senate and close these tax breaks.\n  Let me say that there are a whole lot of businesses in this country \nthat are working very hard to make it. Many American businesses have \nhad to steer through very difficult times. This is the deepest \nrecession since the Great Depression, and there are a lot of \nbusinesses, large, medium, and small, that are struggling every day to \ntry to navigate through this deep economic abyss. Boy, I give them \ngreat credit. Many of these owners have risked their entire life \nsavings to run their business. They get up in the morning and put the \nkey in the door and open their businesses.\n  So, look, what I want to have happen is for us to recognize good \nbusinesses in this country that do the right thing every day--that hire \nAmerican workers, produce products and strengthen this country's \neconomy. My point is those businesses are at a significant disadvantage \nif we continue to say to the business across the street: Move to China \nand produce these products in China and, by the way, we will give you a \ntax break for doing it. And we say to those who stay here: You know \nwhat, you shouldn't have stayed here, because you would have gotten a \ntax break if you had left. That is exactly the wrong message. What we \nshould do for those who stay is to reward them. They are the heroes. \nThey make up the economy, the foundation, the strength of what America \nis, instead of rewarding those who do exactly the wrong thing for this \ncountry.\n  These are my two amendments that I would like to offer.\n  Let me just, finally, say this. I know I get upset sometimes when I \ntalk about the abusive pieces of this tax policy and the abuse, I \nthink, of trade policy that has resulted in the loss of more than 5 \nmillion manufacturing jobs. By the way, the loss of 1.5 million \nmanufacturing jobs in the last 12 to 15 months--think of that. Think of \n1.5 million households in which someone wakes up and says: I am \njobless. I don't have a job anymore. I used to make furniture but that \nfurniture manufacturer is gone. I used to make tool and die machines--\ngone. You name it.\n  I told the story the other day on the floor of the Senate about \nPennsylvania House furniture, which is such a great example of what is \nhappening in this country. Governor Wendell did everything he could to \nkeep this great furniture company in Pennsylvania. They use \nPennsylvania wood, so Pennsylvania House furniture was known as an \nupscale furniture manufacturer that used special wood from \nPennsylvania. Then they were purchased by La-Z-Boy. By the way, La-Z-\nBoy is also leaving, but that is a different story.\n  They were purchased by La-Z-Boy, and La-Z-Boy decided they were \nmoving Pennsylvania House furniture to China and just going to ship the \nPennsylvania wood to China and put together the furniture and ship the \nfurniture back. Governor Wendell did everything he could to prevent \nthat from happening, but it happened.\n  The last day of work at the factory where they had spent a century, \nthe craftsmen who put that furniture together got together, and the \nlast piece of Pennsylvania House furniture that came off the \nmanufacturing line every employee in that company gathered around, they \ntipped it upside-down, and every one of them signed the bottom. \nSomebody in this country, perhaps, has a piece of furniture they don't \nquite understand. It has the signature of every last craftsman to work \nin that manufacturing plant in this country.\n  That pride of production and contribution to this country is by \nworkers who just want a job, who want a country that does not move its \nmanufacturing jobs elsewhere but values its manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry.\n  In 2008, La-Z-Boy said in the next 2 years it would move 1,050 \nemployees in Dayton, OH, to the plant in the Mexican State of Coahuila. \nThey previously moved other jobs to China, but they did say this:\n\n       We regret the impact the moves will have on the families \n     and lives of those employed affected, and greatly appreciate \n     the contribution each of them made with their dedicated \n     services.\n\n  So 1,050 people discovered their jobs were gone. But the same \ncompany, then, is the one who moved the Pennsylvania House furniture \nlong before that.\n  We have a lot to fix in this country, but we will. I am convinced our \ncountry's better days are ahead if we make the right judgments. If we \npass both of these amendments I have offered, it will make a \ncontribution significantly toward things that matter a lot in American \nfamilies: good jobs that pay well that give them some confidence in the \nfuture.\n  I suspect I can't ask unanimous consent to pass both pieces, both \namendments at the moment, so I will negotiate with the chairman of the \ncommittee to see if we can't get votes on both in the days to come.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3382 to Amendment No. 3336\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I realize Senator Gregg is up to speak. I do not see \nhim on the floor. I will be only a few minutes, and then I will ask \nunanimous consent he be recognized after me when he comes to the floor.\n  Mr. President, in a few moments I am pleased I am going to be \noffering an amendment that is strongly supported by Members on both \nsides of the aisle to focus on jobs and investments in equipment for \ncompanies that are currently not making a profit--which, unfortunately, \nis too many across the country right now. We want to make sure they \nhave an opportunity to have the capital they need to be able to grow as \nwell.\n  I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Schumer, Senator Crapo, Senator \nSnowe, and Senator Risch for working with me on an amendment that would \nprovide companies with an immediate source of capital to make increased \ninvestments in our country and spur job creation.\n  Since the start of the recession in December of 2007, the Nation has \nlost more than 8 million jobs, as we know. It is an economic tsunami, \nwhat has happened to families in this country. The national \nunemployment rate skyrocketed from 5 percent to 10 percent as companies \nare forced to cut costs and to lay off workers to remain viable just to \nkeep the ship afloat.\n  Our State, of course, the great State of Michigan, is much worse \nsince we are at about a 14.6-percent unemployment rate right now, and \nwe certainly are feeling the brunt of what has been happening. These \ncompanies also continue to face significant challenges in raising much-\nneeded capital for new investments to be able to keep people working.\n\n[[Page S1002]]\n\n  This amendment would allow struggling companies of all kinds that do \nnot benefit from other similarly designed incentives--such as bonus \ndepreciation or expanding the NOL carryback period, and other things--\nto utilize their existing AMT credits based on new investments they \nmake in 2010. So if they make investments, we would allow them to use \ncredits they cannot use right now because those credits can only be \nused against a profit, and they don't have a profit.\n  In addition to encouraging companies to increase investments to \nmaintain and expand jobs, the amendment also makes available a badly \nneeded source of capital. We have all been talking about access to \ncapital. This is an important way we can make this available at no real \ncost to the Federal Government. I think that is what is important about \nthis amendment. AMT credits are actually prepayments of tax which the \ntaxpayer can offset with future tax liability, dollar for dollar. So \nthese are prepayments.\n  Normally, if they were making a profit they would be able to offset \ntheir taxes and maintain additional revenue and capital, but they are \nnot in a position to do that right now. So at some point we, in fact, \nwould be giving them credit, and they would be able to use these \ncredits and be able to keep capital. But they cannot right now. So in a \nsense we are just moving up the day by which they can access the \ncapital that is available with AMT credits. Since the credits never \nexpire, the proposal merely accelerates when the credits are used.\n  This amendment would allow companies to be able to cash in their \nbuilt-up tax credit so they can build factories, buy equipment, and \ncreate jobs. Specifically, it will allow companies to utilize their \nexisting AMT credits up to 10 percent of a new investment that they \nmake in a manufacturing facility and in equipment purchased this year, \nin 2010. No company would be able to claim more than 50 percent of the \nvalue of the credit.\n  To accelerate the economic impact of allowing companies to be able to \naccess this capital and use the credits, the proposal would allow for \nan expedited refund process similar to current law rules for net \noperating losses.\n  A company that elects the 5-year, net-operating year-loss carryback \nenacted earlier, which I supported strongly, would not be eligible to \nclaim the benefits of this proposal. So it would be only those who \ncannot access other proposals we put forward because of the critical \nnature of helping companies not making a profit, being able to help \nthem access capital. The amendment would be offset by improving tax \ncompliance from individuals who receive rental income from properties.\n  The provision, originally proposed in the President's fiscal year \n2009-2010 budgets, would require people who received rental income on \nreal estate to be subject to the same information reporting \nrequirements as taxpayers who receive income from a trade or business.\n  This proposal would benefit a broad range of companies, including \nairlines, manufacturers, energy companies, high-tech companies--across \nthe board, companies large and small that currently find themselves in \na position where they are not making a profit but have built up these \nprepaid credits.\n  We have support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Association of Manufacturing \nTechnology, Association of Equipment Manufacturers, and Motor and \nEquipment Manufacturers Association. Some of the many U.S. employers \nwho support the proposal are American Airlines, Applied Micro Devices, \nArch Coal, Associated Builders and Contractors, Bosch, Cliffs Natural \nResources, CMS Energy, Consul Energy, Delta Airlines, Daimler, General \nMotors, Goodyear, Micron, National Mining Association, Owens Illinois, \nPeabody Energy, Qwest, T-mobile, and Xerox.\n  These are all major companies employing thousands, tens or hundreds \nof thousands of people who are needing access to capital. They have \nprepaid these credits. They need access to capital now so they can \nmaintain their workforce and, hopefully, expand it and invest in the \nequipment that will allow them to grow.\n  This amendment, again, is one that has broad bipartisan support. It \nwill allow us to essentially move forward the ability for companies to \nuse these AMT credits that they have already paid into, the dollars \nthey have already paid. This is something that will allow companies to \nget the equipment, the tools that are necessary; so as they are using \nthat jobs credit we passed and hiring people or continuing to be able \nto grow and invest in the business and keep the employees they have, \nthat they will be able to get some assistance within the legislation we \nare passing.\n  Again, let me just indicate that I very much appreciate colleagues \nwho have joined me. Senator Hatch, Senator Schumer, Senator Crapo, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Risch, and we have others, I know, who are very \ninterested in joining us as well.\n  I believe at this point I have not heard for sure if we are in a \nposition to actually call up the amendment at this point.\n  At the moment, if we are in a position to call up the amendment? I am \nlooking to staff to determine whether we are in a position to do that \nat this point? We are? All right.\n  Then, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be \nset aside, and I will call up amendment No. 3382.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't know that we are in that position \nyet at this point.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and I call up amendment No. 3382.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for herself, Mr. \n     Hatch, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 3382 \n     to Amendment No. 3336.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3335, as Modified\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and to call up amendment No. 3335 for the purposes of \nmodification only.\n  I have already spoken about the amendment at length. I have already \nsubmitted a lot of documents to the Record about the importance of this \namendment. But to recap, the amendment I am offering on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Vitter, Cochran, and Wicker is an amendment that \nwill help the recovery effort of the gulf coast, particularly as it \nrelates to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n  If we do not get this amendment on this bill or the next bill--I \nprefer it on this bill--we will literally shut down 7,000 units that \nare under construction today of low-income and moderate housing along \nthe gulf coast, from Mobile to Waveland to Gulfport to New Orleans, all \nthe way over to Cameron Parish, the entire gulf coast. Many people \nwitnessed the terrible catastrophe that happened in our State just 4\\1/\n2\\ years ago, and we will be marking the fifth anniversary of Katrina. \nThe wounds seem a little bit fresh watching the scenes from Haiti and \nChile. The situation in Haiti is much more disastrous in many ways than \nwhat happened in the gulf coast, but we most certainly went through our \nown horrors. Five years seems like a long time, but when you are \ndigging out of rubble such as we see happening right now and when the \nflood waters don't recede, in some places for 3 months, and people \ncan't return to their neighborhoods for 9 months, you can understand \nwhy it has taken us a little time to rebuild some of this housing. It \nhas taken longer than we ever imagined.\n  In addition, despite the fact that we have worked as hard and as fast \nas we can, in the middle of rebuilding some of these multifamily \nunits--we are trying to build them better, smarter, and more energy \nefficient, in a much better way than they were before for both public \nhousing and low-income housing--the market collapsed, which is not the \nfault of the people of Louisiana. We don't work on Wall Street. We \ndon't live on Wall Street. We are just busy trying to build our \ncommunities back. Wall Street collapses.\n  As a result, tax credits, which the Congress was so generous to give \nus some years ago to do this work, if we don't get this extension of a \nplaced-in-service date, the developers--which includes the Catholic \nChurch, nonprofit developers, not just for-profit developers--will lose \ntheir opportunity to sell these credits in the marketplace for the \nfinancing necessary to finish construction. That is sort of the long \nand short of it.\n  I am not here asking for additional credits. We are grateful, those \nof us from the Gulf Coast States, for what the Congress has already \ngiven us. But if this amendment, a 2-year extension, is not attached to \nthis bill, 7,000 units currently under construction and we estimate \nabout 13,000 jobs along the gulf coast will be lost.\n  So since this is a jobs bill, I thought it would be a good place to \nput this amendment because it will save 13,000 jobs, building great \napartments for rent and purchase that our people need in the gulf \ncoast. That is what the amendment does.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the amendment to be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend for 2 \n years the low-income housing credit rules for buildings in GO Zones, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 268, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

At the appropriate time, I will call up the amendment \nfor a vote and further debate. I wished to make sure we have the \nmodification in. I have now suggested a pay-for for it. I again thank \nMembers for being helpful to us. We thought actually these units would \nbe finished by now. Of course, the people trying to move into them want \nthem to be finished.

AGENCY WIDE IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Agency Identification.--Each Federal agency shall \n     identify and report every project that is an earmark with an \n     unobligated balance at the end of each fiscal year to the \n     Director of OMB.\n       (b) Annual Report.--The Director of OMB shall submit to \n     Congress and publically post on the website of OMB an annual \n     report that includes--\n       (1) a listing and accounting for earmarks with unobligated \n     balances summarized by agency including the amount of the \n     original earmark, amount of the unobligated balance, the year \n     when the funding expires, if applicable, and recommendations \n     and justifications for whether each earmark should be \n     rescinded or retained in the next fiscal year;\n       (2) the number of rescissions resulting from this title and \n     the annual savings resulting from this title for the previous \n     fiscal year; and\n       (3) a listing and accounting for earmarks provided for the \n     Department of Transportation scheduled to be rescinded at the \n     end of the current fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCoburn be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to take a \nsmall step toward addressing the growing problem of the Federal \ndeficits. The underlying bill we are considering would extend many \nvitally important programs, including various tax provisions, \nunemployment benefits, COBRA health benefits, and other provisions to \nhelp the millions of Americans who have lost jobs or who are struggling \nin this economy to get back on their feet again. While I support these \nprovisions, I am disappointed the bill is not fully paid for. My \namendment will not cover the whole cost of the bill, but it will make a \nsmall dent as we try to get our financial house in order and make the \ntough choices to avoid hamstringing future generations with this debt.\n  There is no single or easy solution to the massive deficits we face, \nbut one thing we should be doing is taking a hard look at the Federal \nbudget for wasteful or unnecessary spending. Hard-working American \nfamilies have to make these kinds of decisions every week to make ends \nmeet, whether it is skipping a trip to the movies or clipping coupons \nor paying attention to the sale ads. But in the end, by cobbling \ntogether a series of small actions, they try to get their budget back \nin line. I think we in Congress should be doing the same thing.\n  My proposal to rescind old, unwanted transportation earmarks would \nbring down our deficit by a modest sum by Washington, DC, standards--\naround $600 million and perhaps a few billion dollars over time. But \nthis is real money back in Wisconsin and one step on a path that is \ngoing to have to include many additional cuts.\n  I have put together a number of proposals for where we should begin \ntightening our belt, including the one for this amendment in a piece of \nlegislation I introduced last fall called the Control Spending Now Act. \nThe combined bill would cut the Federal deficit by about $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion over 10 years.\n  This amendment that is before us now would build off a proposal put \nforward in President George W. Bush's fiscal year 2009 budget proposal \nto rescind $226 million in highway earmarks that were over a decade old \nand still had less than 10 percent of the funding utilized. \nTransportation Weekly did an analysis of these earmarks at the time. \nThey found that over 60 percent of the funding--$389 million--was in \n152 earmarks that had no funding spent or obligated from them. These \nclearly are either unwanted or a low priority for the designated \nrecipients. This is nothing against transportation funding either. I \nfully realize the need for investment in our crumbling infrastructure \nand its potential for job creation in hard-hit segments such as \nconstruction, but having hundreds of millions of dollars sit untouched \nin an account at the Department of Transportation does nothing to \naddress our infrastructure needs and it does nothing to put people back \nto work.\n  So what I have done is build on President Bush's concept a little. My \namendment expands this rescission to all transportation earmarks that \nare over 10 years old with unobligated balances of more than 90 \npercent. At a hearing recently before the Budget Committee, I asked \nTransportation Secretary Ray LaHood about these unwanted and unspent \nearmarks and whether he supported my proposal to rescind them. \nSecretary LaHood responded:\n\n       The answer is, yes, we are supportive of your proposal, and \n     we have identified significant millions of dollars' worth of \n     earmarks.\n\n  It is unclear exactly how many hundreds of millions or even billions \nof dollars could be saved by this proposal being expanded to other \ntransportation earmarks in addition to the previous estimate of $626 \nmillion that would be rescinded from unwanted highway earmarks in the \nfirst year. This proposal would also be permanent so there would likely \nbe additional savings as the unwanted earmarks in the most recent \nhighway bill reach their 10-year anniversary.\n  I think this is a very modest proposal, going after just the lowest \nof the low-hanging fruit, and I would support going even further to \nmake it cover all Federal agencies. But with the uncertainty about how \nmany of these unwanted and unspent earmarks there might be across the \nwhole Federal Government, my amendment simply requires an annual report \nby the OMB to collect information from each agency and include \nrecommendations on whether these other unobligated earmarks should also \nbe rescinded.\n  So as my colleagues can see, there is bipartisan support from the \nlast two\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\nadministrations for this proposal, and there is bipartisan support in \nthis Senate for this amendment. This shouldn't be a hard decision, and \nI hope to have more strong bipartisan support in the Senate. If we \ncan't agree to take old earmarks that no one wants and use the money to \npay down the deficit, then how are we ever going to get our fiscal \nhouse in order?\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, there is an amendment pending by Senator \nSanders to offer a $250 stipend to seniors, veterans, and those \ndisabled to replace the lack of a cost-of-living increase, a COLA \nincrease. As we are all aware, the formulas that drive the cost-of-\nliving increase are predominantly affected by inflation. With the lack \nof inflation, seniors, veterans, and the disabled did not receive a \ncost-of-living increase for this year.\n  Senator Sanders' amendment is very clear. He wants to provide a $250 \nstipend. That has broad-based support within the Senate body, but I \nthink it is responsible to say that to do this, we should pay for it. \nTo do this, we should not print more money, borrow that money just to \nprovide a $250 check. I think most of our Nation's seniors, veterans, \nand disabled would agree with that statement.\n  To ignore the fact that we are not paying for it would be to say that \nwe are going to pass this stipend on to our children and our \ngrandchildren; that we are going to take the money we are going to \nborrow and the debt and the obligation for that debt and we are going \nto pass it generationally down. As a parent of a 25-year-old and a 24-\nyear-old, I do not think they deserve it. At some point, I hope they \nare both going to have children, and I do not think their children \ndeserve for me to shove this down. And I think most Members of the \nSenate probably agree that it is time we start paying for it.\n  How does this get back? Senator Sanders makes this an emergency \ndeclaration to spend. We have a lot of priorities, and there is \nprobably not a priority that does not deserve us to pay for it, to find \nsomewhere where we have prioritized and decided, here is how we are \ngoing to pay for it, versus to continue to go out and borrow.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, we have the largest debt we have ever \nhad. It continues to climb every day. Of every dollar we spend, we \nborrow 43 cents. Over the next 10 years, right now our country is \nobligated at $5 trillion in interest payments. That is trillion with a \n``t.'' I am reminded that the most popular bumper sticker in Washington \ntoday is ``Don't tell Congress what comes after a trillion.'' I am not \nsure we know yet. At the rate we are going, we are going to find out. \nDo you know who is going to be saddled with that debt? It is going to \nbe our children and our grandchildren. Nobody wants to leave our \nseniors, our veterans, and the disabled without the means they need to \nlive. But I think even the people who are the recipients of these \nchecks would look at us and say: Pay for it; don't put it on my \ngrandchildren or my great grandchildren.\n  My amendment No. 3390 is very simple. It says this: Pay for the $250 \nstipend and use the unobligated stimulus money, the money we have \nalready appropriated. We cannot borrow it twice; we can only borrow it \nonce. Use the unobligated stimulus money, a little over $14 billion--I \nthink it is about $14.4 billion--to pay for the stipend. Let's do the \nCOLA, but let's, in fact, make sure that COLA is paid for. The \namendment is almost identical to Senator Sanders' amendment which \nprovides the emergency benefit; it just pays for it. I don't think \nthere is anything unreasonable on that. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates the cost of the Sanders amendment to be at 12.7 billion. I \nunderstand the Sanders amendment was modified, so that might be \nslightly higher. Millions of seniors and veterans are struggling on \nfixed incomes in this troubled economy. This amendment also provides \nthem the ability to get through those tough times but it also gives \nthem the comfort of looking at their grandchildren and their great-\ngrandchildren and saying: I am not a burden on you because this was \npaid for. We accounted for it.\n\n  Senator Bunning came to the floor yesterday--I think we were talking \nabout $10 billion yesterday--and he said: How can a country this great \nnot find a way to pay for $10 billion? Well, we didn't. And as that \nmakes its way through, we are going to borrow that $10 billion, and \nthat $10 billion is going to equate to $10 billion of interest payments \nover the next 10 years. Let me say that again. What we did yesterday is \ngoing to compute to $10 billion worth of interest payments over the \nnext 10 years. No payment down of principal, just an obligation of \ninterest on the debt.\n  Maybe some are smart enough here to tell me exactly what the interest \nrates are going to be in the open marketplace as we finance our debt 3 \nyears, 5 years, 10 years down the road. I don't think it is going to be \nwhere it is today. There is every indication it is going higher. So \nwhen I state the number $5 trillion over the next 10 years, you have to \nunderstand that is a static interest rate that we have applied to it. \nIt is 3.45, is the projection of the Congressional Budget Office. And \nthey\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\nhave said if it averages at this point, then we are going to, as a \nnation, owe $5 trillion, if we didn't borrow another dime. Well, not \nonly do we continue to borrow money, but the likelihood is, with the \neconomic conditions and with the fragile nature of the international \neconomy, anybody who buys our debt, anybody who loans us their money is \nprobably going to want to require more than 3.45 percent to take the \nrisk. When countries such as Greece are on the precipice of default, it \ndrives the international market up. It drives the cost of risk up. It \nwill drive the cost of our risk up. What is $5 trillion today--we might \nnot borrow another dime--may end up being next week, next month, next \nyear $10 trillion over 5 years, just with the change in interest rate; \njust with what it costs us to go out and attract somebody to loan us \nthis money.\n  I think I have given us a best-case scenario of saying we owe $5 \ntrillion in the next 10 years. Excuse me, $5 trillion plus 10 more \nbillion that we spent last night. The question is: Today, are we going \nto add another $14 billion to it? That is the decision in front of the \nCongress. My amendment, No. 3390, provides a $250 stipend. What it does \nthat the Sanders amendment doesn't do, is it pays for it. It assures \nevery recipient--senior, veteran, disabled person--that they are not \nputting the obligation of their check on their grandchildren and their \ngreat grandchildren; that we are taking the responsibility now to fund \nthat.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, the Baucus substitute amendment gives \npreferential treatment to the extension of three programs: unemployment \ninsurance, COBRA, and what is known as FMAP, which is the Federal \nGovernment's aid that it provides to States in the payment of Medicaid. \nThese are laudable things to do, especially in this difficult economic \nenvironment. In my home State of Florida, we have nearly 12 percent \nunemployment. It is the highest anyone can remember, and people are \nstruggling. So these are laudable things to do. The challenge is we are \nnot going to pay for these spending programs. We are going to put them \non the backs of our children and grandchildren, as my colleague Senator \nBurr remarked in his comments.\n  A couple of weeks ago, we passed a bill here in the Senate called \npay-go, and the President just signed this bill into law. I struggled \nwith my vote on pay-go, being a new Member to the Senate and being very \nconcerned about spending, and I thought about voting for it. I thought \nabout voting for it because anything that cuts spending around here, on \nits face, seems like a good idea to me. But the challenge for me came \nin learning from some of my colleagues that we don't enforce pay-go. \nThey came to me and said: Look, they are not going to use this as a \nreal measure to control spending. So the bill passed along party lines. \nAnd although I didn't support it, I hoped for the best.\n  But here we are, a couple of weeks after the President signed the \npay-go law, and I want to remind the Senate of the comments of Majority \nLeader Reid upon arguing for the passage of the bill. He said: This \npay-go--pay-as-you-go rule--we are proposing for the government is the \nsame one Americans use every day in their individual lives; the same \nones we teach our children. In order to spend a dollar, we have to have \nthat dollar in our wallet. This law will enforce that commonsense \napproach.\n  Sounds reasonable. Sounds like the right thing to do. The President, \nwhen he signed the law, said: You have to make hard choices about where \nto spend and where to save.\n  Well, here we are, a few weeks later, and unfortunately the \nprediction of my colleagues that this was not a true enforcement \nmechanism on spending has come true. Because we are going to designate \nthe extension of these three programs as emergencies. They are \nemergencies. And if they are emergencies, then we don't have to make \nthem play by the rules. We don't have to cut spending in order to pay \nfor these programs.\n  Unfortunately, we seem to designate whatever we choose as an \nemergency and, therefore, we don't have to do the things Leader Reid \nsaid. We don't have to do the things President Obama said. But families \nsitting around their tables who have bills to pay can't say: This is an \nemergency; therefore, I can go and spend money I don't have. Families \ncan't do that. Businesses can't do that. Even State governments, that \nhave to balance their budgets, can't do that.\n  So what is an emergency? What does the law tell us is proper to \ndesignate? Certainly we could think of circumstances that could be an \nemergency: a situation of war, the financial meltdown we had a couple \nof years ago. Certainly things such as that would justify being an \nemergency. Well, the Budget Act of 1974 lays out five different \ncriteria that must be met. First, necessary, essential, or vital; \nsecond, sudden, quickly coming into being and not building up over \ntime; three, an urgent pressing and compelling need, requiring \nimmediate attention; four, unforeseen, unpredictable, unanticipated; \nfive, not permanent, temporary in nature.\n  None of these three extensions is that. We saw these coming. To say \nthis is an emergency is like putting $5 of gasoline in your car and \nthen running out of gasoline and saying: I have an emergency. I \ncouldn't foresee that the $5 wasn't going to get me very far.\n  Again, these are laudable programs, and the point of order I am about \nto make is not going to stop this going forward. All it is going to say \nis that you can't declare something an emergency that is not an \nemergency, and that we should pay for this by the end of the year. What \na commonsense idea to bring to Washington and perhaps to the Congress, \nthat we pay for the programs we decide need funding, that we don't \nbalance it on the backs of our kids and grandkids. As Senator Burr \nsaid, we shouldn't borrow $10 billion to spend $10 billion. The \nspending in Washington is unsustainable.\n  Let's do these good programs, but let's take a novel approach and \nlet's pay for them.\n  Mr. President, at this time I wish to make a point of order. Pursuant \nto section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I raise \na point of order against the emergency designation provision contained \nin the pending substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of \nthose acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the \nsubstitute amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a killer motion the Senator from \nFlorida is making. This amendment kills jobs. This amendment tells \npeople who are currently unemployed: You are not going to get an \nunemployment check. This amendment tells people who are trying to get \nhealth insurance under COBRA: Sorry, no more. This amendment tells \ndoctors who are trying to take care of patients, Medicare patients, \nthat they are not going to get paid what they should be paid.\n  Let me give a few numbers. Our legislation will help half a million \nworkers who lose their jobs get help under COBRA. That is the health \ninsurance substitute provision for those who have lost their jobs. But \nthe amendment of the Senator from Florida says to those half a million \nworkers who lose their jobs today that they will not get insurance \nbenefits under COBRA.\n  This amendment also will have the effect, if adopted, of preventing \nnearly 40 million Medicare beneficiaries and nearly 9 million TRICARE \nbeneficiaries from getting access to their doctors--40 million seniors \nand about 9 million military personnel under TRICARE.\n  This amendment will also prevent 400,000 Americans from getting \nunemployment insurance benefits.\n  That is just for starters. This motion, if adopted, is not a poison \namendment, it is a killer amendment. It kills the bill we are trying to \npass in a short period of time. The bill is basically to extend \nunemployment benefits, to extend the COBRA benefits, and to make sure \nthat people who should get relief under current law are able to \nmaintain that.\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\n  This is very similar to the situation we faced because of efforts of \nthe Senator from Kentucky not long ago. We finally resolved that. That \nwas a 30-day extension, and the Senate voted 78 to 19 to continue those \nbenefits under that 30-day provision. The Senator from Kentucky tried \nto stop it. Finally, the Senator relented and the Senate agreed by a \nvote of 78 to 19 that we should proceed, and it passed that 30-day \ncontinuation.\n  This is an emergency. We are now in an economic emergency. \nUnemployment is close to 10 percent. This economy is still in a \nrecession. It is slowly getting better, but if this amendment were to \npass--if the amendment offered by the Senator from Florida were to \nbecome law--then, frankly, think of the signal that would send to \nAmericans who are now relying upon COBRA benefits and unemployment \nbenefits.\n  This point of order is a killer, and that is why we need to waive the \nbudget point of order so we can vote for a bill that would come before \nus later on this evening. I urge Senators, when the vote comes on this \nwaiver, that we waive the budget point of order, because otherwise the \nprovision of the Senator from Florida will send a terrible signal to \nmillions of Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. With all due respect to my colleague, the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, my point of order will not stop these programs \nfrom being extended. What it will do is it will make sure we have to \npay for them by the end of the year--a novel idea, that we actually pay \nfor a program. So we will have to look at programs we have now, \nperhaps, and we cut other programs. Do we not think there is some \ninefficiency in the administration of the Federal Government? We had a \nproposal we tried to pass last year to require all the agencies of the \nFederal Government to cut 5 percent--just 5 percent--when they have had \n5, 10, 15 and 20-percent increases year after year after year. Surely \ngoverning and leadership is about making decisions.\n  I voted for the 30-day extension. I want to vote for this bill, but I \nwant to pay for it. I want to make sure we are not borrowing money from \nthe children and grandchildren of Floridians and other Americans to pay \nfor this bill. I want to make sure we are not going to be paying \ninterest to the Chinese to pay for this bill. I think it makes \nperfectly good sense that we are required, by the end of the year, to \nfind the money to pay for this.\n  Every dollar we spend is a choice. It is a choice on what we should \nspend it on. In this body and in this Congress it is a choice, \nunfortunately, to put a burden upon our children and grandchildren \nbecause we spend much more than we have.\n  I am supportive of extending unemployment compensation. I am \nsupportive of extending COBRA, which is health care. I am supportive of \nhelping out the States with Medicaid payments. All I am asking is let's \npay for it. Surely, there is some other program, duplicative in \ngovernment, inefficiencies we can find to offset this payment.\n  This is not a killer, this is just responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I hope we can vote on this fairly soon. Basically, let's \nremind ourselves this is an emergency. We have lost over 7 million jobs \nin this recession. We are not out of the recession. Unemployment is \nclose to 10 percent. We hope it comes down. This is an emergency and in \nemergency situations you take emergency action and that is why this \nlegislation is necessary now.\n  I hope when the economy does recover we have the fortitude to start \nto live within our means, as we should. Nobody debates that. But we are \nin a situation now where we have to make sure we extend those benefits \nand that Medicaid dollars go to the States right now because we are \nstill in an emergency.\n  I urge, frankly, the motion to waive the point of order. I hope it is \nsuccessful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak about 5 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burris pertaining to the introduction of S. 3065 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3390\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in October of 2008, the Social Security \nAdministration, SSA, announced that beneficiaries would receive a 5.8-\npercent COLA in 2009, the biggest increase since 1982.\n  This increase was primarily due to record high energy prices. Energy \nprices have since declined resulting in a 2.1-percent year-over-year \ndecline in the consumer price index, CPI, as determined by the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics.\n  Because current law precludes a negative COLA, the SSA announced this \npast October that there will be no COLA in 2010.\n  It was also announced that there will be no increase in Medicare Part \nB premiums for current beneficiaries, except for those with incomes \ngreater than $85,000--single--and $170,000--married.\n  I understand the concerns about Medicare Part D and Medigap premiums. \nUnlike Part B premiums--which cannot go up when there is no COLA--these \nother premiums are not subject to such a restriction.\n  However, beneficiaries have other options to reduce these premiums. \nFor example, there may be a competing drug plan with lower premiums. I \nalways encourage people to reevaluate their coverage on an annual basis \nto see if there is another plan that offers the benefits they need at a \nlower price. Or, there may be a Medicare Advantage plan that covers \nboth prescription drugs and provides coverage similar to a Medigap plan \nfor a lower premium.\n  As an aside, senior citizens at my town hall meetings frequently ask \nabout congressional COLAs. I remind them that Congress did not receive \na COLA this year either. I have consistently voted against automatic \nCOLAs for Congress.\n  However, I recognize the financial need of many seniors who rely on \nSocial Security. A $250 check would be roughly equal to a 2 percent \nCOLA for the average beneficiary.\n  Congress enacted the automatic COLA in 1972 in order to provide an \nobjective, nonpartisan way to determine benefit adjustments. The annual \nCOLA has been based on the CPI calculations of the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics ever since.\n  Any decision to change, or override, the current process needs to be \ncarefully vetted. History shows Congress has often played partisan \npolitics with Social Security without regard to the solvency of the \nprogram or the burden placed on future taxpayers.\n  I understand the desire to send $250 checks to current Social \nSecurity beneficiaries to compensate for the lack of a COLA. But, we \nare also facing an annual budget deficit in excess of $1 trillion for \nthe second year in a row.\n  We cannot continue to add to our deficit without any regard to the \nconsequences.\n  The Sanders amendment fails to include an acceptable way of \noffsetting the $13 billion cost of this proposal.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Burr would offset the cost by \nreducing unspent stimulus funds.\n  Last year, CBO scored the stimulus bill at $787 billion. But earlier \nthis year CBO revised its estimate to $862 billion.\n  CBO estimates that we have already spent $200 billion in 2009 and we \nwill spend $400 billion in 2010. That leaves more than $250 billion for \nfuture years.\n  This amendment would simply reduce the unspent balance by $13 \nbillion.\n  It has been suggested by some on the other side of the aisle that we \nshould not use stimulus money to pay for other things.\n  They insist the stimulus money is needed to create jobs. Given the \nfact we have lost nearly 4 million private sector jobs since last year, \nI doubt the stimulus money has created any net new jobs. But for those \nwho choose to believe government spending can create more jobs than it \ndestroys, CBO says payments that can be made quickly are more effective \nthan those that take a long time.\n  By that standard, using less effective stimulus dollars to pay for \nmore effective stimulus dollars is the best alternative.\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which is fully paid \nfor, and reject the amendment of my colleague from Vermont that \nneedlessly increases the deficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think we will soon be entering an order \nto vote on several amendments. I would like to point out the theme of \nthese amendments, most of which are offered by the other side, are to \ncut back Recovery Act dollars, cut back stimulus dollars, take away \nstimulus dollars.\n  We know the stimulus program has created millions of jobs. At least \nthat is what CBO says. Certainly, it has created a great number of \njobs. When these amendments come up, I would like all Members to know \nthe basic theme of these amendments is to pay for them by cutting \nstimulus dollars, which I think is a bad idea. We should not be cutting \nstimulus dollars. We should be maintaining the Recovery Act and \nstimulus program. We will soon get an order so we can start voting on \namendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:55 p.m. this evening \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following amendments and \nthe Baucus motion to waive in the order listed, that prior to each vote \nin the sequence, there be 2 minutes of debate divided and controlled in \nthe usual form, and after each vote in the sequence the remaining votes \nbe 10 minutes' duration.\n  I might say the 2 minutes of debate, equally divided and controlled, \nbe amended to 4 minutes of debate, equally divided and controlled, with \nrespect to the two Bunning amendments. Those two Bunning amendments are \nNos. 3360 and 3361.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, just to make it clear what the amendments \nare, it is Burr amendment No. 3390; Sanders amendment No. 3353, as \nmodified; Bunning amendment No. 3360; Bunning amendment No. 3361, and \nBaucus motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  For the information of all Senators, the first vote will be on the \nBurr amendment, which is similar to the Sanders amendment. One big \ndifference, that Burr amendment takes stimulus dollars to pay for the \nSanders amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There are 2 minutes, equally divided, prior to a vote on the Burr \namendment.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I will take my minute to simply say my \namendment does exactly what the Sanders amendment does. It provides a \n$250 stipend to seniors, veterans, the disabled who did not receive a \ncost-of-living increase because the inflation formula did not provide \none this year. The difference between mine and Sanders is novel--I \nactually pay for the $14 billion we are paying out to seniors, \nveterans, and the disabled. I am saying to every recipient of a check, \nwe are not going to bill this to your children and grandchildren, we \nare going to pay for it now with money that is unobligated but already \nappropriated by the Congress. I think this is a reasonable approach. I \nthink every Member should support it. We should be pleased we are doing \na stipend to seniors, but we should sleep well tonight because we paid \nfor it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate voted yesterday, 53 to 43, \nagainst the Bunning amendment to cut back Recovery Act funds for the \n30-day extension bill. Earlier today, the Senate voted 61 to 38 against \nthe Thune amendment to cut back Recovery Act funds to pay for tax cuts, \nand now we have the pending Burr amendment to cut back Recovery Act \nfunds. In all three cases, we turned away those efforts to cut back \nRecovery Act/stimulus funds. I think we should do the same here, so \npeople can get their benefits--excuse me, so the Sanders amendment gets \npassed.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order against the emergency \nprovisions in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. I move to waive the appropriate provisions in the Budget \nAct and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Bond), the Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), and \nthe Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 38, nays 59, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 35 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--38\n\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Isakson\n     Klobuchar\n     LeMieux\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Webb\n\n                                NAYS--59\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coburn\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Bond\n     Hutchison\n     Sessions\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion rejected.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \nBurr amendment violates the pay-as-you-go provisions, of S. Con. Res. \n21, 110th Congress, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \nyear 2009.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained.\n  The amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3353\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes evenly divided with respect \nto the Sanders amendment No. 3353, as modified.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, for the first time in 36 years, seniors \nand disabled veterans and persons with disabilities will not be \nreceiving a cost-of-living adjustment, a COLA on their benefits. The \nargument for that is that they are not seeing inflationary costs. Go \nback home and talk to seniors, talk to disabled veterans. They will \ntell you they are paying sky-high costs for prescription drugs and \nhealth care. This amendment is supported by AARP, the American Legion, \nthe VFW, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security, and a wide \nnumber of veterans organizations and senior citizens organizations that \nknow it is wrong to turn our backs on seniors in this moment of \neconomic difficulty.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Social Security represents a strong \ncommitment to our nation's seniors. Ever since Ida May Fuller of \nVermont received the first Social Security check issued, vulnerable \nseniors have had a safety-net to fall back on in retirement and to \nsupplement individual retirement savings or pensions. Nearly 70\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\npercent of beneficiaries depend on Social Security for at least half of \ntheir income, and Social Security is the sole source of income for 15 \npercent of recipients.\n  Social Security is an immensely important program, one that has \nhelped millions of Americans stay out of poverty once entering \nretirement. While facing the rising costs of health care, food and \nfuel, Social Security has been a successful safety net for more than 70 \nyears. However, for the first time in its history, this year Social \nSecurity recipients will not receive a cost-of living adjustment, COLA, \ndue to the economic deflation, rather than inflation, our economy \nexperienced this past year. Since the COLA will not go into effect this \nyear, Congress needs to act to ensure those who need it most will \nreceive this essential benefit.\n  That is why I was proud to join Senator Sanders in cosponsoring the \nEmergency Senior Citizens Relief Act, which would provide all Social \nSecurity recipients, railroad retirees, SSI beneficiaries and adults \nreceiving veterans' benefits with a one-time additional check for $250 \nin 2010, similar to the payment beneficiaries received as a part of the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed last year. Today, we have \nthe opportunity to include this important emergency relief in \nlegislation aimed at helping all struggling Americans. This amendment \nrepresents our continued commitment to providing a safety net to our \nnation's seniors and those with disabilities in this uncertain economy.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support the Sanders amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment would add billions of \ndollars to the deficit which would have to be paid for by our children. \nOf course, the reason the COLA is not being given this year is because \nthe law says it should not be. Therefore, I raise a point of order that \nthe Sanders amendment violates section 403(a) of the budget resolution.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1964 and section 4(g)(3) of the statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, \nI move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable \nbudget resolutions for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 4 minutes equally divided \nbefore a vote in relation to the Bunning amendment No. 3360.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are 4 \nminutes equally divided on these two amendments; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Amendment No. 3360 is simple. It contains all of the extensions in \nthe Baucus substitute, but rather than adding over $100 billion in cost \nto the deficit and debt, which the Baucus substitute does, my amendment \npays for the spending in this bill by rescinding unspent stimulus \nfunding.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have stated repeatedly \nthat CBO considers money spent on extending unemployment benefits to be \none of the best kinds of stimulus because the people who receive it are \nlikely to immediately spend it. So let's redirect money from an \nineffective stimulus bill in which some of the funding won't be spent \nuntil fiscal year 2013 or beyond. Let's stimulate the economy now and \nprevent a massive increase in the debt at the same time.\n  I am having a hard time understanding why some Senators believe \nstimulus funding is so sacred. Was the stimulus brought down from the \nmountaintop by Moses? If that is the case, why did the majority raid \nstimulus money to pay for an extension of cash for clunkers?\n  I will be the first to admit that neither side of the aisle has clean \nhands when it comes to out-of-control spending. We can't control what \nwas done in the past, but we can control what happens today. It is time \nto take a stand--a stand for our children and grandchildren so they \nwon't have to pay back trillions more in debt.\n  I am tired of China holding the mortgage on our country. I am tired \nof the massive national debt that will be doubled in 5 years and \ntripled in 10. It is hard for me to look my grandchildren in the eye \nwhen I know this generation is handing them a country where they won't \nhave the same opportunities to succeed and prosper as I did. It has to \nstop.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, our spending has to stop.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this Bunning amendment is the fourth \nattempt in 2 days to pay for emergency safety net programs by cutting \nback stimulus spending, by cutting back from the Recovery Act. This is \nthe same amendment. We have voted on this basic topic four times.\n  Yesterday the Senate voted 53 to 43 against the Bunning amendment to \ncut back Recovery Act funds for the 30-day extension bill. Earlier \ntoday the Senate voted 61 to 38 against the Thune amendment to cut back \nRecovery Act funds, and just a few minutes ago the Senate voted down \nthe Burr amendment. Now we have the Bunning amendment to cut back \nRecovery Act funds again to pay for the pending bill.\n  CBO does say the Recovery Act has added jobs. Between 1 million and \n2.1 million jobs have been added to our economy because of the Recovery \nAct. Just to repeat, the CBO says the Recovery Act added between 1 \nmillion and 2 million to the number of Americans employed in the fourth \nquarter of last year. CBO also says the Recovery Act increased the \nnumber of full-time equivalent jobs by between 1.4 and 3 million jobs. \nThe Recovery Act is creating jobs, so I think the last thing we should \ndo is scale back something that\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\nis working. If it is working, don't change it. If it is working, let's \ncontinue with it.\n  I move to table the Bunning amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 4 minutes equally divided \nprior to a vote in relation to Bunning amendment No. 3361.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, let me briefly describe my amendment No. \n3361. Like other amendments, this amendment contains all the extensions \nin the Baucus substitute, and it also completely pays for that \nspending. But it provides a different alternative for paying for it: \neliminating wasteful and duplicative government programs.\n  Many of these programs are the ones President Obama has recommended \nterminating, and others have been highlighted by the CBO and the \nCongressional Research Service as wasteful.\n  I thank Senator Coburn publicly for the good work he has done \ncompiling this list of programs.\n  We voted on a similar spending reduction when the Senate passed a \nrecord $1.9 trillion increase in the debt limit to $14.3 trillion. I \nhope we have a different outcome today. I hope my colleagues will not \nchoose bloated bureaucracy over our children and grandchildren. They \nwill face over $100 billion more in debt and compounding interest on \nthe debt if we do not pay for this bill. Enough is enough.\n  If we cannot find the money to pay for programs, we ought to make the \nhard choices to reduce the deficit and debt.\n  I hope my colleagues will make the right choice today and support my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, we find ourselves debating an amendment \nthat we voted down just last month. Proponents make the rescissions \nsound like good policy when you listen to them. But Members need to \nunderstand this amendment causes harm to our national and international \nsecurity and to our economy.\n  First, this amendment proposes rescissions throughout the agencies \nthat are completely random and based on subjective assumptions.\n  Second, rescinding discretionary funds that have been available for \nmore than 2 years will jeopardize our national defense, our homeland \nsecurity, and the well-being of our citizens.\n  This is simply irresponsible governing. For example, a ship is not \nbuilt in a year or 2 years. A hospital is not built in a year. And if \nthey are not built in a year, these funds are rescinded.\n  This amendment proposes to cut billions in funding the Congress voted \non and agreed to provide just months ago. This amendment is not based \non careful review and, if adopted, would have serious consequences on \nour procurement process and many critical programs for fiscal year \n2010.\n  The majority of the Members acted responsibly in January and rejected \nthe same approach. I urge my colleagues to do the same today.\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, I move to table the Bunning amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote on the motion to waive a budget point of order on amendment \nNo. 3336.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I made this point of order not because I \nam not in favor of the extension of the unemployment insurance or the \nCOBRA or the money for Medicaid but only that it be paid for.\n  Just a few weeks ago, this Chamber voted to pass a pay-go bill, which \nthe President signed, and it said we will pay as we go. But we have \ndesignated each of these three extensions as emergencies. They are not \nemergencies under the 1974 Budget Act requiring that it be sudden, \nquickly coming, unforeseen, or unpredictable. It is not an emergency.\n  All my point of order does is to say that by the end of the year, we \nwill have to pay for these. It will not stop them from going forward, \nbut it will make sure we have to pay for them, just as the pay-go law \nrequires. These are nonemergencies.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to waive the point of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a killer point of order. This \npoint of order would kill the underlying substitute amendment. It would \nprevent people from getting COBRA benefits. It would prevent people \nfrom getting their unemployment checks. It would cause doctors to have \ntheir payments\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\nfor Medicare patients cut 21 percent. It endangers access for 40 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries. It will kill unemployment insurance \nbenefits for 400,000 Americans. This is a point of order that will, in \neffect, kill the bill. That is why it is vitally important that \nSenators vote to waive the point of order so we can pass the bill.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are \n37. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to reconsider that vote.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I move to lay that motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3400\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President I have sought recognition to speak on an \namendment I am offering to H.R. 4213, the Tax Extenders Act. This \namendment would create a loan guarantee program to maintain the \ndomestic manufacturing capacity for shipbuilding.\n  With the U.S. economy still struggling to recover, manufacturing \ninvestments can have an immediate impact. Manufacturers have lost more \nthan 2 million jobs since the recession began in December of 2007, so \nthere is an opportunity to create a large number of jobs in the \nindustry and to simultaneously revitalize our economy and overall \nglobal competitiveness. One area where benefits can immediately be seen \nis the shipbuilding industry. U.S. shipyards play an important role in \nsupporting our Nation's maritime presence by building and repairing our \ndomestic fleet; and the industry has a significant impact on our \nnational economy by adding billions of dollars to U.S. economic output \nannually.\n  These shipbuilding investments are vital to the United States, \ncreating thousands of good-paying jobs across the country. The \ncommercial shipbuilding and ship repair industry is a pillar of the \nAmerican skilled labor workforce employing nearly 40,000 skilled \nworkers; and the ships produced domestically are an integral part of \ncommerce, international trade, the Navy, Coast Guard, and other \nmilitary and emergency support. With more than 80 percent of the \nworld's trade carried in whole or part by seaborne transportation, the \nshipbuilding industry has always had and will continue to have a large \nindustrial base that can support significant job creation and economic \ngrowth.\n  Since the mid 1990s, the industry has been experiencing a period of \nexpansion and renewal. The last expansion was largely marketdriven, \nbacked by long-term customer commitments. Those new assets created much \nmore productive and advanced ships than those they replaced. For \nexample, articulated double-hull tank barge units replaced single-hull \nproduct tankers in U.S. coastal trades, and new duel propulsion double-\nhull crude carriers replaced 30 plus-year-old, steam propulsion single-\nhull crude carriers. The new crude carriers are larger, faster, more \nfuel efficient and have a fourfold increase in efficiency over the \nvessels they replaced.\n  During the last expansion, the Department of Transportation's \nMaritime Administration touted the success of Aker Philadelphia \nShipyard as a great achievement for the American shipbuilding industry. \nIn 2000, Aker Philadelphia Shipyard was rebuilt on the site of a closed \nU.S. Navy shipyard. In a few short years, the shipyard became the \ncountry's most modern shipbuilding facility employing 1,200 highly \nskilled professional workers. Since 2003, it has built more than 50 \npercent of the large commercial vessels produced in the United States. \nAdditionally, the shipyard contributes over $230 million annually to \nthe Philadelphia region, $5 to 7 million per month in local purchases, \n$8.6 million in annual tax revenues to the city of Philadelphia, and \nsupports over 8,000 jobs throughout the region. Today, Aker \nPhiladelphia Shipyard is one of only two companies producing large \ncommercial vessels in the United States and is a critical asset to the \neconomic viability of the mid-Atlantic region and the domestic \nshipbuilding industry.\n  Despite these successes, the economic collapse has stalled the \nshipbuilding industry by delaying planned ship acquisitions, \nconstraining the credit markets, and making large vessel acquisitions \nimpossible to finance. The long-term customer-driven commitments that \ndrove the last expansion are not a possibility in this economic \nclimate. As a result, this industry, which is a part of the national \nsecurity industrial base, supports thousands of highly skilled jobs, \nand is critical to the industrial fabric of our Nation, is struggling \nto survive.\n\n  Since the economic downturn, shipyards such as the Aker Philadelphia \nShipyard do not qualify for loan guarantees under existing programs at \nthe Department of Transportation. Without assistance, shipyards will be \nforced to begin reducing their highly skilled workforce, apprentice \nprograms, and vendor and supplier contracts, at a time when we can \nleast afford additional job losses. If this situation persists and \ncompanies like Aker were to cease operations, our Nation's ability to \nconstruct commercial vessels would be severely limited and the \ninvestments we made to build this state-of-the-art facility would be \nlost.\n  At the same time, there is a strong and direct correlation between \nthe performance of shipbuilding and the global economy and trade. \nShipbuilding activities rise when global trade and economy grow. \nLikewise, shipbuilding will be among the first activities to suffer \nwhen trade slumps and the economy stutters. This puts shipbuilding at \nthe forefront of one of the world's key and most important economic \nactivities, and a reliable barometer of economic performance.\n  As the economy recovers, so will the need for ships and our domestic \nshipbuilding capacity. The Maritime Administration has recognized that \nconstruction of vessels for the Nation's marine highway system could \nresult in significant new opportunities for U.S. shipyards. The \nshipbuilding industry is also developing vessel portfolios that can be \nleveraged by the government including military vessels to meet the \nNation's needs in time of national emergency. For example, the Navy's \nLittoral Combat Ship and Joint High Speed Vessel programs are based on \ncommercially designed and available vessels. There will also be a need \nfor additional ships as almost $5 billion worth of double-hull \nconstruction and conversion work will need to take\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\nplace by 2015 to meet the double-hull requirement under the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990.\n  To address the dire situation facing the domestic shipbuilding \nindustry, I am seeking the establishment of a loan guarantee program, \nwhere the Secretary of Transportation can issue a loan guarantee for \n$165 million to qualifying shipyards. Because of loan guarantees \nleverage funding, the program would require only $15 million to \nleverage $165 million. This $15 million is offset by reprogramming \npreviously appropriated funds, so there is no additional spending \nassociated with this program.\n  The Federal assistance would be a short-term financing bridge to \nenable shipyards to remain in operation and meet the future anticipated \ndemand for domestically produced ships. I encourage my colleagues to \nhelp maintain the commercial shipbuilding capacity of the United States \nthrough the inclusion of a loan guarantee program.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to have filed an amendment \nthat would give Alaska Native corporations, ANCs, parity for an \nimportant tax incentive encouraging the permanent protection of land \nthrough the charitable donation of a conservation easement.\n  America's wildlife, waters, and land are an invaluable part of our \nNation's heritage. It is imperative to preserve these natural treasures \nfor future generations. Congress long ago concluded that it was good \npublic policy to encourage the charitable contribution of conservation \neasements to organizations dedicated to maintaining natural habitats or \nopen spaces help protect the Nation's heritage. A conservation easement \ncreates a legally enforceable land preservation agreement between a \nwilling landowner and another organization. The purpose of a \nconservation easement is to protect permanently land from certain forms \nof development or use. The property that is the subject to the easement \nremains the private property of the landowner. The organization holding \nthe easement must monitor future uses of the land to ensure compliance \nwith the terms of the easement and to enforce the terms if a violation \noccurs.\n  In 2006, Congress enhanced the charitable tax deduction for \nconservation easements in order to encourage such gifts. With the 2006 \nlegislation, Congress temporarily increased the maximum deduction limit \nfor individuals donating qualified conservation easements from 30 \npercent to 50 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Congress \nalso created an exception for qualified farmers or ranchers, which are \nnonpublicly traded corporations or individuals whose gross income from \nthe trade or business of farming is greater than 50 percent of the \ntaxpayer's gross income. In the case of a qualified farmer or rancher, \nthe limitation increased from 30 percent to 100 percent. The 2008 farm \nbill extended the temporary rules for 2 additional years to charitable \ncontributions made before December 31, 2009.\n  Unfortunately, the way the law was crafted has disadvantaged a number \nof important landowners in my home State. Alaska Native corporations, \nANCs, own nearly 90 percent of the private land in Alaska, including \nsome of the most scenic and resource rich. However, although they are \nvery similar to the small communal family farms that are eligible, \nsubsistence-based Alaskan Native communities are ineligible for these \nimportant new tax incentives. For thousands of years, Alaska has been \nhome to Native communities, whose rich heritages, languages, and \ntraditions have thrived in the region's unique landscape. Members of \nAlaska Native communities continue to have a deeply symbiotic \nrelationship with the land even today. Much like their ancestors, many \nNative Alaskan communities engage in traditional subsistence \nactivities, with nearly 70 percent of their food coming from the land \nor adjacent waters. For many communities, subsistence is an economic \nnecessity considering both the lack of economic development and the \ncost and difficulty involved in purchasing food. For example, in \nKotzebue a community in northwestern Alaska, milk costs nearly $10 per \ngallon. In Buckland, a village home to approximately 400 people, a \npound of hamburger--when it is actually available--costs $14.\n  In Alaska, the Native corporations have an important role to be \nstewards of the land. Their shareholders see themselves as the \ncaretakers of the land and water as their ancestors have for thousands \nof years. Nonetheless, in Alaska today this means they have to balance \nthe need for resource development and the need to cultivate the land \nfor subsistence activities. The traditional lifestyles of Native \nAlaskans are under increasing stress from outside influences. \nPopulation growth and the pressure to pursue cash-generating activities \nhave increased the desire for substantial development, significantly \nadding to the ecological stress on already fragile ecosystems. Without \npermanent protection, their lands could be developed in a manner that \nwould destroy its ability to support the traditional ways and \nsubsistence lifestyles crucial to Alaskan Native communities. Making \nuse of tax incentives available to other Americans will make it easier \nfor Native communities to make the right decisions for their \nshareholders.\n  Today, Alaska Native communities are not eligible for the 50 percent \ndeduction available to individuals because they are federally chartered \nas C corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of \n1971, ANCSA. This leaves Alaska Natives without the ability to convert \nto an eligible entity as other landowners can. In addition, most Alaska \nNative corporations do not have sufficient gross income from the trade \nor business of what is considered traditional farming to be eligible \nfor the 100 percent deduction available to qualified farmers or \nranchers. This is in spite of the fact that as a group the Alaska \nNative shareholders of Alaska Native corporations receive far more in \nsubsistence benefits than they receive in income from the Alaska Native \nCorporation. As a result, Alaska Native corporations do not have the \nsame ability to offset the cost to permanently protect their \nproperties, which contain important wildlife, fish, and other habitats, \nthrough donations of qualified conservation easements.\n  This amendment will allow Alaska Native corporations to protect these \nimportant wildlife habitats, many used for subsistence, by providing an \nenhanced deduction for qualified conservation easements. The amendment \nmodifies section 170(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code by creating a \nnew subsection that provides Alaska Native corporations with a \ndeduction for donations of certain qualified conservation easements. In \norder to be eligible, a qualified charitable conservation contribution \nmust: (1) otherwise qualify under section 170(h)(1); (2) be made by a \nNative corporation; and (3) be land that was conveyed by ANCSA. The \ncorporations would be limited to 10 percent of their land allotment \nunder ANCSA. Under section 170(b)(2)(iii)(I), ``Native Corporation'' is \ndefined by ANCSA, section 3(m). Under section 170(b)(2)(i), the maximum \ndeduction limit would be set at 100 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted \ngross income. If the taxpayer has deductions in excess of the \napplicable percentage-of-income limitation, section 170(b)(2)(ii) would \nallow the taxpayer to carry-forward the deduction for up to 15 years.\n  Congress must act to assist Alaska Native communities in permanently \nprotecting their culturally, historically, and ecologically significant \nland, preserving the communities and their rich traditions in the \nprocess. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/03/senate-section/article/S1013-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I rise in commemoration of the life of John \nPatrick Murtha.\n  John Murtha gave nearly six decades to the country he loved. At the \nage of 20, he left college to join the Marines. As soon as he arrived, \nthe Marines knew they had a gem of a young man on their hands. Routed \nto Officer Candidate School, he became a leader of\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\nhis peers, earning the American Spirit Honor Medal during training.\n  Although his duty to the Marines ended in 1955, his desire to serve \ndid not. He remained in the Reserves for the next decade, and then \nvolunteered for service in Vietnam.\n  There, he cemented his reputation as an American hero, earning the \nBronze Star, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, and two Purple Hearts.\n  John's service in the Reserves lasted long into his political career. \nHe didn't retire until 1990, at which time he was awarded the Navy \nDistinguished Service Medal. But when he returned from Vietnam, he \ndecided that serving the people of the State of Pennsylvania was \nanother way to give back to his country.\n  He came to Congress roughly a year before I did, the first Democrat \nto hold that seat since World War II. As long as I have been here, it \nseems like John has been as much of a fixture in the House Chamber as \nthe desks themselves.\n  John being a marine, it is probably not surprising that he never \nstopped fighting to give our troops in the field the resources they \nneeded to do their jobs. He became the chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and was a reliable advocate for our \nmilitary--and for the people of his district.\n  His deep passion for our military and his commitment to making sure \nthey had the resources they need reached as far as Connecticut, where \nwe make the finest submarines and aircraft in the world. He knew that \nthe products we make there are critical to the success of our military, \nand he was always there alongside me, standing up for our defense \nworkforce and the fine products they make.\n  Many of us will remember with great admiration the courage John \nshowed when he came to the floor in November 2005 to call for an end to \na war he had supported. Colleagues on both sides knew that John Murtha \nwould never make a statement like that lightly, and his bold stance \nplayed a large role in bringing towards an end that misguided war.\n  Of course, most Americans never got to know John Murtha's soft side. \nBut his beloved wife Joyce--they were married for 55 years--and his \nthree wonderful children knew him as his colleagues did: as a funny, \nwarm man who loved his job, loved his constituents, and loved his \ncountry.\n  A colleague of his, Congressman Bob Brady, said, ``There will never \nbe another Jack Murtha.'' And he is right. But we can all carry on his \nwork, impressed by his long record of service and inspired by his deep \npatriotism and commitment.\n  I was proud to know John Murtha, and we were all lucky to have him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/03/senate-section/article/S1014-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Private First Class Zachary Lovejoy\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, in the almost 9 years our \nNation has been at war in Afghanistan, thousands of men and women have \nvolunteered for service in defense of our country and the freedoms we \nhold so dear. These brave men and women sacrifice time with their \nfamilies, with their wives and husbands and children and friends. They \nput their own safety on the line to protect the safety of others--to \nprotect the safety of all who call the United States home. Tragically, \nsome of these men and women make the ultimate--sacrifice giving their \nlives for a country and a people they love.\n  PFC Zachary Lovejoy was one of those brave soldiers. He was 20 years \nold when he died February 2, while serving in Zabul Province. His \nvehicle was struck by a roadside bomb. Private First Class Lovejoy \nspent the last day of his life doing what he loved. While his life may \nhave ended too soon, his legacy will live on though the people who \nloved him, and through all of us who owe him our own lives and safety \nand freedom.\n  That is why today, I honor Zachary Lovejoy by telling the people of \nAmerica about a young man who--from early in life--loved his country \nand dreamed of being a soldier.\n  Private First Class Lovejoy was born in Indiana but moved to my home \nState of New Mexico when he was three. He grew up in Albuquerque, the \nbeloved son of Terry and Mike Lovejoy, and brother to Ashley. He was an \nactive teen who loved football and wrestling and camping and skiing. He \nwas an enthusiastic member of his school's ROTC program. Private First \nClass Lovejoy was a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, whose fun-loving \nattitude and zest for life was contagious, according to his family.\n  Even before he graduated from La Cueva High School, Private First \nClass Lovejoy knew what he wanted to do with his life. He enlisted in \nthe Army during his senior year in high school and began basic training \nin August 2008. Private First Class Lovejoy was assigned to the 1st \nBattalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, \n82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, NC. He received his first \ndeployment to Afghanistan in August 2009.\n  Private First Class Lovejoy's dedication to our country and its \nideals made his family, his community, and everyone who knew him proud. \nUpon hearing of his death, the people of New Mexico--especially those \nwho knew Lovejoy from high school--were shocked and saddened. They \nturned out in droves to leave messages for his family in a special \nmemory book. And it is those messages that offer an intimate view of \nthe legacy Private First Class Lovejoy leaves behind.\n  ``You had such a big and amazing heart,'' one person wrote.\n  ``You put an incredible amount of living in your all too short \nlife,'' said another.\n  ``It is an honor to have been a part of a true hero's life,'' wrote a \nthird.\n  But there was one message that I believe sums up Private First Class \nLovejoy's life best: ``Your last name described you so perfectly. You \nloved all your friends deeply, and spread joy around every place you \nwent.''\n  To Private First Class Lovejoy's parents and sister and grandparents \nand fiancee Kaitlin, I offer my deepest sympathies for your loss, and \nmy deepest thanks for your loved one's service to our country. You are \nforever in our hearts, and we are forever in your debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/03/senate-section/article/S1014-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1014-S1015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  49TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise to celebrate service--\nspecifically the dedication of Americans volunteering in the Peace \nCorps, which this week marks its 49th year of connecting committed \nvolunteers with meaningful work around the globe.\n  There are a lot of ways to give of ourselves. We donate food. We \ndonate money. We donate time. But the Peace Corps takes community \nservice--global service, really to another level, with volunteers \ncommitting 27 months to improve the quality of life in developing \ncountries.\n  Some projects focus on agriculture; others business. Some improve \nhealth, while others emphasize education or the environment, but all \nprograms build a unique international relationship with a spirit of \nvolunteer service at its core.\n  As Chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, I recently saw one \nprogram up close during a congressional delegation I led to Morocco, \nwhich is an active Mediterranean partner country in the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n  Meetings with local government officials there were informative. And \nthe briefings from the embassy staff were important. But the time we \nspent with a Peace Corps volunteer in rural Aitourir was nothing short \nof inspiring.\n  The Youth Development Program there run by Peace Corps volunteer Kate \nTsunoda, with help from local community volunteers, is giving children \nfrom kindergarten through high school critical education, language, and \nart skills.\n  Inside a small community center, below a library still in need of \ndictionaries and elementary schoolbooks, we sat down with a group of \nyoung men, some in college, some recently graduated. In a part of the \nworld where unemployment tops 15 percent, these are the people one may \nsee as most susceptible to recruitment by extremists, but not these \nmen. They spoke of dreams that included higher education, better jobs, \nand a transforming of their local towns.\n  These men credit the Peace Corps program for empowering them and \nbuilding their language skills. I credit the Peace Corps for something \neven greater--forging international understanding, something the Peace \nCorps\n\n[[Page S1015]]\n\nhas excelled at now for 49 years in 139 countries through 7,671 \nvolunteers.\n  On the other side of town, several members of our delegation visited \na start-up small business, the brainchild of retiree and Peace Corps \nvolunteer Barbara Eberhart, whose second career is dedicated to \nempowering the women of Morocco.\n  The group visited a fabric and embroidery shop developed by a \ncommunity of Berber women aided by a microcredit loan and Barbara's \nguidance and unbounded energy. These women, unable to read or write and \nessentially marginalized in Moroccan society, have formed a cooperative \nwhere they create fine embroidered goods and sell them in local \nmarkets. Their small business not only provides desperately needed \nincome, but gives these women a stronger sense of themselves, their \ncommunity and hope for their future and that of their children.\n  With Peace Corps volunteers coming from all backgrounds, ages and \nvarious stages of life, this program is as diverse as our country. The \nlocal citizen collaboration inherent in all Peace Corps work helps \nbuild enduring relationships between the United States and Peace Corps \npartner countries.\n  The Peace Corps invests time and talent in other countries, but it \npays dividends back here in the United States as well. Those who are \ntaught or helped by Peace Corps volunteers are likely to have more \nfavorable opinions of the United States. More than that, many of the \nvolunteers themselves are inspired to public service upon their return \nto this country, some becoming Governors and Members of Congress, \nincluding our own colleague and fellow Helsinki Commissioner, Senator \nDodd of Connecticut.\n  I left Aitourir thinking Kate was the exemplary Peace Corps volunteer \nwith her welcoming smile, passion for service and genuine love for the \nMoroccan people. But aware of the success of so many other Peace Corps \nprograms around the world, I know Kate is one of many volunteers--all \nof whom would have left as great an impression.\n  The Peace Corps is a program that works. Volunteers year in and year \nout continue to fulfill the Peace Corps mission of bringing training \nand education to interested countries and strengthening understanding \nbetween Americans and our neighbors in the global community. \nCongratulations to the Peace Corps for 49 remarkable years. I look \nforward to its continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/03/senate-section/article/S1015-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING VISTA ON ITS 45TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to speak on a resolution I have \ncosigned celebrating Volunteers In Service To America, or VISTA, on its \n45th anniversary and recognizing its contribution to the fight against \npoverty.\n  This resolution will demonstrate the great appreciation this country \nhas for its volunteers, specifically honoring the 45th anniversary of \nthe VISTA Program.\n  Last year nearly 50 VISTA volunteers provided service in Alaska. \nThese citizens are vital to fighting poverty in our State. The success \nof this program is evident in the programs it has left behind such as \nHead Start, job training plans, and credit unions. From its beginnings \nin 1965 to today, VISTA has dedicated hard work, time, and innovation \nto lift Americans all over the country out of poverty.\n  While the mission to fight against poverty has a long history, VISTA \nhas continued to adapt to various localities and challenges to provide \nnew and inspired solutions. Alaska boasts many past and present VISTA \nvolunteers. Many of them have become prominent in Alaska's public and \nprivate sectors.\n  In Alaska, John Shively came to the state with VISTA from New York \nState with the intention of staying for 1 year. He became involved in \nlocal government in Alaska and was involved in the Native lands \nsettlements of early statehood. He later became the commissioner of the \nAlaska Department of Natural Resources, overseeing more than 80 million \nacres of State land. He has also been a regent for the University of \nAlaska, and the Alaska State Chamber of Commerce was proud to award \nJohn Shively the title ``Outstanding Alaskan of the Year'' in 2009.\n  Willie Hensley is an Alaska Native and one of the many successful \nresidents of Alaska. He was a VISTA volunteer and went on to serve in \nthe Alaska State Legislature. He founded the NANA Native Corporation \nafter working hard to ensure equitable settlement of Alaska Native land \nclaims. He is one of the founding members of the Alaska Federation of \nNatives and is a well known author.\n  John Shively and Willie Hensley are just two examples of the \nthousands of VISTA volunteers who have served Alaska and her people. \nVISTA is a program serving all Americans with the focus on lifting poor \nAmericans out of poverty so their futures can be as bright as the \nnorthern lights. VISTA's 45 years of service to the country has made a \ndifference in so many lives, in Alaska and across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/03/senate-section/article/S1015-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SYLVIA PROTHRO HEBERT\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize my \nconstituent, Sylvia Prothro Hebert, who has been selected as a 2009 \nGreat Comebacks Recipient for the West Region. This program honors \nindividuals who are living with intestinal diseases or recovering from \nostomy surgeries, procedures that reconstruct bowel and bladder \nfunction through the use of a specially fitted medical prosthesis. \nSylvia is one of over 700,000 Americans, from young children to senior \ncitizens, who have an ostomy. The Great Comeback Awards celebrate the \nspirit and courage with which a patient embraces life after ostomy \nsurgery. Sylvia and the other Great Comebacks Awardees are Americans \nwho live life to the fullest despite the daily challenges presented by \ntheir respective conditions.\n  At age 9, Sylvia was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. She managed her \nsymptoms with medication, but experienced constant flare-ups during \ncollege. At age 21, her intestines were punctured during a colonoscopy \nand she underwent ostomy surgery. Following this surgery, Sylvia was \nemotionally distraught; however, she entered counseling and learned how \nto cope with her stoma. Sylvia has since triumphed over her illness, \nand achieved her dream of becoming a flight attendant. By her records, \nshe's the first Delta SkyTeam flight attendant with an ileostomy. \nAdditionally, Sylvia joined the Delta Ski and Snowboard team and has \nearned ribbons in many competitions. Sylvia has also completed two \nhalf-marathons and a triathlon.\n  Today, Sylvia lives in Park City, UT, with her husband Paul and their \nchildren, Reese, Garrett, and Renee. I commend Sylvia and the other \nGreat Comebacks Regional Award Recipients. Their personal stories are \ninspirational and will raise awareness about the great comebacks being \nmade by those living with intestinal diseases or recovering from ostomy \nsurgery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/03/senate-section/article/S1015-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1015-S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HARRY AGGANIS\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there is a mid-winter tradition \nthroughout New England and across my home State of Maine--talking \nbaseball. Not just any baseball, of course, but Boston Red Sox \nbaseball.\n  These discussions, whether they take place around the kitchen wood \nstove or the office water cooler, range from the team's storied history \nto the prospects for the upcoming season. The heroes of the past, \nYastrzemski, Williams, and so many more, are recalled, as are the more \nrecent stars, such as Schilling and Ramirez.\n  At times, fans reminisce about a young man who, although his career \nwas cut tragically short, continues to inspire through his athleticism, \ncompetitive spirit, and generosity. His name was Aristotle George \nAgganis. His friends called him Harry. He will always be remembered as \nthe Golden Greek.\n  Harry Agganis was born in Lynn, MA, in 1929. Although he is known as \na baseball player, he first made his mark in football as a star \nquarterback for Boston University. As a sophomore in 1949 he set a \nschool record for touchdown passes. He left school in 1950 to enlist in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps.\n  When he completed his service to our nation, he returned to college, \nsetting a school record for passing yards, winning the Bulger Lowe \nAward as New\n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\nEngland's outstanding football player, and becoming Boston University's \nfirst All-American in football. Upon his graduation, he was offered a \nlucrative contract to play football for the Cleveland Browns but chose \ninstead to sign with the Red Sox so he could remain near his widowed \nmother.\n  Here are a few stories that illustrate the character of this young \nman and the esteem in which he is held.\n  While still a student in 1953, Harry Agganis was inducted into the \nnew Boston University Hall of Fame. He declined gifts of a car and \n$4,000 from his classmates and instead asked that the cash equivalent \nbe put toward establishing a scholarship for Greek-American students \nwith financial need.\n  On June 6, 1954, he homered at Fenway Park and scored the winning run \nas the Red Sox beat the Detroit Tigers. Following the game, he changed \ninto a cap and gown in the Sox clubhouse, ran down Commonwealth Avenue \nin time for the graduation ceremonies on the B.U. campus, and received \nhis bachelor's degree in education.\n  As the 1955 season opened, he was off to a good start, but on June 2 \nhe was hospitalized with pneumonia. He rejoined the team 10 days later \nbut fell ill again. He died on June 27 of a pulmonary embolism. Ten \nthousand mourners attended his wake.\n  His career was brief, but his name lives on. In 1956, a 1,000-seat \nbaseball facility, Harry Agganis Stadium, was dedicated in his honor at \nCamp Lejeune, NC, where he served. A memorial plaque placed at the \nfield reads, ``Endowed with peerless talent, Corporal Agganis \nexemplified the finest in competitive spirit and sportsmanship. An All-\nAmerican football player, and later a professional baseball player, his \noutstanding accomplishments in the field of athletics were an \ninspiration to other Marines who served and were teammates with him \nduring his career in the Marine Corps.''\n  He was inducted posthumously into the College Football Hall of Fame \nin 1974. In 1995, Gaffney Street in Boston was re-named Harry Agganis \nWay. In 2004, Agganis Arena was dedicated in his honor on the Boston \nUniversity campus.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize \nLatoya Lucas of Colorado Springs, who will be awarded today with the \n2009 Tony Snow Public Service Award. This distinction was created to \n``honor extraordinary individuals who are passionate about serving \ntheir country while dealing courageously with debilitating intestinal \ndiseases and ostomy surgery.''\n  In 2003, Latoya was a new mother and an Army specialist serving in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom when her humvee was attacked by rocket-\npropelled grenades. She thankfully survived the incident, but her \ninjuries resulted in a colostomy and 2 years of intensive \nrehabilitation. Latoya's brave service has been recognized by such \nhonors and distinctions as the Purple Heart Medal, the Meritorious \nService Medal, and the Soroptimist International Woman of Distinction \nAward. In 2005, she became the first female recipient of the Military \nOrder of the Purple Heart's Region V Patriot of the Year Award.\n  After her retirement from the Army, Latoya became a motivational \nspeaker and writer to share her remarkable story with others and \nencourage people to draw strength from their struggles. Latoya's book, \n``The Immeasurable Spirit: Lessons of a Wounded Warrior about Faith and \nPerseverance,'' received the Gold Medal Award from the Military Writers \nSociety of America. Additionally, Latoya is the chair of the Wounded \nWarrior Welcome Home Social. She has inspired so many others to draw \nstrength from adversity. As Latoya has said, ``There are so many \nsoldiers who come back home with injuries and untold numbers having \nostomy surgery. I answer questions they have and show them that they \ncan lead a full life with an ostomy.''\n  There are thousands of veterans and Active-Duty members who call \nColorado home, a fact that is a source of pride for me. Coloradans like \nLatoya are a testament to the bravery and strength of our veterans and \ntheir remarkable ability to deal with life-changing injuries. Latoya \nhas become a leader and a source of strength for fellow citizens who \nface similar injuries, and I want to thank her for her service to this \ncountry. I am proud to have this opportunity to share just some \nexamples of Latoya's bravery and achievements, and I congratulate her \nand the other Great Comebacks Award recipients.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/03/senate-section/article/S1016-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/03/senate-section/article/S1016-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/03/senate-section/article/S1016-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1016-S1017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3820.

A bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to provide for \nthorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Thorium \nEnergy Security Act of 2010 with my good friend and colleague Senator \nHarry Reid as an original cosponsor. Our legislation would establish a \nregulatory framework and a development program to facilitate the \nintroduction of thorium-based nuclear fuel in existing and future \nnuclear power plants in the U.S.\n  The U.S. is dependent on foreign sources for about 90 percent of its \nuranium fuel needs. However, the most recent U.S. Geological Survey \nThorium Mineral Commodity Survey confirms that the U.S. has the largest \nthorium deposits in the world.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of our Nation's nuclear power \nindustry, and I expect to see a long future for nuclear power in this \nnation. I believe that future is enhanced with the possibility of \nthorium nuclear power as new source of nuclear power in the future.\n  Thorium-based nuclear fuel will remain in the reactor about three \ntimes as long as conventional nuclear fuel, thereby cutting the volume \nof spent nuclear fuel coming out of reactors by as much as two-thirds. \nThorium nuclear fuel could also significantly reduce the possibility \nthat weapons grade material would result from the process. Finally, a \nthorium fuel cycle can be used as a very effective and efficient means \nfor disposing of existing plutonium stockpiles.\n  For these reasons, a number of governments throughout the world are \naggressively seeking to establish thorium nuclear power as an element \nof their power supply. These governments want the benefits of nuclear \npower, without the difficulties associated with large volumes of waste, \nmuch of which can be turned to weapons grade material. Our aim with \nthis legislation is to ensure that the U.S. does not fall behind the \nmovement. I hope my colleagues will take a look at the potential for \nthorium-based nuclear power.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 3061. A bill to amend part B of title IV of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to improve 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleague Senator \nEnsign, to introduce legislation that will provide children with safe, \nhealthy, and academically focused afterschool programs.\n  The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2010 is \nendorsed by the Afterschool Alliance, an organization representing more \nthan 25,000 public, private, and non-profit afterschool providers \ndedicated to expanding access to high quality afterschool programs, as \nwell as a broad coalition of other local and national organizations.\n  They, and I, have committed to providing quality afterschool care \nbecause the record is clear: students who regularly attend afterschool \nprograms have better grades and behavior in school, better peer \nrelations and emotional adjustment, and lower incidences of drug use, \nviolence, and pregnancy. When kids have something productive to do in \nthe hours between when they are let out of school and when their \nparents get home from work, they are more likely to avoid the traps of \nrisky behavior, more likely to be physically healthy and academically \nsuccessful, and more likely to fulfill their potential.\n  As co-chairs of the Afterschool Caucus, Senator Ensign and I have \nworked to expand awareness of these benefits by organizing annual \nbriefings, sharing research, and advocating fiercely for a focus on \nafterschool care when we talk about how to give our kids the best \nopportunities possible.\n  While we know that afterschool care works, the truth is that too many\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\nAmerican kids don't have access to good programs. More than 15 million \nchildren--from kindergarten through 12th grade--spend time unsupervised \nin the hours after school. That includes an incredible 40,000 \nkindergartners and nearly 4 million middle school students in grades \nsix to eight.\n  When the bell rings and the school day ends, these kids face some 3 \nhours of unscheduled, often unsupervised time before their parents get \nhome from work. Those are rarely productive hours, and, worse, those \nare the hours during which these children are most likely to experiment \nwith risky behaviors.\n  We can do better for our kids.\n  The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2010 has \nthree goals. First, to enhance the quality and sustainability of \nafterschool programs. Second, to emphasize physical fitness and \nwellness programs as part of our nationwide effort to reduce childhood \nobesity, and third, to encourage service learning.\n  Our legislation provides States with tools designed to keep quality \nprograms going. It would allow program grantees the ability to renew \ntheir grants if they can show that the programs are working. It gives \nstates the option to expand technical assistance functions to improve \nthe quality of afterschool programs.\n  Our legislation will increase opportunities for young Americans to be \nmore physically active. The administration has put a focus on reducing \nobesity--one of the easiest medical conditions to recognize, but one of \nthe most difficult to treat--among our children. Obesity costs our \nsociety as much as $147 billion each year--and the best way to stop it \nis to encourage our kids to be more active. Afterschool programs offer \na tremendous opportunity to do just that, and our legislation includes \nsuch wellness efforts in the list of programs that can receive support.\n  Our legislation encourages kids to get involved in service learning \nand youth development activities. Service learning integrates student-\ndesigned service projects with academic studies. This type of program \nhas been shown to strengthen student engagement, enhance student \nachievement, lower drop-out and suspension rates, develop workforce and \nleadership skills, and provide opportunities for teamwork.\n  Of course, as we offer this legislation, I must also remind my \ncolleagues that afterschool programs only work with sufficient funding. \nIn a difficult economy, it is even more important to focus on \nempowering these programs. Studies have shown that afterschool care can \nreduce worker absenteeism by as much as 30 percent and reduce worker \nturnover by up to 60 percent. Decreased worker productivity related to \nparental concerns about afterschool care costs our economy up to $300 \nbillion each year. Approximately 1 in 10 children is currently enrolled \nin afterschool care. However, 2/3 of parents with children who do not \nparticipate in a program would enroll their children in afterschool if \nthey had that option. We should work to give them that option.\n  The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act is a \npositive step towards offering all of our children the chance to spend \ntheir afternoons safely and productively. It is a step towards making \ngood on the most important promise: the one we make to our kids. I hope \nthat my colleagues will join me in support of this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Begich, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 3063. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nloans to certain organizations in certain States to address habitats \nand ecosystems and to address and prevent invasive species; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation that will protect the unique ecosystems of the American \nWest from the harmful effects of invasive, non-native species. I am \njoined by my cosponsors Senators Begich, Bennet of Colorado, Bennett of \nUtah, Feinstein, Merkley, Murkowski, and Wyden.\n  The Invasive Species Emergency Response Fund provides resources to \nprevent the introduction and spread of harmful invasive species; \nprotect susceptible habitats; and establish early detection and rapid \nresponse capabilities to combat incipient invasive species populations.\n  As global climate change patterns shift, particular habitats in the \nWest will be especially vulnerable to the impacts of new species \nintroductions. Hence, the new paradigms in invasive species management \nprovided via this legislation are critically needed. When it comes to \ninvasive species management, history is replete with examples \nillustrating the adage that ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound \nof cure.''\n  The impact of invasive species in the U.S. is now widespread. More \nthan 6,500 non-native, invasive species have become established \npopulations throughout the U.S. Studies show that the damage caused by \nthese pests and their associated control costs total more than $100 \nbillion annually. The unique ecologies of the West are particularly \nvulnerable to their harmful effects.\n  My home State of Nevada is at the center of this ecological storm. \nNon-native species decrease rangeland capacity; lower water tables; \nreduce water quality; increase fuel loads; and displace native plants \nand wildlife habitats. Some in the environmental community have \nidentified the Great Basin as the third most endangered ecosystem in \nthe U.S. due, in part, to the dominance of invasive species.\n  Moreover, once invasive species have gained a foothold in Western \nStates, they exacerbate other critical issues, including water quantity \nand quality, and wildfire. Zebra mussels in Lake Mead are poised to \nwreak havoc on the lake's water quality. Tamarisk's long tap roots \ninfiltrate deep water tables, exploiting up to 200 gallons of water per \ntree per day. Millions of acres of cheatgrass and beetle-killed trees \nstand ready to burn if sparked. In fact, the fire cycle in the Great \nBasin has shortened from 25-50 years to only 3-5 years as a direct \nresult of the take-over of invasive weeds.\n  These few examples underscore the need for this long overdue \nlegislation. State and local agencies and organizations that fight \ninvasive species need access to resources when a new threat is \nidentified, not when funds are available based on bureaucratic budget \ncycle.\n  The revolving loan program established with this bill will provide \nqualified organizations with the resources they need to tackle invasive \nspecies threats within 90 days. The Secretary of the Interior will \nensure that these funds are being used for appropriate projects based \non vetted review criteria.\n  Bark beetles, quagga mussels, and Medusahead have no respect for \nbudget cycles or State lines. Hence, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis critical legislation. It is paramount if we want to protect our \nunique Western landscape.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3063\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit for the production of energy from deep water offshore wind; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation that I am \nintroducing today, the Deepwater Wind Incentive Act, which will provide \na critical long-term renewable production tax credit for developing \ndeepwater wind facilities in the U.S.\n  Deepwater wind refers to a new offshore wind technology that utilizes \nadvanced floating technologies to remove restrictions on the depth of \nthe water and expand our offshore wind resource by nearly a magnitude \nof six. Last year, Popular Science named deepwater wind one of the \neight technologies that can revolutionize our energy paradigm. I am \npleased to have worked with Senators Carper and Collins, two longtime \nleaders on offshore wind development, on this proposal and look forward \nto discussing this bill with my Finance Committee colleagues.\n  Currently, there is a race to develop deepwater offshore wind \nfacilities that could eventually be placed throughout our world's \noceans and our Great Lakes. A Norwegian company is now moving forward \nwith deployment of the first deep-water offshore floating turbine, \nwhich will be located in more than 328 feet of water. The key point is \nthat if you can successfully develop a floating turbine at that depth \nit can be replicated throughout the world. Our competitors are \nrecognizing this opportunity and are aggressively pursuing this \ntechnology. In fact, earlier this year the European Union Industrial \nInitiative announced a roughly 6 billion euro plan to invest in next \ngeneration wind technologies, including deepwater wind, with a goal of \nsupplying 20 percent of its electricity through wind power.\n  Deepwater wind is a resource that provides a tremendous potential for \nour country and provides a more consistent resource than onshore and \nnear shore wind. Specifically, the U.S. has over 1500 gigawatts of \ndeepwater offshore wind generation within 50 nautical miles of the \ncoastline, and if our country can develop these deepwater technologies, \nwe will have the equivalent of 1500 medium sized nuclear power plants \navailable within a close proximity to the electricity demand of the \nU.S.\n  Accordingly, I have modeled this legislation after the current tax \ncredits available for nuclear power that exists in the tax code. \nSpecifically, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 provided a production tax \ncredit for the first 6,000 megawatts from advanced nuclear power. The \nDeepwater Wind Incentive Act, follows this template and provides a 50 \npercent bonus renewable production tax credit for advanced offshore \nwind facilities that are placed in service in more than 60 meters of \nwater. The credit is capped at the first 6,000 megawatts to provide an \nincentive for companies to expeditiously research and deploy this \ntechnology.\n  Time after time, the Department of Energy has indicated that wind can \nprovide a substantial amount of electricity in our country. The \nDepartment's ``20 percent Wind Energy by 2030,'' outlined the policy \nsteps that would move wind to be a major source of American power. In \nthe report, the DOE states that the wind industry ``has responded \npositively to policy incentives when they are in effect.'' This tax \npolicy provides a consistent and clear tax credit to achieve the 20 \npercent by 2030 that is considered in the report. I thank Senator \nCarper and Senator Collins for their assistance in crafting this \nlegislation and I look forward to working with them to enact this \nlegislation into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Udall of Colorado, \n        Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Burris, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Wyden, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Specter, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Franken, and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 3065. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the \nreadiness of the Armed Forces by replacing the current policy \nconcerning homosexuality in the Armed Forces, referred to as ``Don't \nAsk, Don't Tell'', with a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, we just had a press conference this \nafternoon with reference to don't ask, don't tell, the action we want \nto take in the Senate for our military people. I would like to make \nsome brief remarks in that regard.\n  I come to the floor today because I believe in a basic principle, not \njust a political cause. I come to the floor because courage and valor \nare blind to race, religion, philosophy, and sexual orientation. I \nbelieve every single man and woman who puts on a military uniform is \nequally deserving of our thanks and our respect, and that when we \ndismiss the sacrifices made by those with a different sexual \norientation, we undermine the strength of our fighting forces. When we \nfail to recognize the brave contributions gay and lesbian soldiers \ncontinue to make every single day, we diminish ourselves as much as we \ndiminish their service. That is why I am pleased to join the following \ncolleagues: Chairman Lieberman, Chairman Levin, Senator Gillibrand, \nSenator Udall of Colorado, and Senator Wyden in introducing legislation \nto repeal the military's don't ask, don't tell\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\npolicy, a policy which is discriminatory, outdated, and detrimental to \nour national security.\n  Let me start by addressing every service man and woman, to those who \nhave served in our Armed Forces in the past. Let's give them a big \nshout out and a big thank-you. This Nation honors the service and \nsacrifice of all our veterans and those who are still serving today. \nLet me say the days of serving in silence--those days are numbered. \nThis legislation will recognize that every soldier, sailor, airman, and \nmarine is equal to every other warrior, so no one will be forced to lie \nabout who they are if they wish to serve this country.\n  I know there are some who believe this is too big a change, that it \nis not right and we need to wait. To them I would say it boils down to \nbasic fairness. I remind them that the U.S. military has made policy \nchanges before and with resounding success. The repeal of don't ask, \ndon't tell is not just another vote for me, it is a very personal issue \nof basic fairness. When I was about 6 or 7 years old, I have a vivid \nmemory of my family members who went off to war, my uncles and uncles-\nin-law and great uncles who chose to go to war and defend our country, \nregardless of the color of their skin or occupation or who they were as \nan individual. That choice defined them as patriots.\n  I have never forgotten their patriotism or their commitment to this \ncountry. But I have also never forgotten that the U.S. military was \nvery different in those days. My family members volunteered to protect \nthis Nation, but simply because of who they were, they had limited \nopportunities to serve. For all their skill, their talent, their \nintelligence, and their valor, they were forced to choose among two or \nthree roles. They were forced to either be a cook or forced to dig \nditches or forced to drive trucks. The only thing that separated my \nuncles from their brothers in arms was the color of their skin. But in \nthose days, some people argued that racial integration would undermine \nthe cohesion of our fighting forces. Yet the U.S. military came to \nrecognize this was not the case and successive generations proved that \neveryone who volunteered to serve was capable of the same patriotism, \nbravery, and heroism.\n  That memory is especially crisp as I stand in this Chamber to bring \nan end to this discriminatory policy that forces our best and brightest \nto be willing to die for our Nation, while denying they are who they \ntruly are. This, too, is an issue of basic fairness.\n  More than 60 years ago, President Truman recognized the wisdom of \nintegrating the Armed Forces. He understood that in so doing, the Armed \nForces grew stronger and the Nation safer. Today we recognize it is \ntime to end don't ask, don't tell. This repeal of don't ask, don't tell \nwill allow our servicemembers to live their lives openly, honestly, and \nstill fight for the country we all love. So, regardless of sexual \norientation or race or any other factor, today we stand to say we are \ngrateful to the brave patriots who chose to defend our Nation and we \nsalute them.\n  This is about fairness. This is about more than right versus left or \nRepublican versus Democrat. This is about fighting for those who fight \nfor us every day. Ending this policy is the fair thing to do, it is the \nright thing to do, and it is long overdue.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to state my strong support for \nthe Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2010, which would repeal the \n``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy in our Armed Forces.\n  I am one who believes that the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy has \ndone more harm than good. The policy has forced American citizens to \nchoose between serving their country and being honest about who they \nare; and, even worse, it has led to the discharge of some 13,000 brave \nmen and women because their sexual orientation was discovered.\n  The criteria for serving in our Armed Forces should be competence, \ncourage, and a willingness to serve; not race, gender, or sexual \norientation.\n  The Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2010 would finally repeal \n``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' and create a policy of nondiscrimination in \nthe military. That is the right thing to do, and I will support this \nlegislation every step of the way.\n  The Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2010 would repeal the 1993 \n``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy; allow people who were removed under \n``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' to re-enter the military; establish a policy \nof nondiscrimination in the Armed Forces to prevent discrimination on \nthe basis of sexual orientation; and require a Pentagon working group \nestablished by the Department of Defense to issue recommendations on \nhow to implement repeal throughout the military.\n  The bill would also require the Secretary of Defense to report to \nCongress 180 days after enactment on what actions are being taken to \nensure that any school that does not allow a ROTC unit on its campus \ndoes not receive Federal funds.\n  It is important for people to realize that ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' \nis not an abstract policy. This policy has had real and harmful effects \non our military readiness by denying able and willing men and women the \nopportunity to serve, and by requiring the discharge of brave \nindividuals who have served courageously and even risked their lives \nfor their country.\n  Let me give you just a few of the thousands of examples:\n  Anthony Woods, of Fairfield, CA, graduated from the U.S. Military \nAcademy at West Point and went on to serve two tours of duty in Iraq, \nincluding in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He earned the Bronze Star and \nArmy Commendation Medal, and all 81 soldiers who served under his \nleadership in Iraq returned home safely to the United States. Mr. Woods \nwas discharged from the U.S. Army in 2008 because of ``Don't Ask, Don't \nTell.''\n  MAJ Margaret Witt joined the U.S. Air Force in 1987 and served as a \nflight nurse for 18 years. She received numerous awards, including the \nMeritorious Service Metal, Air Medal, and the Air Force Commendation \nMedal. In 2003, President Bush noted in citation that her ``airmanship \nand courage directly contributed to the successful accomplishment of \nimportant missions under extremely hazardous conditions.'' Major Witt \nwas discharged 6 years ago after the Air Force received a tip that she \nwas gay. Major Witt has challenged her case in court because, as she \nsays, ``I joined the Air Force because I wanted to serve my country. I \nhave loved being in the military--my fellow airmen have been my family. \nI am proud of my career and want to continue doing my job. Wounded \npeople never asked me about my sexual orientation. They were just glad \nto see me there.'' The case is currently pending before the Ninth U.S. \nCircuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, CA.\n  LT Daniel Choi, originally from Orange County, CA, also graduated \nfrom the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He is an Arabic linguist \nand served as an infantry officer in Iraq in 2006 and 2007, but he was \nrecommended for discharge from the U.S. Army after announcing last year \nthat he was gay. Lieutenant Choi has said that: ``The lessons of \ncourage, integrity, honesty and selfless service are some of the most \nimportant. . . . I refuse to lie to my commanders. I refuse to lie to \nmy peers. I refuse to lie to my subordinates. I demand honesty and \ncourage from my soldiers. They should demand the same from me.'' The \nNew York National Guard has recently indicated that they will allow \nLieutenant Choi to begin participating in drills with the unit again. \nLTC Paul Fanning, a spokesperson for the New York Guard, has stated: \n``We do not have an issue with it. It's a deeply personal thing. To us \na soldier is a soldier is a soldier.''\n  Veteran U.S. Marine Bob Lehman, of San Diego, CA, served in the gulf \nwar in the 1990s and was never dismissed for being gay. He has \nexplained that, ``Nobody in my unit knew artillery better than I did, \nincluding the officers. During combat, the gay thing didn't even exist. \nMy biggest fear was bringing my guys home alive.'' However, Mr. Lehman \nhas said he believes that the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy forces \nU.S. soldiers into a moral dilemma. ``Marines don't lie, cheat or \nsteal. It was hard to lie . . . There was a lot of denial and \ndepression because of the inability to be out openly, (the fear) that I \nmight get fired.''\n  Courageous men and women like these should be applauded for their \nservice, not discharged for their sexual\n\n[[Page S1024]]\n\norientation. The Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2010 would \nensure that is the case and would require the military to readmit \nanyone who was discharged solely because of their sexual orientation \nand is otherwise willing and able to serve.\n  The ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy has long been a contentious one, \nand I do not state my support for repeal lightly.\n  It is absolutely essential that we undertake this project with great \ncare, so that repeal of the policy will enhance military readiness and \nthe effect will be positive for all of our servicemembers in the field.\n  I am confident that we are up to the task of doing so.\n  In the last few months alone, high ranking officials from various \ncomponents of the military have come forward to say that repeal is not \nonly feasible, it is the right thing to do. For example:\n  ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee that, ``Speaking for myself \nand myself only, it is my personal belief that allowing gays and \nlesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do. No matter how \nI look at the issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we \nhave in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about \nwho they are in order to defend their fellow citizens.''\n  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified at the same hearing that, \n``I fully support the president's decision. The question before us is \nnot whether the military prepares to make this change, but how we best \nprepare for it.''\n  Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus has said, ``I support the repeal of \n``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'' I do think the President has come up with a \nvery practical and workable way to do that to work through the working \ngroup that the Secretary of Defense has set up, to make sure that we \nimplement any change in the law that Congress makes in a very \nprofessional and very smooth manner, and without any negative impacts \non the force.''\n  Retired General Colin Powell issued an official statement expressing \nthat ``In the almost 17 years since the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' \nlegislation was passed, attitudes and circumstances have changed. I \nfully support the new approach presented to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee this week by Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen.''\n  These military leaders believe repeal is not only feasible, it is \nright. According to the University of California, military leaders in \nmany other countries agree. Twenty-five countries currently have \npolicies allowing gay servicemembers to serve openly in their \nmilitaries, including 15 NATO countries, Australia and Israel.\n  This year, Secretary Gates has appointed a Pentagon working group to \nstudy in great detail how repeal can be implemented in a manner that \nwill enhance the readiness and effectiveness of our troops. This group, \nled by Army General Carter Ham and Pentagon General Counsel Jeh \nJohnson, is tasked with engaging troops and their families at all \nlevels of the Armed Forces to determine what changes will be necessary \nin regulations, in education and training practices, and in military \npolicy to implement a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation in our Armed Forces. The study will be careful, and \nthe review will be comprehensive.\n  The time has come to repeal ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'' I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the Military Readiness Enhancement \nAct of 2010. I am confident that our military will be stronger and \nbetter when this bill becomes law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 3068. A bill to reauthorize the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration Human Space Flight Activities, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nthat is intended to chart what I believe to be the proper course for \nthe future of the nation's human space flight programs. This bill would \nprovide an alternative to the Administration's proposed course of \nending the government role in Human Space Flight and avoid the complete \nreliance on other nations or an as-yet-unproven commercial capability \nto launch American astronauts and scientists into space. It would also \nreaffirm the goals of moving beyond low-earth orbit and restore the \nkind of exciting vision that will help inspire young people to excel in \nScience, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. The bill echoes the \ndecision of the Obama administration to support the International Space \nStation, ISS, through at least the year 2020, as we endorsed in our \nNASA Authorization Act, passed in 2008. But the administration's \nproposal does nothing to ensure that we can fully maintain and utilize \nthe space station, especially during the next 5 years. This bill would \ncorrect that, and ensure that full use of the space station is not an \nempty promise.\n  Since the release of the fiscal year 2010 Budget last year, the \nfuture of human space flight programs has been in question. As part of \nthat Budget Request, the administration announced it would establish an \nindependent review panel, chaired by my good friend Mr. Norman \nAugustine, to review U.S. Human Space Flight Plans and provide options \nfor how those programs should proceed in the future.\n  The Augustine Panel completed its review in late August of last year, \nand provided its Summary Report to NASA, the White House, and the \nCongress on September 8, 2009. Shortly thereafter, the Subcommittee on \nScience and Space of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation held a hearing on the report with Mr. Augustine \nappearing as our witness. The Augustine Panel released its full report \nat the end of September, and we have all been awaiting the response of \nthe Obama administration to the report.\n  When the fiscal year 2010 Budget was submitted in 2009, the budget \nrequest for Exploration Systems included a notation that the amount \nrequested was a ``placeholder'' number, and that, once the Human Space \nFlight Plans Review Committee completed its work, the Administration \nwould submit an amended budget request to support the programmatic \ndecisions made as a result of that report. That never happened. \nInstead, the response to the Augustine Panel Report was left to the \nfiscal year 2011 Budget request, which we received on February 1st. \nBecause of the administration's failure to offer a budgetary blueprint \nuntil the fiscal year 2011 budget, we will now experience yet another \nyear's delay in undertaking the steps necessary to advance beyond the \nuncertainty about the future of human space flight programs that \nprompted the review.\n  The Augustine Panel provided five basic options for consideration, \nwith an additional two options that were modifications of these five \nbasic options. The Augustine Panel thus provided a total of seven \napproaches that could be taken to ensure America's continued leadership \nin space--to establish a space program ``worthy of a great nation,'' as \nsuggested by the title of their final report. None of those options \nleapt out as the obvious, consensus answer to the mix of vehicle \ndevelopment options and strategies necessary to meet the challenges of \nthe next generation of human space flight. There was, however, a clear \nconsensus on two important points.\n  First, the Panel found that, without a significant increase in the \ntotal amount of funding made available to NASA, none of the options \npresented could be expected to succeed--including the current plans and \nprograms for developing the Ares 1 and Ares V launch vehicles and the \nOrion Crew Exploration Vehicle. The Panel's conclusion underscored what \nwe in the authorizing committees have been saying for the past five \nyears, and which formed the basis for the funding levels that we \nauthorized in both our 2005 and 2008 NASA Authorization Acts, which \nwould have led to a more timely and successful level of development for \nthe vehicles to replace the space shuttle systems. The Bush \nadministration, however, simply never requested that level of funding. \nIn fact, the prior Administration even reduced the level of funding for \nthose programs that had been projected in the run-out estimates \nincluded in the fiscal year 2005 Budget Request, which initiated the \n``Vision for Exploration'' announced by President Bush on January 14, \n2004.\n\n[[Page S1025]]\n\n  Second, the Panel recommended that a decision be made to formally \nextend U.S. plans to operate and utilize the ISS through at least the \nyear 2020. This was also consistent with guidance the authorizing \ncommittees provided in the 2008 NASA Authorization Act, where we \ndirected NASA to take no steps to preclude operations of ISS through at \nleast 2020, and directed the Agency to provide a plan which would \noutline how they would prepare to support and utilize the space station \nfor that extended period of time. Up to that point, NASA's internal \nplanning--and budget guidance from the Office of Management and \nBudget--was to cease operations aboard the space station in 2015, just \nfive years after its assembly and outfitting would finally be completed \nby the remaining space shuttle flights.\n  Some of the good news in the fiscal year 2011 Budget Request is that \nthe Obama administration agrees with the need to continue supporting \nthe space station to at least 2020, and to expand and increase its \nutilization for research. That is welcome news. The problem is that the \nrequest does not provide the means to ensure that the extension and \nfull utilization of the space station can be realized.\n  It is worth noting that after the budget reductions were made for \nExploration in the 2006 Budget Request, the number of flights planned \nto complete space station assembly were reduced--at the direction of \nOMB for purely budgetary reasons--from 28 remaining flights to 17 \nflights, plus an optional added flight to conduct a final mission to \nservice the Hubble Space Telescope. The effect of those reductions was \nto force NASA to change the planned payloads for those remaining 17 \nflights to try to accommodate the most important spare parts and \nreplacement parts from the 10 ``cancelled'' flights, for ensuring the \nsafe and effective operation and utilization of the station. Ten \nflights' worth of flight-ready payloads--averaging between 40,000 to \n50,000 pounds per flight--were essentially relegated to storage \nwarehouses where most of them remain today, ready to fly, ready to use, \nbut with no guaranteed ``ticket to ride'' to be of any use to the \nstation. Over 1,400 parts and pieces of equipment, Mr. President! What \nis most important to remember, is that the decisions about which \ninstruments and equipment to swap into the remaining flights were based \non the internal assumption of the need to support the ISS through \n2015--not through 2020.\n\n  The result of this is that we do not know how many, or which, of \nthose ``grounded payload'' items might actually be needed in order to \nensure the station can be supported and maintained until 2020. Not only \nthat, we do not know which, or how many, of them are simply too large \nor too heavy to be carried to orbit by any existing vehicle other than \nthe space shuttle. And finally, we do not know what additional items \nmight need to be ordered, manufactured and delivered in the future, or \nwhat launch vehicle capacity will be needed to deliver them to the \nstation.\n  This is not the way a great nation should conduct its civil space \nprogram. This is not the way to ensure that a decision and \npronouncement to continue operations through 2020 will not become an \nempty gesture due to the deterioration, damage, or failure of equipment \nand systems vital to providing the oxygen, water, power to make the ISS \nhabitable and to support scientific research in the period following \n2015.\n  This is just one example of the type of considerations that \npreparations that the Obama administration appears to have ignored \nwhile preparing its response to the Augustine panel Report. It is an \nissue I propose to address, among many, in the legislation being \nintroduced today.\n  Since last May, when the President announced the appointment of a \nCommittee to review U.S. Human Space Flight Plans, we have all been \nwaiting for clear policy direction based on the report of that \nCommittee, which was released in late September. Throughout that time, \nat my direction, my committee staff carefully followed the public \nmeetings and briefings of the Augustine panel, and considered the \nimplications of the various options discussed and eventually included \nin the panel's final report.\n  In the course of that ongoing review, as well as our Committee \nhearing last September, I began forming my own conclusions about the \ncorrect path for the future of U.S. human space flight programs, as is \nmy responsibility as the Ranking Republican on the policy and oversight \ncommittee for NASA. The key factors driving my position regarding that \npath forward have been: the need to maintain U.S. leadership in space \nexploration, which I believe is essential to our economic and national \nsecurity; the need to ensure we do not lose the skills, expertise and \nindustrial capacity that are necessary to conduct space exploration; \nthe need to ensure, as our Committee has in the previous two NASA \nAuthorization bills we have developed and seen enacted into law, that \nNASA has both a balanced range of activities across its full mission \nresponsibilities, and was authorized the funds needed to carry out that \nrange of activities; and the need to protect--and capitalize on--our \nmassive investment in the ISS, which, along with our international \npartners, is close to $100 billion. Now that it is almost completed and \nhas a six-person permanent crew, we can begin to conduct the research \nthat we have anticipated all these years during its construction. \nResearch that has the potential to fundamentally change and enhance our \nunderstanding of physical processes, vaccine development, and a whole \nhost of other research.\n  In order to meet those needs, we must first take steps to ensure we \ndo not have an extended period of time during which there is no \ncapability within the United States to launch humans into space, \nwhether to the space station or any other destination. The easiest, \nmost logical and obvious answer in the short term is to continue to use \nthe one launch vehicle that already exists, has a proven history of \n98.7 percent probability of success for each mission, and upon which \nthe space station was designed, assuming the shuttle's availability \nthroughout the station's on-orbit lifetime to provide support and \nmaintenance.\n  Prematurely and voluntarily ending the space shuttle program without \na near-term U.S.-built alternative on the horizon simply seems \nirresponsible, and that is an issue that I believe the Congress must \naddress. While the Space Shuttle will never be completely safe, just as \nwith any vehicle that must carry humans into the harsh environment of \nspace, it is currently flying as safely, if not more safely, than it \never has.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would ensure that a final \ndecision on the timing of the space shuttle retirement, or even the \nnumber of missions it might still be required to fly, would not be made \nuntil the issues involved are fully considered and resolved and we are \nfully convinced that the shuttle's capability is no longer needed. In \nparticular, we must answer the question of how we support, maintain, \nand fully utilize the ISS, not just in 5 or more years, when any new \ncommercially-developed vehicle might be available, but right now, as we \nare about to cut the ribbon on it as a finally completed research \nfacility.\n  I have already mentioned the lack of complete information regarding \nthe ability to adequately ensure the availability and deliverability of \nspare and replacements parts needed between now and 2020 to keep the \nspace station fully and safely functional. All this is to underscore \nthat the issue of whether to continue flying the shuttle, and the \nnumber of additional shuttle flights that are needed, is not simply a \nmatter of shortening the gap between shuttle retirement and the \navailability of its replacement, or protecting a vitally important \nworkforce. This issue also requires policy makers to understand what \nthe space shuttle can do--and possibly do exclusively in the case of \nlarge, heavy replacement systems and structures--to ensure that the \npromise to extend the ISS to 2020 can actually be fulfilled. We must be \ncertain the ISS can be kept alive and fully functioning over the next \n10 years. Again, the administration's Budget Request offers no answers \nto how we will be able to deliver all the equipment necessary to extend \nthe life of the ISS if the shuttle is not available.\n  I am also very concerned about the proposal to simply cancel the \nConstellation programs of Ares 1, the low-earth orbit crew launch \nvehicle, the Ares V Heavy Lift vehicle for enabling flights beyond low-\nEarth orbit, and the\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\nOrion Crew Exploration capsule to carry the crews for both of those \nmissions. It is very clear that many of my colleagues are also deeply \nconcerned about this part of the President's budget. I simply believe \nany decision to terminate those projects needs much more consideration \nthan I believe it has gotten during the preparation of the Obama \nadministration's proposal for NASA.\n\n  The approach of the administration--their so-called ``bold new \ninitiative''--is to turn to an entirely new approach based exclusively \non the development of commercially-developed crew launch systems. There \nappears to have been little thought given to how we might leverage the \n$9 billion already spent on the Constellation vehicles in the \nidentification of potential providers for those commercial systems. I \nbelieve that is wasteful and irresponsible and all but guarantees that \ncommercial developments will start from scratch--and therefore take \nmuch longer to develop and be much more costly, in the long run, to the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Another concern with this new approach is that we do not yet have any \ndetails about how the $6 billion proposed in the Budget Request for \ncommercial space flight over the next 5 years will be allocated and \nwhat it will be expected to support. We don't know whether this will be \na collaborative program, creating incentives for matching funding from \nthe private sector, or whether it will represent more of a government \nsubsidy to develop systems for which there may not be a sustainable \nmarket for those services beyond what NASA would purchase. I am \nphilosophically and fundamentally opposed to such government subsidies, \nparticularly when it is not clear that taxpayer funding for an approach \nlike this won't have to be followed by even more taxpayer dollars to \nkeep the systems available to meet the needs of the space station, or \nother government space projects.\n  The legislation I am proposing will address that issue by directing \nNASA to consider ``commercial'' options that include the possibility of \nagreements not only with the ``entrepreneurial'' start-up companies \nlike SpaceX, which represent an exciting but still unproven set of \nvehicles designed to service a still non-existent commercial market, \nbut also with other, longer-standing and experienced commercial \ncompanies. The key aerospace companies with whom NASA currently has \ndevelopment contracts might well be able to jointly develop a new \nlaunch system as a modification of their existing contracts under the \nConstellation program. They could combine their expertise and \ncapability to transition their efforts toward developing a new launch \ncapability based on existing shuttle main engines, external tank \nmanufacturing capability, solid rocket motors, and the Orion crew \nvehicle. Something like that has been, I am told, a subject of informal \nconversations among those companies for some time. I believe we need to \nensure through legislation that such an alternative will be fully \nevaluated and considered as one possible approach to the new \n``commercial'' space systems development. We have not been given \ndetails of this possible approach, because those discussions are \napparently still ongoing. But I believe we need to make sure there is a \nlegislative underpinning that would at least allow the full \nconsideration of that approach.\n  I would not view such an approach as precluding the continued pursuit \nof the current COTS, Commercial Orbital Transportation Systems, \nactivities being pursued with SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corporation \nfor cargo delivery services for the Space Station. I have consistently \nsupported that development and believe we should continue to do so. My \nconcern, one I know that of a number of my colleagues share, is to \nensure we have redundant and alternative means of providing U.S. human \nspaceflight capability. If one of those can be more fully commercial in \nnature, and something that can stand on its own without the taxpayers \nbeing responsible for their success, so much the better.\n  I will be working with my colleagues in the Senate, and reaching out \nto our counterparts in the House of Representatives, to ensure all of \nthese issues are put on the table for discussion, using the vehicle of \nthis legislation to provide an alternative view to that proposed by the \nObama Administration.\n  This legislation actually tracks closely with the President's \nrequest, in terms of the amounts authorized for NASA. It authorizes \nprograms largely at funding levels already enacted for fiscal year \n2010, with some very minor exceptions, and at the same base account \nlevels requested by the administration for fiscal year 2011 and fiscal \nyear 2012.\n  What my legislation adds is the authorization levels necessary to \nimplement the potential continuation of space shuttle flights, at a \ngreatly reduced annual level of flights and associated costs, as well \nas modest increases in the short-term for the establishment and support \nof an enterprise to be developed to manage and operate the U.S. \nNational Laboratory.\n  The greatest difference, as I have indicated, is that this \nlegislation points the way to what I believe is a more measured and \nreasoned approach that ensures the best use of investments we have \nalready made, provides the Congress and the administration with \nnecessary information to inform our judgments on alternative launch \nvehicle developments, and provides a means of avoiding severe economic \ndislocations in the aerospace industry and the highly skilled and \ndedicated workforce that has provided the capability for this nation to \nbe the world leader in space exploration.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3068\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Application with other laws.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States Human Space Flight program has, since \n     the first Mercury flight on May 5, 1961, has been a source of \n     pride and inspiration for the Nation.\n       (2) The extraordinary challenges of achieving access to \n     space both motivated and accelerated the development of \n     technologies and industrial capabilities that have had \n     widespread applications which have contributed to the \n     technological excellence of the United States.\n       (3) It is essential to the economic well-being of the \n     Nation that the aerospace industrial capacity, highly skilled \n     workforce, and embedded expertise remain engaged in \n     demanding, challenging, and exciting efforts that ensure \n     United States leadership in space exploration and related \n     activities.\n       (4) The completion of the International Space Station, the \n     ability to sustain a crew of at least 6 members, and the \n     ability to conduct unique microgravity research that can only \n     be accomplished in the space environment, provides an \n     opportunity for scientific and technological advancement that \n     must be immediately and fully exploited.\n       (5) The designation of the U.S. Segment of the \n     International Space Station as a National Laboratory, as \n     provided in section 507 of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16767) \n     and as further provided in subtitle A of title VI of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization \n     Act of 2008 (42 U.S.C. 17751 through 17753), provides an \n     opportunity for multiple United States government agencies, \n     University-based researchers, commercial research \n     organizations, and others to utilize the unique environment \n     of microgravity for fundamental scientific research and \n     potential commercial developments.\n       (6) In order to assure the full and complete utilization of \n     the International Space Station, including the ability to \n     sustain the systems and physical infrastructure of the \n     vehicle, effective and timely transportation systems are \n     required, which must be able to deliver the full range of \n     logistics, support, and maintenance items which may be \n     necessary through the year 2020.\n       (7) For some potential replacement elements necessary for \n     Space Station sustainability, the Space Shuttle represents \n     the\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\n     only vehicle, existing or planned, capable of carrying those \n     elements to the International Space Station in the near term.\n       (8) In order to ensure effective utilization of Space \n     Station research facilities, the capability for returning \n     processed experiment samples and research-related equipment \n     to Earth is essential.\n       (9) The maintenance of human exploration goals, such as a \n     return to the Moon, a voyage to Mars, or other celestial \n     bodies or locations is essential for providing the necessary \n     long-term focus and programmatic robustness of the United \n     States civilian space program.\n       (10) The United States must develop, as rapidly as \n     possible, replacement vehicles capable of providing both \n     human and cargo launch capability to low-Earth orbit and, by \n     expansion or modification of core design features, capable of \n     delivering large payloads into low-earth orbit or to \n     destinations beyond low-Earth orbit.\n       (11) While commercial transportation systems may contribute \n     valuable services, it is in the United States' national \n     interest to maintain a government-operated space \n     transportation system for crew and cargo delivery to low-\n     Earth orbit and beyond.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT POLICY.\n\n       (a) Use of Non-U.S. Human Space Flight Transportation \n     Capacity.--It is the policy of the United States that \n     reliance upon and use of non-United States human space flight \n     capability shall only be undertaken as a temporary \n     contingency in circumstances where no United States-owned and \n     operated human space flight capability is available, \n     operational, and certified for flight by appropriate Federal \n     agencies.\n       (b) U.S. Human Space Flight Capacity.--The Congress \n     reaffirms the policy stated in section 501(a) of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of \n     2005 (42 U.S.C. 16761(a)), that the United States shall \n     maintain an uninterrupted capability for human space flight \n     and operations in low-earth orbit, and beyond, as an \n     essential instrument of national security and the ability to \n     ensure continued United States participation and leadership \n     in the exploration and utilization of space.\n\n     SEC. 4. SPACE SHUTTLE OPERATIONS.\n\n       (a) Retention of Space Shuttle Operations Capability.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall take all necessary \n     steps to ensure that all Space Shuttle Program activities and \n     operations are able to continue, or to be resumed, including \n     flight operations and support, pending the completion of the \n     reviews, requirements, and reports of this section.\n       (2) Current shutle manifest flight assurance.--The \n     Administrator shall take all steps necessary to ensure \n     shuttle launch capability through fiscal year 2011 to enable \n     launch, at a minimum, of all payloads manifested as of \n     February 28, 2010.

The \n     Administrator shall include details and associated costs of \n     such support as part of any proposed development initiative \n     for the procurement of commercially-developed crew or cargo \n     capabilities or services.\n       (E) Establishment of flight demonstration and readiness \n     requirements.--The Administrator shall establish appropriate \n     milestones and minimum performance accomplishments which must \n     be completed before any authority is granted to proceed to \n     procurement of commercially-developed crew transportation \n     systems or capabilities.\n       (3) Sense of the congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the development of commercial capabilities for the use \n     of space may be of value in maximizing the utility and \n     productivity of the International Space Station by providing \n     a commercial means of enabling crew transfer and crew rescue \n     services for the International Space Station. The Congress \n     further believes that once such commercial services have \n     demonstrated the capability to meet established ascent, \n     entry, and International Space Station proximity operations \n     safety requirements the United States should make use of \n     domestic commercially-provided crew transfer and crew rescue \n     services to the maximum extent practicable. The Congress \n     further believes that the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration should expedite, where possible, the use of \n     domestic commercially provided International Space Station \n     cargo missions, and that upon the certification by \n     appropriate Federal agencies of operational flight readiness \n     for the provision of commercial crew transportation \n     capabilities, the Administrator should limit, to the maximum \n     extent practicable, the use of a United States government \n     crew transportation vehicle to missions carrying crew beyond \n     low Earth orbit.\n       (4) Limitation on obligation or expenditure of funds.--No \n     funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act may be \n     obligated or expended for the purpose of procuring a \n     commercially-developed crew transportation vehicle prior to \n     completion of the requirements of paragraph (2) of this \n     subsection.\n       (g) Cargo Return Capability.--The Administrator is directed \n     to conduct a study of alternative means for development of \n     the capability for a soft-landing return for return research \n     samples or other derivative materials, and small to mid-sized \n     (up to 1,000 kilograms) equipment for return and analysis, or \n     refurbishment and redelivery to the ISS. If the Administrator \n     decides that an independent study is appropriate, the results \n     of the study shall be transmitted to the committees of \n     jurisdiction no later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (h) Report to Committees of Jurisdiction.--The \n     Administrator shall submit a report to the committees of \n     jurisdiction on\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\n     plans for implementing the requirements of this section no \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this act.\n\n     SEC. 8.

Res. 431\n\n       Whereas the massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake that struck \n     Chile in the early hours of Saturday, February 27, 2010, has \n     claimed approximatley 800 lives, according to government \n     officials of Chile, and the death toll is expected to \n     continue to rise as assessments of the devastation continue;\n       Whereas the earthquake hit most strongly in 6 central and \n     south regions, from the capital, Santiago, and the nearby \n     port of Valparaiso in central Chile, to the Bernardo \n     O'Higgins, Maule, Bio Bio, and Araucania regions of the \n     south;\n       Whereas the regions most strongly hit are home to about 60 \n     percent of the 17,000,000 inhabitants of Chile and account \n     for approximately 70 percent of the gross domestic product of \n     Chile;\n       Whereas the earthquake generated some tsunami activity, in \n     addition to the earthquake, and several hundred people were \n     killed in the coastal towns of Constitucion and Talcahuano as \n     a result;\n       Whereas many of the villages in the Juan Fernandez \n     archipelago were destroyed by tsunami activity;\n       Whereas the earthquake left an estimated 2,000,000 people \n     homeless and damaged more than 1,000,000 homes, \\1/3\\ of \n     which may have to be demolished;\n       Whereas the earthquake, classified as a ``megathrust'' \n     earthquake, unleashed an estimated 50 gigatons of energy and \n     broke about 340 miles of the fault zone, according to the \n     United States Geological Survey's National Earthquake \n     Information Center;\n       Whereas aftershocks have continued, seriously complicating \n     efforts to survey the damage and rescue survivors despite the \n     noble efforts of local teams;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense has estimated that \n     reconstruction costs could exceed $30,000,000,000, equivalent \n     to 20 percent of the 2009 gross domestic product of Chile;\n       Whereas damage to ports and other infrastructure will \n     hinder important exports and economic recovery;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Chile on \n     March 2, 2010, and promised an extensive aid package, and the \n     United States Ambassador to Chile requested emergency relief \n     funding;\n       Whereas Chile enjoys excellent relations with the United \n     States since its transition back to democracy, and both \n     countries have emphasized similar priorities in the region, \n     designed to strengthen democracy, improve human rights, and \n     advance free trade;\n       Whereas Chile and the United States also maintain strong \n     commercial ties, which have become more extensive since a \n     bilateral free trade agreement between the two countries \n     entered into force in 2004;\n       Whereas since 2004, the Government of Chile has worked with \n     the Government of the United States and the international \n     community as part of the multinational peacekeeping force in \n     Haiti, first as a part of the Multinational Interim Force-\n     Haiti (MIFH) and subsequently as a part of the United Nations \n     Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), committing more \n     human material resources to MINUSTAH than it has to any \n     previous peacekeeping mission;

which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 432\n\n       Whereas millions of people around the world struggle each \n     year for life and breath due to lung diseases, including \n     tuberculosis, asthma, pneumonia, influenza, lung cancer and \n     chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary \n     fibrosis, and more than 8,100,000 die each year;\n       Whereas lung diseases afflict people in every country and \n     every socioeconomic group, but take the heaviest toll on the \n     poor, children, the elderly, and the weak;\n       Whereas lung disease is a serious public health problem in \n     the United States that affects adults and children of every \n     age and race;\n       Whereas lower respiratory diseases are the fourth leading \n     cause of death in the United States;\n       Whereas the economic cost of lung diseases is expected to \n     be $177,000,000,000 in 2009, including $114,000,000,000 in \n     direct health expenditures and $64,000,000,000 in indirect \n     morbidity and mortality costs;\n       Whereas nearly half of the world's population lives in or \n     near areas with poor air quality, which significantly \n     increases the incidence of lung diseases such as asthma and \n     COPD, and more than 2,000,000 people die prematurely due to \n     indoor and outdoor air pollution;\n       Whereas tuberculosis, an airborne infection that attacks \n     the lungs and other major organs, is a leading global \n     infectious disease;\n       Whereas no new drugs have been developed for tuberculosis \n     in more than 5 decades and the only vaccine is nearly a \n     century old, yet there were 9,400,000 new cases in 2008, and \n     this curable disease kills 1,800,000 each year;\n       Whereas an estimated 12,000,000 adults in the United \n     States, are diagnosed with COPD, and another 12,000,000 have \n     the disease but don't know it;\n       Whereas COPD kills an estimated 126,000 people in the \n     United States each year, is currently the fourth leading \n     cause of death in the Nation, is the only one of the 4 major \n     causes that is still increasing in prevalence, and is \n     expected to rise to become the third leading cause of death \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the \n     United States and the most common cause of cancer deaths;\n       Whereas the leading cause of lung cancer is long-term \n     exposure to tobacco smoke;\n       Whereas about 23,400,000 people in the United States have \n     asthma, a prevalence which has risen by over 150 percent \n     since 1980;\n       Whereas asthma is the most common chronic disorder found in \n     children, with 7,000,000 affected;\n       Whereas flu and pneumonia together are the eighth leading \n     cause of death in the United States;\n       Whereas about 190,000 people in the United States are \n     affected by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) each \n     year, a critical illness that results in sudden respiratory \n     system failure, which is fatal in up to 30 percent of cases;\n       Whereas about 75,000 people in the United States die as a \n     result of acute lung injury, a disease that can be triggered \n     by infection, drowning, traumatic accident, burn injuries, \n     blood transfusions, and inhalation of toxic substances, which \n     kills approximately the same number of people each year as \n     die from breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer \n     combined;\n       Whereas of the 10 leading causes of infant mortality in the \n     United States, 4 are lung diseases or have a lung disease \n     component;\n       Whereas pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a relentlessly \n     progressive, ultimately fatal disease with a median survival \n     rate of 2.8 years that has no life-saving therapy or cure;\n       Whereas more than 120,000 people are living with PF in the \n     United States, 48,000 are diagnosed with it each year, and as \n     many as 40,000 die annually, the same as die from breast \n     cancer;\n       Whereas the cause of sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease \n     that occurs most often in the lungs and has its highest \n     incidence among young people aged 20 to 29, is unknown;\n       Whereas 15 years ago, people with pulmonary hypertension \n     lived on average less than 3 years after diagnosis;\n       Whereas new treatments have improved survival rates and \n     quality of life for those living with this condition, but it \n     remains a severe and often fatal illness;\n       Whereas Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare lung disease \n     that affects women exclusively and is also associated with \n     tuberous sclerosis, has no treatment protocol or cure and is \n     often misdiagnosed as asthma or emphysema;\n       Whereas Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome, a genetic metabolic \n     disorder which causes albinism, visual impairment, and \n     serious bleeding due to platelet dysfunction, has no cure and \n     no standard of treatment;\n       Whereas children's interstitial lung disease, a group of \n     rare lung diseases, has many different forms, including \n     surfactant protein deficiency, chronic bronchiolitis, and \n     connective tissue lung disease, and is thus difficult to \n     diagnose and treat;\n

Res. 433\n\n       Whereas there are more than 3,300,000,000 women in the \n     world;\n       Whereas women around the world participate in the \n     political, social, and economic life of their communities and \n     play the predominant role in providing and caring for their \n     families;\n       Whereas women, as both farmers and caregivers, play a \n     leading role in advancing food security for their families \n     and communities;\n       Whereas the ability of women to realize their full \n     potential is critical to the ability of a nation to achieve \n     strong and lasting economic growth and political stability;\n       Whereas according to the 2009 World Economic Forum Global \n     Gender Gap Report, ``[A] nation's competitiveness depends \n     significantly on whether and how it educates and utilizes its \n     female talent. To maximize its competitiveness and \n     development potential, each country should strive for gender \n     equality--that is, to give women the same rights, \n     responsibilities and opportunities as men.'';\n       Whereas, also according to the same report, ``Every year of \n     schooling increases a girl's individual earning power by 10% \n     to 20%, while the return on secondary education is even \n     higher, in the 15% to 25% range. Additionally, women reinvest \n     90%of their income back into the household, whereas men \n     reinvest only 30% to 40%.'';\n       Whereas according to President Barack Obama, ``Our \n     daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons, \n     and our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all \n     humanity--men and women--to reach their full potential.'';\n       Whereas according to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton, ``[I]nvesting in the potential of women to lift and \n     lead their societies is one of the best investments we can \n     make.'';\n       Whereas despite some achievements made by individual women \n     leaders, women around the globe are still vastly \n     underrepresented in high level positions and in national and \n     local legislatures and governments and, according to the \n     Inter-Parliamentary Union, account for only 18.7 percent of \n     national parliamentarians;\n       Whereas although strides have been made in recent decades, \n     women around the world continue to face significant obstacles \n     in all aspects of their lives including discrimination, \n     gender-based violence, and denial of basic human rights;\n       Whereas women are responsible for 66 percent of the work \n     done in the world, yet earn only 10 percent of the income \n     earned in the world;\n       Whereas women account for approximately 70 percent of \n     individuals living in poverty world-wide;\n       Whereas women account for 64 percent of the 774,000,000 \n     adults world-wide who lack basic literacy skills;\n       Whereas girls account for 57 percent of the 72,000,000 \n     primary school aged children in the world who do not attend \n     school;\n       Whereas in Sub-Saharan Africa only 17 percent of girls \n     enroll in secondary school;\n       Whereas women receive less than 10 percent of all available \n     credit in Africa, own less than 2 percent of the land in the \n     world, and account for only 15 percent of the agricultural \n     extension agents in the world, yet produce the majority of \n     the food crops in the world, including 70 percent of the food \n     crops in Africa;\n       Whereas women in developing countries are \n     disproportionately affected by global climate change;\n       Whereas according to the Joint United Nations Programme on \n     HIV/AIDS, women account for 50 percent of HIV or AIDS \n     infections worldwide, and nearly 60 percent of HIV infections \n     in Sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas according the Department of State, 56 percent of \n     all forced labor victims are women and girls;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations, 1 in 3 women in \n     the world will be beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise \n     abused in her lifetime;\n       Whereas according to the International Center for Research \n     on Women, there are more than 60,000,000 child brides in \n     developing countries, some of whom are as young as 7 years \n     old;\n       Whereas March 8 is recognized each year as International \n     Women's Day, a global day to celebrate the economic, \n     political, and social achievements of women past, present, \n     and future and a day to recognize the obstacles that women \n     still face in the struggle for equal rights and \n     opportunities; and\n       Whereas, the United Nations theme for International Women's \n     Day 2010 is ``Equal rights, equal opportunities: Progress for \n     all'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of ``International Women's Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that the economic growth and empowerment of \n     women is inextricably linked to the potential of nations to \n     generate economic growth and sustainable democracy;\n       (3) recognizes and honors the women in the United States \n     and around the world who have worked throughout history to \n     strive to ensure that women are guaranteed equality and basic \n     human rights;\n       (4) reaffirms the commitment to end gender-based \n     discrimination in all forms, to end violence against women \n     and girls worldwide; and\n       (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     International Women's Day with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/03/senate-section/article/S1032-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1032-S1033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3358.

Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nByrd, Mr. Ensign, and Mr. Voinovich) submitted an amendment intended to \nbe proposed to amendment SA 3336 proposed by Mr. Baucus to the bill \nH.R. 4213, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend certain \nexpiring provisions, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie \non the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\n             TITLE VIII--DC OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Scholarships for \n     Opportunity and Results Act of 2010'' or the ``SOAR Act''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions for their \n     children, including the educational setting that will best \n     serve the interests and educational needs of their child.\n       (2) For many parents in the District of Columbia, public \n     school choice provided under the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001, as well as under other public school choice \n     programs, is inadequate. More educational options are needed \n     to ensure all families in the District of Columbia have \n     access to a quality education. In particular, funds are \n     needed to provide low-income parents with enhanced public \n     opportunities and private educational environments, \n     regardless of whether such environments are secular or \n     nonsecular.\n       (3) Public school records raise persistent concerns \n     regarding health and safety problems in District of Columbia \n     public schools. For example, more than half of the District \n     of Columbia's teenage public school students attend schools \n     that meet the District of Columbia's definition of \n     ``persistently dangerous'' due to the number of violent \n     crimes.\n       (4) While the per student cost for students in the public \n     schools of the District of Columbia is one of the highest in \n     the United States, test scores for such students continue to \n     be among the lowest in the Nation. The National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress (NAEP), an annual report released by the \n     National Center for Education Statistics, reported in its \n     2007 study that students in the District of Columbia were \n     being outperformed by every State in the Nation. On the 2007 \n     NAEP, 61 percent of fourth grade students scored ``below \n     basic'' in reading, and 51 percent scored ``below basic'' in \n     mathematics. Among eighth grade students, 52 percent scored \n     ``below basic'' in reading and 56 percent scored ``below \n     basic'' in mathematics. On the 2007 NAEP reading assessment, \n     only 14 percent of the District of Columbia fourth grade \n     students could read proficiently, while only 12 percent of \n     the eighth grade students scored at the proficient or \n     advanced level.\n       (5) In 2003, Congress passed the DC School Choice Incentive \n     Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-199; 118 Stat. 126) to provide \n     opportunity scholarships to parents of students in the \n     District of Columbia that could be used by students in \n     kindergarten through grade 12 to attend a private educational \n     institution. The opportunity scholarship program under such \n     Act was part of a comprehensive 3-part funding arrangement \n     that also included additional funds for the District of \n     Columbia public schools, and additional funds for public \n     charter schools of the District of Columbia. The intent of \n     the approach was to ensure that progress would continue to be \n     made to improve public schools and public charter schools, \n     and that funding for the opportunity scholarship program \n     would not lead to a reduction in funding for the District of \n     Columbia public and charter schools. Resources would be \n     available for a variety of educational options that would \n     give families in the District of Columbia a range of choices \n     with regard to the education of their children.\n       (6) The opportunity scholarship program was established in \n     accordance with the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Zelman v. \n     Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639 (2002), which found that a \n     program enacted for the valid secular purpose of providing \n     educational assistance to low-income children in a \n     demonstrably failing public school system is constitutional \n     if it is neutral with respect to religion and provides \n     assistance to a broad class of citizens who direct government \n     aid to religious and secular schools solely as a result of \n     their genuine and independent private choices.\n       (7) Since the opportunity scholarship program's inception, \n     it has consistently been oversubscribed. Parents express \n     strong support for the opportunity scholarship program. A \n     rigorous analysis of the program by the Institute of \n     Education Sciences (IES) shows statistically significant \n     improvements in parental satisfaction and in reading scores \n     that are even more dramatic when only those students \n     consistently using the scholarships are considered.\n       (8) The DC opportunity scholarship program is a program \n     that offers families in need, in the District of Columbia, \n     important alternatives while public schools are improved. It \n     is the sense of Congress that this program should continue as \n     1 of a 3-part comprehensive funding strategy for the District \n     of Columbia school system that provides new and equal funding \n     for public schools, public charter schools, and opportunity \n     scholarships for students to attend private schools.\n\n     SEC. 803. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to provide low-income parents \n     residing in the District of Columbia, particularly parents of \n     students who attend elementary schools or secondary schools \n     identified for improvement, corrective action, or \n     restructuring under section 1116 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316), with \n     expanded opportunities for enrolling their children in other \n     schools in the District of Columbia, at least until the \n     public schools in the District of Columbia have adequately \n     addressed shortfalls in health, safety, and security and the \n     students in the District of Columbia public schools are \n     testing in mathematics and reading at or above the national \n     average.\n\n     SEC. 804. GENERAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Authority.--From funds appropriated to carry out this \n     title, the Secretary shall award grants on a competitive \n     basis to eligible entities with approved applications under \n     section 805 to carry out activities to provide eligible \n     students with expanded school choice opportunities. The \n     Secretary may award a single grant or multiple grants, \n     depending on the quality of applications submitted and the \n     priorities of this title.\n       (b) Duration of Grants.--The Secretary shall make grants \n     under this section for a period of not more than 5 years.\n       (c) Memorandum of Understanding.--The Secretary and the \n     Mayor of the District of Columbia shall enter into a \n     memorandum of understanding regarding the design of, \n     selection of eligible entities to receive grants under, and \n     implementation of, a program assisted under this title.\n       (d) Special Rule.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, funding appropriated for the opportunity scholarship \n     program under the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (Public \n     Law 111-8), the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2010 \n     (Public Law 111-117), or any other Act, may be used to \n     provide opportunity scholarships under section 807 to new \n     applicants.\n\n     SEC. 805. APPLICATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In order to receive a grant under this \n     title, an eligible entity shall submit an application to the \n     Secretary at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by \n     such information as the Secretary may require.\n       (b) Contents.--The Secretary may not approve the request of \n     an eligible entity for a grant under this title unless the \n     entity's application includes--\n       (1) a detailed description of--\n       (A) how the entity will address the priorities described in \n     section 806;\n       (B) how the entity will ensure that if more eligible \n     students seek admission in the program than the program can \n     accommodate, eligible students are selected for admission \n     through a random selection process which gives weight to the \n     priorities described in section 806;\n       (C) how the entity will ensure that if more participating \n     eligible students seek admission to a participating school \n     than the school can accommodate, participating eligible \n     students are selected for admission through a random \n     selection process;\n       (D) how the entity will notify parents of eligible students \n     of the expanded choice opportunities and how the entity will \n     ensure that parents receive sufficient information about \n     their options to allow the parents to make informed \n     decisions;\n       (E) the activities that the entity will carry out to \n     provide parents of eligible students with expanded choice \n     opportunities through the awarding of scholarships under \n     section 807(a);\n       (F) how the entity will determine the amount that will be \n     provided to parents for the tuition, fees, and transportation \n     expenses, if any;\n       (G) how the entity will--\n       (i) seek out private elementary schools and secondary \n     schools in the District of Columbia to participate in the \n     program; and\n       (ii) ensure that participating schools will meet the \n     reporting and other requirements of this title;\n       (H) how the entity will ensure that participating schools \n     are financially responsible and will use the funds received \n     under this title effectively;\n       (I) how the entity will address the renewal of scholarships \n     to participating eligible students, including continued \n     eligibility; and\n       (J) how the entity will ensure that a majority of its \n     voting board members or governing organization are residents \n     of the District of Columbia;\n       (2) an assurance that the entity will comply with all \n     requests regarding any evaluation carried out under section \n     809; and\n       (3) an assurance that site inspections of participating \n     schools will be conducted at appropriate intervals.\n\n     SEC. 806. PRIORITIES.\n\n       In awarding grants under this title, the Secretary shall \n     give priority to applications from eligible entities that \n     will most effectively--\n       (1) give priority to eligible students who, in the school \n     year preceding the school year for which the eligible student \n     is seeking a scholarship, attended an elementary school or \n     secondary school identified for improvement, corrective \n     action, or restructuring under section 1116 of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316);\n       (2) give priority to students whose household includes a \n     sibling or other child who is already participating in the \n     program of the eligible entity under this title, regardless \n     of whether such students have, in the past, been assigned as \n     members of a control study group for the purposes of an \n     evaluation under section 809;\n       (3) target resources to students and families that lack the \n     financial resources to take advantage of available \n     educational options; and\n       (4) provide students and families with the widest range of \n     educational options.\n\n     SEC. 807.

Most recently, Ms. Brill worked as \nSenior Deputy Attorney General of the Consumer Protection Division in \nthe North Carolina Department of Justice. Over her professional career, \nMs. Brill has worked on critical issues in agriculture, tobacco, food, \npharmaceuticals, and identity theft. Her expertise and intelligence \nhave allowed her to excel in all of these areas.\n  The FTC has an important role in protecting consumers from unfair and \ndeceptive trade practices as well as anticompetitive behavior by \nbusinesses. Ms. Brill will serve consumers well in her new position as \na Commissioner.\n  Ms. Brill has spent much of her professional life working on behalf \nof the people of Vermont, and I look forward to continuing to work with \nher as she helps to advance Chairman Leibowitz's active agenda.
