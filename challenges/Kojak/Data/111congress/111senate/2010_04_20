Madam President, with regard to financial \nregulation, from the beginning of this debate, I have called for a \nbipartisan approach. And for several months, I was encouraged to see \nbipartisan talks approaching agreement on a bipartisan bill.\n\n  Somewhere along the line, those talks got off course, leading to \nDemocrats pulling away from bipartisan efforts, a party-line vote in \ncommittee and the Democrat leadership's stated\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\ndesire to bring a bill to the floor that had, in effect, bipartisan \nopposition. So last week I raised concerns with the Dodd bill, but I \nalso told the President and our friends across the aisle that this bill \nis not unfixable.\n  It is important for the country and taxpayer that we get this right, \nthat we put them before politics. That is why I was disappointed to \nread that Senate Democrats are refusing to drop the $50 billion bailout \nfund--a fund that the Treasury Secretary himself opposes--unless \nRepublicans pay a price for taking it out. This is exactly what \nAmericans don't like about Washington: when one side tries to ``get'' \nsomething for doing what they should have done in the first place. If \neveryone agrees it should be dropped, then it should be dropped. And if \nSenate Democrats think it should stay, then they should explain why \nthey think the Treasury Secretary was wrong when he said that this \nbailout fund ``would create expectations that the government would step \nin to protect shareholders and creditors from losses.''\n  Both sides have expressed a willingness to make the changes needed to \nensure without any doubt that this bill won't put taxpayers on the hook \nfor future bailouts of Wall Street banks. So why don't we just do that?\n  I am heartened to hear that bipartisan talks have resumed in earnest, \nand in my view, the progress we have seen over the past few days is \nproof that I was right to raise concerns about this bill when I did. As \nI said, the best way to get a bill with the credibility of bipartisan \nsupport is to allow bipartisan talks to continue. Let us fix the bill \nand have a bipartisan reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2434-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2434-S2435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Wall Street reform is very complex. Few of \nus are experts in derivative trading or credit default swaps or even \nthe intricacies of securities. But the principle before us is a very \nsimple one, in spite of all these very complicated issues that will be \nin this bill. You either believe we need to strengthen oversight of \nWall Street or you don't. You either believe we need to strengthen \nprotection of consumers or you don't. I believe in those principles and \nin fixing what is broken.\n  That is what this good reform will do. It will enforce the strongest \nprotections ever against Wall Street greed. It will give families more \ncontrol over their own finances and give consumers more clarity so they \ncan make right financial decisions. This legislation would guarantee \ntaxpayers that they will never again be asked to bail out a big bank.\n  It will also ensure no big bank can become too big to fail and shield \nfamilies' life savings from Wall Street gambling. It will make the \nsystem more transparent so we can catch bankers' excesses and then hold \nthem accountable.\n  Our bill contains Republicans' ideas and Democratic ideas. It is good \nfor consumers and for everyone who favors economic security over \nreckless risk-taking.\n  As I said, some elements of this reform are complicated. There is one \npart that is especially hard to follow. Similar to the most complex \ncommodity, Republican reaction to cleaning up Wall Street is hard to \nunderstand.\n  This bill will bring to the floor the result of months of bipartisan \nmeetings, investigations, negotiations, and consensus building. Our \nRepublican colleagues, in spite of the fact that they have been \ninvolved in much of the negotiation, investigations, and consensus, are \npretending this is a partisan effort.\n  I am happy to hear my counterpart, my friend, Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, talk about the need for more negotiations. We don't \nstand in the way of that. That is fine. This bill, when it comes to the \nfloor, is going to be open to amendment, amendments by Democrats, \namendments by Republicans. That is the way it should be. So no one \nshould think the bill that comes to the floor is the final product. \nThere will be amendments.\n  Some people strongly believe the bill from the committee is too weak, \nsome believe it is just right, some believe it is too strong. So we \nneed to make sure everyone understands this bill is not a final \nproduct. That is why I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle \nare going to let us bring this bill to the floor. Remember, there are \nonly 59 of us, so if a single Republican is not willing to join with \nus, there will be no Wall Street reform. The Republicans will have \nkilled Wall Street reform.\n  I am confident that is not what will happen. I read very closely the \nletter that was signed by 41 Republican Senators. I received a copy of \nit on Friday. There is not a sentence in that letter that says we are \ngoing to vote against moving to proceed, and I was happy to read that. \nThey said they wanted more negotiations and there have been more \nnegotiations. Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby--Dodd, the chairman, and \nShelby, the ranking member--spent hours yesterday working on this bill, \nand that is the way it should be. The bill we will bring to the floor \nputs an end to taxpayer-funded bailouts. Let's all agree on that. It \nprotects consumers. Let's all agree on that. But our Republican friends \ninsist on pretending, in conversations I have heard on the floor, that \nit doesn't protect consumers and it doesn't put an end to taxpayer-\nfunded bailouts.\n  We know Wall Street doesn't like the bill. That should speak volumes. \nIt doesn't like this bill. Of course it doesn't. Look at the rules of \nthe road on Wall Street. They get to take your money, money that is not \ntheir own, and gamble it away with little risk and large reward.\n  I was, for 4 years of my life, chairman of the Nevada Gaming \nCommission, and that is not hunting animals; it is gambling. During \nthose times, we had some very difficult issues dealing with gambling, \nwith gaming. But I understood a lot about poker and 21 and roulette and \nother such things. But it was, on its face, a gamble. What they are \ndoing on Wall Street, we should have the Nevada Gaming Commission come \nto regulate a lot of it because it is nothing but a gamble. That is \nwhat we are trying to do here, bring a semblance of finality and \nstability to what is going on there on Wall Street.\n  I again say it. Look at the rules of the road on Wall Street. They \nget to take your money--it is not their money--and gamble it away with \nlittle risk and large reward. It would be as if I asked a Senator from \nGeorgia to go to Las Vegas with me and I will gamble away all his \nmoney, but I get part of the money for doing nothing other than telling \nhim we are in Las Vegas.\n  There are many who do not want us to touch a system that has let them \ntake our homes, take everything we have. They don't want us to touch a \nsystem that has let them take their winnings and ask taxpayers to save \nthem from their losses. It is a pretty good deal. They can get all the \nmoney they can--that is not their own--and if they profit, fine; if \nthey lose something, that is too bad, even though it is not their money \nthey are losing, even though they are losing somebody else's. Wall \nStreet knows, if we don't act, they will not be held accountable for \ntheir mistakes, and if things don't go their way, they know they will \nget a mulligan; that is, they can start over. That is the way the \nsystem worked when our economy teetered on the brink of collapse and \nthat is the way the system still works today. We have to change that. \nThat is what we have to change. With this Wall Street accountability \nbill, we will. That is what this is about. It is a Wall Street \naccountability bill.\n  Let's bring this matter to the floor and offer amendments. Let's not \nbe threatening filibusters on different parts of the bill. Let's go \nback to the way we used to do things. Let's bring an amendment to the \nfloor, let's vote on it, whoever gets the most votes wins, whoever \ndoesn't get the most votes loses, and move on to the next amendment.\n  It is puzzling why my Republican friends are pretending that this \nbill to fix Wall Street is good for those who\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\nbenefit from the fact it is broken. Similar to the bankers themselves, \nit seems a number of Republicans care more about making short-term \ngains than they do about doing what is right for this economy in the \nlong run. Some details of this debate might be complex, but the \ndifferent sides are as clear today as could be. On one side are \nconsumers and investors, families and businesses and the vast majority \nof Americans who want us to make sure the financial crisis they just \nlived through can never happen again.\n  That is our goal. They knew there was no regulation, minimal \nregulation, and those people on Wall Street took advantage of that. \nThey were betting on things that would make famous Nevada gamblers \nblush.\n  They don't want us to just talk about it, they want us to do \nsomething about it. We have to decide who is on whose side here, \nbecause we are ready to act. On one side are those who want to make \nsure we never have a situation like we had before. On the other side we \nhave Wall Street bankers. They are doing pretty well. Two major Wall \nStreet banks reported profits between them of about $7 billion last \nquarter. I don't begrudge them making money. That is good. People in \nour great free enterprise system can make money. I am just saying we \nhave to have rules that don't allow them to cause another problem, as \nwe had, which is second only to the Great Depression. Some say it is \nworse. These Wall Street bankers are sitting very comfortably. They see \nnothing wrong with a system that privatizes their gains and socializes \ntheir losses. They don't want us to change a thing. Let's decide that \nwe, Democrats and Republicans, are on the side of consumers and \ninvestors, families and businesses, and the vast majority of Americans \nwho want us to make sure the financial crisis they just lived through \ncan never happen again.\n  Those who think this legislation is bailing out Wall Street should \nlook at it again. Let's move forward in a bipartisan manner to get this \nbill done as quickly as possible, go to conference with the House, have \nthe President sign the bill. The sooner we do that, the more stable our \neconomy will be, not only here in America but worldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2435-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise at a propitious time because the \nmajority and minority leaders addressed the pending bill that is coming \nout of the Banking Committee and their desire for the bill to be one \nthat is amendable and debatable.\n  I am here to talk specifically about one facet of the financial \ncrisis and one improvement that is to be made by this bill that needs \nto be carefully addressed to make sure we don't repeat a mistake made \nin the 1990s with the failure of the S industry.\n  I have a chart with me. We have heard a lot about mortgages. We all \nknow if it weren't for FHA, if it weren't for VA insurance, if it \nweren't for the Fed doing Freddie and Fannie a favor, there would not \nbe much mortgage money available right now. It has all run away from \nthe United States because of the subprime crisis and, in fact, because \npeople are nervous about what happened in the financial markets with \nsubprime securities. During this crisis we have been in, beginning in \n2005 and going on until now, in my State of Georgia--these numbers are \nspecific to Georgia, but Georgia is the tenth largest State--we see \nhere that of the mortgages in default, totally in default or in \nforeclosure, it got as high as 8.2 percent on what I refer to as \nqualified mortgages. Those are mortgages that were made to creditworthy \npeople who had good underwriting standards. Those were good mortgages. \nUp to 8.2 percent or 1 in 10 of those, at its apex, were either \ndelinquent or pending foreclosure. But 24.7 percent were what is known \nas subprime or nonqualified loans and were either in mortgage \ndelinquency or in default, 3 to 1.\n  The reason I show this chart is it demonstrates where the problem \nhappened, not just on Wall Street but on Main Street; that is, in \nchasing higher yields, in pushing toward a desire for greater home \nownership, credit standards got lax, and loans became nonqualified \nloans that carried a higher interest rate but a much higher risk. It is \nacknowledged by me and by most, in terms of the housing crisis we have \nbeen in, that the largest precipitating factor was shoddy underwriting, \nloose credit, and subprime mortgages. The legislation coming out of the \nBanking Committee is going to create something known as shared risk or \nlender liability in terms of the making of mortgage loans. I will be \nthe first to tell my colleagues, I am not on the Banking Committee. I \nhaven't seen the final draft. What I will address is what I hope will \nhappen, not what I know will happen.\n  What I hope the committee will understand is, in its requirement for \nshared risk, being that the maker of a mortgage retain 25 percent of \nthat mortgage for its lifetime or until it is paid, is the significant \namount of capital that is asked for an institution to reserve and a \npossible amount for a mortgage broker or a mortgage banker but not for \nan institutional lender. The problem is, there are no institutional \nlenders like savings and loans anymore. One should revisit what \nhappened with the savings and loan crisis, the Resolution Trust \nCorporation, and the failure that took place in the late 1980s and late \n1990s. In America in the 1970s and 1980s, most of the mortgages made \nwere made by lenders who didn't share the risk. They had 100 percent of \nthe risk. They were savings and loan associations that took deposits, \npaid a preferential rate of interest over banks by regulatory design to \nattract the capital, and they held the mortgage in portfolio until it \nwas paid. That is not shared risk. That is total risk.\n  What were our foreclosure rates in the 1970s and 1980s up until the \nend of the 1990s? Very marginal, 1 to 2 percent, certainly not 8.2 \npercent, certainly not 24.7. What happened, though, in the savings and \nloan industry is, No. 1, the Federal Government took away the interest \npreference to pay between banks and S so capital flowed out of the \nS No. 2, because S then needed to make more money on the \ninternal portfolio, the government allowed savings and loans to create \nservice corporations, which were subsidiaries, to deviate from their \noriginal charter and, instead of just making home loans, allowed them \nto make commercial loans and, in fact, become developers.\n  What happened? What happened is history. We got off our mission, \nbecause we got off the risk. Because we took our eye off the ball, the \nsavings and loan industry across America failed. Congress had to create \nthe Resolution Trust Corporation to dispose of the bad assets around \nthe country and we went through, up until now, the most severe \nrecession we have ever been through. But this one is worse. This one is \nmore pervasive. This one was caused by a lot of financial \nirregularities and poor oversight on our part, as well as greed on the \npart of many lenders. My hope is, when we start fixing things with \nregard to mortgages, we will recognize that shared risk is not going to \nsolve any problem, if 100 percent risk didn't solve it in the late \n1980s. What is going to solve the problem is for us to have reasonable \nstandards of required underwriting that are an insulator from \ninstitutions\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\nmaking bad loans unless they take the risk.\n\n  I am suggesting that we define what is a qualified loan that would \nnot be subject to shared risk and what is a loan that would be subject \nto it. For example, what would a qualified mortgage be? I was in this \nbusiness for a long time. When I started in the business in the 1960s \nthrough mid-1980s, you could not borrow twice your annual income. You \ncouldn't have a monthly payment higher than 25 percent of your take-\nhome pay, and your total debts a year or longer could not exceed 33 \npercent of your gross income. That was reasonable underwriting. What \nwere our foreclosure rates then: 2, 1.5, a high of 2.8 percent in the \nmid-1980s, but certainly not anything such as what we have in the 24.7 \nand the 8.2 percent.\n  What is a qualified loan is one that requires full documentation so \nyou do have to have a job, so your boss verifies your job, so the \ncredit agency actually verifies your credit so you actually have a \ndownpayment, you don't have downpayment assistance or some ``now you \nsee it, now you don't'' program--no interest-only loans. Everybody \nknows, you are not making an investment if you are not paying the debt \nservice and only paying the principal. Interest-only loans were a bad \nidea whose time came and it went. It may be good for certain forms of \ncommercial investment but not for residential.\n  No balloon payments. One of the biggest problems with these \nforeclosures was good people were loaned money with shoddy underwriting \nthat had balloon payments in 3, 5, or 7 years. People didn't know what \na balloon payment was. They thought it was something that flew in the \nair. A balloon payment is when the whole principle comes due all at \nonce and you are subject to the ability to refinance. That is not a \nqualified loan; that is a high-risk game.\n  No negative amortization. That was a bad idea whose times came and \nwent. Negative amortization meant you borrowed $100,000, but you made \npayments so at the end of the year you owed more, not less. That is a \nbad idea. That was predicated on rapid inflation or rapid appreciation \nwhich isn't always going to happen. And then requiring people to carry \nprivate mortgage insurance on their loans if they exceed 80 percent of \nthe loan to value of the house, a normal underwriting standard until we \ngot into the loosy-goosy time of the late 1990s and the decade of 2000 \nto 2010.\n  If we adopted in this legislation those parameters, to exempt lenders \nfrom shared participation, we would attract all the money like the good \nold days, then put the shared risk retention on those loans that are \nnot well underwritten; make the mortgage broker or the investment \nbanker hold 5 percent of an investment they sell because it didn't meet \nthese qualifications, what would happen? They wouldn't do it, because \nthey wouldn't hold the money. It would have prevented what has been \nalleged one of the brokerage houses did already. They would never short \nsomething and bet on it failing if they had a piece of it. They would \nonly do it if you had a piece of it and they didn't.\n  It is important, when we get into this regulation or reregulation of \nthe financial industry, that we also recognize we have some obligation \nto correct some of the mistakes the government made itself in the past \nthat caused the problem in the S in the 1980s and with nonqualified \nmortgages in the 1990s.\n  What I am suggesting simply is, let's take those things that are \ntried and true, not things we think will work but things we know will \nwork. Let's make them the gold standard. Let's make them the \nqualification for the attraction of money in mortgages to fund the \nhomes of the American people. Then let's say to those who want to take \na risky loan, let's say to those who want to have shoddy underwriting, \nlet's say to those who want to make a quick return and get out before \nthe dollar comes due, they will have to take the risk. Shared \nresponsibility or shared risk is precisely right as an insurance policy \nto protect against that. But the unintended consequence of shared risk \non a qualified, well underwritten loan is a higher interest rate for \nthe consumer and less attraction of capital for individuals who form \nthose loans to fund the housing purchases, which ultimately leads the \ngovernment to do with Freddie and Fannie what it did before--force them \nto make loans they should not, force the government and taxpayers to be \nat risk in part on those loans and bring us back to another period like \nthe S collapse or, later, like the financial market collapse of the \nlast couple years. There will be another one in the future if we don't \nrecognize the need to make qualified loans, well underwritten, do it as \nwe did in the good old days when America flourished, foreclosure rates \nwere low, and home ownership was within reach of 70 percent of the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to talk about the same issue the \nSenator from Georgia has discussed. First, I congratulate him. This is \na point we have been making on our side of the aisle. He has come up \nwith a thoughtful and appropriate way to address what was one of the \ncore drivers of our fiscal meltdown. If we look at what caused the \nfinancial crisis of late 2008, which has caused this significant \nrecession, which has caused us to go through all these expenditures as \na government and which has caused so many American people to suffer the \nconsequences of the recession, there were three or four major events \nthat generated this. One was money was too cheap for too long. That was \na Federal Reserve decision. But right at the essence of it was the \nissue of underwriting, the fact that there was a decoupling of the \npeople making the loan from the people who were responsible for the \nloan.\n  We had this whole service industry built up that was making money off \nof the fees for originating the loan and wasn't that concerned about \nthe ability of the person to repay the loan or the underlying asset. \nWhat the Senator from Georgia pointed out--and the proposal he has \nbrought forward is a very responsible way to address this fundamental \nproblem, which is the failure of underwriting--is a point we have been \nmaking on our side of the aisle. We have a whole series of what we \nthink are pretty good ideas as to how we can make financial reform work \nbetter. Certainly one of them is the idea of the Senator from Georgia.\n  I was impressed today to hear both leaders say they want to have a \nbill that is bipartisan, that is comprehensive, that is thoughtful, and \nthat addresses the issues we confront in this regulatory arena.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the atmosphere around here that has been \ncreated. Regrettably, there has been a huge amount of hyperbole, \nespecially in the last couple weeks. Most of it has not been directed \nat moving down the path of a thoughtful and mature and substantive \napproach to this issue. Most of it has been addressed at raising \nanecdotal events which then have been hyperbolized into single one-\nliners as to how you address them.\n  This issue of financial reform is far too complicated for one-liners. \nThat is a fact. It is an extremely complex undertaking to make sure we \naccomplish what we need to accomplish in regulatory reform. Our goals \nshould be two. First, we should do whatever we can to restructure the \nregulatory arena so we reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the \npotential of another systemic risk event. I will talk about what we \nneed to do in that area in a second.\n  Second, while we are doing that, we have to make sure the regulatory \nenvironment we put in place keeps America as the best place in the \nworld to create capital and get a loan for people who are willing to go \nout and take a risk, be entrepreneurs, and create jobs.\n  One of the great uniquenesses of our culture, what makes us different \nfrom so many other places in this world, what gives us such vibrance \nand energy as an economic engine, is that we have people who are \nwilling to go out and take risks. We have people who are willing to be \nentrepreneurs. And we have a system of capital formation and credit \nwhich makes capital and credit readily available to those individuals \nat reasonable prices. So as we go down the road of regulatory \nreorganization, we have to make sure we do not suffocate that great \nstrength of our Nation.\n  There are four basic issues before us today in regulatory reform, and \nnone of them are partisan. Yet in the atmosphere around here, you would \nthink they are all partisan, especially the\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\nPresident's recent speech, which was over the top in its partisan \ndialog.\n  First is how you end too big to fail. We cannot allow a system to \nexist where there is a belief out there in the markets that the \ntaxpayers are going to back up a company that has taken too many risks \nand has gotten itself in trouble. Why is that? Because if that happens, \nif there is a belief in the market that the taxpayers will step in and \nback up companies that are very large and systemic when they have taken \ntoo much risk and put themselves in dire economic straits--if there is \na belief that the taxpayer is going to step up and back up that \ncompany--capital will get perverted. Capital will not be efficiently \nused. Capital will flow in an inefficient way to companies which have \nproved themselves not to be fiscally responsible. That is not a good \nway for an economy to function--certainly a market economy to function. \nSo we have to end too big to fail.\n  This is not a partisan debate. Senator Dodd has brought forward a \nbill which he thinks ends too big to fail. In my view, it has some \nserious flaws. It is a good attempt, but it does not get there. Senator \nCorker and Senator Warner, from two different parties, have actually \nput together a concept--we call it resolution authority around here--\nwhich actually does end too big to fail and does it the right way. It \nessentially says if a company, if an entity--which is a huge entity--\ngets out of whack, overextends itself, gets too much risk, is no longer \nviable, well, then, we are going to resolve that company. The \nstockholders will be wiped out, unsecured bondholders will be wiped \nout, and the company will basically flow into bankruptcy and will not \nbe conserved. That is a good approach, and it is a bipartisan approach.\n  Another big issue: how you address regulatory oversight to try to \nanticipate a systemic event. Again, the Dodd bill makes an attempt in \nthis area, but there are ways we can improve it. We need to have all \nthe different regulators who have an important role in this sitting at \na table, most likely led by the Fed, who take a look at the broad \nhorizon of what is happening in the marketplace and saying: OK, in this \narea we have a problem arising. We have too many people doing too many \nthings which are at the margin of responsibility here. We are going to \nempower the agency which is responsible for that--the FDIC or the OCC \nor one of the other regulatory agencies--to go out and make sure that \nactivity ceases or is abated, and they are going to come back and \nreport to us so you have some oversight here.\n  That is the concept. It can be fleshed out in better terms. It goes \nto this issue which is raised by the Senator from Georgia--we should \nhave better underwriting standards as part of this exercise so in the \nmarketplace, real estate especially--residential real estate--we get \nback to the approach we should have taken to begin with, which is that \nwe know the asset value that is being lent to exists and that the \nperson can pay the loan back as the loan is adjusted over the years.\n  Thirdly, we have the issue of derivatives. Derivatives are a huge \npart of the market--massive. The number is $600 trillion of notional \nvalue--something like that; massive numbers. What do they do? They \nbasically make it possible for American companies especially to sell \ntheir products around the world or to take and put their products into \nthe market in a way that they are able to address issues which they do \nnot have control over.\n  For example, if you are Caterpillar equipment and you are selling \nsomething in China, you do not know if the currency value is going to \nchange--well, you do with China; that is a bad example--if you are \nselling something in Brazil, you do not know if the currency value is \ngoing to change, you do not know if there is going to be a change in \nthe cost of your materials you are building that tractor with, you do \nnot know a lot of different factors you do not have control over. So \nderivatives allow you to ensure over that.\n  That is a simple statement of what derivatives do. But that goes to \nall sorts of different activities--from financial entities, all the way \nacross the board to producers of goods. So there needs to be a regime \nput in place that makes these derivatives sounder, where we do not get \nan AIG type of situation where basically we are backing up what amounts \nto an insurance policy for a company with a name but actually no \nassets.\n  Senator Jack Reed from Rhode Island and I have been working for \nmonths--literally months--on a daily basis to try to work out such a \nregime. We think we are pretty close. We think it is going to be a good \nproposal. Nobody is going to like it, which we know means it is going \nto be a good proposal. But it is going to accomplish what we need to \ndo, which is to get more transparency and liquidity and margin in the \nmarket. There will be the opportunity to have end users who are exempt, \nbut there will also be a primary incentive to put people on a \nclearinghouse. To the extent you can move from a clearinghouse to an \nexchange, that will happen also, without undermining the market.\n  But the key here is to put in place a regime which does not force \ncompanies to go overseas to do their derivative activity. This is a \nvery fluid event. If we come forward with an overly regressive approach \nand an overly bureaucratic approach--one which basically responds to a \nhyperbole of the moment, which is that all derivatives are bad and not \ntransparent and therefore must be put on exchanges, something like \nthat--we are basically going to push offshore the vast amount of \nderivative activity that is critical to our industry in America being \ncompetitive. As a very practical matter, if we can develop a sound \nmarket--and we can develop a sound market--we want to be the nation \nwhere most people go to develop their derivatives because it is a big \nindustry and it is something we should keep onshore.\n  The fourth issue: consumer protection.\n  My time is up?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I see the Senator from Louisiana wants to \nspeak. But the point here is pretty obvious. This is not a partisan \nissue. We can resolve the issue of financial regulatory reform if we \nsit down and do it in a constructive, thoughtful way, step back, be \nmature, and take an approach that is thoughtful versus wrapped in \nhyperbole and popularism of the moment. I certainly hope we will take \nthat process and go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I join my colleagues in urging the \nSenate to come together--Republicans and Democrats--around a strong \nbipartisan approach to financial regulatory reform. We need to address \nthe critical causes behind the financial crisis of the last several \nyears, and we need to do it right and in a bipartisan way.\n  Unfortunately, we are not on that path yet. The Dodd bill, which the \nPresident and Chairman Dodd and others are trying to push to the floor, \nis a purely partisan approach and, unfortunately, it gets a lot of the \nbigger issues wrong.\n  First, and perhaps most importantly, the Dodd bill expands too big to \nfail. It does not end it. The Dodd bill ensures more future bailouts. \nIt does not get rid of the need for bailouts. It is not just me saying \nthat. As conservative an authority as Time magazine wrote a few weeks \nago:\n\n       Policy experts and economists from both ends of the \n     political spectrum say the bill does little to end the \n     problem of banks' becoming so big that the government is \n     forced to bail them out when they stumble. Some say the \n     proposed financial reform may even make the problem worse.\n\n  Another significant authority is Jeffrey Lacker. He is president of \nthe Richmond Federal Reserve. He was interviewed by CNBC. The CNBC \nreporter said: Well, doesn't this bill allow all sorts of resolution? \nIsn't that ending too big to fail? He said, very clearly:\n\n       It allows those things, but it does not require them.\n\n  That is the heart of the problem here: It allows those things, but it \ndoes not require them.\n\n       Moreover, it provides tremendous discretion for the \n     Treasury and FDIC to use that fund to buy assets from the \n     failed firm, to guarantee liabilities of the failed firm, to \n     buy liabilities of the failed firm. They can support \n     creditors in the failed firm. They have a tremendous amount \n     of discretion. And if they have the discretion, they are \n     likely to be forced to use it in a crisis.\n\n  Exactly, precisely, what we saw in the last few years.\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\n  William Isaac, former FDIC Chairman, has echoed exactly the same \nconcern:\n\n       Nearly all of our political leaders agree that we must \n     banish the ``too big to fail'' doctrine in banking, but \n     neither the financial reform bill approved in the House nor \n     the bill promoted by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris \n     Dodd will eliminate it.\n\n  Finally, Simon Johnson, a respected MIT professor:\n\n       Too big to fail is opposed by the right and the left, \n     though not apparently by the people drafting legislation. The \n     current financial reform bills are effectively a wash on the \n     issue.\n\n  There are multiple sections in the Dodd bill that expand too big to \nfail: sections 113 and 114 essentially creating a ``too big to fail'' \nclub; other sections creating a new permanent bailout slush fund; other \nsections allowing the bailout of creditors and codifying backdoor \nbailouts. That is a significant flaw in the bill--and not the only one.\n  My second big concern is that the Dodd bill creates a new all-\npowerful superbureaucracy with powers well beyond what is necessary to \nfix the problems that led to the last crisis. Again, there are several \nsections creating that new all-powerful bureaucracy. Perhaps the most \nsignificant one in my mind is one that subjects anybody who accepts \nfour installment payments to the authority of this huge new \nbureaucracy.\n  I have four kids. Three are teenagers with braces. That is their \northodontist. That is the electronic store down the street. None of \nthese folks were part of the problem that led to the financial crisis, \nbut they sure accept four installment payments. We cannot pay for three \nsets of braces otherwise. This is a huge new superbureaucracy with \nenormous authority.\n  Finally, another big problem with the Dodd bill is it does nothing to \nfix other key causes of the crisis. For instance, it does nothing about \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We have a so-called comprehensive bill, \nwith multiple titles, thousands--tens of thousands--of words, hundreds \nof pages, and the words ``Fannie Mae'' and ``Freddie Mac'' are never \nincluded, nowhere to be found. As Lawrence White, an economics \nprofessor, said:\n\n       The silence on Fannie and Freddie is deafening. How can \n     they look at themselves in the mirror every morning thinking \n     that they have a regulatory reform bill and they are totally \n     silent on Fannie and Freddie? It just boggles my mind.\n\n  And it boggles my mind as well.\n  Finally, nothing on lending standards, underwriting standards--\nexactly what Senator Isakson was talking about. The core fundamental \nproblem behind the last financial crisis was that all sorts of loans \nwere written that any reasonable person would know from the outset had \nno chance of making--the person getting the loan had no realistic \nchance of keeping up on that loan because there were no lending \nstandards, no underwriting standards. An institution wanted to start \nthe loan and sell it off and get it off its books and get quick profit \nfor initiating the loan. The Dodd bill doesn't address that and doesn't \ncreate those lending standards we need to create.\n  So where is the change? We need change. We need real reform, but \nwhere is the change?\n  These are the top firms that got bailout funds from the taxpayers, \nhundreds of billions of dollars all told. This is the old regulator of \nthose firms. This is the new regulator of those firms--exactly the \nsame. The regulation of these entities doesn't change, doesn't move--\nexactly the same. Again, we need regulatory reform, but we need it \nzeroed in on the real problems, and we need a strong bipartisan \napproach, not a highly partisan approach.\n  Many of us think these are the basic principles of true regulatory \nreform: permanently ending bailouts and too big to fail, which the Dodd \nbill clearly does not do; ending all of the bailout authorities of the \nFederal Reserve and FDIC because if they still have those authorities, \nthey will use them in the future; enhancing consumer protection without \ncreating this huge new superbureaucracy that goes well beyond what is \nneeded to address the causes of the crisis; creating greater \ntransparency for derivatives while allowing businesses to manage risk, \nas Senator Judd Gregg explained.\n  Begin to address Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those were key causes of \nthe crisis. There is no excuse for those four words to be completely \nleft out of a so-called comprehensive reform bill.\n  Establish minimum lending standards for mortgages. That was a key \ncause of the crisis. It is ridiculous for that to not be addressed in a \nso-called comprehensive reform bill.\n  Increase competition for credit rating agencies. We saw significant \nproblems there.\n  And dramatically improve coordination and communication among the \nregulators. This would be an approach targeted on the real problems, \nnot a bill using the last financial crisis as an excuse to reach \nanother preexisting agenda. This would be a bipartisan approach which \nthe American people can support, and I hope this will become the \noutline of the approach the Senate adopts as we move forward.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, this morning I met a friend who is \nvisiting, and he told me he was planning to go out and visit the FDR \nMemorial. I thought maybe the entire membership of the Senate should go \nout and visit the FDR Memorial.\n  Essentially, FDR did three things in response to the Great \nDepression: one was to create jobs, a second was to fix housing, and a \nthird was to repair the banking system. All three were essential. We \nhave been immersed in all three components now, responding to the great \nrecession we experienced and the great explosion of the economy in 2008 \nthat we are dealing with every day.\n  What did Roosevelt do in response to the banking challenge? Two main \nthings: First, he made sure American families could safely put their \nmoney back into banks. That is the origination of the deposit \ninsurance. Second, President Roosevelt made sure banks didn't engage in \nhigh-risk speculation that would put the banks and the American economy \nat risk because he understood the critical role of banks in lending to \nfamilies and lending to small businesses, and the last thing one wants \nin a recession is to have investment houses making speculative \ninvestments go down and then take the banks down with them. So you \ncompromise the lending to small businesses and to families at the same \ntime that the investments go awry. That is why he separated those \nactivities--highly risky investments separate from the lending that \nwould continue to fuel our economy.\n  Well, because of these regulations in the Roosevelt administration, \nthe wages of American families grew steadily right alongside the \nproductivity of our economy. Our economy was thriving and our middle \nclass was thriving. Indeed, we should judge the success of our economy \nnot by the gross domestic product, not by the size of the bonuses in \nboardrooms on Wall Street; we should judge the success of our economy \nby the living wages paid to working families and whether those wages \nare keeping pace with productivity our workers are bringing to the \neconomy. By that standard, we are not doing well.\n  By the 1980s and 1990s, Wall Street convinced Washington that we \ndon't need those Roosevelt-era regulations anymore, we don't need those \nwalls that protect lending from high-risk investing. Instead of having \noversight and accountability, we should just let Wall Street make their \nown rules. This is a little bit like a traffic system in which we say \nwe are kind of tired of those traffic lights. We don't really like \nthose stop signs and lane markers. It is a waste of paint. We can do \nwithout them. For a short time, everybody can just kind of speed down \nthe road and not worry about any rules to abide by until shortly \nthereafter when everyone crashes.\n  That is exactly what happened in our financial system over this last \ndecade. The SEC took down the leverage limits. The five largest \ninvestment banks were told to set their leverage wherever they wanted. \nWe had Bear Stearns in a single year going from leverage of 21 to 41. \nSo for every dollar they were investing, they were betting $20 by the \nstart of the year, but by the end of the year, as the SEC granted them \npermission, for every dollar they held, they were betting $40. They \nmake a tremendous amount of money on the way up\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\nwhen they can bet $40 for every dollar they hold, but they crash in a \nspectacular fashion when the market goes down in that situation.\n  Then, again, we had the Fed. The Fed puts monetary policy in the \npenthouse and safety and soundness on the upper floors. But what do \nthey do with their responsibility for consumer protection? They put it \ndown in the basement and they seal the doors. They let no daylight in \nand they let little communication occur between the consumer protection \nside and the safety and soundness and the monetary side.\n  They did absolutely nothing when a new product was invented in 2003, \na new form of subprime that had a 2-year teaser rate, a prepayment \npenalty that locked the family into that loan and prevented the family \nfrom escaping from that loan, and that had exploding interest rates \nthat would destroy the family. The Fed did absolutely nothing. Then \nWall Street said: You know what. These loans are worth so much because \nwe can pull so much money out of families with these loans, so we are \ngoing to pay a bonus to a broker if the broker ties a family into one \nof these loans. And those steering payments resulted in tons of \nfamilies who qualified for prime mortgages being steered into subprime \nmortgages. By a Wall Street Journal study, 60 percent of families who \nwere in subprime mortgages qualified for prime mortgages, but their \nbroker persuaded them that the best mortgage was one that was not in \ntheir best interests.\n  Then we had the rating agencies. The rating agencies had magic all \ntheir own. They didn't develop their own models to evaluate BBB bonds \nthat were mixed and sliced and diced into new packages of bonds. No. \nThey took their models from Wall Street, and based on those models \nthey said: If you take BBB bonds from over here and BBB bonds from over \nhere and you mix them together, we will rate 80 percent of the \nresulting bonds as AAA. Well, that is a money-making machine, but it \nalso undermined one of the key instruments the financial world depends \non; that is, accurate credit ratings.\n\n  Then we had lots of tricks and traps buried in the small print, \nstripping families of their capital. Things were happening in the \ncredit card industry such as sitting on a person's payment for 10 days \neven though it had arrived on time, sitting on it for 10 days and then \nposting it as late and charging a late fee. As a constituent from Salem \nsaid to me, where is the fairness in that? American citizens are saying \ntime and time again, when clauses written in the fine print defy \nfundamental fairness, where is the fairness in this?\n  So at every level we had a breakdown in our financial system. We know \nwhat happened. The deck was stacked against the ordinary citizen. It \nturned a banking system that is designed to help families, strengthen \nfamilies, strengthen small businesses into a casino for Wall Street's \nbig bets. When those bets went bad, the taxpayers--you and I--were left \nholding the bag.\n  Now, as the effort to restore fair rules of the road to Wall Street \nheats up here on the floor of the Senate, there are those on Wall \nStreet and those on this floor who want to block reform. They don't \nwant to fix any of these things I have been describing. Indeed, \nrecently the minority leader met with more than two dozen Wall Street \nexecutives and hedge fund managers and urged them to elect members of \nhis party who would stop these reforms that serve the American people. \nThen he came back down here and he whipped out his talking points from \nFrank Luntz and he said: This bill won't work. Why did he say that? \nBecause he doesn't want a bill to reform Wall Street and fix these \nrules and restore prosperity to our economy. He wants to take this \nelection year instead and serve a powerful constituency that doesn't \nwant any rules restored to the road.\n  Folks, that is just wrong. We have a responsibility. Just as our \nancestors not so long ago fixed the problems of the Great Depression, \nfixed the banking system, and restored a banking system that would take \nus forward in an orderly fashion and allow business to thrive in \nAmerica, to be the envy of the world in America, we have the \nresponsibility to do that today.\n  There are some who have said: Well, we want a free market. Let me \ntell my colleagues, a free market thrives with rules that allow orderly \nconduct because those rules create the integrity that gives people the \nfaith to utilize those markets. We saw with the stock market reforms \nthat people believe stocks are traded fairly in America, and therefore \nthey are willing to invest and, by investing, power up the companies \nthat are issuing public stock. It works when there is integrity in the \nmarket. Foreign investors will come and put their dollars in America if \nthey believe there is integrity in our system.\n  That is what these rules are about--rules that create a free market \nwith integrity so that it can power up the economy of America. That is \nwhat this is about. We are not talking about what some of my colleagues \nacross the aisle are talking about: preserving the status quo, which \nmeans freedom from oversight, freedom from accountability, freedom to \ntranslate BBB bonds and AAA bonds with a magic evaluation system; free \nto blow up the economy, which destroyed families' savings, families' \nretirements, families' jobs, often families' health care, and pretty \nmuch tore the foundation out from under the American working family.\n  This bill creates a consumer financial agency that will say: No more \ntrips and traps on basic financial products. We need to have that \nmission no longer locked in the basement. We need to have that mission \nin an agency that says we will not allow those tricks and traps and \nscams that have been perpetuated over the last decade, so that \nAmericans will not say: Where is the fairness in that? Instead, they \nwill say: Thank goodness these contracts are fair and serving our \nfamilies and our economy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator has \nspoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Is that my full allocation of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you. I will close by saying this bill must get \ndone because we have a responsibility to restore the foundations for \nour Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from \nOregon for his remarks. He has brought great passion for this issue to \nthe Senate. He serves with distinction on the Banking Committee. I \ncouldn't agree with him more that the spectacle of colleagues \nscampering up to Wall Street to offer their services, and interfering \nwith, obstructing, watering down, and impeding, of all things financial \nregulatory reform, after all we have been through, is not a spectacle \nthat is salutary.\n  I appreciate his remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2439-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2439-S2440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NOMINATIONS AND HOLDS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to talk for a minute about \nnominations and holds. The Senate's Executive Calendar contains the \nnames of those individuals whom President Obama has nominated to serve \nin his administration, and those positions require Senate confirmation. \nThe Executive Calendar also contains the names of those the President \nhas nominated to be Federal judges--it is called the Executive \nCalendar, but judicial offices are on it as well--at the district court \nlevel and the appellate level.\n  Since President Obama took office, this Senate has voted on 44 \nnominees. Some others have been approved by unanimous consent, but we \nhave had 44 votes on nominations. Of those 44 votes, 31 of them--that \nis 70 percent of the nominees we have confirmed--have been held over, \nfilibustered, and delayed by days, weeks, and months. The average \nlength of time these nominations have languished in the Senate has been \nover 106 days. That is 15 weeks--3\\1/2\\ months--from the time they were \nnominated to the time they were confirmed. That is just the average \ndelay. Some have spent 1 full year in Senate limbo as a result of holds \nby our colleagues.\n  If it has taken this long to confirm them, these must have been \ncontroversial nominees, and these must have been tough votes and close \nvotes for the Senate, one would think. Well, let's take a look--bearing \nin mind that it takes 51 votes to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\n  Sixteen of these nominees who have been held over, filibustered, or \ndelayed were subsequently approved when they came to a vote by more \nthan 90 votes in the Senate. Again, sixteen of the filibustered \nnominees passed the Senate with votes of more than 90. Another 10 have \nbeen approved with more than 80 votes--bear in mind that it only takes \n51 to get confirmed--and 3 more with more than 70 votes. That is 29 out \nof those 31 nominees who, when they finally came to their vote, were \napproved overwhelmingly, by enormous bipartisan majorities, in the \nSenate. They have spent 106.6 days, on average, waiting to be confirmed \nby those vast majorities--waiting to be confirmed overwhelmingly.\n  The only conclusion that a rational mind can draw from this is that \nthis is not about controversial nominees; this is about politics, plain \nand simple--the bare knuckles politics of obstruction, the kind of \npolitics that says I don't care if you are qualified for the job for \nwhich you were nominated. I don't care that the Department of State or \nthe Department of Homeland Security needs you for a critical job. I \ndon't care. You are going to sit on the Senate calendar for months and \nmonths and months so that I can score political points against the \nPresident, so that I can inhibit the deployment of this elected \nPresident's administration into the office of the government.\n  Well, that is wrong and it needs to stop.\n  As of Monday, the Executive Calendar contained the names of 101 \nnominees--101 individuals for critical jobs in agencies all across the \ngovernment that are now sitting on the Senate's Executive Calendar \nwaiting and waiting. I want to address some of the judges who have been \nwaiting for a long time, and I will ask that their nominations be \ncalled up and approved.\n  Mr. President, I will start with Judge Albert Diaz and Judge James \nWynn, a pair of judges who are Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals \nnominees. So I will call up Executive Calendar Nos. 656 and 657, the \nnominations of Judges Albert Diaz and James Wynn, nominees to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  Let me tell you who they are. Judge Diaz currently serves on North \nCarolina's Special Superior Court for Complex Business Cases. He was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2010, by a vote \nof 19 to 0. He has served in the Marine Corps and has 9 years of State \ncourt judicial experience.\n  Judge James Wynn was reported out of the Judiciary Committee the same \nday, January 28, 2010, by a vote of 18 to 1. He currently sits on the \nNorth Carolina Court of Appeals, the State's intermediate appellate \ncourt. He is a certified military trial judge and a captain in the U.S. \nNavy Reserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2440-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2440-S2441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to executive session, and notwithstanding rule XXII, the \nSenate proceed to Executive Calendar Nos. 656 and 657; that the \nnominations be confirmed en bloc; that the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table en bloc; that any statements relating to the \nnominations be printed in the Record, as if read, and the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  I ask for the regular order on the unanimous-consent request. The \nunanimous-consent request is pending right now, and there is nobody on \nthe floor to answer it or object to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am told a Senator is coming to make an objection, \nso I will withhold.\n  While we are waiting for a Republican Senator to come and object to \nthese nominees, they came out of the Judiciary Committee back in \nJanuary. They were voted out of the Judiciary Committee by, in one \ncase, a unanimous, bipartisan vote of 19 to 0.\n  I am informed that the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, is coming to \nobject. He sits on the Judiciary Committee. He likely was one of those \n19 who voted in favor of this nominee at the committee level. I don't \nknow who the one vote against Judge Wynn was, but he cleared the \ncommittee by a vote of 18 to 1--again, a strong bipartisan vote of \nsupport. Yet I am informed by the floor staff that they are finding \nsomebody to come and object to these nominees who have now been held \nthrough all of February, all of March, half of April, despite being, in \none case, unanimous votes in the Judiciary Committee, and the other an \n18-to-1 overwhelming bipartisan majority.\n  For the record, I am informed that the minority was aware that I was \ncoming to make these unanimous-consent requests; that they had full \nknowledge this was going to come. If they are unable to get somebody to \nthe floor to object, as far as I am concerned that is not my concern.\n  Mr. President, I renew the unanimous-consent request now that there \nis a Senator on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, might I ask my colleague to \nrestate the request?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes. It was to call up Executive Calendar Nos. 656 \nand 657, which are the nominations of Judge Albert Diaz and Judge James \nWynn to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. As the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona will recall, since he sits with me \non the Judiciary Committee, Judge Diaz was voted out by a vote of 19 to \n0 back on January 28, 2010. If my math is correct, that means the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona voted for this nominee in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Judge James Wynn was reported out the same day, January 28, by a vote \nof 18 to 1. I don't know if the Senator was the single dissenting vote \nin that overwhelming vote in support of Judge Wynn's nomination.\n  Judge Diaz served in the Marine Corps and has 9 years of State court \njudicial experience. Judge Wynn is a certified military trial judge and \na captain in the U.S. Navy Reserves.\n  My unanimous-consent request was that the Senate proceed to executive \nsession, and notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to Executive \nCalendar Nos. 656 and 657; that nominations be confirmed en bloc; that \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; that any \nstatements related to the nominations be printed in the Record, as if \nread, and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague restating the \nrequest. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, as I think \nmy colleagues are aware, the two leaders have worked out a process for \nconsideration of at least some of the judicial nominations. My \nunderstanding is, there is another agreement on at least one circuit \ncourt nomination that they are working out a time agreement on right \nnow and that would occur, I presume, later this week. I think it is \nimportant to let the two leaders work out those agreements. As a \nresult, reluctantly, I have to object to my colleague's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished \nSenator's objection. We do have 101 nominees on the Executive Calendar. \nThe objections have holds which are secret. They are holding up people, \nas I said, for an average of 106 days. While it is nice one or two \nmight be given a time agreement by the minority party, it does very \nlittle to relieve the blockade that the minority party is engaged in of \njudicial and Executive nominees.\n  I will continue forward. I call up Executive Calendar No. 701, the \nnomination of Nancy Freudenthal to be a judge for the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Wyoming. She passed out of the committee by \nvoice vote--a voice vote, as the Presiding Officer knows, is a vote \nwithout dissent--on February 11, 2010. She has decades of experience as \na public servant and as a lawyer in private practice. She currently is \nWyoming's First Lady.\n  If confirmed, she will be that State's first female Federal judge. It \nis the practice of the Judiciary Committee not to put forward judges \nunless the consent of the home Senators has been obtained. I point out \nthat both the Senators from Wyoming are Republicans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session, \nand notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar \nNo. 701, the nomination of Nancy\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\nFreudenthal; that the nomination be confirmed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements relating to the \nnomination be printed in the Record; and that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for the same reasons as noted earlier, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I call up Executive Calendar No. 702, \nthe nomination of Judge D. Price Marshall to serve on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Arkansas, a district court nominee \nwho has been held up and filibustered. This district court nominee, \nJudge Marshall, is currently a judge on the Court of Appeals for the \nState of Arkansas. He spent 15 years in private practice in Jonesboro, \nAR. He served as a law clerk to Seventh Circuit Judge Richard S. \nArnold. Judge Marshall was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on \nFebruary 11, 2010, by voice vote and without dissent. He has been held \nand blockaded on this floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session, \nand notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar \nNo. 702; that the nomination be confirmed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; that any statements relating to the nomination \nbe printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let's try another one.\n  I call up Executive Calendar No. 704. This is the nomination of Judge \nTimothy Black, again, a district court nominee, a local trial court \nnominee, to serve on the U.S. district Court for the Southern District \nof Ohio. Judge Black has served the Southern District of Ohio for 6 \nyears as a Federal magistrate judge. He is currently a Federal \nmagistrate judge in the court for which he is nominated as a district \njudge. Before that, he spent a decade as a municipal court judge and \nhad a long career as a civil litigator. He was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee without dissent after a voice vote on February 11 \nof this year. February, March, April--more than 2 months ago. He has \nlanguished on the Senate floor after clearing the committee without \ndissent--a judge, a district judge, a trial judge who serves now as the \nmagistrate judge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session, \nand notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar \nNo. 704, the nomination of Judge Timothy Black; that the nomination be \nconfirmed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that \nany statements relating to the nomination be printed in the Record; and \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for the same reasons stated before, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Lael Brainard, \nof the District of Columbia, to be an Under Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12 \nnoon will be equally divided and controlled between the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, with the \nSenator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, controlling 15 minutes of the time \ncontrolled by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I probably will not take the 15 minutes \nbut somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Lael Brainard to be \nUnder Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.\n  I do not think it is unreasonable for the American people to expect \nnominees to important posts in the Treasury Department to have a clean \nrecord in the payment of their taxes. After all, Treasury is \nresponsible for collecting taxes. Treasury nominees have a special \nresponsibility to live up to the same high standards the Department \ndemands from ordinary citizens. But the American people deserve much \nmore than just someone with a clean tax record. They deserve a nominee \nwho is honest, trustworthy, and straightforward.\n  The Finance Committee's bipartisan investigation of Ms. Brainard \nrevealed she does not have a clean tax record. At worst, she refuses to \nbe straightforward and honest about her tax records.\n  The Finance Committee looks into the tax record of every nominee who \ncomes before the committee. A routine examination of Ms. Brainard's \npast few tax returns revealed many problems. When asked if she has paid \nall her taxes on time, she did not reveal several cases in which she \nhad failed to pay her taxes on time.\n  When she was asked, on her nomination questionnaire, if she was \ncurrent with all her taxes at the time she was nominated, she replied \nyes. But, in fact, that was not true. She was well overdue on paying \ncounty property taxes and DC employment insurance taxes at the time.\n  There were also several problems with the forms she was supposed to \nfile to prove that her household employee was legally able to work in \nthis country. On one form, there was a serious problem with a space \nthat the household employee is required to sign. It appears Ms. \nBrainard filled in that space with her own signature, and she could not \nprovide an explanation of why she did so.\n\n  On another form, dates appear to have been written over to change the \nyear. She could provide no explanation of why this was done.\n  On two different forms, Ms. Brainard missed the deadline for \ncompleting the employer portion of the form. On another form, the \nemployer portion was filled in 1 month before the employee portion, but \nthe law requires the employee portion to be filled in first.\n  On yet another form, the employee certification section lists her \nhusband's name, but the signature is hers.\n  On another form, the employee section is filled in, but the required \nemployer certification section was left blank.\n  There was another problem of the home office deduction which she \nclaimed in the past several years. She could not provide a clear and \nconsistent reason for taking a home office deduction of one-sixth of \nher household expenses. She was unable to provide a credible reason for \nthe size of the deduction. She reduced her home office deduction to \none-twelfth of household expenses on her 2008 tax return. However, she \ndid not reduce the deduction on her 2005, 2006 or 2007 tax return, all \nof which had the inflated deduction.\n  Some Senators might come to the conclusion that these tax problems \nalone should not disqualify the nominee. They may say that, at worst, \nthis is simply a pattern of sloppiness. Do we want someone who is so \nsloppy in her tax responsibilities to be in charge of international \naffairs at the Treasury Department?\n  But this is not just a matter of sloppiness. This is a matter of \ntotal lack of candor with the Finance Committee and, by extension, with \nthe Senate and, by extension, with the American people.\n  Ms. Brainard spent 9 months stonewalling the Finance Committee over \nall these tax issues. She gave evasive and incomplete answers to the \nstaff of the committee. The level of evasiveness of this nominee \nappears to\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\nbe unprecedented. The committee had to submit 10 rounds of questions to \nclarify inconsistencies and incomplete answers Ms. Brainard had given. \nSeveral of those questions have been left unanswered.\n  The many tax problems of this nominee and the extreme difficulty the \nFinance Committee had in getting straight answers about these problems \nwas outlined in a bipartisan memo Senator Grassley entered into the \nCongressional Record on December 23 of last year. If we cannot trust \nMs. Brainard to be truthful and straightforward when she is a nominee, \nhow can the American people trust her to be straightforward and honest \nwhen she is confirmed and serving in the Obama administration?\n  As Under Secretary for International Affairs, she would be involved \nin some highly sensitive issues, such as the determination of whether \nChina is manipulating its currency.\n  Do we want someone with such an abysmal record on truthfulness \nserving in this high position in the Treasury Department representing \nour country?\n  This is not just a matter of taxes. It is a matter of trust. The \nAmerican people deserve a person we can trust in this very important \nposition. That person is not Lael Brainard. We cannot trust someone who \ngives evasive, inconsistent, and incomplete answers to routine \nquestions. We cannot trust someone who spends 9 months refusing to come \nclean about her record. We cannot trust someone who refuses to be \nstraightforward about her tax problems because she is so desperate to \nbe confirmed.\n  Mr. President, someone with this record is a terrible choice to serve \nin the Treasury Department. I urge my fellow Senators and my colleagues \nto consider this record before they vote on this nomination. I urge a \n``no'' vote on this nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Yes, I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk not about \nobstructionism but, rather, about transparency and the rules. And the \nrule I am going to talk about is a rule that, in fact, we embraced in \nthe last Congress. When I first came to the Senate, we embraced this \nrule by a vote; I think it was 92 to 6. We said we are going to change \nthe way we do business around here when it comes to transparency. I \nthought it was a great moment. I was excited that we were making these \nbold changes about the way the Senate works, to open the doors and let \nthe sun shine in.\n  Imagine my disappointment some 2 years later when I realized that for \nmany Members of this body, that was a meaningless exercise because in \nthe area of secret holds, we are doing no better today than we were \nbefore we passed S. 1 in those early weeks of my time in the Senate, in \n2007.\n  Section 512 of that bill deals with secret holds. What we tried to do \nin that bill was to make sure that if a Senator wanted to oppose \nsomebody, no problem; if he or she wanted to hold somebody, that is \ntheir right as a Senator. But own it. Own it. We are not here to be in \na back room making a deal to leverage something for some kind of pork \nwe may want in our district. What we are here to do is the people's \nbusiness. If a Senator has an objection to a nominee, they should tell \nthe public they have an objection and, frankly, they owe the public an \nexplanation as to why. We are here working for them. We are doing the \npeople's business here. We are not doing some backroom deal. We are \ndoing the people's business.\n  So transparency is what this is about today, and section 512 lays out \nthe exact steps that are necessary in order to make sure all of the \nholds become public. The process begins pretty simply: by someone \nmaking a unanimous consent request to move the nomination. When that \nmotion is made, then the Senator who has the secret hold must submit a \nnotice of intent specifying the reasons for the hold, and within 6 days \nthat must be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  Why do Senators hold secretly? Well, I can't think of a good reason. \nI mean, sometimes it is that they want to slow things down, and they do \nnot want to be honest about it. Sometimes it is that they want to \nleverage it for a deal in their State from that agency, and they do not \nwant to be forthcoming about that. That seems a little unseemly, to \nsay: I am going to block an unrelated nomination in order to get a \ndeal. And that is the kind of stuff people are sick of. That is the \nkind of stuff they do not want us to do anymore. They want us to be \nupfront. If a Senator wants to block a nomination in an agency because \nthat agency is not doing their will, then they need to be proud of \nthat.\n  Here is the tricky part about this rule. Once the motion is made and \ntherefore the clock starts ticking and a Member has to admit they have \na secret hold and they have to own that hold, then what they can do is, \nbefore the 6 days, they can withdraw their hold, and that is when we \nstart seeing an imitation of the World Wrestling Federation tag-team \nmatch. That is when another Senator comes in and tags up and says: \nWell, I will do a secret hold now. And then a motion is once again \nmade, and guess what. That Senator backs out after 6 days and somebody \nelse takes his or her place with the secret hold. So we get secret \nholds forever, ad nauseam--secret hold, secret hold, secret hold.\n  So I come to the floor today to begin the running of the clock. We \nhave over 80 nominations pending. In a comparable time in the Bush \nadministration, we had five. We have around 80. I am now going to begin \nto make a motion on these 80. Why this particular group? I will tell \nyou why this particular group. No objection has been made to these \nnominees in committee. Let me say that again. Every single one of the \nnames I am going to move this morning had no objection in committee. So \nwe have literally had every Member of this body on one of these other \ncommittees, and nobody objected. Nobody said a word. So right now, it \nis very difficult for the public to figure out why all these important \nnominees are not moving forward.\n  Vote no. I am sure there have been nominees on whom I have voted no. \nThere is a nominee on whom I put a hold. I put a hold on a nominee, but \nI was very upfront and put in the record at committee why I put a hold. \nI wrote a letter on why I put a hold. I wanted everyone to know why \nthis nominee was being held. I thought it was an important part of my \nduty as a Senator to explain why I was doing what I was doing.\n  So vote no. Hold a nominee. But don't do it under cover of darkness \nunless you have something to be ashamed of. If a Senator has something \nto be ashamed of, then they can do the tag team. The law lets them do \nit. They can just keep playing tag and getting another secret hold and \nthen tag off again and get another secret hold.\n  If we want to know why the country doesn't trust us, it is because of \nthis kind of nonsense, these kinds of secret hold shenanigans or, as my \nmother would say, this poodle dog. That is her word for nonsense. I \ndon't think she means to insult all the poodle owners in the world, but \nit is a good phrase--poodle dog--for what this is. It is nonsense.\n  Mr. President, when I have 1 minute left, if you will notify me, I \nwill begin making the motions on these people whose nominations are \nbeing secretly held by Senators and who are not being allowed their \ntime to even respond to whatever might be the secret reason why they \nare being held.\n\n\n   Nomination of Stuart Gordon Nash to be an Associate Judge of the \n               Superior Court of the District of Columbia\n\n  Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar No. 333; that the \nnomination be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table, no further motions be in order, the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any statements \nrelating to the nominee be printed at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  There being no objection, the nomination considered and confirmed is \nas follows:\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\n                             the judiciary\n\n       Stuart Gordon Nash, of the District of Columbia, to be an \n     Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the District of \n     Columbia for the term of fifteen years.\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar No. \n404, the nomination of Warren Miller, Office of Civilian Radioactive \nWaste Management, Department of Energy; that the nomination be \nconfirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, no further motions be in order, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and any statements relating to the \nnominee be printed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, I will make the same brief \nstatement I made with Senator Whitehouse. Some of these nominees are \nsubject to discussion between the two leaders, working out time \nagreements for their consideration--at least some of the court \nnominees.\n  Now, I don't know about this specific nominee. I would say that I \nhave no secret holds on anyone, so this is not on my own behalf. But in \norder to preserve the deliberation between the two leaders, on behalf \nof the minority I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Missouri yield for a question?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona suggested that \nthe leaders--meaning the Democratic and Republican leaders--wanted \nthese held. Is the Senator from Missouri able to represent to the body \nthat Senator Reid would like to see all the names she is calling moved \nforward today, at this moment; that he is not asking for a delay in the \nconsideration of any of these nominations?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. All of these nominees have secret holds. The purpose \nof my exercise today is to begin to enforce the rule around here that \neverybody voted for, with the exception of a handful of people, that we \nweren't going to do secret holds anymore.\n  I am certainly aware that the leader supports us doing this; that the \nsecret hold has brought the nomination process not only to a halt but, \nmore importantly, it has done it without the public even understanding \nwhy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will ask a further question, through the Chair. So the \nrepresentation that these names or nominations are being held because \nof the leaders--meaning the Democratic and Republican leaders--is not \naccurate? There is no intention of the Democratic leader to hold any of \nthese nominations; is that not true?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. That is true.\n  Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar No. 500, which is the \nnomination of Julie Reiskin, member of the LSC; that the nomination be \nconfirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, no further motions be in order, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and any statements relating to the \nnominee be printed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, I am trying to follow the \nnumbers as my colleague is going down through the unanimous consent \nrequests, and I think my colleague skipped over the name of John J. \nSullivan, of Maryland, Calendar No. 208, to be a member of the Federal \nElection Commission. Is there some objection on the other side or might \nwe have an explanation as to why that name was skipped over?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I would be happy to----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Regular order.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Regular order, but let me explain how this list was \ncompiled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has made a unanimous \nconsent request. Is there objection to that request?\n  Mr. KYL. I would be happy to object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. By the way, just for the edification of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, there is one of these nominees on here who I believe is \nbeing secretly held by a Democrat. And by the way, I want to point out \nthat the rule that does try to bring transparency to this process was \none that was sponsored by Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley in a \nbipartisan way. The Wyden-Grassley effort that spanned a number of \nyears was a bipartisan attempt to change and reform the way the Senate \nworked to provide more transparency. So this is really about \ntransparency and this is about secret holds, and my criticism for \nsecret holds is a bipartisan criticism. I don't think anybody should do \na secret hold. I don't care if they are a Republican, a Democrat, an \nIndependent, or any other party label, secret holds have no place in a \npublic body.\n  Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar No. 501; that the \nnomination of Gloria Valencia-Weber of New Mexico, Legal Services \nCorporation, be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table, no further motions be in order, the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action, and any statements \nrelated to the nominee be printed at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar No. \n556; that the nomination be confirmed--that is, the nomination of \nBenjamin Tucker for the Office of National Drug Control Policy--the \nmotion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table, no further \nmotions be in order, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and any statements relating to the nominee be printed \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar No. 581, the nomination \nof John Laub to be Director of the National Institute of Justice; that \nthe nomination be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, no further motions be in order, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and any \nstatements related to the nominee be printed in the Record at the \nappropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. For reasons stated earlier, Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar No. \n589, the nomination of Anthony Coscia; that the nomination be \nconfirmed, the motions to reconsider be made and laid upon the table, \nno further motions be in order, the President be immediately notified \nof the Senate's action, and any statements relating to the nominee be \nprinted at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, let me just sum up. I had 20 I was \ngoing to try to do today. There are 80 of them. I will be back. This is \nnot about trying to rush through nominations, this is about trying to \nmake the rules work the way we wrote them. That means that beginning \nimmediately, all of the motions I just made, the Members who are \nholding those nominees have an obligation under the law--under the law \nthey have an obligation to ``submit a notice of intent specifying the \nreasons for his or her objection to a certain nomination,'' and not \nmore than 6 session days after today, that must be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  These are the first 15 or so. I will continue to get them all on the \nrecord, hopefully by the end of the week, so that everyone knows next \nweek, and maybe we will figure out why all these people are being held \nsecretly. This is not about saying you should not vote no on these \npeople. This is not even about not debating these people. This is about \ntransparency and open government. That should be a bipartisan value, an \nall-American value in which we can all believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired.\n  The Chair will clarify for the record that Executive Calendar No. \n333, Gordon Nash of the District of Columbia, to be an associate judge \nof the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, has been confirmed.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL.

Mr. Presdient, the Senate yesterday, by a vote of 84 to \n10, invoked cloture to end a Republican filibuster of President Obama's \nnomination of Lael Brainard to be Under Secretary at Treasury. As I \nsaid before that vote, the majority leader has taken a significant step \nto address the nominations crisis created by Senate Republican \nobstruction. Regrettably, that obstruction made it necessary for the \nSenate majority leader to file five cloture petitions to bring an end \nto Republican filibusters and allow the Senate to carry out its advice \nand consent responsibilities.\n  The refusal by Republicans month after month to come to agreements to \nconsider, debate, and vote on nominations is a dramatic departure from \nthe Senate's traditional practice of prompt and routine consideration \nof noncontroversial nominations. Their practices have led to delayed \nup-or-down votes for more than 100 nominations stalled from final \nSenate action. The American people should understand that these are all \nnominations favorably reported by the committees of jurisdiction and \nare mostly nominations that were reported without opposition or with a \nsmall minority of negative votes. Regrettably, this has been an ongoing \nRepublican strategy and practice during President Obama's entire \nPresidency.\n  Twenty-five of those stalled nominations are to fill vacancies in the \nFederal courts. They have been waiting for Senate action since being \nfavorably reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee as long ago as \nlast November.\n  To put this in perspective, by this date during George W. Bush's \nPresidency, the Senate had confirmed 45 Federal circuit and district \ncourt judges, on its way to confirming 100 judicial nominations by the \nend of his first 2 years in office. I know, I was the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee during much of that time, and worked hard to \nmake sure that President Bush's nominees were not given the same unfair \ntreatment given President Clinton's judicial nominees by Senate \nRepublicans. Senate Democrats made real progress with respect to \njudicial vacancies. We did treat President Bush's judicial nominees \nmore fairly than Republicans had treated President Clinton's and \nconfirmed 100 during the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee in \n2001 and 2002.\n  President Obama began sending us judicial nominations 2 months \nearlier than President Bush had and still only 18 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court confirmations have been allowed. If Republicans would \nagree to allow the Senate to act on the additional 25 judicial \nnominations reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee but on \nwhich Senate Republicans are preventing Senate action, we could be at a \ncomparable figure to the pace we attained in 2001 and 2002. As it \nstands we are 60 percent behind what we achieved during President \nBush's first 2 years.\n  Republicans continue to stand in the way of these nominations despite \nvacancies that have skyrocketed to over 100, more than 40 of which are \n``judicial emergencies,'' as caseloads and backlogs grow and vacancies \nare left open longer and longer.\n  I understand and share the frustration of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland who came before the Senate earlier today to speak about this \nobstruction. In the time he had, he asked the Senate to consider 5 of \nthe 25 judicial nominees stalled on the calendar, and each time there \nwas a Republican objection. He made the point that these judicial \nnominations have not only been waiting a long time, but they were \napproved unanimously or nearly unanimously by all Republican and \nDemocratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee. Still, after weeks, and \nin some cases months, Republicans will not consent to their \nconsideration. They were nominees who are supported by home State \nSenators, including Republican home State Senators. Still, Republicans \nwill not enter into agreements for their consideration.\n  I began urging the Republican leadership last December to allow the \nSenate to make progress on these nominations by agreeing to immediate \nvotes on those judicial nominees that were reported by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee without dissent, and to agree to time agreements to \ndebate and vote on the others. Presently, there are 18 judicial \nnominations being stalled from Senate consideration by Republican \nobjection even though when they were considered by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee no Republican Senators on the committee voted against a \nsingle one. This is the Republican strategy of delay and obstruction--\ndelay and obstruct even those nominees they support. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the eleventh circuit \nuntil this year. They delayed confirmation of Judge Joseph Greenaway of \nNew Jersey to the third circuit. They delayed and filibustered the \nnomination of Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the fourth circuit, \nwho was then unanimously approved.\n  I further call upon Republicans to agree to time agreements on each \nof the other seven judicial nominees ready for final Senate action. \nOnly one Republican Senator in the Judiciary Committee voted against \nJudge Wynn of North Carolina; only three voted against Judge Vanaskie \nof Pennsylvania; only four voted against Ms. Stranch of Tennessee, who \nis supported by the senior Senator from Tennessee, a Republican and a \nmember of the Senate Republican leadership. Senate Republicans should \nidentify the time they require to debate the nominations of Justice \nButler of Wisconsin, Judge Chen of California, Judge Pearson of Ohio, \nand Judge Martinez of Colorado, who are all well-qualified nominees for \ndistrict court vacancies, which are typically considered and confirmed \nwithout lengthy debate. They should not now be held up because they \nwere targeted unfairly in committee by Republicans applying a new \nstandard for district court nominees never used with President Bush's \nnominees, whether we were in the majority or the minority.\n  Republican obstruction has the Senate on a sorry pace to confirm \nfewer than 30 judicial nominees during this Congress--not the 100 we \nconfirmed in 2001 and 2002. Last year, only 12 circuit and district \ncourt judges were confirmed. That was the lowest total in more than 50 \nyears. So far this year, only six more have been considered.\n  The majority leader was required to file cloture on the nomination of \nBarbara Keenan of Virginia to the fourth\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\ncircuit. Judge Keenan's nomination was stalled for 4 months. After the \ntime-consuming process of cloture, her nomination was approved 99 to 0. \nThere was no reason or explanation given by Senate Republicans for \ntheir unwillingness to proceed earlier or without having to end their \nfilibuster on that nominee either.\n  Similarly, there has yet to be an explanation for why the majority \nleader was required to file cloture to consider the nominations of \nJudge Thomas Vanaskie to the third circuit and Judge Denny Chin to the \nsecond circuit, both widely respected, long-serving district court \njudges. Judge Vanaskie has served for more than 15 years on the Middle \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, and Judge Chin has served for 16 years on the \nSouthern District of New York. Both nominees have mainstream records, \nand both were reported by the Judiciary Committee last year with \nbipartisan support. Judge Chin, who was the first Asian-Pacific \nAmerican appointed as a Federal district court judge outside the ninth \ncircuit, and if confirmed would be the only active Asian-Pacific \nAmerican judge to serve on a Federal appellate court, was reported by \nthe committee unanimously.\n  This obstruction and delay is part of a partisan pattern. Even when \nthey cannot say ``no,'' Republicans nonetheless demand that the Senate \ngo exceedingly slow. The practice is continuing. The majority leader \nhas had to file cloture 22 times already to end the obstruction of \nPresident Obama's nominees. That does not count the many other nominees \nwho were delayed or are being denied up-or-down votes by Senate \nRepublicans refusing to agree to time agreements to consider even \nnoncontroversial nominees. That is the frustration I share with Senator \nWhitehouse and many others. If Republicans wish to oppose a nomination \nthey can, but they are stalling noncontroversial nominations that they \nsupport.\n  The Senate should be better than this. These Republican practices are \ndestructive. When we see that Americans are frustrated with Congress, \nit is these kinds of practices that contribute to that frustration. I \nurge the Senate Republican leadership to change its ways. Agree to \nprompt consideration of noncontroversial nominees and enter into time \nagreements to debate and vote on those nominees that they oppose. Quit \nwasting the time of the Senate. The American people want us to act on \nWall Street reform, not be bogged down in delaying tactics for the sake \nof delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the President will \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action with respect to the \nconfirmation of the Brainard nomination.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes and that I be followed by Senator Burris for 5 minutes, at \nwhich point the Senate will recess for the party caucuses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a front-page story of the New York Times \ntoday points to the fact of the enormous power of big money in terms of \nfinancial reform. They say:\n\n       With so much money at stake, it is not surprising that more \n     than 1,500 lobbyists, executives, bankers and others have \n     made their way to the Senate committee that on Wednesday will \n     take up legislation to rein in derivatives. . . .\n\n  When Congress deregulated Wall Street and allowed them to do pretty \nmuch anything they wanted to do--which brought us to where we are \ntoday; i.e., a massive recession--they spent, over a 10-year period, $5 \nbillion--$5 billion--in order to work their way on Congress.\n  Last year, as we began to address financial reform, they spent $300 \nmillion. So the issue we are debating now is not whether Congress will \nregulate Wall Street, it is whether Congress will continue to be \nregulated by Wall Street.\n  Their power is extraordinary. Their money is unlimited. If there was \never a time in American history where the Senate had to start standing \nup to big money interests and represent the needs of ordinary \nAmericans, this is the time. The American people are looking.\n  Let me just touch on four issues that I think are key, if we are \nserious--underline ``serious''--about financial reform.\n  No. 1, we have to break up the huge financial institutions which are \nat the cause of the crisis we are in and which exert so much power over \nour economy. The four major U.S. banks--Bank of America, Citigroup, \nJPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo--issue two-thirds of the credit cards \nin this country, write half of the mortgages, and collectively hold \n$7.4 trillion in assets, about 52 percent of the Nation's estimated \ntotal output last year. Despite the fact that we bailed these banks out \nbecause they were too big to fail, incredibly, three out of four of \nthese institutions are now larger today than they were when we bailed \nthem out.\n  Enough is enough. I am joined as a progressive by many conservatives \nwho understand that we cannot continue to have that concentration of \nownership, not just in terms of the liability to the American people in \nterms of too big to fail but in terms of their monopoly control on the \nentire economy. So if we are serious about financial reform, now is the \ntime to start breaking up these behemoths that exhibit certain enormous \nimpacts on our whole economy.\n  No. 2, we have to end the absurdity of a Wall Street selling \ntrillions of dollars in exotic financial tools, instruments, at the \nsame time small and medium-sized businesses are unable to get the loans \nthey need in order to create the jobs our country desperately is in \nneed of. At a time when we are in the midst of a major recession, at a \ntime when we are losing our competitive advantages in the global \neconomy, it is absolutely absurd that our largest financial \ninstitutions continue to trade trillions in esoteric financial \ninstitutions which make Wall Street the largest gambling casino in the \nworld. We need to have them start investing in the real economy, the \nproductive economy, in small and medium-sized businesses, in \ntransforming our energy system and helping us rebuild our \ninfrastructure, and in transportation and other desperate needs. They \ncan no longer live isolated from the real world and engage in bets on \nwhether oil is going to go up 6 months from now or whether the housing \nmarket goes down.\n  If we are serious about real financial reform, we need to pass \nnational usury legislation. I get calls every week from Vermonters who \nare sick and tired of paying 25-percent or 30-percent interest rates on \ntheir credit cards. Every major religion points out that usury is \nimmoral. It is wrong to charge people outrageously high interest rates \nwhen they are in desperate need. We need national usury legislation. I \nwill be offering an amendment which will cap at 15 percent the amount \nfinancial institutions can charge on credit cards, which is exactly \nwhat exists for credit unions today.\n  Lastly, if we are serious about real financial reform, we need \ntransparency at the Federal Reserve. The Fed cannot continue to operate \nin almost total secrecy. During the bailout, large financial \ninstitutions received trillions of dollars in zero or near-zero \ninterest loans. Who received those loans and what were the terms? The \nFed is not telling the American people. Did some of those banks turn \naround and in a mammoth welfare scam invest that Fed money, zero-\ninterest money, in government Treasury bonds at 3 percent or 4 percent? \nThe Fed is not telling us the answer to that question as well. It is \ntime we had transparency at the Fed so the American people know what \nour Central Bank is doing.\n  Most of all, we need to end the ``heads bankers win, tails everybody \nelse loses'' financial system that currently exists in the United \nStates today. The American people are profoundly disgusted with the \ngreed and recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street. They cannot \nunderstand how the very same people who created this recession in which \nmillions of workers have lost their jobs, people have lost their homes, \npeople have lost their savings, that these very same people are now \nreceiving multimillion dollar bonuses. People don't understand that, \nnor do I, in fact. So we need a new Wall Street. We need real financial \nreform. I hope, in fact, that the\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\nSenate and the House are prepared to stand up to the very powerful \nspecial interests who do not want us to do that.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, when I came to Washington over a year ago, \nthis country faced an economic crisis greater than anything we have \nseen in generations. So my colleagues and I set out to work. Under \nPresident Obama's strong leadership, we passed a landmark stimulus \npackage that stopped the bleeding. We did what was necessary to prevent \na complete economic collapse and set America back on the road to \nrecovery.\n  Since that time, we have come a long way. Many key economic \nindicators have started to turn around, but we are not out of the woods \nyet. The economy has started to grow again, but unemployment is still \ntoo high, and rampant foreclosures continue to threaten families in my \nhome State and across the country. During the first 3 months of this \nyear, almost 15,000 homeowners went into foreclosure in Illinois alone. \nDespite our best efforts to modify mortgages to make them more \naffordable, that is twice as many foreclosures as we saw during the \nsame period last year. This is unacceptable. We are making progress, \nbut it simply isn't enough.\n  Today, America no longer stands at the brink of disaster, but we are \nstill vulnerable to the same recklessness that led to this crisis in \nthe first place. For years, at big corporations such as Goldman Sachs, \nWall Street bankers packaged bad mortgages together and sold them to \ninvestors. They knew these investment vehicles would inevitably fail, \nso they turned around and bet against them. They bet against the \nAmerican people. They sought to make a profit off of the misfortunes of \ntheir own customers. They allegedly committed fraud, and that is why \nthey are currently being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission \non behalf of the American people. As a former banker, I understand the \nseriousness of this misconduct. I know it continues to pose a dramatic \nthreat to the American financial system.\n  That is why we need to pass strong financial reform to prevent bad \nbehavior on Wall Street from sinking ordinary folks on Main Street. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reform legislation \nintroduced by Senator Dodd. This bill would prevent Goldman Sachs and \nother companies from getting us into a mess in the first place, and it \ncan help ensure that we will never end up in this position again.\n  This legislation creates a consumer protection bureau designed to \nshield ordinary Americans from unfair, deceptive, and abusive financial \npractices. It would establish an oversight council tasked with keeping \na close eye on emerging risks so that we are never taken by surprise \nagain. It would end so-called too big to fail, protect taxpayers from \nunnecessary risks, and eliminate the need for future bailouts.\n  This bill would also increase transparency and accountability for \nbanks, hedge funds, and the derivative market, so a big company such as \nGoldman Sachs would not be able to get away with their alleged fraud \nanymore.\n  These basic reforms will establish clear rules of the road for the \nfinancial services industry so we can keep the market free and fair \nwithout risking another economic collapse. But if we fail to take \naction, if we do not pass this reform bill, then we will be right back \nwhere we started, with no safeguards against this kind of deception and \nabuse in the future. I call upon my colleagues to join me in supporting \nSenator Dodd's bill when it comes to the floor this week. I ask my \nfriends on both sides of the aisle to stand with me on the side of the \nAmerican people. Let us pass financial reform legislation, and let's do \nit without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2447-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record following my remarks an article from Newsweek magazine by \nGeorge F. Will entitled ``This Nuclear Option Is Nuclear.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Thursday is Earth Day. Actually, it is \nthe 40th anniversary of Earth Day. It is a good day to celebrate by \ncreating a national resolve in our country to build 100 new nuclear \npower plants in the next 20 years, which would be the best way to \ncreate the largest amount of pollution-free, carbon-free electricity. \nToday, nuclear power produces 20 percent of America's electricity but \n69 percent of all of our carbon-free, pollution-free electricity.\n  During 2009, America's national energy policy looked more like a \nnational windmill policy--the equivalent of going to war in sailboats. \nIf we were going to war, the United States wouldn't think of putting \nits nuclear navy in mothballs. Yet we did mothball our nuclear plant \nconstruction program--our best weapon against climate change, high \nelectricity prices, polluted air, and energy insecurity. Although 107 \nreactors were completed between 1970 and 1990, producing 20 percent of \nour electricity today--which, as I said, is 69 percent of our carbon-\nfree electricity--the United States has not started a new nuclear plant \nin 30 years.\n  Instead of using our own nuclear power invention to catch up with the \nrest of the world, President Obama, in his inaugural address, set out \non a different path: America would rely upon ``the sun, the winds, and \nthe soil'' for energy. There was no mention of nuclear power. Windmills \nwould produce 20 percent of our electricity. To achieve this goal, the \nFederal Government would commit another $30 billion in subsidies and \ntax breaks.\n  To date, almost all the subsidies for renewable energy have gone to \nwindmill developers, many of which are large banks, corporations, and \nwealthy individuals. According to the Energy Information \nAdministration, big wind receives an $18.82 subsidy per megawatt hour--\n25 times as much per megawatt hour as subsidies for all other forms of \nelectricity production combined. Last year's stimulus bill alone \ncontained $2 billion in windmill subsidies. Unfortunately, most of the \njobs are being created in Spain and China. According to an American \nUniversity study, nearly 80 percent of that $2 billion of American \ntaxpayer money went to overseas manufacturers. Despite the billions in \nsubsidies, not much energy is being produced. Wind accounts for just \n1.3 percent of America's electricity--available only when the wind \nblows, of course, since wind cannot be stored, except in small amounts.\n  Conservation groups have begun to worry about what they call the \n``renewable energy sprawl.'' For example, producing 20 percent of U.S. \nelectricity from wind would cover an area the size of West Virginia \nwith 186,000 turbines and require 19,000 miles of new transmission \nlines. These are not your grandmother's windmills. These turbines are \n50 stories high. Their flashing lights can be seen for 20 miles. An \nunbroken line of giant turbines along the\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\n2,178-mile Appalachian Trail--except for coastlines, ridgetops are \nabout the only place turbines work well in much of the East--would \nproduce no more electricity than four nuclear reactors on 4 square \nmiles of land--and, of course, you would still need the reactors for \nwhen the wind doesn't blow.\n  There are other ways a national windmill policy also risks destroying \nthe environment in the name of saving the environment. The American \nBird Conservancy estimates that the 25,000 U.S. wind turbines today \nkill 75,000 to 275,000 birds per year. Imagine what 186,000 turbines \nwould do. One wind farm near Oakland, CA, estimates that its turbines \nkill 80 golden eagles a year.\n  To be sure, similar concerns about sprawl exist for other forms of \nrenewable energy. For example, it would take continuously foresting an \narea 1\\1/2\\ times the size of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park \nto produce enough electricity from biomass to equal the electricity \nproduced by one nuclear reactor. A new solar thermal plant planned for \nCalifornia's Mojave Desert was to cover an area 3 miles by 3 miles \nsquare, until environmental objections stopped it.\n  At least for the next couple decades, relying on windmills to provide \nour Nation's clean electricity needs would be like wandering off track \nfrom your house in Virginia through San Francisco on the way to the \ncorner grocery store. This unnecessary journey offends the commonsense \ntheory of parsimony, defined by scientist Spencer Wells as ``don't \novercomplicate . . . if a simpler possibility exists.''\n  The simpler possibility that exists for producing lots of low-cost, \nreliable green electricity is to build 100 new nuclear plants, doubling \nU.S. nuclear power production. In other words, instead of traveling \nthrough San Francisco on your way to the corner grocery store, do what \nour country did between 1970 and 1990: Build 100 reactors on 100 square \nmiles of space--several of them would be on existing reactor sites--\ncompared with the 126,000 new square miles needed to produce that much \nelectricity from biomass or the 26,000 square miles needed for wind. \nUnlike wind turbines, 100 new nuclear reactors would require fewer \ntransmission lines through suburban backyards and pristine open spaces. \nThey would also require much less taxpayer subsidy. At current rates of \nsubsidy, taxpayers would shell out about $170 billion to subsidize the \n186,000 wind turbines necessary to equal the power of 100 nuclear \nreactors.\n  While Federal Government loan guarantees are probably necessary to \njumpstart the first few reactors, once we have proven they can be built \nwithout delays or huge cost overruns, no more loan guarantees will be \nneeded. In fact, the Tennessee Valley Authority just finished \nrebuilding the $1.8 billion Brown's Ferry reactor on time and on \nbudget, proving it can still be done. Yet, even if all $54 billion in \nloan guarantees defaulted--which isn't going to happen--it would still \nbe less than one-third of what we are putting into wind.\n  My concern about the unrealistic direction of our national windmill \npolicy led me to give five addresses on clean energy over the last 2 \nyears. The first, delivered at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in \n2008, called for a new Manhattan Project--like the one we had in World \nWar II but this time for clean energy independence. Then, a year ago at \nOak Ridge, I proposed building 100 new nuclear plants, a goal that all \n40 Senate Republicans adopted, along with 3 other goals: electrifying \nhalf of our cars and trucks, expanding offshore exploration for natural \ngas and oil, and doubling clean energy research and development.\n  My concern during 2009 deepened as members of the Obama \nadministration, with the conspicuous exception of Energy Secretary \nStephen Chu, seemed to develop a stomach ache whenever nuclear power \nwas mentioned. The President himself seemed unable to mention the \nsubject. Last year, at a climate change summit in New York City, \nPresident Obama chided world leaders for not doing more to address \nclimate change, but he didn't mention the words ``nuclear power'' \nduring his entire speech. That is ironic because many of the countries \nhe was lecturing were making plans to build nuclear plants to produce \ncarbon-free electricity and we were not. Climate change was the \ninconvenient problem, but nuclear power seemed to be the inconvenient \nsolution.\n  Fortunately, with the arrival of 2010 has come a more welcoming \nenvironment for nuclear power. In his State of the Union Address, \nPresident Obama called for ``a new generation of safe, clean nuclear \nreactors.'' His 2011 budget request recommends tripling loan guarantees \nfor the first reactors, and in February, his administration announced \nthe awarding of the first two loan guarantees for nuclear power. He has \nselected distinguished members, both for the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission and for a new blue ribbon commission, to figure out the best \nway to dispose of used nuclear fuel.\n\n  Democratic Senators--several of whom, in fairness, have long been \nsupporters of nuclear energy--have joined with the current 41 Senate \nRepublicans--to create bipartisan support. Last December, for example, \nDemocratic Senator Jim Webb, of Virginia, a former Navy Secretary, and \nI introduced legislation to create an environment that could double \nnuclear power production and to accelerate support for alternative \nforms of clean energy.\n  There seems to be a growing public understanding that nuclear \nreactors are as safe as other forms of energy production. A nuclear \nplant is not a bomb; it can't blow up. Our sailors have lived literally \non top of reactors for nearly 60 years without a nuclear incident. \nNobody in the United States has ever been killed in a nuclear accident. \nMost scientists agree it is safe to store used nuclear fuel onsite for \n60 to 80 years while those scientists figure out how to recycle used \nfuel in a way that reduces its mass by 97 percent, reduces its \nradioactive lifetime by 99 percent, and does not allow the isolation of \nplutonium, which could be dangerous in the wrong hands.\n  In addition, there is a growing realization by those who worry about \nclimate change that if Americans want to keep consuming one-fourth of \nthe world's electricity and we want large amounts of it to be low-cost \nand carbon-free, nuclear power is the only answer for now.\n  It has also helped, and been a little embarrassing as well, that the \nrest of the world has been teaching Americans the lesson we first \ntaught them. China is starting a new nuclear reactor every 3 months. \nFrance is 80 percent nuclear and has electricity rates and carbon \nemissions that are among the lowest in Europe. Japan gets 35 percent of \nits electricity from nuclear and plans 10 more reactors by 2018. There \nare 55 new reactors under construction in 14 countries around the \nworld--not 1 of them in the United States.\n  I believe we must address human causes of climate change, as well as \nair pollution that is caused by sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury emissions \nfrom coal plants. But I also believe in that commonsense theory of \nparsimony: Don't overcomplicate things if a simpler possibility exists. \nMy formula for the simplest way to reach the necessary carbon goals for \nclimate change without damaging the environment and without running \njobs overseas in search of cheap energy is this:\n  No. 1, build 100 new nuclear powerplants in 20 years.\n  No. 2, electrify half our cars and trucks in 20 years. If we plug \nvehicles in at night, we probably have enough electricity to do this \nwithout building one new power plant.\n  No. 3, explore for more low-carbon natural gas and the oil we still \nneed.\n  No. 4, launch mini-Manhattan Projects to invent a low-cost, 500-mile \nbattery for electric cars and a 50-percent efficient solar panel for \nrooftops that is cost-competitive with other forms of electricity, as \nwell as better ways to recycle used nuclear fuel, to create advanced \nbiofuels, and to recapture carbon from coal plants.\n  These four steps should produce the largest amount of energy with the \nsmallest amount of pollution at the lowest possible cost, thereby \navoiding the pain and suffering that comes when high energy costs push \njobs overseas and make it hard for many low-income Americans to afford \nheating and cooling bills.\n  One day, solar and other renewable energy forms will be cheap and \nefficient enough to provide an important supplement to our energy needs \nand can do so in a way that minimizes damage to our treasured \nlandscapes. Earth\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\nDay, as it comes Thursday, is a good day to remember that nuclear power \nbeats windmills for America's green energy future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            [From Newsweek]\n\n                     This Nuclear Option Is Nuclear\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       The 29 people killed last week in the West Virginia coal-\n     mine explosion will soon be as forgotten by the nation as are \n     the 362 miners who were killed in a 1907 explosion in that \n     state, the worst mining disaster in American history. The \n     costs of producing the coal that generates approximately half \n     of America's electricity also include the hundreds of other \n     miners who have suffered violent death in that dangerous \n     profession, not to mention those who have suffered \n     debilitating illnesses and premature death from ailments \n     acquired toiling underground.\n       Which makes particularly pertinent the fact that the number \n     of Americans killed by accidents in 55 years of generating \n     electricity by nuclear power is: 0. That is the same number \n     of Navy submariners and surface sailors injured during six \n     decades of living in very close proximity to reactors.\n       America's 250-year supply of coal will be an important \n     source of energy. But even people not much worried about the \n     supposed climate damage done by carbon emissions should see \n     the wisdom--cheaper electricity, less dependence on foreign \n     sources of energy--of Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander's \n     campaign to commit the country to building l00 more nuclear \n     power plants in 20 years.\n       Today, 20 percent of America's electricity, and 69 percent \n     of its carbon-free generation of electricity, is from nuclear \n     plants. But it has been 30 years since America began \n     construction on a new nuclear reactor.\n       France gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear \n     power; China is starting construction of a new reactor every \n     three months. Meanwhile, America, which pioneered nuclear \n     power, is squandering money on wind power, which provides 1.3 \n     percent of the nation's electricity: it is slurping up $30 \n     billion of tax breaks and other subsidies amounting to $18.82 \n     per megawatt-hour, 25 times as much per megawatt-hour as the \n     combined subsidies for all other forms of electricity \n     production.\n       Wind power involves gargantuan ``energy sprawl.'' To \n     produce 20 percent of America's power by wind, which the \n     Obama administration dreamily proposes, would require 186,000 \n     tall turbines--40 stories tall, their flashing lights can be \n     seen for 20 miles--covering an area the size of West \n     Virginia. The amount of electricity that would be produced by \n     wind turbines extending the entire 2,178 miles of the \n     Appalachian Trail can be produced by four reactors occupying \n     four square miles of land. And birds beware: the American \n     Bird Conservancy estimates that the existing 25,000 turbines \n     kill between 75,000 and 275,000 birds a year. Imagine the \n     toll that 186,000 turbines would take.\n       Solar power? It produces less than a tenth of a percent of \n     our electricity. And panels and mirrors mean more sprawl. \n     Biomass? It is not so green when you factor in trucks to haul \n     the stuff to the plants that burn it. Meanwhile, demand for \n     electricity soars. Five percent of America's electricity \n     powers gadgets no one had 30 years ago--computers.\n       America's nuclear industry was a casualty of the 1979 \n     meltdown of the Three Mile Island reactor in Pennsylvania, \n     which was and is referred to as a ``catastrophe'' even though \n     there were no measurable health effects. Chernobyl was a \n     disaster because Russians built the reactor in a way no one \n     builds today--without a containment vessel.\n       Since the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority, \n     Alexander's state has played a special role in U.S. energy \n     policy. The last commercial reactor opened in America is \n     Watts Bar, Unit 1 in Tennessee. And, in a sense, all uses of \n     nuclear power began in that state.\n       In September 1942, the federal government purchased 59,000 \n     acres of wilderness in eastern Tennessee and built an instant \n     city--streets, housing, schools, shops, and the world's most \n     sophisticated scientific facilities. This was--is--Oak Ridge. \n     Just 34 months later, a blinding flash illuminating the New \n     Mexico desert announced the dawn of the atomic age. That is \n     what Americans can do when motivated.\n       Today, a mini-Manhattan Project could find ways to recycle \n     used nuclear fuel in a way that reduces its mass 97 percent \n     and radioactive lifetime 98 percent. Today, Alexander says, \n     10 percent of America's lightbulbs are lit with electricity \n     generated by nuclear material recycled from old Soviet \n     weapons stocks. This is, as Alexander says, ``one of the \n     greatest swords-into-plowshares efforts in world history, \n     although few people seem to know about it.'' It is a travesty \n     that the nation that first harnessed nuclear energy has \n     neglected it so long because of fads about supposed ``green \n     energy'' and superstitions about nuclear power's dangers.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Alexander for his \nremarks. I share his analysis. He is exactly correct. It is very \nimportant for America that we recognize what he has said but even more \nimportant now, since I think the American people overwhelmingly \nunderstand and support that, that we take some action that would \nactually help us to get in the game of nuclear power production.\n  I remain baffled by some of the generalized statements of the \nadministration on nuclear power but lack of action that could move us \nforward and get us out of this funk we are in, where we are not doing \nanything. We have to start catching up with countries that are serious \nabout nuclear power. It will help make us more productive, help create \na lot of high-paying jobs in America, clean power, 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week, no emissions into the atmosphere, no CO2. It \nhas so many benefits that I am convinced we need to move forward.\n  I wish to make remarks on another issue; that is, the nomination of \nMarisa Demeo to the DC Superior Court. It is not a nomination that \ncomes through the Judiciary Committee, as most Federal judges do. \nBecause she is a DC Superior Court nominee, the nomination went through \nHomeland Security. Although, it is not a lifetime appointment, if you \nare an advocate or resident of the District of Columbia who might have \nto one day appear before a judge, you do want to know that Congress has \nmade certain that once that judge puts on the robe, he or she is \ncapable of putting aside personal views and applying the law \nevenhandedly.\n  Unfair jurisprudence to one party is detrimental, costly, and \npainful. We need to make sure our nominees exercise judgment--\nobjective, fair judgment--and not allow their personal politics or \nideologies to influence their decision making.\n  I am not comfortable enough to say that Ms. Demeo is capable of doing \nthat. I am just not. Her background and record raise issues with me. I \nwish to be fair, but I think we need to talk about them.\n  The DC Superior Court does have broad jurisdiction. It includes trial \nmatters, criminal, civil, family court, landlord, tenant, and so forth. \nA judge needs to be impartial in all those matters. Ms. Demeo's \nbackground provides evidence that she may be more political and strong-\nwilled personally than impartial.\n  Her prior experience includes serving as regional counsel for the \nMexican-American Legal Defense Fund. In this position, she made a \nnumber of troubling statements. For example, she argued that \n``governments have a legal obligation to help those who don't speak \nEnglish well.'' We have an obligation, all of us, to help people who do \nnot speak English, and I think that is so. But as a judge, I am \nwondering: Does this mean that constitutionally she is saying the \ngovernment has a legal obligation to do that? That seems, to me, the \ntone of her statement.\n  During her tenure at MALDEF, the organization sued the State of Texas \nbecause high schools did not offer their exit exams in Spanish. One \ndoes not have to be a lawful citizen of our country to attend the \nschools of Texas, even those unlawfully in the country can enroll in \nhigh schools. Apparently, the state of Texas decided individuals should \ndo their exit exams in English to get a high school diploma. She \nopposed that.\n  She opposed the nomination of Miguel Estrada, a fabulous Hispanic \nnominee. He had superior academic credentials, was a brilliant writer, \nand testified beautifully, I thought, before the Judiciary Committee. \nShe said this about him:\n\n       The most difficult situation for an organization like mine \n     is when a President nominates a Latino who does not resonate \n     or associate with the Latino community and who comes with a \n     predisposition to view claims of racial discrimination and \n     unfair treatment with suspicion and with doubt instead of \n     with an open mind.\n\n  I don't think that is an accurate description of Miguel Estrada, who \ncame here as a young man from Central America. I don't think that is an \naccurate description of him. I am disappointed she would make that \nstatement about him. I am unaware of any provision in the Constitution \nwhich requires that judges show favoritism to one party or another \nbased on their ethnicity. A judge, no matter what their background, \nracial, ethnic, religious, political, should give everybody before the \ncourt the same fair treatment. It is not necessary for a Caucasian to \nhear a case involving a Caucasian or for a Latino to hear all cases\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\ninvolving Latinos. Every judge puts on a robe, and that robe symbolizes \ntheir absolute commitment to objectivity.\n  After the Democrats successfully filibustered Mr. Estrada, one of the \nfirst nominees to be blocked by repeated, sustained filibusters--this \nwas not too many years ago, less than 10, about 7 or 8. We still have \nproblems in the Senate as a result of the alteration of Senate \ntradition where nominees are filibustered. I try not to do that. The \nGang of 14 settled that, saying filibusters, under extraordinary \ncircumstances, now become possible. This was after the Estrada \nnomination.\n  She was proud of blocking Mr. Estrada. She bragged about it. She \nsaid:\n\n       This shows just because we have a Republican President and \n     a Republican Senate, it is still possible to defeat \n     candidates who are so conservative that they take us back in \n     civil rights.\n\n  I disagree. I disagree with her analysis of Miguel Estrada's \nposition. I heard him testify. I think he would have been a fabulous \nmember of the U.S. courts.\n  Being a liberal means never having to say you are sorry about what \nyou say to other people. In opposing Linda Chavez--a wonderful writer, \nthinker, and passionate advocate for civil rights--she stated this in \nopposing Linda Chavez:\n\n       We generally support the nomination of Latinos to important \n     positions, but Linda Chavez could really turn things backward \n     for the Latino community. I do not appreciate that. Linda \n     Chavez would not have turned things back on the Latino \n     community. I don't know what she means by that.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       A Spanish sounding surname does not make a person \n     sympathetic to the concerns and needs of the Latino \n     population.\n\n  She, therefore, would appear to only embrace the kind of Latino \nnominee who agrees with her politically. It is not truly a question of \nethnicity, is it? It is a question of something different, a political \napproach to government and law.\n  On May 13, 2004, she participated in a press conference with the \ncoalition against discrimination and the Constitution to ``challenge \nthe extremism of the Federal marriage amendment backers.'' I guess that \nmeans I am an extremist.\n  Quite a number of Senators in the majority, as I recall, voted to say \nthat a marriage should remain as it has always previously been \ninterpreted: to be a union between a man and a woman. But she says this \nis an extremism amendment. I don't think so.\n  I know there is a legal dispute about gay marriage, one in the \nDistrict of Columbia now. She already stated where she is on the \nmatter, declaring it a fundamental right. I do not believe that is a \nfundamental constitutional right for a same-sex union to be declared a \nmarriage under the law of the United States. It never was for the first \n170 years of the existence of this country.\n  Ms. Demeo is no friend of immigration enforcement. When the INA \nannounced a plan to enter into the FBI's National Crime Information \nCenter database the names of 314,000 individuals who had been ordered \ndeported but who fled and absconded and did not submit themselves for \ndeportation, in an effort to simply comply with a judicial final order, \nshe decried that move. She responded that most of the violators who are \nguilty only of violating civil immigration laws do not pose a threat to \nnational security. I am not saying they pose a threat to national \nsecurity. They have come into the country illegally. They somehow \nbecame apprehended. Maybe they committed some other crime. They were \nordered to be deported and they should be deported. If they do not show \nup and abscond, they should be in the NCIC, just like anybody who has a \nspeeding ticket and they did not pay their fine.\n  She also criticized the government's Operation Tarmac, which \nidentified and ordered the deportation of 600 workers with access to \nsensitive areas at airports who had violated immigration law. We had \n600 workers at airports with access to sensitive areas, and they were \nfound to be illegally here and ordered deported.\n  Indeed, she is an advocate for amnesty openly. I guess we can \ndisagree on that. Good people certainly disagree on that. She is a big \nfan also of affirmative action programs. There is a fine line between \naffirmative action and quotas and mandatory racial preferences, and I \nfear she has crossed that line.\n  During the Clinton administration, when Energy Secretary Frederico \nPena announced his resignation, she insisted he be replaced by a \nLatino, indicating that was necessary for Latino concerns to receive \nconsideration. I think it is all right to ask that happen. But to \ndemand that and to insist that only a person of your ethnicity can give \nfairness to your ethnic group I think is wrong and goes against \nfundamental American concepts of law.\n  In a 2000 opinion editorial for the San Diego Tribune, Ms. Demeo \nfully embraced the concept of dangerous identity politics, in my view. \nShe said:\n\n       We must create the pressure to move the nominations of \n     Paez--\n\n  Who had been nominated to the Federal bench--\n\n     and other Latino nominees. . . . Latinos must be appointed in \n     greater numbers at all levels, especially to the appellate \n     courts, where most of the decisions interpreting the \n     Constitution and Federal laws are ultimately made. Without \n     sufficient representation at every level, equal justice for \n     Latinos--or even the perception of justice--will not exist.\n\n  I think that is overstatement. It is one thing to advocate, and I \nrespect that, advocating for more people, groups who appear to be \nunderrepresented. That is a legitimate factor that would play in a \nnomination. To use that kind of language, I think, is dangerous because \nit suggests fairness is not otherwise obtainable.\n  Perhaps Ms. Demeo can set these views aside and be fair on the bench. \nI think they are extreme in many instances. I am not certain she can. \nIt appears to me she is entrenched in a political approach, a lifestyle \nof emphasizing rights for one group or another and not so much the \nidea, the American vision of equal rights for everybody. That is the \ncore American principle; that everybody in a court of law is entitled \nto equal rights. A judge and our juries are charged to that effect, and \njudges put on a robe to show they are going to be unbiased and that \nthey are going to follow the law regardless of what their personal \nviews or friendships or so forth might be. So that is my concern and \nthe reason I have decided I will oppose the nomination. I assume she \nwill go on and have her vote soon and will probably have a majority and \nbe confirmed. But if she is confirmed, I hope Judge Demeo will think \nabout some of the issues I have raised and make sure in her own heart \nof hearts that when she takes that bench, she is not going to favor one \nparty or another based on their religion, their ethnicity, their \npolitics, or her personal social agendas. I believe that is important.\n\n  I have some quotes from some letters in opposition to Judge Demeo's \nnomination. Numbers USA has said her nomination ``would be a setback \nfor the nation in terms of seeking to restore the rule of law in \nimmigration.''\n  The Eagle Forum is a conservative group that has studied the \nnomination and has written regarding the basis for opposing the \nnomination as Judge Demeo's advocacy for issues, such as ``in-state \ntuition for illegal aliens, the handling of the census for purposes of \nredistricting, photo ID voting laws, official English initiatives, \namnesty for illegal aliens, affirmative action, and traditional \nmarriage.''\n  The Concerned Women of America wrote:\n\n       Her bias is so ingrained and so much the main thrust of her \n     career that it [is] not rational to believe that she will \n     suddenly change once confirmed as a judge. Rather it is \n     reasonable to conclude she would use her position to \n     implement her own political ideaology.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Demeo reveals her own bias and lack of constitutional \n     knowledge by her statement that the Constitution is a \n     ``flawed document that embodied the historical bias of its \n     time.''\n\n  Well, it is certainly not a perfect document, we all know that, and \nit has been amended because it did have some provisions that could not \nstand historical scrutiny, such as the question of slavery and equal \nrights for all Americans. But I do think her statement is troubling to \nme as a whole because I don't think it is a flawed document. Our \nConstitution is the greatest document ever struck by the hands of man \nat a given time, somebody once wrote.\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\n  The Traditional Values Coalition notes that she has ``demonstrated a \nwillingness to undermine our nation's effort to secure our borders \nagainst illegal immigrants.''\n  They go on to make a number of points.\n  Others have written, which I will ask to have printed in the Record.\n  The nominee, whom I don't have anything against personally, if \nconfirmed--and I suspect she will be--will have to think about these \nissues, commit herself totally and completely to fair and equal justice \nto everybody who appears before her and put aside some of the advocacy \npositions that have marked her sustained efforts during her \nprofessional career.\n  Mr. President, before I leave the floor, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record the letters from Concerned Women of America, \nthe Eagle Forum, Numbers USA, and the Traditional Values Coalition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 19, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of Concerned Women for America's \n     (CWA) 500,000 members nationwide, we write respectfully to \n     request you oppose the nomination of Marisa Demeo to the D.C. \n     Superior Court.\n       Marisa Demeo has a long history as a hard-left political \n     activist as a lawyer and lobbyist for the ultra-liberal \n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), \n     which calls into question her impartiality and judicial \n     temperament. When speaking out against Miguel Estrada, who \n     had an impeccable legal record, Demeo unfairly tarnished him \n     by saying, ``If the Senate confirms Mr. Estrada, his own \n     personal American dream will come true, but the American \n     dreams of the majority of Hispanics living in this country \n     will come to an end through his future legal decisions.'' \n     This shows her own prejudice and lack of judicial \n     temperament.\n       Her bias is so ingrained and so much the main thrust of her \n     career that it is not rational to believe that she will \n     suddenly change once confirmed as a judge. Rather it is \n     reasonable to conclude she would use her position to \n     implement her own political ideology.\n       Demeo reveals how her own bias and lack of Constitutional \n     knowledge by her statement that the Constitution is a \n     ``flawed document that embodied the historical bias of its \n     time.'' She has distorted the Constitution to argue that \n     there is a fundamental right to ``same-sex marriage.''\n       A judge of the D.C. Superior Court must be impartial and \n     possess a sound judicial temperament. Marisa Demeo's record \n     shows that she lacks these necessary attributes.\n       We urge you to oppose Marisa Demeo's nomination on the \n     Senate floor. CWA reserves the right to score this vote and \n     publish it in our scorecard for the 111th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Penny Nance,\n\n                                          Chief Executive Officer,\n     Concerned Women for America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Eagle Forum,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Apr. 14, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the many thousands of American \n     families Eagle Forum represents nationwide, I am writing to \n     urge you to vote NO on the nomination of Marisa Demeo to the \n     DC Superior Court.\n       Marisa Demeo has served as a DC Magistrate judge for the \n     past 2\\1/2\\ years, and like so many others President Obama \n     has nominated to the courts, the majority of her legal \n     experience comes from far left-leaning legal advocacy groups \n     such as Lambda Legal and the Mexican American Legal Defense \n     and Education Fund (MALDEF). Judge Demeo has a strong record \n     of partiality to minority groups and to the liberal ideology \n     on a wide range of issues such as in-state tuition for \n     illegal aliens, the handling of the census for purposes of \n     redistricting, photo ID voting laws, official English \n     initiatives, amnesty for illegal aliens, affirmative action, \n     and traditional marriage.\n       Not only has she espoused views on the immigration issue \n     that are odds with a respect for the rule of law, but she has \n     shown a troubling contempt for conservative Latino Americans. \n     In a January 2003 press statement announcing MALDEF's \n     opposition to President George W. Bush's nomination of Miguel \n     Estrada to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, Demeo stated: \n     ``The most difficult situation for an organization like mine \n     is when a president nominates a Latino who does not reflect, \n     resonate or associate with the Latino community.''\n       Judge Demeo's public statements on a number of important \n     policy issues help to demonstrate her leftist personal \n     opinions which she will, no doubt, reflect in future judicial \n     decisions:\n       On laws Supporting Traditional Marriage: ``The right to \n     marry is a fundamental right that every individual should \n     have. It was prejudice against Blacks, which was the \n     underlying force creating and maintaining our anti-\n     miscegenation laws. It is prejudice against gay men and \n     lesbians that underlies the drive to prohibit them from being \n     able to marry.'' (MALDEF press statement, May 14, 2004).\n       On Requiring Use of Census Sampling: ``When you don't \n     adjust the data when states are redrawing their political \n     district lines, what ends up happening is they do not \n     accurately draw the lines in order to fully represent those \n     minority communities who were missed by the census.'' (NPR, \n     March 6, 2001).\n       On Photo ID Requirements for Voting: ``It violates the \n     rights of minority voters who may be poor and without photo \n     identification. The provision makes it hard to vote.'' (AP \n     Online, February 25, 2002).\n       On English as an Official Language: ``Governments have a \n     legal obligation to help those who don't speak English \n     well.'' (AP, October 9, 2003)\n       On Describing Congressional Opponents of Amnesty: ``There \n     are certain forces in Congress who are anti-immigrant and not \n     interested in seeing immigrants become full participants in \n     this country.'' (The Seattle Times, May 31, 1998)\n       On Affirmative Action (Grutter v. Bollinger): ``All \n     segments of the Latino community supported the continuance of \n     affirmative action.'' (FDCH Political Transcripts, June 23, \n     2003)\n       Marisa Demeo's policy positions and public statements have \n     proved her to be a leftist activist, and we should assume no \n     different in her future rulings and opinions as a judge on \n     the DC Superior Court. Eagle Forum believes that Judge \n     Demeo's nomination should be given serious attention as her \n     positions and public statements on so many important issues \n     do not ``reflect or resonate'' American constitutional values \n     or principles.\n       Conservative grassroots Americans do not want judicial \n     nominees who have a record of disrespecting the Constitution \n     to slip through the confirmation process unchallenged and \n     without a tough fight. We urge you to join us in opposing \n     Judge Marisa Demeo when her nomination comes to the Senate \n     floor for an up-or-down vote. Eagle Forum reserves the right \n     to score this vote and to publish it in our scorecard for the \n     Second Session of the 111th Congress.\n           Faithfully,\n                                                 Phyllis Schlafly,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   NumbersUSA,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, Apr. 13, 2010.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: On behalf of NumbersUSA's 940,000 \n     members, we are writing to advise you that the Nation's \n     largest grassroots organization advocating for immigration \n     enforcement opposes the nomination of Marisa DeMeo to the \n     district of Columbia Superior Court.\n       While we don't often get involved in judicial nominations, \n     this nominee is troubling. The D.C. court could well serve as \n     a stepping stone to the federal bench. That would be a \n     setback for the nation in terms of seeking to restore the \n     rule of law in immigration.\n       Marisa DeMeo has served as a general counsel of MALDEF (the \n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund) where she \n     has a lengthy record of disrespect for federal immigration \n     laws, with indications that she believes it is illegitimate \n     for Congress to set enforceable limits. Ms. DeMeo favors \n     amnesty and official recognition of the illegal alien Mexican \n     ID, the matricula consular. She opposes the highly successful \n     287(g) program. With regard to potential judicial \n     temperament, she has often referred to her opponents in \n     immigration debates with such ugly name-calling as ``anti-\n     immigrant.''\n       Thank you for taking our views into consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Roy Beck,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Traditional Values Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Apr. 15, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of 43,000 churches associated with \n     the Traditional Values Coalition, I am writing to ask that \n     you vote against the confirmation of Marisa Demeo to become a \n     member of the DC Superior Court. Many of our churches are \n     African American and Hispanic.\n       Marisa Demeo is far out of the mainstream in her beliefs, \n     statements and activism. Her role as an activist with the \n     LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Lambda Legal \n     Defense and Education Fund is troublesome to say the least.\n       In addition, while serving as regional counsel for the \n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), \n     Demeo has demonstrated a willingness to undermine our \n     nation's efforts to secure our borders against illegal \n     immigration. MALDEF has also been involved in efforts to \n     undermine our national security efforts by encouraging cities \n     to refuse to comply with the Patriot Act after the 9/11 \n     attack on our nation.\n       As an open, radical lesbian, Demeo has openly condemned the \n     effort to amend our Constitution to protect marriage as a \n     one-man, one-woman union. Demeo supports gay marriage, \n     claiming it is a constitutional right. She also claims that \n     LGBT individuals are equal to racial minorities and can claim \n     protection as minorities under our civil rights laws.\n       The American people have overwhelmingly voted against gay \n     marriage in state after state when they've had a chance to \n     cast a ballot for traditional marriage. Demeo's views are out \n     of step with the beliefs of most\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\n     Americans on the sanctity of marriage between one man and one \n     woman.\n       As a DC Superior Court Judge, Demeo would be in a key \n     position to undermine our national security and destroy \n     traditional marriage through her edicts. The DC Superior \n     Court is known to be a steppingstone to the Supreme Court.\n       Demeo's radical lesbianism, anti-marriage, anti-national \n     security views are dangerous to our nation. She should not be \n     confirmed to the DC Superior Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Andrea Lafferty,\n                                           TVC Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Financial Reform\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I want to spend a few minutes, if I may \nthis afternoon, to talk about an issue that has been the subject of \nmuch debate over the last number of days, and that is the financial \nreform bill that will be coming to the floor of this body in a matter \nof days--an issue that is going to confront us, as the circumstances \npresently exist, with Members having to make a choice. My hope is that \nbefore that occurs, we can reach some understanding that will allow us \nto have a strong bill that ends too big to fail, that protects \nconsumers, and that builds the kind of architecture for financial \nservices that will allow us to avoid the pitfalls that caused our \neconomy to reach almost near collapse over the last several years.\n  The choice is going to come down to this: There are people who can \nvote to open this debate on financial reform legislation that will hold \nWall Street firms--large financial institutions--accountable and \nprevent future economic crises such as the one from which we are just \nbeginning to emerge or basically defeat this; to somehow walk out of \nthis Chamber and leave us basically where we have been, and that is \nhighly vulnerable--individuals, families, businesses, and the overall \neconomy of our country once again exposed to the kind of \nvulnerabilities that brought so much hardship to our country.\n  They can, of course, block--as they are apt to do in some cases--any \nconsideration of this bill and leave us in a place--a broken place--\nwhere the status quo would again create the kind of problems I have \ndescribed.\n  So one has to ask themselves a question: Who benefits if this bill to \nrein in Wall Street and large financial institutions is strangled by a \nfilibuster, where it ends up that we can't even get to debate the bill? \nWho benefits from that? Well, certainly no one can make a case the \nAmerican family would benefit. These families have seen millions of \njobs lost and trillions in savings wiped out because a greedy few on \nWall Street gambled with money that didn't even belong to them, causing \nthe hardship we have seen in our Nation.\n  Certainly, America's small businesses do not benefit. These are the \nones that have seen the flow of credit and capital literally dry up. \nHow many of us in this Chamber, back in our respective States, have \ntalked to owners of small businesses who cannot get a dime's worth of \ncredit over the past several years in order to hire new people and \nsurvive during this economic crisis? I hear anecdote after anecdote \nafter anecdote of businesses desperately trying to find credit in order \nto stay alive and survive. Yet because of the unchecked risk taking by \nfinancial firms that caused this economic crisis, credit is virtually \ngone. So American businesses--small businesses particularly--certainly \nare not benefitted if we are confronted again with the status quo and a \nperpetuation of the present set of rules.\n  Certainly, Madam President, the American community banks do not \nbenefit at all. These are the ones who have found it difficult or even \nimpossible to compete on a playing field tilted so heavily toward the \nlargest firms and, frankly, financial firms that are unregulated.\n  One of the things our community banks and others--and I am not \nsuggesting they love every dotted i and crossed t in the bill--are \nseeking is some consolidation of regulation. They want to see their \ncompetitors, who are not subjected to any regulation, be subjected too \nso they will also have to face the same set of rules.\n  The bill I have written, along with my Banking Committee colleagues, \ndoes just that. We consolidate the regulation so there is not the \noverlapping jurisdictions that exist, and their major competitors--the \nnonbank financial institutions--are going to be subjected to the same \nrules they are. That creates that level playing field our smaller banks \nneed in order for them to compete effectively.\n  Certainly the American taxpayers are not going to benefit with the \nstatus quo. These are the people who were forced to bail out Wall \nStreet in 2008. If this bill is blocked, they might be asked to do it \nagain.\n  Now, I am not in the prediction business, but if some future Congress \ngoes back to the American public, as we did in the fall of 2008, and \nasks them to write a check again for $700 billion because we failed to \nget this legislation through that would end too big to fail--the \nimplicit guarantee that the Federal Government will bail you out if you \nare so large or so interconnected that you can't possibly fail--the \nAmerican people, in my view, would reject overwhelmingly a request to \nask them to write another check for that purpose.\n  Our bill, for the first time, writes into legislation an absolute \nprohibition that the American taxpayer would ever or should ever again \nbe asked to do what they did in the fall of 2008.\n  But here is who would benefit if this bill is blocked: the same large \nfinancial firms that got us into the mess in the first place. They \nbelieve--and I presume they are right--that they can bolster their \nbottom lines if the status quo prevails; that they can continue to take \noutrageous risks, using other people's money, knowing that any profit \nis theirs to keep and any loss will be made up by the American \ntaxpayer.\n  That is why we are faced with this prediction that 41 of our fellow \ncolleagues will vote against us going to this bill on what they call \nthe motion to proceed to the bill. The letter from the minority leader \nsays: We have 41 votes to stop you from even debating this bill. Well, \nyou explain to the American taxpayer--to small business, to the \nAmerican family, and to others out there who are paying an awful price \nbecause of the mess of these very institutions that are today leading \nthe charge against us getting to a bill--why the status quo is in their \ninterest and their benefit.\n  Madam President, those who vote to block this bill are sending a \nclear message to American families, businesses, community bankers, and \ntaxpayers, and that message will be: I am sorry, but we are not on your \nside. We are choosing another side of this equation.\n  Last month, my good friend, the minority leader, and the Republican \nSenator responsible for campaign fundraising participated in a meeting \nin New York with Wall Street executives. That happens all the time. \nCertainly, there is the right to sit down and talk with people, to \nrepresent labor and business, and we should do that. But nobody knows \nwhat was talked about at that meeting. Yet when our friend and \ncolleague who chairs the campaign committee came back, right \nafterwards, all of a sudden we get this rhetoric about too big to fail; \nthat we can't possibly go to this bill.\n  Now, I was born at night, Madam President, but not last night. I was \nborn at night, but not last night. And don't tell me that miraculously \nthese things happened and all of a sudden we find ourselves with 41 \ncolleagues, many of whom I suspect are not overly enthusiastic about \nthis game plan that says: Don't ask why; don't tell us what is in the \nbill. Just tell us we are going to line up and say no matter what \nanyone says or does or what they have tried to do, we are going to \nobject to even going to this bill.\n  I firmly believe there is more than a small minority of my Republican \ncolleagues who, frankly, find that argument objectionable. That is not \nto suggest they like this bill or agree with every position in it, but \nI know them well enough to know they are sick and tired of being told \nhow they are going to have to vote on a procedural motion on a matter \nthat I think deserves at least the support of our colleagues to begin \nthat important debate.\n  What we do know, of course, about the opposition to going forward is \nthat the Republican leadership returned armed with some very false \ntalking points, talking points written by a political strategist with \nclose ties to\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nlarge financial institutions, talking points that have been debunked by \nthe independent media analysis and even Republicans such as FDIC \nChairman Sheila Bair.\n  Let me point out the memo that suggested this game plan was written \nby a political strategist was written long before even one word was \nwritten on the bill. They were told how to fight a bill that didn't \neven exist out here by accusing the bill of leaving open the too big to \nfail, even though they knew--at least those who had read the bill--\nthose provisions had been written so tight that no one could possibly \nargue too big to fail would be allowed again.\n  The Republican leadership returned promising that every member of \ntheir caucus would vote to kill this bill before the debate even began. \nI know for a fact that Members of this body, on both sides of the \naisle, want to pass a good bill. My colleagues know me well, and they \nknow my reputation over the years. I have never, ever passed a major \npiece of legislation in this body, in over three decades, when I have \nnot had the cooperation and backing of a Member or Members on the other \nside of the aisle--never once on every major piece of legislation with \nwhich I have been involved. Here we are, at the brink of going forward \nwith the single largest proposal to reform the financial services \nsector of our country, and we are divided here like a couple of \npetulant teenagers, instead of sitting around and coming together as I \nhave offered for months, getting behind a bill and allowing us to go \nforward. It is long overdue that we grow up and recognize this is not \nsome athletic contest, this is about whether our economy can get back \non its feet, whether we can grow and prosper and create jobs, have \ncredit flow and capital form so that businesses and wealth can be \ncreated. Nothing less than that is at stake in this debate and \ndiscussion, and all the more reason why we need to go forward, and go \nforward like adults, like Members of the greatest deliberative body--as \nwe are told over and over--in the history of mankind, the Senate, to \nresolve these matters.\n\n  I have worked for hours with my colleague from Alabama, as he well \nknows, Senator Shelby, to the point that he has said--and I appreciate \nit very much and I compliment him for it--we are 80 percent of the way \nto a bipartisan consensus. In fact, I suspect if Richard Shelby were \nasked today whether that number were 80 percent, he would have even a \nhigher number. Imagine being 80 to 90 percent in agreement, yet being \ntold by the minority we cannot go forward. Do I have to write the whole \nbill? Is that when we can go forward? You have 80 or 90 percent of what \nyou think is a good bill, but, no, no, we are going to stop any further \ndebate. In all my years I have never heard of such an argument, whether \nI have been in the minority or majority, that I agree with 80 or 90 \npercent of what you have written, Senator, but I am sorry, we are going \nto stop even considering any further debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  I worked for many hours with the Senator from Tennessee, Bob Corker, \nto try to get to 100 percent, as he well knows. No matter what was said \nin the meetings between the Republican leadership and Wall Street \nexecutives, the fact is that the bill I will be bringing to the floor \nreflects not only bipartisan input but good common sense as well. If \nyou look at what the bill actually does, it is clear that there is no \nideology here, just one principle: Hold Wall Street and large financial \ninstitutions accountable so that American families and businesses can \ngrow and thrive without fear of another economic catastrophe.\n  The bill creates an early warning system so that for the very first \ntime in our Nation's history, someone will be in charge of monitoring \nour entire financial system, to look out for emerging products and \npractices and problems, not just here at home but even globally.\n  Again, I don't think you have to have a Ph.D. in economics to know \nwhat we have seen in the headlines and heard on our news shows a few \nweeks ago, that there were major economic problems in the small nation \nof Greece, and that all of a sudden the financial system of every other \nnation around the world was at risk. Or when that small exchange in \nShanghai, China, began to decline by 12 percent a few years ago, every \nother exchange around the globe within hours was adversely affected.\n  That market, that exchange, represented less than 5 percent of the \nvolume of the New York Stock Exchange. Yet because it declined by 12 \npercent one morning, every other exchange around the world reacted. \nWhat more do I need to say about whether our issues here are global in \nscope, not just domestic? Again, it is even further reason why we need \nto be able to pull together and create this bill that is essential so \nwe have a warning system in place that looks out for and monitors \nproducts, practices, and even problems that can emerge in other parts \nof the world if they can pose the kind of risk that could bring our \nfinancial system to near collapse.\n  Under the status quo, of course, no regulator can see beyond the \nnarrow silo of their own radar screen. We changed that. This now \ninvolves all of these prudential risk regulators sitting at a systemic \nrisk council headed up by the Federal Reserve and Treasury here, so \nthey can actually look over the horizon and act as a financial radar \nsystem. What is going on out there? Are there problems emerging in \nproducts or companies or nations that could bring our country to near \ndisaster financially?\n  If we had had that in place back a few years ago, I would argue we \nmight not find ourselves where we are today. So this is one of our \nprovisions in the bill. What a pity it would be to lose the opportunity \nto create that kind of an early warning system. That is how the \nsubprime lending sector was able to grow so large despite the dangers \nit posed to the economy and why no one was able to stop it before it \nprecipitated a crisis. I do not believe members of the minority caucus \nwant regulators to be unaware of emerging threats to our financial \nsystem.\n  The bill brings new transparency and accountability as well to \nfinancial dealings by ensuring that even the most complicated or \nobscure transactions are concluded in an open marketplace.\n  The Presiding Officer, of course, is well versed and talented, coming \nfrom the Empire State, and understands these issues. I believe that \nderivatives, for instance, are a very important instrument, critically \nimportant to economic growth and prosperity. They have become a \npejorative, unfortunately, but my view has been let the markets work.\n  How do the markets work best? Markets work best when there is \ntransparency, when buyers and sellers, investors, have an opportunity \nto see with clarity what these instruments are, what they are designed \nto do. Right now we have a shadow economy where some of these \ninstruments operate in darkness, and that is one of the problems that \ncreated the financial mess we are in. Our bill opens up, sheds light, \nbrings sunshine to these instruments so that taxpayers but, more \nimportantly, investors and others can honestly understand what they \nare, what they are intended to do and how they work.\n  For the first time here we would force risky financial companies such \nas Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers that have operated the shadow \nbanking system to be subject to proper supervision, again, so we have \nthe ability to understand what they are doing.\n  Of course, under the status quo these dangerous giants that have been \nfree to take enormous gambles in a single-minded quest for maximum \nprofit and when they go down like the Hindenberg, taxpayers are left to \nclean up the rubble. I do not believe that members of the minority \ncaucus want to leave the Lehman Brothers unsupervised until its \ncollapse shakes the very foundations of our economy.\n  This bill I have before us beefs up the SEC oversight, it strengthens \nprotections for investors, and gives shareholders a greater voice on \nhow executives are compensated and how big their bonuses can get. Under \nthe status quo, of course, the same executives whose mismanagement \ncaused the collapse of financial giants get to collect ridiculous \nbonuses again. Kill the bill and there is nothing in here that would \npreclude the same kind of abuses, the outrageous gouging, if you will, \nat taxpayer expense by a handful of these executives who fail to \nunderstand--or if they understand, more outrageously\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\nwere willing to reward themselves for their own failures because the \nAmerican taxpayers shored up their financial institution.\n  The Allen Stanfords and Bernie Madoffs of the world are able to rip \noff investors for millions while the understaffed and underfunded SEC, \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, fails to stop them.\n  I do not believe members of the Republican caucus want to leave these \nexecutives free to line their pockets with unearned billions or leave \ninvestors vulnerable to Wall Street predators and con artists. That is \nwhat happened. That is what went on. Our bill stops it. We need to be \nable to go forward with this bill.\n  Our bill requires full disclosures in plain English so that Americans \ncan easily understand the risks and returns of any financial product, \nwhether it is a mortgage or a student loan. Our bill creates an \nindependent consumer protection agency, a watchdog with bark and bite, \nto protect consumers from the abusive practices that have become almost \nstandard operating procedures--skyrocketing credit card interest rates, \nthe explosion in checking account fees, predatory lending by mortgage \nfirms, and so much more.\n\n  You do not have to educate the American people. You will hear it over \nand over from your own constituents. Listen to what they have been \nthrough with these increased interest rates, increased fees--every \ngimmick you can think of to pick the pocket of the American taxpayer \nwho, today, necessarily needs to depend on credit cards in order to \nmake ends meet in their families.\n  Of course, under the status quo, consumers trying to make smart \ndecisions about their family finances are confronted with a sea of fine \nprint and technical jargon and they are vulnerable to the predatory \nlenders, the greedy predators who have taken advantage of them. Our \nbill stops that. Our bill puts an end to that. If we do not get a \nchance to debate this and go forward, that would be the end of it. What \na disgrace it would be to be confronted, as we were at the outset of \nthis Congress, with the problems the American taxpayers have been \nthrough--8\\1/2\\ million jobs lost, 7 million homes in foreclosure, \nretirement accounts evaporated, small businesses failing, and we did \nnothing to stop it, despite the fact that 80 or 90 percent of what I \nhave written in this bill is agreed to by many in the minority. But you \nwill not even allow the bill to go forward to be debated. For the life \nof me I do not understand that logic.\n  In short, this bill protects the American consumers, American \nbusinesses, community banks, as I mentioned, and taxpayers from the \nvery exact situation that occurred in 2008, an economic crisis brought \nabout by Wall Street highjinks, large financial institutions and \nregulatory failures. Our bill creates a stronger foundation, I might \nadd, on which we can rebuild the prosperity we have lost in our Nation \nover the last number of years.\n  I do not believe members of the Republican minority, our friends and \ncolleagues here, want to kill this bill. I do not want to believe that. \nUnlike other matters we have debated over this Congress, this matter \nought to be one where we can come together as I have tried to do, day \nin and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out, to craft \na piece of legislation that reflected the myriad views embraced by the \nMembers of this Senate.\n  We are on the brink of going forward and I will go forward with this \nbill. We can do it one of several different ways. We can go forward. I \nwill bring this bill up. The leader, I am told, will offer a motion to \nproceed. My hope is we will not have to have a vote on that, that there \nwill be enough common sense here that would say this is a good product \neven for those who do not like various provisions of it, and then do \nwhat we are supposed to do in this body--debate, offer amendments, try \nto improve the bill based on your own view of what constitutes an \nimprovement. But let's act like the Senate on a major bill of this \nimport here, instead of putting on the brakes, don't show up, don't say \nanything, just vote no, we are not going to debate this until you do \nexactly as I want you to do.\n  That is not the Senate that I think the American people expect to see \nwork. My hope is, of course, that I will be right in that. My \ncolleagues, many of whom I have worked closely with on many issues, do \nnot want to be part of a blind, pointless effort here, just to walk \naway from this process. I believe they, our friends on the other side, \nare caught between the same commonsense principles that led many of \nthem to spend so many hours helping us create this legislation, and the \npolitical deals that have led their leadership to demand they help to \nkill it.\n  As I said a moment ago, I have been in this body for some 30 years. I \nhave served with many Republican colleagues for a long time. I have \ngreat friends, as my colleagues know, on the other side of this aisle, \npeople who I believe care as much about this country as any other \nMember, and they want to be part of answers, solutions. They did not \ncome here, they did not fight hard to get here, to say no. They came \nhere because they wanted to be part of the answers to how we can get \nour country moving again.\n  Again, I am charged as the chairman of a committee to try to pull \ntogether a bill that reflects the disparate points of view, that \nlistens to our colleagues here in crafting a piece of legislation that \ncan work. I have tried to do that now for many months. I have come to \nthe point where, frankly, we need to go forward in this body. I am \nconfident, again, if our colleagues would give us a chance we can \nachieve the results they seek and I am hopeful they will when the \nmotion to proceed occurs, and then engage in the kind of thoughtful, \nintelligent debate this Senate has a reputation of achieving and \naccomplishing.\n  I thank my colleagues for the work they have contributed to it so \nfar. Let's not take all of that work and dash it on the rocks of \nprocedural filibustering. We can do better than that. I am confident we \nwill. I urge my colleagues to be supportive of these efforts.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the nomination \nof Marisa Demeo to be a Superior Court judge in the District of \nColumbia. I do not believe she has enough judicial experience to sit on \nthe DC Superior Court. She is currently serving as a magistrate judge, \na position she has held for the past 2\\1/2\\ years. Although being a \nmagistrate judge is good training for a Superior Court judge, 2 years \nis not enough of that training. Of the 25 magistrate judges in the \nDistrict of Columbia, she is one of the least experienced. Nineteen of \nthe current DC magistrate judges have served for 5 years or more \ncompared to her 2\\1/2\\. Some have served for decades. In fact, only 3 \nof her 24 colleagues have served less than Ms. Demeo.\n  Looking at her record, I see she has much more experience working as \na lobbyist for a special interest group than a magistrate judge. She \nwas chief lobbyist for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education \nFund, a national Latino civil rights organization, from 1997 to 2004. \nIn this position, she became more well known for divisive comments she \nmade against Hispanic Republicans than for her legal expertise. She \ntook on a high-profile role opposing President Bush's nomination of \nMiguel Estrada, criticizing him in numerous newspaper stories because \nhe did not appear to support her political agenda. During this time, \nshe made personal attacks against him, suggesting he was a traitor to \nother Hispanics.\n  Let me read from a 2003 article from National Review entitled, ``Dems \nto Miguel Estrada, You're Not Hispanic Enough.'' Ms. Demeo said:\n\n       If the Senate confirms Mr. Estrada, his own personal \n     American dream will come true, but the American dreams of the \n     majority of Hispanics living in this country will come to an \n     end through his future legal decisions.\n\n  In another press statement she said:\n\n       The most difficult situation for an organization like mine \n     is when a president nominates a Latino who does not reflect, \n     resonate or associate with the Latino community.\n\n  Instead of debating these issues, Ms. Demeo tried to convince the \nmedia\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\nthat an entire community should only think one way--her way--and that \nMiguel Estrada was wrong for thinking anything otherwise. To me, this \nsounds like ethnic bullying. It is dangerous and insulting to believe a \nparticular community should think uniformly, and Ms. Demeo was wrong to \ndo this.\n  I was not in the Senate at the time; however, I have come to work \nclosely with Miguel Estrada since that time, especially during my work \non the Honduras crisis. He is a patriotic American and one who gave his \nown time and energy to help us understand the legal issues facing \nHonduras. I do not doubt for a minute his qualifications to serve on \nthe Federal bench. Comments by Ms. Demeo and others questioning Mr. \nEstrada's credentials, encouraging the filibuster of his nomination, \nand accusing him of not being ``authentically Hispanic'' made the \nconfirmation process very painful for him and his family.\n  This was not the only time Ms. Demeo advanced this terrible argument. \nShe used this same line of attack against Linda Chavez, President \nBush's nominee to be Secretary of Labor.\n  Ms. Demeo was quoted by the Washington Post in January of 2001 \nsaying:\n\n       We generally support the nomination of Latinos to important \n     positions, but Linda Chavez could really turn things \n     backwards for the Latino community. We just really question \n     what kinds of efforts she is going to put into enforcing the \n     affirmative action laws.\n\n  Ms. Demeo has also attacked those of us in Congress who opposed the \namnesty legislation of a couple years ago, saying we were ``anti-\nimmigrant and not interested in seeing immigrants become full \nparticipants in this country.''\n  She strongly opposes English as the official language and says the \ngovernment must accommodate non-English speakers. She was quoted by the \nAssociated Press in 2003 saying ``governments have a legal obligation \nto help those who don't speak English well.''\n  She demanded that the Census Department use ``sampling'' to puff up \nthe number of voters in Hispanic districts. She told National Public \nRadio in 2001 that raw census data should not be used because it ``does \nnot fully represent those minority communities who were missed by the \ncensus.'' Instead, she advocated that less accurate sampling data be \nused to redraw political districts.\n  Ms. Demeo has shown similar disregard for verified information by \narguing that photo requirements for voting ``violates the rights of \nminority voters.''\n  She is also an active proponent of affirmative action, again \nsuggesting to the public that all Latinos are in lockstep agreement on \nthis issue.\n  After the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter, Demeo said:\n\n       All segments of the Latino community supported the \n     continuance of affirmative action. . . . The nation must now \n     also turn and concentrate on ensuring equality of opportunity \n     in our elementary, middle and high schools. Colleges and \n     universities that use race-conscious admissions have made \n     those universities a better place for everyone to learn.\n\n  Ms. Demeo has also attacked the definition of traditional marriage. \nThese views have led groups such as Eagle Forum, Numbers USA, the \nFederation of American Immigration Reform, English First, Concerned \nWomen for America, and the Traditional Values Coalition to oppose Judge \nDemeo's nomination.\n  I assume Ms. Demeo will be confirmed. If she is, I will wish her well \nin this new position. But I, regrettably, will vote no on this \nnomination.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the nomination of \nMarisa J. Demeo.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am going to actually speak on a \ndifferent matter. I ask unanimous consent that my statement be moved to \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, here, in our Nation's Capital, we stand \nfor justice, for fairness and opportunity and for the rule of law.\n  On the floor of this Senate and in the Oval Office, we shape national \npolicy, and guide the course of a Nation.\n  In the chambers of the Supreme Court, the principles of justice laid \ndown in our Constitution are translated into the real world.\n  Our system of government, embodied in this city, stands as an example \nfor all others around the world.\n  And yet today we are met with a certain irony.\n  As I address this chamber, the DC Superior Court has been paralyzed, \nand our justice system has ground to a halt, thanks to my Republican \ncolleagues.\n  My good friend, the junior Senator from South Carolina, has chosen to \nobstruct an eminently qualified judicial nominee and current DC \nmagistrate judge, named Marisa Demeo.\n  When the President of the United States appoints a judge to the \nSuperior Court here in Washington, these nominations are generally \napproved by the Senate without delay or controversy.\n  But this time, my Republican friends have decided to play politics \nwith our judicial system.\n  They have stalled Judge Demeo's nomination for 8 months, and have \nturned a routine vote into the longest confirmation battle of the Obama \nPresidency.\n  As a result, DC government officials have warned that their ability \nto administer justice is being tested.\n  As a former attorney general of Illinois, I understand how dire this \nsituation is. I understand how this obstructionism is crippling the \nSuperior Court system.\n  And for what reason? My colleagues and I have asked our Republican \nfriends to name their objections, but no one can get a straight answer.\n  No Republican has cast any doubt on Judge Demeo's qualifications, \nwhich are superb.\n  She has served as a magistrate judge since 2007. Before that, she \nworked at the Department of Justice, in the Civil Rights Division and \nas an assistant U.S. attorney.\n  She has degrees from Princeton and New York University. Her legal \ntraining and experience are more than adequate for the post of Superior \nCourt Judge, and yet, for unspecified political reasons, the junior \nSenator from South Carolina continues to hold up this important \nnomination.\n  He said he has concerns that Judge Demeo may not be fair and balanced \nin her approach. But there is nothing in her record to suggest anything \nof the sort.\n  In fact, not a single Republican even took the time to ask a question \nat Judge Demeo's confirmation hearings.\n  So I cannot imagine what they find objectionable.\n  The court system in our Nation's Capital is strained to the breaking \npoint, and my friend from South Carolina doesn't seem to mind.\n  I believe this is simply unacceptable.\n  This is why the American people are frustrated with their government: \nbecause petty political battles and Republican obstructionism are \nimpeding our ability to govern.\n  My friends on the other side are certainly entitled to play political \ngames if they like, but I would urge them to save politics for the \ncampaign trail, and stop holding up the course of justice and the \nimportant business of the American people.\n  We simply do not have time for this. This is not about politics, this \nis about people's lives.\n  This is about the functioning of the American justice system, right \nhere in the Capital of the United States.\n  This is about the constitutional right to a fair and speedy trial, a \nright which has been denied to DC residents by Republican political \ngames.\n  The American people have had enough.\n  So I urge my friends on the other side to abandon this kind of \nobstructionism and take their political games elsewhere.\n  Let us stand up for the ideals of fairness and justice that are \nembodied here, in this system of government.\n  And let us make sure that every American, including the residents of \nour Nation's Capital, can avail themselves of this system.\n  I ask my colleague from South Carolina to drop his hold on this \neminently qualified nominee, so this Senate can hold a vote, and then \nwe can move forward in a bipartisan manner to address the challenges we \nface.\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this week in the Senate we are calling \nattention to the unfortunate obstructionism coming from the other side \nof the aisle when it comes to President Obama's nominations. There are \nnow 101 nominees who have been voted out of committee--most of them \nwith unanimous support but who are languishing on the Senate floor \nbecause the Republican minority won't allow them to have a vote. In \nmany cases, they won't even give a reason--they are using anonymous \nholds. That is fundamentally unfair.\n  Let me speak briefly about a nominee we will vote on today: Marisa \nDemeo. She was nominated to be an associate judge on the District of \nColumbia Superior Court. This is a local court here in Washington that \nprimarily hears misdemeanor and felony cases. It is not a Federal court \nand its judges do not serve lifetime appointments.\n  Marisa Demeo is currently a magistrate judge on this court, and she \nhas an excellent reputation. She is a former Federal prosecutor and was \nhired by the John Ashcroft Justice Department as an assistant U.S. \nattorney here in Washington.\n  Before she was a prosecutor, she was a civil rights lawyer in the \nJustice Department's Civil Rights Division and at the Mexican American \nLegal Defense Fund, one of the most respected civil rights \norganizations in America.\n  Judge Demeo has received numerous awards throughout her legal career, \nincluding the ``Rising Legal Star'' award from the Hispanic Bar \nAssociation \nof Washington, DC, and a Special Achievement Award from the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the District of Columbia.\n  Judge Demeo was unanimously approved by the Senate committee that \noversees DC Superior Court nominations, so you would think she would be \nconfirmed by the full Senate in short order. Well you would be wrong. \nAfter being voted out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \non May 20, 2009, Judge Demeo has been held up on the Senate floor ever \nsince. For 11 months now, the Republican minority obstructed her \nnomination and objected to an up-or-down vote. No other nominee of \nPresident Obama's has been pending on the Senate floor longer than \nJudge Demeo.\n  As a result of this delay, the DC Superior Court has struggled to \nhandle its crushing caseload. Last month, the Senate received a letter \nfrom the chief judge of that court, Lee Satterfield, who said the \nfollowing:\n\n       The Superior Court is a busy, urban court with a caseload \n     of over 100,000 cases per year. Each day we make life and \n     death decisions about neglected and abused children, \n     juveniles alleged to have committed crimes, criminals charged \n     with everything from minor misdemeanors to first degree \n     murder and sex abuse. . . . [T]he people of the District of \n     Columbia deserve a court with a full complement of judges \n     making the crucial decisions affecting the lives of D.C. \n     residents.\n\n  I am pleased the Republicans have finally relented and agreed to a \nvote on Judge Demeo. We owe it to her, and we owe it to the people of \nthe District of Columbia.\n  I know there has been some criticism of some positions Judge Demeo \ntook when she worked at MALDEF. A few of my Republican colleagues have \ndiscussed these criticisms on the Senate floor today. I would like to \nmake two points in response.\n  First, the positions Judge Demeo took when she was an advocate at \nMALDEF are mainstream positions. She advocated for comprehensive \nimmigration reform. She opposed the nomination of Miguel Estrada, one \nof President Bush's most controversial nominees. She supported \naffirmative action, and she opposed a photo ID requirement in the \nvoting context because of its adverse impact on minorities. And she \nopposed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. These are \npositions I share, and many members of the Senate share. They are \npositions that are hardly out of step with the political mainstream in \nAmerica.\n  In any event, Judge Demeo has been a magistrate judge for the past \nthree years, and she has demonstrated her ability to be fair and \nimpartial. She has skillfully made the transition from advocate to \njudge, and she deserves this promotion from magistrate judge to \nassociate judge on the DC Superior Court. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport her confirmation.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nvote to confirm the nomination of Marisa Judith Demeo as associate \njudge on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\n  She has waited long enough and the Superior Court of the District has \nwaited long enough. Judge Demeo epitomizes what it means to serve. A \nconsummate community leader, she has always believed in the importance \nof public service.\n  She is currently serving as magistrate judge in the Criminal Division \nof Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\n  As an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the \nDistrict of Columbia, she has ample experience prosecuting misdemeanor \nand felony cases.\n  Having said that, she also has deep roots in the community, a woman \nwho cares about justice--about doing what's fair and what's right. She \nbelieves in the rule of law.\n  From her work at the AIDS Service Center of Lower Manhattan, her \nservice for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, her time as a \nTexas rural legal aid and a paralegal in the Civil Rights Division of \nthe Department of Justice, she has taken pride in acting on a spirit of \ncommunity that is part of who she is--each of us working together for \nthe betterment of all of us.\n  I know the good work she has done at the Mexican American Legal \nDefense and Education Fund and what that work has meant to her and to \nthose she has served.\n  The professional awards and honors she has received as well as her \nacademic awards are far too numerous to mention here. Suffice it to say \nthat, in my view, she is one of the most accomplished nominees we have \nhad before us.\n  A graduate of Princeton University and New York University School of \nLaw, Judge Demeo's credentials are impeccable.\n  I know her dedication and her keen mind, her judicial temperament, \nher belief in the rule of law and those powerful words that mean so \nmuch to her and to all of us in this Chamber--equal justice under law.\n  Judge Demeo is ready to serve on a busy urban court with a caseload \nof over 100,000 cases per year. As an associate judge on the Superior \nCourt of the District of Columbia she will bring her knowledge, skills, \nand expertise to every decision in a busy courtroom dealing with \nhundreds of neglected and abused children who will come before her--\njuveniles alleged to have committed crimes, and those who have been \naccused and charged with crimes ranging from misdemeanors to first \ndegree murder and sexual abuse.\n  Judge Demeo will be there to serve as she always has, ready to make \ntimely and fair decisions on domestic violence cases, housing issues, \nchild custody and support.\n  The caseload will not deter her. It will invigorate her, and I am \nproud to cast my vote to confirm Judge Demeo as an associate judge on \nthe Superior Court of the District of Columbia and urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  The time has come to confirm this nominee.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to support the long-delayed \nnomination of Judge Marisa Demeo for a seat on the DC Superior Court \nand urge my colleagues to approve her as quickly as possible so she can \ntake her place on this court that is both busy and shorthanded.\n  Judge Demeo is well qualified for this position and brings a range of \nlegal experience to her new job that would make her an asset to the \ncourt. She has been a judge, a prosecutor, a plaintiff's attorney \nadvocating for civil rights and a law professor.\n  Specifically, for the past 2 years, Judge Demeo has served as a \nmagistrate judge in the Criminal Division of the Superior Court of the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Prior to that, from 2004 to 2007 she served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of \nColumbia; from 1997 to 2004 she served as the Regional Counsel for the \nMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, from 1993 to 1996 \nshe was an honors program trial attorney with the Justice Department \nCivil Rights division, and she was an adjunct professor of law at \nHoward University in 2003, 2005 and 2008.\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\n  Judge Demeo is a graduate of Princeton University with a bachelor's \ndegree in political science and earned her law degree at New York \nUniversity. And besides her legal work, she is also in demand as a \nspeaker on legal issues and is the author of many articles on civil \nrights law.\n  Judge Demeo also has a compelling personal story that reminds us that \nthe American dream is alive and well. Her father--the son of Italian \nimmigrants--and her mother--a Puerto Rican immigrant--taught her that \nif you work hard, anything is possible and Judge Demeo has channeled \nher talent and drive into a successful career in public service.\n  These facts taken together led the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee to endorse Judge Demeo's nomination by voice vote in \nMay.\n  Let me say that again, the committee reported Judge Demeo's \nnomination to the full Senate in May--11 months ago--and it has been \nstalled ever since.\n  There is also speculation that some object to her because of legal \nadvocacy work she has done on behalf of the Mexican American Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund, also known as MALDEF.\n  But there is no reason that this sort of work should be held against \nany nominee. Under our system of justice, when an individual or group \nbelieves something is not just, they are allowed to have their day in \ncourt and have an attorney zealously argue their cause.\n  In her confirmation hearing, Judge Demeo was specifically asked if \nher advocacy work would affect her decisionmaking as a judge. Let me \ngive you Judge Demeo's response in her own words:\n\n       When you think about the parties that appear in the \n     courtroom, oftentimes it's plaintiffs versus defendants and \n     one party against another, and I've . . . worked in both \n     positions in my career. Being in the judge position has \n     allowed me to take a step back already, in the magistrate \n     position, and listen to the parties and be open to both \n     sides.\n\n  To that end, at her confirmation hearing, representatives of the \nJustice Department and the Public Defenders' office came to lend their \nsupport to her nomination.\n  And we should remember, that nominations for the DC courts are made \nthrough a process different than other judicial nominees.\n  Under the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental \nReorganization Act, the Judicial Nominations Committee recommends three \nindividuals for each position to the President, and the President then \nselects one of those individuals and sends the nomination to the Senate \nfor confirmation.\n  The Judicial Nominations Committee is a diverse, Federal-district \nentity, comprised of two individuals appointed by the Mayor of the \nDistrict of Columbia--one being a nonlawyer--two appointed by the Board \nof Governors of the District of Columbia Bar, one nonlawyer appointed \nby the city council of the District of Columbia, one individual \nappointed by the President of the United States, and one judicial \nmember appointed by the Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  This is a process aimed at getting the best qualified nominees, \nwithout regard to party or politics.\n  Finally, Chief Judge of the Superior Court, Lee F. Satterfield, wrote \nto both the majority and minority leaders in October pleading for the \nswift approval of Judge Demeo because the court is already five members \nshort.\n  In his letter, Judge Satterfield wrote:\n\n       The Superior Court is a busy, urban court with a caseload \n     of over 100,000 cases a year. Each day we make important \n     decisions about neglected and abused children, juveniles \n     alleged to have committed crimes, and accused charged with \n     everything from minor misdemeanors to first degree murder and \n     sexual abuse. Vulnerable families in the District rely on \n     Superior Court judges to make timely and fair decisions \n     regarding domestic violence, housing, child custody and \n     support, and numerous issues that affect them every day. Our \n     goal is to serve the community well by handling the important \n     decisions we are entrusted with fairly, justly and \n     efficiently.\n\n  And last month, Judge Satterfield sent another letter to the majority \nand minority leader with this dire warning, ``We are beginning to \nexperience delays in meeting performance measures and standards for how \nquickly cases should go to trial.''\n  But, a shorthanded court cannot achieve these goals, which means \njustice is delayed for many. It's long past time that we approve this \nhighly qualified nominee and I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this \nnomination and allow her to get to work administering justice for the \ncitizens of our Nation's Capital.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               In Praise of Dorothy Metcalf-lindenburger\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak once more about \nour Nation's great Federal employees.\n  Forty-nine years ago, President Kennedy stood before Congress and \noffered a bold profession of his faith in American innovation. \nConvening a special joint session to share with the American people his \nplans for economic recovery and global leadership, President Kennedy \nchallenged us to reach the Moon in 9 years. He reminded us that leading \nthe way in exploring space was central to leading a vibrant innovation \neconomy, and that the causes of economic recovery and national security \nwould benefit from investing in a Moon shot, and that the newly free \naround the world, caught between East and West, would draw inspiration \nfrom such a difficult mission undertaken by a free people. He \nchallenged us to reach the Moon in 9 years. We made it there in 8 \nyears.\n  Kennedy's call echoed a timeless adage: ``Ad Astra Per Aspera''--to \nthe stars through rough times.\n  When we are faced with difficult challenges, we look for inspiration \nbeyond the bounds of our farthest frontier. We can choose, despite \nuncertainty, to be forward looking and set lofty goals. That, more than \nanything, is the mission of those great Federal employees who work at \nthe National Aeronautic and Space Administration, NASA.\n  I was among those called to the study of engineering in the late \n1950s during the years of Sputnik and the start of the space station. \nWe benefited not only from the amount of investment the government was \nmaking in STEM fields, but also by the strong sense of purpose the \nspace program inspired in all of us.\n  America's reach into space is intricately linked with our need to \ntrain the next generation of scientists, engineers, technologists, and \nmathematicians who will drive our 21st century innovation economy, and \nI know there is no one in the Senate any more committed to STEM \neducation than the Presiding Officer.\n  That is why I have chosen this week to honor a great Federal employee \nfrom NASA who spent the last 2 weeks orbiting the Earth on STS-131 and \nhas dedicated her career to promoting STEM education.\n  Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger is one of NASA's new educator \nastronauts. A native of Fort Collins, CO, Dottie, as she is called, \ntook an unusual path to space. As a child, Dottie was always fascinated \nwith astronomy and space exploration. When she narrowly lost a contest \nto win a free trip to space camp, her parents saved up enough money for \nher to go. It turned out to be an excellent investment not only in \ntheir daughter's future, but also in the many students Dottie has \ninspired.\n  Dottie pursued her love of science at Whitman College, where she \nmajored in geology. She began teaching Earth science and astronomy at \nHudson's Bay High School in Vancouver, WA, in 1999. In her 5 years \nthere as a science teacher, she won awards for achievement. An avid \nmarathon runner, Dottie also coached the school's cross-country team.\n  In 2003, one of her students asked a question that would change her \nlife. The student curiously asked: How do\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\nastronauts use the bathroom in space? When Dottie went on line to \nresearch the answer for her student, she discovered on NASA's Web site \na recruitment call for teachers to join the space program. She jumped \nat the chance, though it was a long shot. Over 8,000 teachers \napplied. Dottie was one of three who made it and is currently NASA's \nyoungest active astronaut.\n\n  She joined NASA in 2004 and began the rigorous, 2-year Astronaut \nCandidate Training. Dottie learned how to fly jets and operate complex \nspace shuttle and International Space Station systems. She undertook \nscientific and technical briefings, engaged in physiological training, \nand practiced water and wilderness survival skills. As an educator \nastronaut, Dottie works with NASA's education program, helping to \ndevelop new ways to bring space and STEM subjects into the classroom \nand inspiring girls and boys alike to follow in her footsteps by \nstudying science.\n  When she is not training to be a mission specialist on the shuttle, \nrunning a marathon, or singing lead vocals for an astronaut band, \nDottie is also inspiring her own daughter. She and her husband Jason, \nwho is a history teacher, have taught their 3-year-old daughter, \nCambria, how to sing ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' and other songs \nabout the Sun and the Moon.\n  On April 5, Dottie and the rest of the crew of Discovery's STS-131 \nmission lifted off from Cape Canaveral for a 2-week trip to the \nInternational Space Station. Dottie's primary tasks were overseeing the \ntransition of the station's computers to a new Ethernet network and \norchestrating the space walks conducted by two of her colleagues. She \nalso recorded a video to help promote robotics, science, and \nengineering.\n  Dottie sees her role as a teacher for all, helping to make science \nexciting for adults and children alike. She and her husband even built \na telescope that they brought on summer vacation, and wherever they \nstopped they would encourage people to look through it at objects like \nJupiter or the Moon.\n  She said, ``Wherever we go out in our solar system, from a teaching \nstandpoint, I really hope that students are engaged in learning math \nand science. We should always try to be a leader in this.''\n  America's astronauts--like Dottie--carry out important work with far-\nreaching impact.\n  Once again we find ourselves as a nation in difficult times, just as \nwe were when President Kennedy challenged us to look skyward.\n  Just last week, President Obama laid out his vision for the future of \nAmerican space exploration. No matter what their next mission, it will \nbe carried out by NASA employees.\n  The outstanding public servants at NASA give flight to our dreams and \nremind us that, in America, when we will it, there is no impediment to \ngrand achievement.\n  ``Ad Astra Per Aspera.'' Let us look once more, in these rough times, \nto the stars--to the limits of space and those who would take us there.\n  Let us recommit ourselves to inspiring students, just as astronauts \nlike Dottie do each day, to study science, math, engineering, and \ntechnology in pursuit of innovation in space and here on Earth.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Dorothy Metcalf-\nLindenburger and her crewmates from STS-131 for their hard work and \ncontribution. We welcome them home.\n  They are all truly great Federal employees.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be divided equally between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Marisa Demeo \nto be an associate judge in the District of Columbia Superior Court. I \nchaired her nomination hearing before the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs and believe she is a very well-\nqualified candidate.\n  Since 2007, she has served as a magistrate judge of the DC Superior \nCourt. Prior to that, she was an assistant U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Columbia, prosecuting criminals on behalf of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Judge Demeo also worked as an attorney for the Mexican-American Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, an organization that provides legal \nservices to individuals of Hispanic descent. She received her \nbachelor's degree from Princeton University and her J.D. from the New \nYork University Law School.\n  Candidates from the DC Superior Court are identified by the \nnonpartisan Judicial Nomination Commission, which sends three names of \nqualified candidates to the President for his final selection. This \nprocess has consistently produced excellent nominees for DC's local \ncourts. Similar to others chosen through this process, I believe Judge \nDemeo has much to offer the DC Superior Court.\n  Judge Demeo has a strong record as magistrate judge and has presided \nover many cases of the busy criminal calendar. My staff spoke with DC \nSuperior Court Chief Judge Satterfield today, and he emphasized how \npleased he has been with her performance. Judge Satterfield said he \ncould not understand the concerns raised about Judge Demeo's \nimpartiality--she has an open record as a magistrate judge, and no one \nis criticizing her work on the court.\n  The committee also interviewed many of her colleagues during the \nnomination process who described her as fair, having a good temperament \nand knowledge of the law. Judge Demeo herself emphasized the importance \nof fairness, impartiality, integrity, and respect for all parties \nappearing before her during her nomination hearing.\n  In May 2009, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs favorably reported her nomination. The committee of \njurisdiction clearly considered her to be well qualified because no \nobjections to her nomination were voiced.\n  I was pleased that the Senate confirmed Stuart Nash to be an \nassociate judge of the DC Superior Court earlier today. However, there \nremains a critical need to fill vacancies at the court. DC Superior \nCourt is a trial court that hears over 100,000 cases a year. With many \njudges nearing retirement, it is important to fill empty seats quickly.\n  This need is so great that Chief Judge Satterfield wrote two letters \nto Majority Leader Reid asking us to fill these vacancies. Judge \nSatterfield described the situation as dire and stated that unfilled \nvacancies hinder the court's ability to administer justice for the \npeople of DC.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nboth of Judge Satterfield's letters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Superior Court of the\n\n\n                                         District of Columbia,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Oct. 14, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: As Chief Judge of the Superior \n     Court of the District of Columbia, I wanted to take a moment \n     to bring to your attention two nominations for associate \n     judges positions on the Superior Court that have been pending \n     for several months. The nominees are Marisa Demeo and Stuart \n     Nash. I understand the press of business before the Senate, \n     given the economy, the push for health care reform, and the \n     myriad of nominees in a relatively new administration. \n     However, I wanted to draw your attention to the dire \n     situation the Superior Court will face by the end of the year \n     due to the announced retirements of three other Superior \n     Court judges, if these nominees are not confirmed in the next \n     few months.\n       If these two vacancies are not filled before the Senate \n     adjourns, we will be five judges below our full complement of \n     62 associate\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\n     judges by the end of January 2010. These vacancies would have \n     serious consequences for the administration of justice in the \n     District of Columbia and for the people we serve. We have \n     been working without a full complement of judges most of the \n     year since one of my colleagues, Judge Robert Rigsby, was \n     sent to Iraq with the National Guard. Fortunately, another \n     colleague, Judge Rafael Diaz, who retired in March 2009 at \n     the end of his term, graciously agreed to stay and handle a \n     full caseload while we await his replacement. I am not sure \n     how long Judge Diaz will be able to continue full time. If \n     the two pending nominations are not confirmed before the \n     Senate adjourns for the year, and Judge Diaz can no longer \n     handle cases full time, by the end of January 2010, we will \n     have only 57 associate judges. Such a scenario would \n     certainly test our ability to administer justice for the \n     people of the District of Columbia in a timely fashion, \n     particularly in our Criminal Division and Family Court.\n       The Superior Court is a busy, urban court with a caseload \n     of over 100,000 cases per year. Each day we make important \n     decisions about neglected and abused children, juveniles \n     alleged to have committed crimes, and accused charged with \n     everything from minor misdemeanors to first degree murder and \n     sexual abuse. Vulnerable families in the District rely on \n     Superior Court judges to make timely and fair decisions \n     regarding domestic violence, housing, child custody and \n     support, and numerous issues that affect them every day. Our \n     goal is to serve the community well by handling the important \n     decisions we are entrusted with fairly, justly and \n     efficiently. I would appreciate any help you can provide in \n     moving the two nominations forward.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Lee F. Satterfield,\n     Chief Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Superior Court of the\n                                             District of Columbia,\n                                    Washington, DC, Mar. 12, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: I wanted to provide you with an \n     update on the circumstances in the D.C. Superior Court with \n     the five vacancies we are currently experiencing. Judge Diaz, \n     who has been continuing to hear cases on one of the \n     unassigned calendars after announcing his retirement, will be \n     stepping down within the next month. This will leave us with \n     five full vacancies, which clearly hinders our ability to \n     administer justice for the people of the District of Columbia \n     in a timely fashion, especially worrisome in the Criminal \n     Division and the Family Court. We are beginning to experience \n     delays in meeting the performance measures and standards for \n     how quickly cases should get to trial.\n       As I mentioned in my October letter, the Superior Court is \n     a busy, urban court with a caseload of over 100,000 cases per \n     year. Each day we make life and death decisions about \n     neglected and abused children, juveniles alleged to have \n     committed crimes, criminals charged with everything from \n     minor misdemeanors to first degree murder and sex abuse. \n     Vulnerable families in the District rely on Superior Court \n     judges to make timely and fair decisions regarding domestic \n     violence, housing, child custody and support, and numerous \n     issues that affect them every day. These cases need to be \n     handled effectively but also efficiently.\n       I understand the great press of business before the U.S. \n     Senate, and the multitude of bills affecting the lives of \n     people across the country. However, the people of the \n     District of Columbia deserve a court with a full complement \n     of judges making the crucial decisions affecting the lives of \n     D.C. residents.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Lee F. Satterfield,\n                                                      Chief Judge.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs works quickly to hold its nomination hearings \nbecause we understand what an important role the court plays in the \nDistrict's legal system. It saddens me that the District's courts and \nits residents continue to suffer while a highly qualified candidate's \nnomination is slowed.\n  I am confident that once confirmed, Judge Demeo will exercise sound \nand unbiased judgment when ruling on cases before her. She has the \neducation and experience to make valuable contributions to the DC \nSuperior Court bench. I plan to vote in support of Judge Demeo's \nnomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any remaining \ntime for debate with respect to the Demeo nomination be yielded back, \nand the Senate now proceed to vote on confirmation of the nomination; \nfurther, that upon confirmation, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action, and the cloture motion with respect to the \nnomination be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Marisa J.

Mr. President, today the Senate finally confirmed the \nnomination of Marisa Demeo for a 15-year term as a judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Superior Court. Her nomination was the longest \npending judicial nomination on the Executive Calendar, having been \nstalled since it was reported by the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee last May--nearly a year ago--by voice vote.\n  There was no reason for this nomination to have been delayed so long. \nIndeed, once the majority leader pressed the matter by filing for \ncloture, Republicans agreed to 6 hours of debate and then used only a \nsmall portion of that. The bipartisan vote in favor of Judge Demeo is \nhardly unexpected, just delayed a year.\n  Judge Demeo has served for 3 years as a magistrate judge on the court \nto which she has been confirmed. She is only the second Hispanic woman \nto hold that position. Judge Demeo is an experienced former prosecutor \nand Justice Department veteran with a sterling professional record. The \nChief Judge of the Superior Court, Lee Satterfield, has written several \ntimes to the majority and minority leaders about the ``dire situation'' \ncreated by vacancies on that court for administration of justice in \nWashington, DC, and in support of Judge Demeo's nomination.\n  Judge Demeo should have been confirmed long ago. This sort of \nobstruction of a DC Superior Court nomination is unprecedented. These \nnominations for 15-year terms on the District's trial court are not \nusually controversial.\n  Those Senators who opposed this nomination and voted against it will \nhave to explain their vote. Some tried. I do not think references to \n``lifestyle'' have a place in this debate. I was also struck by those \nwho selectively cited her advocacy for various causes when she was \npreviously employed as an advocate as somehow rendering her unfit for \njudicial service. These same Senators were willing to give President \nBush's nominees the benefit of the\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\ndoubt, but apparently not those of President Obama. Their mantra when \nthere was a Republican President nominating Republican activists was \nthat they would be able to put aside those views or that they were \nmerely doing their job or representing a client. Apparently that leeway \nonly applies to Republican nominees.\n  I commend those Republican Senators who bucked their party to vote in \nfavor of this fine young woman and well-qualified nominee.\n  I strongly supported the confirmation of Judge Demeo and regret that \nit has taken nearly a year for her nomination to receive an up-or-down \nvote in the Senate. I congratulate her on her confirmation to the \nSuperior Court and have every confidence she will be a fair and \nthoughtful judge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is considered made and laid on the table. The President will \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the cloture motion \non the nomination is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I indicated yesterday, when I asked \nunanimous consent on a nomination, that I would be back on the floor \ntoday at 4:30. So following this vote I wanted to come to the floor to \nonce again ask unanimous consent. I told my colleague from Louisiana, \nSenator Vitter, that I was going to do this. I told him last week when \nI came to speak about this. I said I don't, under any conditions, come \nto the floor of the Senate wanting to be critical of another Senator. \nThat is not something I enjoy doing. In this case, I explained to \nSenator Vitter that I was going to be critical of something he has done \nand I felt it appropriate and as a matter of courtesy I should tell my \ncolleague from Louisiana what I was going to do.\n  Let me describe the circumstance. It bothers me a lot. I am pretty \nunhappy about it and so should all of my colleagues be unhappy. There \nis a man named GEN Michael Walsh, a soldier who served this country for \n30 years. He served in wartime. I know him, know him fairly well. I am \nnot related to him. I don't have anything other than a professional \nrelationship because I have seen his work in the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers. He is an extraordinary guy.\n  He was recommended unanimously by the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Levin and Senator McCain and the unanimous vote of the Armed \nServices Committee, to be promoted from a one-star general to a two-\nstar major general. That was last year.\n  It has dragged on now for nearly 6 months and this soldier has not \nbeen promoted because the nomination to promote him, which came from \nthe Armed Services Committee unanimously, has been held up by one \nSenator. That is Senator Vitter from Louisiana.\n  I understand that Senator Vitter is holding this nomination up all of \nthese months because he is demanding certain things from the Corps of \nEngineers for his home State.\n  Regrettably, it represents a list of things, for the most part, that \nthe Corps of Engineers cannot do--they don't have the legal authority \nto do, they don't have the funding, they don't have the authorization \nto do. In any event, the general we are talking about, General Walsh, \ndoesn't make policy for the corps on whether to do these things, even \nif they have the authority. He does policy. That is what the job of \nthis general is. He is the commander of the Mississippi Valley Division \nof the Corps of Engineers. He spent a tour in Iraq for this country. He \nhas done a lot of work not only in a war zone but all around the \ncountry, has a distinguished 30-year career. Yet despite the fact that \nlast October, he was to have been promoted to major general, this \nsoldier's professional life is on hold because of the actions of one \nSenator.\n  I say to my colleague from Louisiana, this is fundamentally unfair to \nGeneral Walsh. It is fundamentally unfair. It is not the way we should \ntreat soldiers. The demands that are being made of the Corps of \nEngineers are demands the corps cannot meet. I put the exchange of \nletters in the Congressional Record. There are two letters from my \ncolleague, Senator Vitter, and two responses from the Corps of \nEngineers. They make it clear that the Senator from Louisiana is asking \nsomething the corps cannot possibly do. He has made six or eight \nrequests. I believe the corps has indicated they will proceed on two of \nthem because they do have the authority. The others they cannot because \nthey are not authorized. They don't have money, and they don't have the \nlegal capability.\n  This is 1 out of 100 nominations that is being held up, 1 out of 100 \non the Executive Calendar. This person is someone I know, a one-star \ngeneral who deserves to be a two-star general. That is what Senator \nMcCain and Senator Levin believe. Unanimously, the Armed Services \nCommittee reported this out last September. This soldier's career is on \nhold because one Senator is demanding of the corps something the corps \ncannot and will not be able to do. It does not have the legal authority \nand does not have the funding and does not have the authorization to do \nit.\n  I am here to make a unanimous consent request again. I ask of my \ncolleague from Louisiana if at long last he might allow this nomination \nto proceed. This general should not be a one-star general. He should \nhave, last September, been a two-star general because unanimously the \nArmed Services Committee believed he was owed that and deserved that \npromotion in rank. Months and months and months and months later, this \ngeneral has had his career stalled by the actions of one Senator.\n  My hope is that today perhaps that Senator will tell us he will lift \nthat hold and that we will be able to give the second star to General \nWalsh, a patriot, a soldier, someone who served this country in wartime \nand does not deserve what has happened to him in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me join my colleague from North \nDakota in making a plea to the Senator from Louisiana. As the Senator \nfrom Louisiana knows, I am chairman of the Armed Services Committee. \nOur committee operates on a bipartisan basis. I see one other member of \nthe committee sitting on the floor; in fact, two other committee \nmembers are on the floor, including the Presiding Officer. I know they \nwould confirm what I am saying. We should keep our uniformed military \nofficers out of any kind of political crossfire. They don't make these \ndecisions. They put on the uniform of the United States. They give \ntheir lives. Their families support them. The least we can do is give \nthem bipartisan support. We do that on this committee.\n  This nomination was approved and put on the calendar on October 27. \nThis is a document we call the Executive Calendar of the Senate. It is \nprinted every day. This general has been sitting here now, MG Michael \nJ. Walsh, since October 27. The Senator from Louisiana has expressed \nhimself to the Corps of Engineers. He has made his arguments. This \ngeneral cannot do what the Senator from Louisiana is asking for. No. 1, \nhe can't do it because the corps has told the Senator they don't have \nthe authority to do what he wants them to do in terms of these three \nprojects. In any event, this general does not have the authority within \nthe corps to make these kinds of decisions, even if the corps had the \nauthority to approve these projects.\n  As chairman of the committee, I know I am speaking not only for \nmyself, I am speaking for every member of the committee who has voted \nfor this general's nomination. I know I am speaking for Senator McCain, \nwho has told me specifically that I can invoke his name in support of a \nplea to the Senator from Louisiana to no longer hold this nomination. \nIt cannot achieve what the Senator from Louisiana wants to achieve. It \nis a terrible message to the men and women in uniform that a nomination \nsuch as this is obstructed because there is a request from one Senator \nfor some projects for his State which the corps cannot approve, \naccording to the letter which the corps has sent to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  I join my friend from North Dakota. On behalf of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I make this plea. I spoke to the Senator from Louisiana a \nnumber of months ago. He indicated to me that he just needed a few more \nweeks. He thought he could straighten this out in a few more weeks. A \ncouple months\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\nhave now passed since that conversation. I would make this plea as \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, but I know, representing the \nunanimous view of the committee, that this man, this soldier, this \ngeneral should not have his promotion held up for these kinds of \nreasons or any kind of reason, as far as I am concerned, but surely not \na reason where he himself is personally involved. Once in a while we \nwill disagree with a nomination, including of a uniformed officer, \nwhere we have problems with that uniformed officer's activities, \nsomething they may have done that we disapprove of--rarely, but it \nhappens. But in this case, this has nothing to do with this officer. \nThe objection or the effort of the Senator from Louisiana has nothing \nto do with this officer. It is not this officer who is blocking \nanything the Senator from Louisiana wants.\n  I join this plea the Senator from North Dakota has made. I know he \nwill be making a unanimous consent request. I will be joining in that \nrequest when he makes it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I do object. General Walsh today, before \nany promotion, is one of nine leading officers of the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers. He is part of that leadership. I am happy my two \ncolleagues are satisfied with his leadership and the corps' leadership \nand how that agency is being run. I can tell them, as a Senator from \nLouisiana, I am absolutely not satisfied with their leadership and how \nthat agency is being run at all.\n  Since Hurricane Katrina, there were 14 major report deadlines put on \nthe Corps of Engineers, required of the corps. The corps missed all 14 \nof those major deadlines. Today, as we speak, the corps is still \nactively missing and has failed to respond to 13 of the 14, having \naccomplished 1 many months late.\n  I have brought nine significant issues before the Corps of Engineers \nin conversations with them, not minor projects, major issues with \nregard to hurricane recovery and hurricane and flood protection. I have \noutlined the authority they have to do constructive things under each \nof those categories. They have not responded in a positive or timely \nway on eight of those nine issues.\n  One of those issues is a particularly good example. That is the \nMorganza to the gulf hurricane protection project. That is a vital \nhurricane protection project that would protect significant portions of \nsouth Louisiana that was originally proposed in 1992. The Senators want \nto talk about authority from Congress. That project has been authorized \nby Congress three different times in three different water resources \nbills. Yet the corps continues to drag its feet and is still not moving \nforward toward full implementation of that project, after three \nspecific authorizations by Congress, 18 years later.\n  I am sorry the corps leadership is frustrated with an 18-day delay or \nan 18-week delay. But I suggest they try 18 years on for size. That is \nhow long the people of Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, many folks \nthroughout Louisiana, have been waiting on the Corps of Engineers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me say to my colleague from \nLouisiana, if he will stay in the Chamber--let the record note he has \nleft the Chamber--there is no State, none that has received more help \nmore consistently from this Chamber, from the American people, and, \nyes, from the Corps of Engineers in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. \nThat State and the city of New Orleans were leveled. It was an \nunbelievable catastrophe for the Senator's State and for his city. But \nafter billions and billions and billions of dollars that has come from \nthis Congress and, yes, from my subcommittee, the subcommittee on \nappropriations I chair, I think it would be nice for a change to hear \nthat maybe the Corps of Engineers, the Senate, and the American people \nhave been a great help to New Orleans and to Louisiana.\n  Let me describe what my colleague just said on the floor, why this is \nsuch an unbelievable mistake for him to make. He says, just to pick an \nexample: Well, the Morganza to the gulf issue is a perfect example of \nhow the corps simply will not do what it is supposed to do. It has been \nauthorized three times, he says, on and on.\n  Let me read what the Corps of Engineers says and let me tell my \ncolleagues what I know as an appropriator. The Corps of Engineers is \nnot authorized to construct the Houma lock, which is what he wants in \nthis Morganza to the gulf--the Houma lock, as an independent, \nfreestanding project--or separable elements of the Morganza to the gulf \nproject. An additional authorization will have to be required to \nconstruct the Morganza to the gulf project in accordance with the new \ndesign criteria.\n  My colleague might not like that. I understand that. There are a \nwhole lot of things he doesn't like. But it is a fact. He cannot \npossibly go to sleep believing that holding up the promotion of a \nsoldier who has gone to war for his country because of something that \nsoldier can't do that he demands be done, he cannot possibly sleep easy \nbelieving that is the right course of action. It is not the right \ncourse of action. This is but 1 of 100 names on the Executive Calendar \nto date, 100. This was put on the calendar nearly 6 months ago for a \ngeneral who has an unblemished record, has served America for 30 years, \ngone to war for this country, and was told by the Armed Services \nCommittee, Republicans and Democrats unanimously by Senator Levin and \nSenator McCain: You deserve a promotion to the second star as a major \ngeneral. But 6 months later, this is not a major general.\n  This soldier has lost his promotion for the last 6 months because of \none Senator saying: I am going to use this soldier as a pawn in my \nconcerns and demands about the Corps of Engineers.\n  I could go through the rest of these demands. In fact, let me go \nthrough a couple, if I might. Outfall canals and pump to the river. He \nis making demands about that. Let me tell you about that. We had a vote \non this. He lost. He doesn't like it. The Appropriations Committee, the \nfull committee, voted and he lost. Why did he lose? Because what he \nwants to do is the most costly approach that will provide less flood \nprotection for New Orleans. So you want to spend more money for less \nprotection? No, the Appropriations Committee voted on that. I led the \nopposition. The appropriations subcommittee voted no. He is demanding \nholding up, by the way, the promotion for this major general. He is \ndemanding it be done. The Corps of Engineers says if Congress \nappropriates the funds for this study, we will do it. But there are no \nfunds appropriated.\n  Why? Because we voted against it. That is why. Unbelievable. And the \nlist goes on. Ouachita River levees. The authorization for this project \nspecifies that the levee maintenance is a nonfederal responsibility. \nCongress has not enacted a general provision of law that would supplant \nthis nonfederal responsibility or that would allow the Corps to correct \nlevee damages that are not associated with flood events.\n  That is just two. I mentioned three with Morganza. The fact is, we \nhave a circumstance here where a soldier deserves a promotion, and that \npromotion is being held up because we have a Senator who is demanding \nthings the Corps of Engineers cannot do. That is unbelievable to me. I \ndo not come here very often getting angry about what a colleague does. \nEverybody here has their own desk. Everybody comes here with their own \nelection and their own support. But I am saying this to you: These \ndemands and using a soldier's promotion as a pawn in demands of the \nCorps that the Corps cannot do is just fundamentally wrong, and I do \nnot know how someone can sleep doing it.\n  Madam President, I have not yet made the consent request. I would \nalert my----\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield. But I do intend to make a unanimous \nconsent request. I have not made it. So I would alert the folks who are \nhere that I will be doing that momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. It is my understanding, through the Chair, that there \nare dozens and dozens of these holds that are secret and nobody knows \nwhat demands are being made or why. We do not know.\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\n  In this instance, it is my understanding that this Senator has \nproclaimed publicly why he is holding it. Is my understanding correct \nabout that, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct, I think perhaps boasting about it. He is \nsaying: I have to do this for my State. But there is nothing he can \ngain for his State because the Corps of Engineers cannot move on these \nissues. They do not have the authority. They do not have the legal \ncapability. The result is, this soldier, whose promotion he is holding \nup, meanwhile is wafting in the wind for 6 months and loses his \npromotion.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. That is the part I want to inquire about. Let's just \nsay hypothetically, if the Army Corps of Engineers succumbed to what \nthe Senator is asking and said: OK, you are going to hold up this brave \nsoldier's promotion that he deserves because you want something for \nyour State--if they did that, would that not be illegal?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. So what he is saying is, he is asking the Army Corps \nof Engineers to do something that is illegal, and if they refuse to do \nsomething that is illegal, he is going to refuse to allow a soldier's \npromotion to go through? Am I actually getting that right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator, I believe you have it pretty close \nto right. As I understand it, the Senator is demanding things of the \nCorps of Engineers that they do not have the legal authority to do. \nUntil they do them, he is going to hold up the promotion of General \nWalsh, which I think--it is unbelievable to me that someone would do \nthat.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield further?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me read to you from the March 19 letter from the Corps \non this issue. The Senator from Louisiana said the example he wanted to \nuse was something called the Morganza project. That is the example. He \nsaid, let me just give you one example. Three times, he says, this \nproject has been authorized.\n  Well, this is what the Corps says relative to Morganza. OK. This is \nin writing, a letter to Senator Vitter:\n\n       The Corps does not have authority to implement the Houma \n     Navigation Lock as an independent project. Section 425 of \n     WRDA 1996 authorized a study of an independent lock, but did \n     not authorize construction. Section 425 in part read . . . \n     ``The Secretary shall conduct a study of environmental, flood \n     control, and navigation impacts associated with the \n     construction of a lock structure in the Houma Navigation \n     Canal as an independent feature of the overall damage \n     prevention study being conducted under the Morganza,--\n\n  That is his project--\n\n     Louisiana, to the Gulf of Mexico feasibility study.'' The \n     Corps conducted a study in response to Section 425, but that \n     study did not recommend construction of an independent Houma \n     Navigation Lock feature due to uncertainties of benefits and \n     concerns over justification of an independent lock structure.\n\n  That is their answer. They do not have the authority to do it.\n  Again, I know the Senator from Missouri is on the committee, so she \nunderstands that we act in a bipartisan way. We try to protect and \ndefend and support the uniformed members of the U.S. military. We have \nunlimited bipartisan support for what they do for us, and this is the \nresponse--a hold on a nomination because the Corps will not do \nsomething they are not authorized to do?\n  I think it is so unacceptable, I made this unanimous consent request \nabout 2 months ago. The Senator from Louisiana objected then. He said \nto give him a few more weeks. He thinks he could work it out. Those few \nweeks have long gone. So I very much support the effort of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is unbelievable to me that we have \n100 of these. This is one I am particularly concerned about because I \nthink it misuses a soldier's promotion in pursuit of something that \nreally cannot be done by an agency, and I regret this is happening. \nThis should not happen. And how on Earth are we going to find ways to \nwork together in this place if this is the way we do business?\n  This makes no sense to me. It is not fair to a soldier. People \nlistening to this would understand somebody demanding that an agency do \nsomething it cannot do in exchange for releasing a hold on a soldier's \npromotion? Is that what we have come to here? I hope not.\n  So my intention is to offer a unanimous consent request. My \nunderstanding is, someone is----\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the Senator from Delaware has a unanimous consent \nrequest which has been cleared. I wonder, just to make sure the Senator \nfrom Louisiana does have notice--apparently, he has been notified there \nis going to be a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to have the Senator from Delaware do his \nrequest. I would say, however, that the Senator from Louisiana was on \nthe floor, and I would have hoped he would have stayed on the floor to \nobject to something that deals with the holdup he has made on this \nnomination. But apparently he has left the floor.\n  So let me yield to the Senator from Delaware for his unanimous \nconsent request, and then I will propound a unanimous consent request \non the subject just discussed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, April 21, \nfollowing a period of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession to consider Executive Calendar No. 699, the nomination of \nChristopher Schroeder to be an Assistant Attorney General; that there \nbe 3 hours of debate with respect to the nomination; that upon the use \nor yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of \nthe nomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table; further, that the cloture \nmotion with respect to the nomination be withdrawn; provided that upon \ndisposition of the Schroeder nomination, the Senate then proceed to \nExecutive Calendar No. 578, the nomination of Thomas Vanaskie to be a \nU.S. circuit judge for the Third Circuit; that there be 3 hours of \ndebate with respect to the nomination; that upon the use or yielding \nback of time, the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the \nnomination; that upon confirmation, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table; that the cloture motion with \nrespect to the nomination be withdrawn; provided further that on \nThursday, April 22, following a period of morning business, the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 607, \nthe nomination of Denny Chin to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Second \nCircuit; that there be 60 minutes for debate with respect to the \nnomination; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on confirmation of the nomination; that upon \nconfirmation, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table; with the cloture motion withdrawn, and the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action with respect to the above-\nreferenced nominations; with all time covered under this agreement \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Leahy and Sessions or \ntheir designees; finally, the Senate then resume legislative session.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the cloture motions on the Schroeder, \nVanaskie, and Chin nominations are withdrawn.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Executive Calendar No. 526, the nomination of BG Michael J. \nWalsh; that the nomination be confirmed and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table; that any statements related to \nthe nomination be printed in the Record; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, Madam President, for the reasons I have clearly laid \nout, I again object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me again say the reasons that were \nclearly laid out were inappropriate reasons. The very specific project \nmy colleague described as the problem--at least one of the problems--it \nturns out he would know, because he has received written notice from \nthe Corps of Engineers, that they do not have the legal authority to do \nthat which he demands.\n  So I do not know. I do not know where you go from here. If facts do \nnot matter in this place, then I guess we have a fact-free debate and \none does what they want to do without regard to the consequences. The \nconsequence in this case--the negative consequence is for a soldier, a \npatriot who has gone to war for this country is now, in my judgment, \nbeing treated unbelievably unfairly by at least one Senator.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise because today marks 11 years \nsince the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, occurred. \nThis is a painful recall of a horrible moment in our country that \nshould remind us all of a condition that could easily happen again.\n  I and millions of other Americans watched in horror as young students \nhung out of windows in that schoolhouse to try to save their lives, \nwhile two of their schoolmates went on a rampage and killed 12 students \nand a teacher. Those images will forever be burned in our memory.\n  But here is what a lot of people do not know: All the firearms used \nby the shooters were bought by an underage friend at a gun show. That \npurchase was able to be made because of the gun show loophole. Because \nof the gun show loophole, they were bought with no questions asked, no \nbackground check, no questions about who you are, where you might live. \nThe weapons were bought ``cash and carry,'' without, again, any \nidentifying questions being asked or being supplied. Those 13 people \nshould never have died that day because those teenagers should not have \nhad access to those guns. The young woman who bought the guns for the \nshooters said she would not have done it if a background check had been \nrequired.\n  Our laws require a background check for all gun sales by licensed \ndealers. But a special exemption allows anyone--including terrorists \nsuch as bin Laden, criminals, gun traffickers, and the severely \nmentally ill--to buy guns without a background check from so-called \nprivate sellers, who sell hundreds of guns every year at gun shows, \nfully exempt from any responsibility for those sales.\n  In 1999, I introduced legislation to close the gun show loophole and \nto keep guns from falling into the wrong hands. In the aftermath of \nColumbine, the Senate passed my legislation, with Vice President Al \nGore casting the tiebreaking vote. It was a great victory but a short-\nlived one. The gun lobby stripped my legislation in conference with the \nHouse, and in the decade since then we have done absolutely nothing at \nthe national level to close the gun show loophole. No wonder domestic \nterrorists frequently use gun shows to sell their firearms to fund \ntheir illegal activities.\n  Just yesterday, we commemorated the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma \nCity bombing. It claimed 168 lives, including 19 children under the age \nof 6. Timothy McVeigh--the killer responsible for those horrific \ndeeds--frequently set up his own booth. He sold weapons at gun shows.\n  We continue to see the tragic consequences of senseless gun violence \nfueled by gun show dealers who are not really licensed.\n  Just a few weeks ago, a few miles from this Chamber, John Patrick \nBedell opened fire on two police officers at the Pentagon Metro \nstation. They were wounded before they returned the fire and killed \nBedell. One of his semiautomatic guns was linked directly back to a gun \nshow sale. And it is no surprise that his gun was bought outside the \nnormal stream of commerce because Bedell would have failed a background \ncheck. He actually tried to buy a gun from a licensed firearms dealer \nin California, but because of his diagnosed mental illness, he couldn't \npass the check.\n\n  If that doesn't make it clear that we have to stop guns from falling \ninto the wrong hands, just think of the Virginia Tech shootings. Last \nFriday, we marked the third anniversary of that horrible day. In that \ntragedy, a mentally deranged man killed 32 students and faculty in the \nworst mass shooting in American history.\n  Whether it is Virginia Tech, the recent shootings at the Pentagon, or \nColumbine, we are reminded over and over that our gun laws are not \nstrong enough. Yet, while gunshots continue to ring out across this \ncountry, the silence from this Chamber is deafening.\n  I am a veteran. I served in the military in Europe during wartime, \nWorld War II, and I understand the desire to protect one's self and \nfamily. But I know how important it is to keep terrorists, convicted \ncriminals, and domestic abusers from having guns.\n  Some would argue that gun owners are against sensible gun laws, \nincluding closing the gun show loophole, but that is simply not true. \nRecent polling has shown that there is overwhelming support for closing \nthe gun show loophole among gun owners. Here we have a placard that \nshows that gun owners themselves want the loophole closed. Sixty-nine \npercent of NRA members agree, and 85 percent of other gun owners agree: \nShut down that gun show loophole. Republican pollster Frank Luntz \nrecently found that 69 percent of National Rifle Association members \nand, as pointed out, 85 percent of other gun owners want us to close \nthis loophole. After all, the vast majority of gun owners are law-\nabiding Americans who pass background checks and use their firearms \nresponsibly. They know their lives and the lives of their children are \nin danger when a firearm is purchased by an unqualified buyer at a gun \nshow, by someone who could never pass a background check at a \nneighborhood gun store. It is as easy as ever for criminals to buy \nguns--easier, in fact, than it is to get a library card.\n  We have an opportunity to save lives, and that is why I call on my \ncolleagues to please join me and pass my bill to close the gun show \nloophole once and for all. Eleven years ago, we lost 12 students and a \nteacher to gun violence in Littleton, CO. One of the best ways to honor \nthose who perished and those who have suffered is to make sure a \ntragedy like Columbine never happens again. We owe that and nothing \nless to the young people who died 11 years ago and the young people who \ncount on us today. We have to step up to our responsibilities and ask \nall gun dealers to step up to their responsibilities.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2463-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2463-S2466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUESTS--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, earlier today I came to the floor to \ntalk about transparency and the bright sunshine of public service and \nhow foundational it is to that service being open. It is impossible to \ndo the people's business if we do not allow the people to see what we \nare doing.\n  I remember sound and fury coming from some of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle when they believed there were decisions being made \nabout the health care bill behind closed doors, sound and fury that \nsomehow someone wasn't telling the public everything that was going on. \nMeanwhile, dozens and dozens of nominees to do the work of our \ngovernment have piled up under the heading of a ``secret hold.''\n  I don't really understand how the secret hold came about. I don't \nreally understand why one would ever need a\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\nhold to be secret. Why does it need to be a secret? Is there something \ngoing on that you are not proud of? Is there a problem you don't want \npeople to find out about?\n  I have to tell my colleagues, I kind of admire the Senator from \nLouisiana, who boldly spoke out that he is holding a general and not \nallowing this general to get another star, after a unanimous vote of \nthe Armed Services Committee, because he wants a special project for \nhis State that hasn't been authorized and hasn't been appropriated--\nbold but not unheard of, unfortunately, around here. People are \nconstantly making deals for pork. Pork is an important part of the \ndealmaking around this place. Way too much of it goes on behind closed \ndoors. But at least the Senator from Louisiana and I think earlier the \nSenator from Alabama--at least they were willing to publicly say they \nwere holding a nominee because they wanted some pork for their States.\n  What I am most worried about is how many people out there are holding \nthese nominees for secret reasons, and there are secret negotiations \ngoing on about what they want to get in order to release the hold. That \nis what everyone should be uncomfortable with.\n  Because we were uncomfortable with it, the Senate passed a bill. We \npassed a bill that was signed into law by President Bush, and I think \nthis bill was passed 90-something to 4. In that bill, in section 512, \nit lays out what we thought was going to be an end to the secret hold. \nIn the bill, it says that once someone makes a unanimous-consent \nrequest for a nomination to proceed, then that is the starting gun. The \nclock begins ticking. In that law, it says that when the motion is \nmade, the Member of the Senate who has a secret hold must notify their \nparty leader of the reasons why the nomination is being held; further, \nthat the hold must be published, and the reasons for it, in the \nCongressional Record within 6 days.\n  Well, this morning I began the process of making that clock tick so \nthat secret holds come out in the open where we can all identify them. \nKeep in mind that all of the names I am trying to begin the clock \nticking for under secret holds came out of committee without an \nobjection. In fact, we even went so far as to go back in the record and \nsee if there was a voice vote, and even if there was a voice vote \nagainst the nominee, we didn't include them in this list. So these \nliterally are people who have been nominated to do important things in \nour government, such as putting criminals in jail, sitting on the \nbench, moving prisoners around the country, an ambassador to a country \nthat is incredibly important to the stability of the Middle East and \nour national security. All of these people have not had anyone speaking \nout in opposition to them. Yet they are held in secret.\n  So it is important to begin this process so that Senators can proudly \nexplain what exactly--I think there are many examples, probably, of \nwhat the Senator from Louisiana was trying to do. The man he is holding \nhas nothing to do with the project he wants. The man he is holding \ncan't even deliver the project he wants. He is just telling that \nagency: You are not going to get what you want until I get what I want. \nI have to tell my colleagues that is not the way the American people \nwant this place run.\n  While the vast majority of these are secret holds by our friends from \nacross the aisle, there are also a handful that are being held by \nDemocrats, and that is just as wrong. This is a bipartisan issue. It is \nabout good government, transparency, and doing the people's business in \npublic instead of in secret.\n  I wish to clarify a point made earlier today in an exchange I had \nwith the Senator from Arizona. The Senator asked why I did not include \nCalendar No. 208, John Sullivan, a member of the FEC, on my list. As I \nstated earlier, my list consists of those nominees who have secret \nholds. It is my understanding that the Democratic Senator from \nWisconsin raised his objection to Mr. Sullivan publicly and put out a \npublic statement on his opposition to Mr. Sullivan on June 30, 2009.\n  If any of these names I am going to proceed to try to get unanimous \nconsent on--if any Member has, in fact, put out a public statement on \ntheir opposition, then obviously they just need to speak up. That is \nwhat we are looking for here. We are looking for people to speak and \nown up to their objection. There is nothing wrong with holding a \nnominee if you have an objection. There is something wrong if it is \nsecret. There is nothing wrong with debating a nominee. There is if it \nis secret. There is nothing wrong with voting no on a nominee. That is \npublic. It is the secrecy we have to get at here.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive \nsession to consider Calendar No. 652, the nomination of Michael \nMundaca, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; that the nomination be \nconfirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, no further motions be in order, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and that any statements relating to \nthe nominee be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, and I will simply make a \ncouple of comments at this point because, as my colleague has said, it \nis her intention to make further unanimous-consent requests, and much \nof what I say will be linked to them as well. So with her indulgence, \nlet me just make a couple of points.\n  I don't know whether there are, in fact, holds on all of the \nindividuals for whom there will be a unanimous-consent request made or \nwhether in some cases there was just a failure to clear on what we call \naround here a hotline; that is to say, a request made by the clerks on \nboth the Republican and Democratic side.\n  I don't know who has holds on these individuals. If there are, I \nhaven't looked it up. There are some, clearly, who are not \nobjectionable who are on the Executive Calendar. I think, for example, \nof U.S. Marshals and, as far as I know, there will be no objection on \nour side. Those are simply to be worked out, in terms of when the votes \nwill occur, between the two leaders. There is a process for that to \noccur. We just voted for a judge, and that process was done.\n  I understand there is an agreement for a Department of Justice \nAssistant Counsel who will be voted on tomorrow and two judges--I think \nboth circuit court judges--which has been worked out by the leaders.\n  I only say, if my colleague from Missouri intends to ask unanimous-\nconsent requests that each of the individuals she names be approved by \nunanimous consent, I will have to object to that because I think it is \nmore appropriate for our leaders to determine a time for debate, if \nthere needs to be debate, and a vote, if there needs to be a vote. \nShort of that, I will have to object to the unanimous-consent request. \nTherefore, with respect to the specific request just made, \nrespectfully, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, when someone fails to clear someone \nthey are holding--and they have a right to do that--this is not a \ndebate over whether people have a right to hold. I assure the Senator \nfrom Arizona that the leader is very aware these motions are being \nmade. These motions are being made simply for the purpose to allow the \nrule to operate the way we wrote the law. We have a bad habit. I can \njust whisper into somebody's ear and hold a nomination. That is why we \nput these provisions in the law--to stop the bad habit of somebody \nsaying: If you give me that bill, I will let that guy go or, if you \ngive me that levee, I will let that guy go or, if you give me something \nI want, I will let the guy go. That is why this law was written--to \nstop the bad habit of somebody being able to stop a nomination without \nhaving to say why or even who.\n  So this is only an attempt--this is not to say all of these nominees \nwill go through. I am not naive. I know they all will not move through \nthis afternoon by unanimous consent, but this is notice to the American \npeople that we are going to try to begin to enforce the law we wrote.\n  It has been pointed out to me: Well, you didn't put an enforcement \nmechanism in there. Do we have to make it a misdemeanor for a Senator \nto claim a hold? Do we have to say you can go to jail if you don't \nidentify your hold? You would think that Senators passing\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\nby a large margin and signed by a Republican President of 90-some to \nsomething, that that alone would be enough that people would, in fact--\nI would hope the people I named this morning--the people holding them \nhave already notified the Senator from Arizona or the Senator from \nKentucky that they are, in fact, the ones holding these nominations and \nwhy. This is the only purpose of this exercise--to make the law work \nthat we voted for, that I am confident the Senator from Arizona voted \nfor, and that the leader from Kentucky voted for and the entire \nRepublican leadership voted for.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator will yield, I appreciate my colleague's \ncomments, which I consider well taken. It is my practice if I have a \nhold on someone, it is for a very specific purpose that I consider to \nbe legitimate, and I will notify whoever may be involved in it. When I \ntalked about clearing the so-called hotline, I meant this: Sometimes \neither a piece of legislation or a nominee will be hotlined--usually in \nthe evening after all business has expired and most of us have gone \nhome--and I have on occasion, because my staff will then be informed of \nthat, and sometimes they will respond to that hotline by saying Senator \nKyl does not approve of that bill or nominee because I know nothing \nabout it. The next morning we will take a look at it, and 9 times out \nof 10 say: OK, no problem. Let it go.\n  Technically, I think that could be deemed a hold under the \nlegislation to which we referred. I don't think any of us are getting \nto that objection. About 1 time out of 10, there is usually something \nyou say: I don't like X in the bill. And frequently that gets cleared \nup. I think sometimes the practice of hotlining can be a good practice, \nbut it means everybody needs to look at what is being hotlined and have \nan opportunity to register an objection or get it worked out or maybe \nthe objection would stand.\n  To the point of my colleague about the so-called secret holds, I \ntotally agree. The fact is, there are different reasons some people \nmight be on the calendar my colleague is reading, but I don't know \nthose reasons. I need to object on behalf of the minority tonight, and \nI will do that.\n  To the extent they are secret and being used for some of the purposes \nmy colleague described, I agree those are improper, and that happens \naround here.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I appreciate my friend's comments. I understand he is \nnot someone making secret holds, and he is objecting on behalf of \nothers. There is not a problem with that. I want to make the point \nthat, under the law, it is technically not a hold until this unanimous-\nconsent request is made. So there is no obligation under the law for \nsomeone to identify their hold until this request is made. I would \nthink that after these requests are made, everybody will be on notice \nto follow the law and stop with the secret hold business because it is \ngoing to slow us down to have to constantly come to the floor and make \nthese unanimous-consent requests.\n  Wouldn't it make more sense for everybody to own it, if they are \ngoing to stop somebody's life--a lot of these people have given up \nother jobs and are out there in limbo. Wouldn't it make more sense to \nown it and not go through these games?\n  At this time in the Bush administration we had five backed up. We \nhave 80-some now.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 705, the nomination of James \nP. Lynch, to be Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics; that the \nnomination be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table; that no further motions be in order; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any \nstatements regarding the nomination be printed in the Record as if \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 722, the \nnomination of Judith Ann Stewart Stock, to be Assistant Secretary of \nState; that the nomination be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table; that no further motions be \nin order; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and that any statements relating to the nomination be printed \nin the Record, as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 726, the \nnomination of Patricia A. Hoffman, to be Assistant Secretary of Energy; \nthat the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable; that no further motions be in order; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any statements \nrelating to the nominee be printed in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection.\n  Mr. KYL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 728, the \nnomination of Gloria M. Navarro, to be U.S. district judge for the \nDistrict of Nevada; that the motions to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table; that no further motions be in order; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any \nstatements relating to the nomination be printed in the Record as if \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I might \ninquire of my colleague. I gather there will be several individual \nunanimous-consent requests made for the purpose of getting on the \nrecord the objection as to each name on the calendar. I believe we can \naccomplish that purpose by an en bloc request. If my colleague were to \nmake such a request, it would be deemed that the request was made for \neach of the individual names, and perhaps my colleague would read the \nnumbers on the calendar. I can then interpose an objection. If my \ncolleague's purpose is beginning the clock, as it were, or requiring \nthe person with the hold on the individual having to come forward, that \ncould be achieved. I would be happy to spare the time of my colleague \nand the Senate from going through each individual name. I can object en \nbloc and that process can then commence, if that is acceptable.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Pardon me while I consider the irony that the \nassistant leader of the other party wants to save time. I find that \nslightly ironic under the circumstances of how many of these \nnominations have been blocked up all these months.\n  Having said that, it is my understanding that this law requires the \nmotion to be made on each individual. I don't want there to be any \nquestion as to whether each individual unanimous-consent request has \nbeen made, so that everyone understands that the clock is ticking. I \nthink it is very important that there is a very clear signal. I don't \nbelieve this procedure has ever been undertaken before under the new \nlaw we passed in January of 2007. I want to make sure after the fact--\nbecause I am worried that perhaps somebody is going to think if we \ndidn't make the request, they can tag team and withdraw their secret \nhold and put another one in. I am trying to make sure that doesn't \nhappen.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that concern, and I would think by a unanimous-\nconsent agreement, which specifically stated the reason for it, as both \nof us have said, that it would be our intention that the process would \nbe invoked by an en bloc request, if the Chair would rule on the \nmatter, perhaps that would be sufficient to move forward on it, and we \ncould know at that point that the process had been invoked for \neverybody.\n  Might I inquire whether the Chair would consider the process to be \ninvoked for all of the names considered in the Senator's request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An en bloc unanimous-consent request will \nsatisfy the procedural requirements.\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. I would be happy to have the Senator proceed whatever way \nshe would prefer and for me to object appropriately for that purpose.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. In the spirit of moving things along and getting \ncooperation to move things along, which I hope is something that \nbecomes a trend, I will be happy to read off all the names and then \nmake the motion en bloc, with one objection to be heard for the record, \nand we hopefully will get letters flowing into the office from the \npersons having secret holds.

Mr. President, last week, I came before this body to \nspeak of the loss of a great leader from Memphis, TN, by the name of \nBenjamin Hooks. It is with a heavy heart that I come to the floor of \nthe Senate again for the loss of a distinguished American. Early this \nmorning, our Nation lost a strong leader and a great civil\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\nrights pioneer. I ask my colleagues to join me for a moment in \nreflecting upon the leadership, passion, and selfless dedication that \ndefined the highly consequential life of Ms. Dorothy Height.\n  She began her career in the 1930s as a teacher in Brooklyn, NY. She \nbecame active in the United Christian Youth Movement shortly after it \nwas founded. It was this cause that would first carry her to national \nleadership, though she was quite a young lady at the time.\n  In 1938, Dorothy was selected by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to help \nplan a World Youth Conference. She rose to this task with poise and \ndetermination and made a strong impression on the First Lady.\n  Later, Dorothy was asked to serve as a delegate to the World Congress \non Life and Work of the Churches.\n  Also, in 1938, she was hired by the YWCA and quickly began to rise \nthrough the ranks of the national organization.\n  It was around this time that she caught the attention of Mary McLeod \nBethune, founding president of the National Council of Negro Women, or \nNCNW, who recruited young Dorothy to join the fight for women's rights, \none of the central issues that would become the cause of her life.\n  She remained deeply involved in the YWCA and also attained high \nleadership positions in the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, the U.S. Civil \nRights Leadership, and a number of other organizations.\n  She helped to guide these pivotal groups through the stormy waters of \nthe civil rights movement, looking always to the future and maintaining \na steadfast dedication to cause and principle.\n  But it was Dorothy's distinguished leadership of the NCNW that would \ncome to define her career. In 1957, Dorothy Height was elected fourth \nnational president of NCNW, a position she would hold continuously \nuntil 1998. For more than four decades, she was at the helm of the \npreeminent leadership council for African-American women.\n  Thanks to her unrivaled expertise, transcendent vision, and lifelong \ndedication to this cause and to this great organization, by the time of \nher retirement in 1998, she lived in a country that was far more free, \nmore fair, and more equal than the one she saw as a child.\n  For her extraordinary work, in 2004, this Congress bestowed upon her \nits highest civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal. President \nBush presented her with this award on her 92nd birthday.\n  Today, as we celebrate Dorothy's life and mourn her loss, I ask my \ncolleagues to join with me in honoring the immeasurable contributions \nshe has made to this country.\n  I ask them to reflect on the leadership she has rendered and the \ncauses she has championed and the countless lives she has touched. \nWithout Dorothy Height, America might be a very different place today.\n  We owe a great deal for the difference she has made and for the \nlifetime of hard work she has devoted to her fellow citizens.\n  It is with a sad heart that I come to this floor again to eulogize \none of our pioneers, one of our greatest Americans, and one of the \nmajor contributors to the civil rights movement to advance the cause of \nequality and justice in the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2467-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2467-S2468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, for too long the interests of the \nmiddle class have gone ignored--simply an afterthought in a financial \nsystem that has enabled a few Americans to help themselves, to \naccumulate immense wealth, while middle-class wages stagnated.\n  Wherever I go in Ohio, the story is the same: From Toledo to \nMarietta, from Ashtabula to Middletown, the entrepreneurs and small \nbusiness owners can't get the credit they need to expand operations and \nhire workers. College students are worried about signing away their \nfinancial future when signing up for college. They are worried a bank's \nexorbitant interest rate will follow them into their career, through \nparenthood, and into retirement. Neighborhoods across Ohio--especially \nin our cities, but it has spread way beyond that--have been shattered \nbecause of the housing crisis, caused in large part by Wall Street \ngambling with the American dream. Cities and towns face massive budget \nshortfalls, shortchanging vital public services such as education, law \nenforcement, and transportation.\n  Today, I brought to Washington--for the third straight year--55 \npresidents of colleges and universities, 2-year, 4-year, private and \npublic, from Ohio to talk about what we do with public education. All \nof them face significant budget problems because of what Wall Street \nhas done to our communities, to our colleges and universities, to our \ncities, towns, and small businesses.\n  Workers worry about their pensions--whether they spend their later \nyears living off the fruits of their labor or working part-time jobs \njust to get by. The hallmarks of middle-class life--a stable job, a \nsecure home, a safe community--in too many places in Ohio, in Colorado, \nand across the country are at risk.\n  Let's not forget what got us here in the first place. Some might say \nwe don't need to pick winners in our economy, but we don't need to pick \nlosers either. Yet look what we have done on Wall Street and in \nWashington. Washington's permissive attitude toward Wall Street has \nthrown our entire economy into turmoil. The financial sector can't be \nallowed to call the shots, as they have, when it comes to our economy.\n  Let me cite one quick statistic. In 1980, 35 percent of our Nation's \nGDP was manufacturing. Less than half that amount, less than one-sixth, \nwas financial services. Today, those numbers have flipped--at least \nbefore this recession. Manufacturing accounted for only about 15 \npercent of our GDP, financial services was almost twice that. But look \nwhat that brought us. Look what it brings us in mining towns in \nColorado or industrial towns in Ohio, where town after town after town \nhas been hollowed out because of Wall Street, because of Federal \npolicies from the last decade that have chosen financial services over \nmanufacturing, that have chosen Wall Street over Main Street.\n  Megabanks can't hold such a large stake in our economy that their \ndownfall becomes our economy's downfall. Despite the economic meltdown \nand bailout, our Nation remains vulnerable to the next economic crisis. \nYet what is happening in this institution? People are trying to block \nus from action. The biggest banks grow bigger--the six largest U.S. \nbanks have total assets equal to 63 percent of our overall GDP. Let me \nsay that again. The six largest banks have total assets equal to 63 \npercent of our overall GDP. We must take action to ensure that no bank \ncan hold so much of our Nation's wealth that if it fails our Nation \neither bails it out or our financial system crumbles.\n  What kind of a Hobson's choice is it for the House and the Senate, \nthe President and the Federal Reserve to make when a bank is so big \nthat if it is about to fail, we have two choices: Either we bail out \nthat bank with taxpayer dollars--as we had to do a couple years ago, at \nthe end of the Bush years--or we allow the financial system to implode \nand crumble.\n  But size alone is not the problem. We also have to cut back on Wall \nStreet's risky speculative activity where taxpayer interests are \ninvolved. For decades we have had a system that incentivizes reckless \nbehavior without accountability and very little consequence to the \nbankers who got us into it, all the while taxpayers and the middle \nclass are left footing the bill.\n  That is why Wall Street reform is so important. It would make big \nWall Street banks accountable and impose strict regulations to forbid \nWall Street from gambling with our financial security. In the last 10 \nyears, the banks got bigger, the speculation grew more rampant, and the \nrisk from very highly paid Wall Street bankers, managers, and \nexecutives became more rampant. When everything fell apart, the middle \nclass and poor people in this country\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\npaid the price. They paid it through lost jobs, they paid it through \nlost homes, they paid it through more debt, they paid it through losing \nthe American dream.\n  In the end, if we do Wall Street reform right, if we are able to \novercome the opposition to Wall Street reform--the opposition from the \nRepublican leader and those who follow him, which is all about \nprotecting the banks--if we win this debate and outvote the Republican \nleader and the banks and all who would follow him, it would make Wall \nStreet banks accountable, it would impose strict regulations, and \nprevent Wall Street from gambling. It would end taxpayer bailouts for \ngood. Financial institutions, not American taxpayers, would then pay \nfor their own mistakes.\n  If someone starts a small business in O'Leary, OH, and fails, he pays \nfor it. If someone has a job and fails at her job, loses her job, she \npays for it. When Wall Street banks fail at their work, they collect, \nin many cases, millions of dollars and suffer little punishment while \nthe rest of us pay for it.\n  If we do this right, Wall Street reform will provide the strongest \nconsumer protections for people in Ohio, in Colorado, and in every \nState in this country--no more of the tricks and the traps in the \nmortgage market and elsewhere that led to the near collapse of our \neconomy. We need to bring new accountability to Wall Street that \nprotects the pensions of our retirees, the home values of our families, \nand the jobs of our workers.\n  Those opposing financial reform--those who oppose Wall Street \nreform--as they did with health care reform, are protecting special \ninterests. The Presiding Officer, the senior Senator from Colorado, and \nmyself were on the floor many times during the health care debate, and \nover and over we pointed out how the opponents of the health care \nreform--similar to the opponents of Wall Street reform--were, in too \nmany cases, simply representing the interest groups that were opposed \nto this. The Republicans' most important benefactor during health care \nreform was the insurance companies, and those insurance companies were \nmajor supporters of Republicans for decades. Well, we are seeing the \nsame thing with Wall Street. The most important benefactor to \nRepublicans and Wall Street reform are the big banks and the big Wall \nStreet operators. Again, they are doing the bidding of banks and they \nare doing the bidding of the Wall Street operators.\n  They make other arguments. They never say: The reason I am opposed to \nthis is because Wall Street and the big banks want me to. No, they come \nup with something else. There is an old saying from a Mississippi civil \nrights leader who said: Don't tell me what you believe. Show me what \nyou do, and I will tell you what you believe. Well, watch what my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are doing; listen to what \nRepublicans are saying. In the end, they know this choice is between \nWall Street and Main Street. Behind closed doors they, of course, want \nto make the decision for Wall Street, but when they come out here, \nwhile they are protecting Wall Street, they want to make it sound as \nthough they are protecting Main Street.\n  Americans are too smart to be fooled. Wall Street lobbyists have \nenlisted Republicans to kill a bill. They have had meeting after \nmeeting behind closed doors with Wall Street lobbyists, bank lobbyists \ntalking about how to kill this bill. You know that the Republican \nleader and those who follow him are saying directly to Wall Street \nlobbyists that if they want their help, then elect more Republicans in \nthe Senate. That would help immensely. Of course it would, because if \nthere are more Republicans in the Senate, there will be more people to \nblock Wall Street reform.\n  So while cutting backroom deals to prevent reform, they are hoping \nthe American people forget that it was Wall Street greed and excess; \nthat it was deregulation of Wall Street--so they had no real rules to \nlive under over the last 10 years--that put our economy on the brink of \ncollapse. Well, the American people, this time, will not forget. No \nmore meltdowns, no more bailouts.\n  We need rules that ensure Wall Street investors can't bet the farm in \nChillicothe, can't bet the home in Cleveland Heights, can't bet the job \nin Wilmington on a financial bubble that is bound to burst. We need \nrules that support the entrepreneurs and small business owners on Main \nStreet across the Nation, not rules that protect Wall Street in New \nYork.\n  That is what reform will do. It is about protecting small business \nowners such as Teresa from Powell, OH, in central Ohio, who writes:\n\n       My husband and I are small business owners in Ohio. Our \n     business is successful and we want to grow and hire more \n     employees. But the banks still aren't lending. We have a new \n     product we would like to launch, but we need a loan. We have \n     put everything in the business to make it a success. How is a \n     business to grow when it cannot get financing even if it has \n     a proven track record of success?\n\n  It is about JoAnn from Cincinnati, who writes:\n\n       I am one of those small business owners who can't get money \n     from the banks. If the situation continues, I and my family \n     and my employees and their families will be out of luck and \n     out of an income, and [into] unemployment. The banks are \n     sitting on cash, cleaning up their balance sheets and killing \n     us with fees.\n\n  Some Republicans claim banks are more important than protecting the \nAmerican public. It is a false choice. The real choice comes this week \nand next week when this Wall Street reform comes to the Senate floor. \nThe real choice is: Are you going to side with Wall Street or are you \ngoing to side with Main Street? That is the choice. If we in this body \nfollow the Republican leader and side with Wall Street, we will be in \nanother financial collapse sometime in the next decade or so. If we, \nhowever, in this body follow the Presiding Officer and me and others \nwho think that Main Street is what represents the real values of this \ncountry, then we will see a financial system that will serve the \nAmerican people and doesn't just serve the interests of Wall Street.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2468-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2468-S2470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEVENS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is Justice John Paul Stevens' \nbirthday, and I cannot help but think about that and some wonderful \nconversations I have had with him of late. As I said, his retirement \nfrom the Supreme Court will begin to draw to a close an extraordinary \njudicial career spanning four decades, including 35 years on the \nNation's highest Court.\n  It is interesting, Justice Stevens and I both came to Washington in \nthe wake of the Watergate scandal in 1975. President Ford was impressed \nby Justice Stevens' anticorruption record, including his investigation \nof two Illinois Supreme Court Justices who were charged with accepting \nbribes. His confirmation to the Supreme Court was the first of a dozen \nSupreme Court nominations I have considered and voted on in my years in \nthe Senate. As a young freshman Senator, it was my privilege to support \nhis confirmation in 1975. Incidentally, he was nominated by a \nRepublican President and considered by an overwhelmingly Democratic \nSenate. From the time he was nominated until the time he was confirmed \nunanimously, it was 2\\1/2\\ weeks.\n  Justice Stevens is the only sitting Justice with Active military \nservice during wartime. He is the last Justice from the ``Greatest \nGeneration.'' He has never turned away when the Nation sought his \nservice. He worked as a Navy intelligence officer during World War II, \nand that earned him a Bronze Star.\n  Justice Stevens' unique and enduring perspective is irreplaceable; \nhis stalwart adherence to the rule of law is unparalleled. The Federal \njudiciary and indeed the entire Nation will miss his principled \njurisprudence. Today, as he marks another milestone with the \ncelebration of his 90th birthday, and as we continue to honor his \nlegacy, I want to mention just a few of his most notable opinions.\n  During my 35 years in the Senate, I have submitted briefs to the \nSupreme Court in only a few cases. The most recent case was very \nimportant to me. It involved a Vermont musician named Diana Levine.\n  Ms. Levine was forced--remember, she is a musician--she was forced to \nendure the amputation of her arm after she was injected with a drug to \ntreat nausea. The drug maker failed to include critical information on \nits warning label that could have saved Ms. Levine's arm, and she \nultimately sued the\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\ndrug maker for this failure. A Vermont jury awarded Ms. Levine damages \nfor the injuries that forever altered her life and career. Justice \nStevens wrote the Court's opinion in that important case. He concluded \nthat Food and Drug Administration approval of a drug for sale does not \nprevent that corporation from being held accountable under State \nconsumer protection laws. In Ms. Levine's case, a Vermont jury heard \nall the facts and determined that the corporation had improperly \nlabeled its product and failed to warn about the risks of injecting the \ndrug. Justice Stevens' opinion in the Levine case ensured that millions \nof Americans who rely on pharmaceuticals will be protected by their own \nstate laws, and will not be denied access to justice if they are \ninjured. Although most Americans never expect that they will need to go \nto court, the right to do so is enshrined in our Constitution. Justice \nStevens wrote a similarly compelling decision for the Court in a case \ncalled Tennessee v. Lane.\n  Justice Stevens has written important opinions in cases in which the \nSupreme Court has upheld the power of Congress to pass legislation that \nprotects the Americans we represent. He has brought to his opinions a \nkeen understanding of the distinct roles set forth in our Constitution \nfor courts and for the democratically elected Congress. He has \nmaintained a fervent respect for both.\n  In Gonzales v. Raich and in Tennessee v. Lane, Justice Stevens \nauthored the Supreme Court's opinions upholding the actions of Congress \nto protect Americans. I suspect these precedents will be even more \nimportant as the Supreme Court continues to examine laws passed by \nCongress to protect Americans from discriminatory health insurance \npolicies and fraudulent Wall Street practices.\n  Justice Stevens has also written important decisions that involve the \nenforcement of laws duly passed by Congress. He authored a powerful \nopinion for the Court in one of the most important environmental \nprotection decisions in recent memory. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the \nCourt concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency had to live up \nto its name and mission in implementing the Clean Air Act, despite the \nBush administration's refusal to do so. Justice Stevens wrote: \n``Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean Air Act's \ndefinition of air pollutant' we hold that EPA has the statutory \nauthority to regulate the emission of such gases from new motor \nvehicles.'' The Court rejected the Bush administration's rationale for \nrefusing to enforce the law. The Nation will be better served for that \ndecision.\n  Some of the most important cases decided by this Supreme Court in the \nlast decade have involved the limits of Presidential power in time of \nwar, and Justice Stevens has left his mark on many of them. His \nexperience serving this country in wartime no doubt contributed to his \nunderstanding. I said earlier that he is the only member of the Supreme \nCourt who has served his country in wartime in the military. In Rasul \nv. Bush, the Court held that our Federal courts have jurisdiction over \ndetainees held by the Government, even though they are not citizens of \nthe United States. A few years later, Justice Stevens wrote for the \ncourt in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, and concluded that our Government has to \nfollow our laws, including the Geneva Conventions, in trying prisoners \ndetained at Guantnamo Bay. At their core, these decisions upheld the \nnotion that the rule of law applies even in a time of war--something \nthe Founders of this country believed.\n  As the most senior Justice on the Court, Justice Stevens has the \nauthority to write the opinion of the Court when the Chief Justice is \nin dissent. In two of the most important civil rights cases of the \ndecade, Grutter v. Bollinger and Lawrence v. Texas, Justice Stevens \nextended the privilege of the writing the majority opinion to other \nJustices. In Grutter, the Court upheld the University of Michigan Law \nSchool's admissions policy in an opinion by Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor. Justice Stevens joined that opinion, which recognized a \ncompelling educational interest in racial diversity. In Lawrence v. \nTexas, the Court held that consensual sexual conduct was protected by \nthe Constitution from government intrusion. The majority opinion, in \nwhich Justice Stevens joined, was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. \nThe impact of these two rulings on hardworking Americans was immediate; \nI hope they will endure.\n  A decade ago, the Supreme Court unnecessarily waded into the \npolitical thicket to determine the outcome of the 2000 Presidential \nelection. In a scathing dissent, Justice Stevens lamented that the \ndecision would damage the Court's reputation as impartial. Of course, \nhe was right, and it did damage the Court's reputation. He had noted, \nand I quote:\n\n       Although we may never know with complete certainty the \n     identity of the winner of this year's Presidential election, \n     the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the \n     Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of \n     the rule of law.\n\n  He was right to speak so critically of what was a blatant political \ndecision.\n  While the public's memory of that politically charged decision \nfinally began to recede, the Supreme Court again opened the floodgates, \nissuing its latest election-related decision in the Citizens United \ncase. In Citizens United, five Justices with the stroke of a pen \noverturned a century of law to permit corporations to overwhelm and \ndistort the democratic process. Those five justices substituted their \nown preferences for that of Congress, which had built on decades of \nlegal development to pass bipartisan campaign finance reform \nlegislation after an open and extensive debate. In order to reach its \ndivisive decision granting corporations, banks, and insurance companies \nrights that were once reserved for individual Americans, the Court \noverstepped the proper judicial role, and rejected not just the \nconclusions of the elected branches, but also its own recent precedent \nupholding the very same law it now overturned. In what may be his most \npowerful dissent, Justice Stevens noted that the ``Court's ruling \nthreatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the \nnation. The path it has taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do \ndamage to this institution.''\n  I agree with Justice Stevens in both of these dissents. I join him in \nhis concern for the Court's reputation. Two of the three branches of \ngovernment are involved in campaigns and elections. When the American \npeople see the courts reaching out to influence those elections, they \nrightly get suspicious of its impartiality.\n  While I supported his confirmation, as I said before, as a very \njunior, very new Senator, I have not always agreed with Justice \nStevens. But my admiration for his service is not based merely on the \nresults of the cases that came before him, nor solely on his judgment \nor his forthrightness, but, rather, also on the manner in which he \napproached the law and his vigilant concern for public confidence in \nour courts.\n  If we lose that public confidence in our Court, we lose one of the \ngreatest mainstays of our democracy. If a society does not have \nconfidence in the integrity and the independence of their courts, there \nis no way they can maintain a democracy, there is no way they can \nmaintain a check and balance.\n  I have always respected the way in which Justice Stevens has \nconducted himself as a Justice and the way he has explained his \nconclusions. He and I share a view of government transparency that is a \nvital element of our democracy. No one can question Justice Stevens' \nintegrity, nor his dedication to public service.\n  Today, I join a grateful nation in wishing Justice John Paul Stevens \na very happy 90th birthday. We are indebted to him for his service. I \nhope the next nomination to the Supreme Court will honor his \nextraordinary legacy.\n  The choice of a Supreme Court nominee is one of the most important \nand enduring decisions any President can make. A year before he died, \nPresident Gerald Ford wrote this about Justice Stevens: ``I am prepared \nto allow history's judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, \nexclusively) on my nomination 30 years ago of John Paul Stevens to the \nU.S. Supreme Court.'' What a tribute. No doubt every President would \nwant to be able to say that about the quality of his Court selections.\n  The law is not a game to be played or a puzzle to be solved. The law \nis intended to serve the people--protecting the freedom of individuals \nfrom the\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\ntyranny of government or the mob, and helping to organize our society \nfor the good of all.

Mr. President, today is Equal Pay Day: After 16 months of \nwork, professional women today will finally have earned what their male \ncounterparts earned in just 12 months of work last year. It is shameful \nthat gender discrimination still exists in our country, and I hope \ntoday will serve as an important reminder that we must redouble our \nefforts to fully close the wage gap.\n  Forty-six years have passed since the Equal Pay Act was enacted, yet \nthe disparity between women's and men's salaries stubbornly remains. \nCongress passed title VII of the Civil Rights Act to protect employees \nagainst discrimination with respect to compensation because of an \nindividual's race, color, religion, sex or national origin. \nUnfortunately, a narrow ruling by the Supreme Court in 2008 meant that \nthose who are subject to pay discrimination have no claim to remedies \nunless a suit is filed no more than 180 days after the pay \ndiscrimination first takes place, even if they were unaware of the \ndiscriminatory pay. This ruling eroded longstanding interpretation of \ndiscrimination laws and created a new obstacle for victims of pay \ndiscrimination to receive justice.\n  Last year, the new Congress achieved what could not be done before: \nWe enacted the ``Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act'', which I was proud to \ncosponsor with Senators Mikulski, Kennedy and others. This bill \nrestored victim's ability to file suit for pay discrimination and \nbecame the first bill President Obama signed into law. Lilly Ledbetter, \nthe courageous woman who was the subject of decades of pay \ndiscrimination, continues to fight to ensure other women do not \nexperience the same wage disparity she did for so many years. Lilly \nvisited Vermont last fall as the keynote speaker at the Women's \nEconomic Conference I host every year. Vermonters who attended that \nconference have written me and stopped me in the street to tell me how \nmuch her story meant to them. I hope Lilly continues to speak to \ninspire thousands more women to pursue pay equity.\n  The ``Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act'' was an important first step in \nsupporting equal pay for equal work, but our efforts must not stop \nthere. Today, women are still paid just 77 cents on average for every \ndollar a man makes. Over the course of a womans career, the pay gap \nwill mean between $400,000 and $2 million in lost wages. Eight years \nago Vermont acted to pass an equal pay act, which prohibits paying \nfemale or male workers differently for equal work that requires equal \nskill, effort, and responsibility under similar working conditions. Now \nin Vermont, employers cannot require wage nondisclosure agreements and \nemployees are protected from retaliation for disclosing their own wage. \nAs a result, Vermont leads the country in having one of the narrowest \nwage gaps between women and men. Today, in celebration of Equal Pay \nDay, Vermont's Business & Professional Women and the Vermont Commission \non Women will join their member organizations at the Vermont State \nHouse for a proclamation signing and discussion of important issues \nrelative to women.\n  Two bills awaiting action in the Senate include provisions similar to \nthose enacted in Vermont. The ``Paycheck Fairness Act'', originally \nintroduced by Senator Clinton, of which I am an original cosponsor, \ncreates stronger incentives for employers to follow the law, \nstrengthens penalties for equal pay violations, and prohibits \nretaliation against workers for disclosing their own wage information. \nThis bill passed the House with bipartisan support more than a year ago \nand deserves action in the Senate. The ``Fair Pay Act'', introduced by \nSenator Harkin--another bill that I cosponsor--requires employers to \npay equally for jobs of comparable skill, efforts and working \nconditions and requires employers to disclose pay scales and rates for \nall job categories at a given company. To effectively close the wage \ngap we must address the systemic problems that are resulting in pay \ndisparities. I believe both these bills are essential steps to closing \nthe wage gap.\n  This is not a Democratic or Republican issue but an issue of inherent \nfairness. Sadly, wage discrimination affects women of every generation \nand every socioeconomic background and is not limited to one career \npath or level of education. We should pass the ``Paycheck Fairness \nAct'' and the ``Fair Pay Act'' and work toward other solutions to \nensure our daughters and granddaughters are not subject to the same \ndiscrimination that has burdened American women for decades.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to Equal \nPay Day. It is today, April 20, that represents how long women had to \nwork into 2010 to earn what men made in 2009. It is an unfortunate \noccasion.\n  Women make this country run--we are business leaders, entrepreneurs, \npoliticians, mothers and more. But we earn just 78 cents for every \ndollar our male counterpart makes. Women of color get paid even less.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I am fighting for jobs today and jobs tomorrow. I \nam on the side of a fair economy and I am the side of good-guy \nbusinesses. We need an economy that works for everyone.\n  I was proud to sponsor the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in the \nSenate, and even prouder to stand next to President Obama as he signed \nhis first bill into law. This law overturns the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. so that the laws \nagainst pay discrimination apply to every paycheck or other \ncompensation a worker receives. This protects victims of discrimination \nand allows them to file a lawsuit any time that they find they have \nbeen treated unfairly.\n  But more needs to be done. The next step is the Paycheck Fairness \nAct. This bill will help close the wage gap between men and women. It \nwill help empower women to negotiate for equal pay, create strong \nincentives for employers to obey the laws already in place, and \nstrengthen enforcement.\n  It is time to recommit to closing the wage gap. From the day I first \nentered Congress I have worked hard to guarantee equality to everyone \nunder the law. I firmly believe that all forms of discrimination should \nbe prohibited. I believe people should be judged by their individual \nskills, competence, unique talents and nothing else. And once you get \nthat job because of your skills and talents you better get equal pay \nfor equal work. It is time to tell all of those who have suffered wage \ndiscrimination--it is a new day.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today Americans are observing Equal Pay \nDay. It is the date that marks the 110 extra days that women must work \ninto 2010 in order to equal what men earned in 2009.\n  In 1963, responding to the fact that the 25 million female workers in \nour workforce earned just 60 percent of the average pay for men, \nCongress enacted the Equal Pay Act to end this brazen yet widely \ntolerated discrimination.\n  Over the past 47 years, we have made progress towards the great goal \nof equal pay for women. But, progress has been stalled in the last \ndecade. As we observe Equal Pay Day this year, it is a sad fact that \ntoo many women in this country still do not get paid what men do for \nthe exact same work. On average, a woman makes only 77 cents for every \ndollar that a man makes. The circumstances are even worse for Latinas \nand women of color.\n  This is wrong and unjust. But, even more, it threatens the economic \nsecurity of our families. Millions of Americans are dependent on a \nwoman's paycheck just to get by, put food on the table, pay for child \ncare, and deal with rising health care bills. Two-thirds of mothers \nbring home at least a quarter of their family's earnings. In many \nfamilies, the woman is the sole breadwinner. And, during the latest \neconomic downturn, more men have lost\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\njobs than women, making households even more dependent than ever on \nwomen's earnings.\n  The fact is, America's women are working harder than ever, but they \nare not being fairly compensated for their contributions to our \neconomy. On average, women lose an estimated $700,000 over their \nlifetimes due to unequal pay practices, and this inequality means real \nhardships for their families.\n  And, while many factors influence a worker's earnings--including \neducational attainment, work experience, and family status--even when \ncontrolling for many of these variables, a substantial portion of the \nwage gap cannot be explained by anything but discrimination.\n  This issue is highlighted by the experience of Lilly Ledbetter. Over \nnearly two decades of work, Lilly received performance awards and \noutstanding reviews. Yet, late in her career, she learned, through an \nanonymous note, that she had been paid significantly less than men in \nthe company doing the exact same job. When she sued, a jury reviewed \nthe evidence and concluded that she was paid less because of her \ngender.\n  Outrageously, the Supreme Court reversed the jury's verdict. They \nheld that, even though Lilly's company, like so many others that \ndiscriminate, do so covertly and do not reveal what male workers earn, \nLilly somehow should have known that she had been discriminated against \nwithin 180 days of when she was hired. Because workers like Lilly do \nnot learn of pay inequities for years, the decision left no recourse \nfor her and for other victims of wage discrimination.\n  Largely because of Lilly's determination to win justice for women, \nthe first legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by \nPresident Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Very simply, this \nlaw reversed the Court's severely flawed decision.\n  We celebrate enactment of this important law, but we must recognize \nthat it was only a first step. We need to do much more.\n  First, there are too many loopholes and too many barriers to \neffective enforcement of existing laws. That is why I strongly support \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act. This bill--sponsored by Senator Dodd, \nSenator Mikulski, and Representative Rosa DeLauro--would strengthen \npenalties for discrimination and give women the tools they need to \nidentify and confront unfair treatment.\n  In January, the House of Representatives passed the bill \noverwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. And, last month, the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which I chair, held a \nhearing on this long-overdue bill. I hope that the Senate can pass the \nbill and send it to the President's desk this year.\n  In addition, we must recognize that the problem of unequal pay goes \nbeyond insidious discrimination. As a nation, we unjustly devalue jobs \ntraditionally performed by women, even when they require comparable \nskills to jobs traditionally performed by men. Why is a housekeeper \nworth less than a janitor? Why is a parking meter reader worth less \nthan an electrical meter reader? To address this more subtle \ndiscrimination, last year on Equal Pay Day I introduced the Fair Pay \nAct to ensure that employers provide equal pay for jobs that are \nequivalent in skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions.\n  My bill would also require employers to publicly disclose their job \ncategories and their pay scales, without requiring specific information \non individual employees. Giving people better bargaining information in \nthe first place will help alleviate the need for costly litigation by \ngiving employees the leverage they need to have informed pay \ndiscussions with their employers. Right now, women who suspect pay \ndiscrimination must file a lawsuit and go through a drawn out legal \ndiscovery process to find out whether they make less than the man \nworking beside them.\n  With pay statistics readily available, this expensive process could \nbe avoided. In fact, I asked Lilly Ledbetter: If the Fair Pay Act had \nbeen law, would it have prevented her wage discrimination case? She \nmade clear that, if she had been aware of the information about pay \nscales that the bill provides, she would have known she was a victim of \nsex discrimination.\n  The Fair Pay Act removes many of the systematic barriers that lead to \nunequal pay. We must act this year to pass this important legislation \nto eliminate the longstanding biases that prevent America's women \nworkers from achieving true equality in the workplace.\n  On this Equal Pay Day, let us recommit ourselves to eliminating \ndiscrimination in the workplace and ensuring that all Americans receive \nequal pay for equal work. America's working women--and the families \nthat rely on them--deserve fairness on the job. And, let me be clear, \nas chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I \npledge to fight pay discrimination until we have achieved true equality \nin the workplace and there is no longer a need to observe Equal Pay \nDay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2471-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2471-S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past Sunday marked the start of \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week. Since 1981, people across the \nNation have observed this week with candlelight vigils and public \nrallies to renew our commitment to crime victims and their families. It \nis vitally important that we recognize the needs of crime victims and \ntheir family members, and work together to promote victims' rights and \nservices.\n  My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago \nwhen I served as State's attorney in Chittenden County, VT, and \nwitnessed first-hand how crime can devastate victims' lives. I have \nworked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one \nthat respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than \none that presents additional ordeals for those already victimized.\n  I was honored to support the passage of the Victims of Crime Act of \n1984, VOCA, which has been the principal means by which the Federal \nGovernment has supported essential services for crime victims and their \nfamilies. This critical piece of legislation provides grants for direct \nservices to victims, such as State crime victim compensation programs, \nemergency shelters, crisis intervention, counseling, and assistance in \nparticipating in the criminal justice system. These services are \nentirely funded from a reserve fund created from criminal fines and \npenalties, and are provided without a single dime of funding from \nFederal taxpayers.\n  I have worked hard over the years to protect the Crime Victims Fund. \nState victim compensation and assistance programs serve nearly 4 \nmillion crime victims each year, including victims of violent crime, \ndomestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, elder abuse, and drunk \ndriving. Several years ago, we made sure the fund had a ``rainy day'' \ncapacity so that in lean years, victims and their advocates would not \nhave to worry that the Crime Victims Fund would run out of money, \nleaving them stranded. More recently, an annual cap has been set on the \nlevel of funding to be spent from the fund in a given year. When this \ncap was established, and when President Bush then sought to empty the \nCrime Victims Fund of unexpended funds, I joined with Senator Crapo and \nothers from both political parties to make sure that the Crime Victims \nFund was preserved. These resources are appropriately set aside to \nassist victims of crime and their families. We have had to work hard to \nprotect the Crime Victims Fund, and I have consistently supported \nraising the spending cap to allow more money out of the fund and into \nthe field.\n  As we observe Crime Victims' Rights Week, I would like to highlight a \nprogram in Vermont that has developed a unique and innovative approach \nto supporting victims of crime. In 2006, I was pleased to help the \nVermont Center for Crime Victim Services secure funding to design and \nimplement the Burlington Parallel Justice Project. This program \naddresses the limitations of traditional criminal justice and \nrestorative justice models, and represents a collaborative approach to \nrepair the harm caused by crime. Under this program representatives \nfrom different sectors of the community, from government to law \nenforcement to service providers to local business, come together to \naddress the needs of crime victims in a comprehensive manner.\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\n  The concept of parallel justice was developed by Susan Herman, a \nformer executive director of the National Center for Crime Victims, who \nemphasized the importance of having a victim-driven path through the \ncriminal justice system. With the help of Susan and the National Center \nfor Crime Victims, the Vermont Center for Crime Victims Services, the \nBurlington Community Justice Center and the Burlington Police \nDepartment implemented her vision in their community by forming a \nParallel Justice Commission. The commission responds to the needs of \nvictims by working with local service providers and others to address \nthose needs, whether it is emotional support, medical cost assistance, \nor property repair. By hearing from victims about their experiences \nwith the criminal justice system, they also bring about systemic change \nwhere needed. The result is a comprehensive approach to victim \nassistance that enhances the relationships between different parts of \nthe community and builds safer and stronger neighborhoods.\n  The Burlington Parallel Justice Project is a national demonstration \nproject for parallel justice and has been able to thrive and expand due \nto funding from VOCA assistance grants. Last month, Burlington police \nchief Michael Schirling, a member of the Parallel Justice Commission, \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary committee about innovative crime \nreduction strategies. He spoke about the success of the parallel \njustice program as an example of a community policing model and \nemphasized that developing innovative and effective strategies will be \nincreasingly crucial to effective public safety. I could not agree \nmore. I have often advocated for Federal support of meaningful, \ncommunity-based solutions to crime and other issues we face in Vermont \nand across the Nation.\n  Both Congress and the States have become more sensitive to the rights \nof crime victims since I was a prosecutor. We have greatly improved our \ncrime victims' assistance programs and made advances in recognizing \ncrime victims' rights. But we still have more to do. As we observe \nNational Crime Victims' Rights week this year, we must renew our \nnational commitment to help crime victims by supporting programs like \nthe Parallel Justice Project, and protecting the Crime Victims Fund.\n  I want to commend and thank Judy Rex, Karen Tronsgard-Scott, and the \nmany other victims' advocates and service providers in Vermont and \nacross the country who show their dedication every day of the year to \ncrime victims. I am thankful for their advice and insights over the \nyears, and I look forward to continuing our work to address the needs \nof victims everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2472-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATURAL RESOURCE CHARTER\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to report to you and my \ncolleagues on the excellent work that is being done to help developing \ncountries capitalize on their natural resource wealth. This unique \ninitiative is called the Natural Resource Charter, and it is designed \nto give countries the tools and knowledge they need to develop their \nnatural resources for the good of their citizens in a transparent and \naccountable manner. As a collective work coordinated by established \nacademics and development experts, the charter provides a set of policy \nprinciples for governments on the successful translation of natural \nresource wealth into fair and sustainable development.\n  At the U.S. Helsinki Commission we monitor 56 countries, including \nthe United States, with the mandate to ensure compliance to commitments \nmade under the Helsinki Final Act with focus on three dimensions: \nsecurity, economics and the environment, and human rights.\n  The management of extractive industries has broad implications \ncovering all three dimensions of the Helsinki process. We know that \noil, gas, and mining are potential sources of conflict and their supply \nhas a direct impact on our national security. The often negative \neconomic consequences for resource rich countries are well documented \nand we see constant reminders of the environmental impact of extraction \nboth at home and abroad. Finally, the resultant degradation of human \nrights in countries that are corrupted by resource wealth is a real \nconcern that we must address.\n  When the charter was launched last year, I was struck by how far we \nhave come in terms of bringing the difficult conversation on extractive \nindustries into the lexicon of world leaders. Only a few short years \nago, the word ``transparency'' was not used in the same sentence with \noil, gas or mining revenue. After the launch of the Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Initiative in 2002, we have seen a major shift \nin attitude. This was followed by G8 and G20 statements in support of \ngreater revenue transparency as a means of achieving greater economic \ngrowth in developing countries.\n  But it is clear that given the challenge ahead, more than statements \nare needed. The Natural Resource Charter is a concrete and practical \nnext step in the right direction.\n  Economists have found that many of the resource-rich countries of the \nworld today have fared notably worse than their neighbors economically \nand politically, despite the positive opportunities granted by resource \nwealth. The misuse of extractive industry revenues has often mitigated \nthe benefits of such mineral wealth for citizens of developing nations; \nin many cases the resources acting instead as a source of severe \neconomic and social instability.\n  In addressing the factors and providing solutions for such \ndifficulties, the Natural Resource Charter aims to be a global public \nresource for informed, transparent decisionmaking regarding extractive \nindustry management.\n  The charter's overarching philosophy is that development of natural \nresources should be designed to secure maximum benefit for the citizens \nof the host country. To this end, its dialogue includes a special focus \non the role of informed public oversight through transparency measures \nsuch as EITI in establishing the legitimacy of resource decisions and \nattracting foreign investment. On fiscal issues, the charter presents \nguidelines for the systematic reinvestment of resource revenues in \nnational infrastructure and human capital with the goal of diminishing \neffects of resource price volatility and ensuring long-term economic \ngrowth.\n  This week the commission will hold a public briefing on the Natural \nResource Charter and I am pleased to say that there was a candid \nconversation between the audience and the panel that revealed much \nabout how the charter could be used to promote human rights and good \ngovernance. The briefing also addressed ways that U.S. support of \ndemocratic and economically sensible extractive industry standards \ncould have a powerful effect in securing the welfare and freedoms of \ncitizens in resource-rich countries. In particular, it was noted that \nthe Energy Security Through Transparency Act, S. 1700, a bipartisan \nbill I introduced with my colleague Senator Lugar and 10 other \ncolleagues is consistent with the principles set out in the Natural \nResource Charter.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure our continued \nprogress on these issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2472-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2472-S2473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HOLD ON DEFENSE DEPARTMENT NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last year, several of my colleagues and I \nwrote to Secretary Gates requesting a clear policy through which the \nDepartment of Defense would encourage renewable energy development \nwhile maintaining necessary protections for military missions. Among \nother recommendations, to facilitate the development of renewable \nenergy projects consistent with national security needs, we \nspecifically pointed to the Department's need to formally consolidate \nall decisionmaking into a single office to limit unnecessary conflict \nbetween the Department and renewable energy development. At that time, \nthere were a wide array of projects where the Department of Defense had \nobjected very late in the permitting process.\n  Since that time, conflicts between the siting of renewable energy \nprojects and defense missions have only intensified in scale and now \nthreaten to impede currently planned and permitted renewable energy \nprojects, placing billions of investment dollars and thousands of new \nU.S. jobs at risk. Recent attempts to work with DOD for various\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\ncompromise and alternative solutions, such as expanding current radar \ncapability, has produced few results.\n  For example, in my State of Oregon, the planned Shepherds Flat Wind \nFarm would produce more than 850 megawatts of electricity. It would be \nthe largest wind farm in the world. Planners worked with numerous \nFederal agencies and cleared the project with the Navy. But just a \nmonth before groundbreaking, the Air Force halted the project because \nthey believe it could potentially interfere with a radar array in \neastern Oregon. Attempts to work with DOD, by the planners and by my \noffice, have met with stiff resistance and no offers of compromise \nsolutions. There is an attitude that resolving conflicts with civilian \nenergy projects is simply not one of DOD's missions. The grim reality \nis that the Shepherds Flat Wind Farm is only the beginning of the \nproblems in Oregon. The objection to this project will also halt at \nleast 10 other projects in the works totaling over 3,000 megawatts of \nrenewable energy. DOD appears content with the status quo. But status \nquo doesn't reduce our independence on foreign oil or generate new \njobs.\n  Regrettably, it appears that the Department is not interested in \nidentifying possible solutions. This surprises me given the critical \nnature of our future renewable energy program and its impact on our \nNation's national security. Instead of being a partner in the process, \nDOD appears content to be a roadblock. It is long past time for the \nDepartment to give this issue the attention it requires and work to \nfind solutions instead of just being a problem.\n  Therefore, until I receive assurance that DOD is taking appropriate \naction to address the increasing conflict between national renewable \nenergy policy and national defense, I will object to any unanimous \nconsent agreement for the nominations of Sharon E. Burke, to be \nDirector of Operational Energy Plans and Programs at DOD; Katherine \nHammack, to be Assistant Secretary of the Army; and Elizabeth A. \nMcGrath, to be Deputy Chief Management Officer at DOD. I place these \nholds reluctantly. I am hopeful that the Department will take immediate \nand appropriate action to resolve current renewable energy conflicts \nand prevent future ones from occurring. Once that happens, I will be \nable to withdraw my holds so that DOD nominations can once again move \nthrough the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2473-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           REMEMBERING BRIGADIER GENERAL THOMAS R. MIKOLAJCIK\n\n Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I am here today to celebrate the \nlife and military service of a great American and an adopted South \nCarolinian, BG Thomas R. Mikolajcik. ``General Mik,'' as he was known \nto his many friends, passed from this life to the next on April 17, \n2010, after a courageous 6\\1/2\\-year battle with ALS.\n  General Mikolajcik was a 1969 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy \nand a decorated veteran of the conflicts in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, \nand the first gulf war. During his distinguished military career, he \nlogged more than 4,000 hours as a command pilot, commanded the 437th \nAirlift Wing at Charleston Air Force Base in Charleston, SC, and served \nas director of transportation for the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff \nfor logistics.\n  General Mik was a tireless advocate for causes he believed in, and he \nwon many allies locally and nationally for his work on behalf of the \nCharleston military community. The Mikolajcik Engineering Laboratory \nCenter at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center in Charleston and \nthe Mikolajcik Child Development Center at Charleston Air Force Base \nare named in his honor.\n  A warrior until the end, General Mik's fighting spirit was never more \nevident than after he was diagnosed with ALS in 2003. Following his \ndiagnosis, he would often say, ``You can put your head down and feel \nsorry for yourself, or you can help others.'' He chose the latter. \nGeneral Mik founded the first ALS support group in South Carolina and \nthe ALS Clinic at the Medical University of South Carolina. He also \nfought for full ALS coverage for his fellow veterans, who are \ndisproportionately more likely to suffer from this terrible disease \nthan the general population. And like so many other battles General Mik \nfought, he won this one, too, in a 2008 Defense Department ruling.\n  General Mikolajcik was a noble spirit and inspirational leader, who, \neven through his long illness, never stopped caring for and impacting \nthe lives of those fortunate enough to know him. I am honored to have \ncalled him a friend and to extend my deepest sympathies on behalf of a \ngrateful nation to his devoted wife Carmen, along with their three \nchildren and seven grandchildren. Today, South Carolina mourns the \npassing of a true American hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2473-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BILL STANLEY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Beloved for his brilliant mind and generous spirit, Bill \nStanley will be missed deeply.\n  I knew Bill for many years, and I am grateful for all of the wisdom \nhe offered me personally. Bill was a loyal and valued friend who was \nalways generous with his time and advice. Mostly though, I treasure the \nexample that Bill Stanley set in his career of devoted service to this \ncountry. Bill served America with courage and distinction in the U.S. \nMarine Corps, in Connecticut's State Senate for two successful terms, \nand through the many important causes that he championed in the city of \nNorwich and throughout our State.\n  Bill Stanley's desire to serve his community was boundless, as was \nhis generosity. Bill's legacy of enormous contributions and \nachievements has touched thousands of people across our state. Among \nhis many initiatives were the St. Jude Common, a center that has cared \nfor thousands of seniors across Connecticut, and the Forgotten Founders \nCommittee, an extraordinary project that will honor many of early \nAmerica's most important--and often overlooked--historical figures.\n  Bill Stanley loved history, taught history, and made history. With \nhis unique insight, energy, and passion, Bill Stanley illuminated our \nhearts and minds with his weekly columns for the Norwich Bulletin. Bill \nnever hesitated to ask tough questions or take a contrarian stance on \nan issue. For this, he was respected and trusted by countless readers; \nmany of whom he knew personally and others who admired him from afar.\n  Bill Stanley wrote about many of the most important figures and \nmoments in Norwich's history and uniquely brought to life the stories \nthat form the fabric of the city of Norwich, a city he understood and \ncherished like few others. Bill lifted his readers up to experience a \nnew, exciting, and wider view of the past. In doing so, he has offered \nus a deeper understanding of the present and helped us chart the future \ncourse for our State, our country, and our world.\n  Our State and this Nation are blessed to have people like Bill \nStanley who truly enrich our communities. We--his readers, his \nstudents, and his friends--were particularly blessed with the \nopportunity to have learned from him. Bill's brilliant mind, \nmagnanimous spirit, and unforgettable stories will never fade from our \nmemory.\n  I extend my condolences to Bill's wife Peg and his children Bill Jr., \nCarol, and Mary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2473-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2473-S2474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as you are aware, last Friday \nthe Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, announced the winners of the \n2010 Commander in Chief's Annual Award for Installation Excellence. \nIncluded on this prestigious list is Elmendorf Air Force Base in \nAnchorage, AK. This award recognizes the outstanding and innovative \nefforts of the brave men and women who operate and maintain our \nNation's military installations. I would like to read the award \ncitation for Elmendorf for the record.\n\n       The men and women of Elmendorf Air Force Base distinguished \n     themselves by significantly improving the quality of life, \n     productivity, and work environment for over\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\n     seventeen thousand Arctic Warrior Airmen and their families. \n     They did this in part through the execution of the largest \n     Military Construction program in base history, an \n     unprecedented 460 million dollars in construction. Directly \n     contributing to their success was the ability to obtain the \n     lead contracting authority for four projects, an Air Force \n     first. Elmendorf Air Force Base is also leading the way for \n     the Air Force by being the one and only wing to use Air Force \n     Reserve Command officers to fill active duty billets to \n     leverage the stability and experience of reserve personnel to \n     realize a true total force integration gain. They were also \n     the first to implement a new Veteran's Affairs itemized \n     billing process, increasing reimbursements by 20 percent, and \n     becoming a model for other Joint Venture sites. This \n     contributed to the hospital being named as the number one \n     hospital in the Air Force for the second year in a row. \n     Finally, through ceaseless efforts to protect natural \n     resources, Elmendorf was named as having Pacific Air Force's \n     number one environmental program, winning the coveted General \n     White Awards for natural resource conservation and pollution \n     prevention. The commitment to excellence demonstrated by the \n     men and women of Elmendorf Air Force Base reflects great \n     credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.\n\n  Congratulations to the men and women of Elmendorf Air Force Base as \nwell as to the other winners of the coveted Commander-In-Chief's \nInstallation Excellence Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2474-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BOBBY COX\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as a lifelong Atlanta Braves \nfan, I am always delighted when my team comes to town. They visit \nWashington next month, and as always, the Braves' incredible manager, \nmy dear friend Bobby Cox, will be at the helm. But this year, the joy \nis bittersweet. After 50 years in baseball, Bobby Cox will retire at \nthe end of this season.\n  I am an enormous and longtime fan of Bobby Cox, for so many reasons. \nHe is so good and easy with people, and he takes them for who they are. \nAnd in the case of baseball players, he takes them for what they have, \nand allows them to achieve incredible things with it: I have never \nheard a manager encouraging his hitters at the plate between every \nsingle pitch as Bobby does with such tremendous enthusiasm.\n  He is one of only a handful to spend at least 20 straight seasons \nmanaging the same team. And I always knew, without a doubt, that Bobby \nalways had the team ready to play its best. His record makes that much \nabundantly clear--he guided Atlanta to 14 consecutive postseason \nappearances and of course, to a World Series title in 1995.\n  Unlike so many other heroes in baseball, Bobby is very approachable, \nso good at putting people at ease. I remember visiting with him, and in \nminutes we were discussing ``Dirt'' Lemke who he really admired and \nrespected as a second baseman because he was so scrappy.\n  That is why Bobby is an icon. He brings out the best in his players \nand exemplifies what the sport of baseball is supposed to be about--\nhustle, grit, loyalty and determination. It is why he is one of the \nwinningest managers in Major League history, and it is why the Braves \nare what they are today.\n  So I say to Bobby: I'll still be a Braves fan after you retire, but \nit just won't be the same without number six in the dugout.\n  It is no wonder players love to play for Bobby. It is no wonder his \nfans feel like they are part of the team. I am honored to call Bobby my \nfriend and, I am grateful that he has led me to continue cherishing--\nand needing--baseball the way I do.\n  Bobby, congratulations on your well-deserved retirement. It is your \nkind of integrity and stature that brings the game great pride.\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Bobby Cox, \nwho is a great Georgian, a great American, and a great friend, in the \nRecord of the Senate. After 25 remarkable years as the manager of the \nAtlanta Braves, Bobby will retire at the end of the 2010 season.\n  Bobby began his career by spending five years in the Dodgers' farm \nsystem before being selected by the Chicago Cubs in the November 1964 \nMinor League draft. He was acquired by the Braves in 1966 and spent \n1967 playing for Triple-A Richmond. Bobby was traded to the New York \nYankees where he played third base in 1968 and 1969. He retired as a \nplayer at the age of 30, and it was the coaching career that followed \nthat would make him a baseball legend.\n  Bobby returned to manage the Braves from 1978 to 1981. Although he \nleft Atlanta in 1982 to lead the Toronto Blue Jays, it seems he \ncouldn't quite get our fair city out of his system. After leading the \nBlue Jays to the American League East crown with a 99-62 finish in \n1985, Bobby was named Major League Manager of the Year by the Baseball \nWriters Association of America, the Associated Press and the Sporting \nNews. He returned to the Braves as general manager in October 1985 and \noversaw a farm system that produced some of the greatest players in \nBraves history and laid the foundation for the success that was to \ncome.\n  In 1990, Bobby decided to return to the dugout as manager of the \nBraves, and I'm sure glad he did. While the Braves finished in last \nplace in 1990, Bobby turned it around with a first place finish in \n1991. I still remember that epic World Series battle against the \nMinnesota Twins as if it were yesterday. While the Braves fell short in \nthe World Series, 1991 was just the beginning of an epic run that \nincluded 14 straight division titles.\n  During his illustrious career on the bench, Bobby has been named \nManager of the Year four times. He led the Braves to a World Series \ntitle in 1995, defeating the Cleveland Indians four games to two. On \nJune 8, 2009, Bobby won his 2,000th victory with the Braves. He's only \nthe fourth skipper in major-league history to claim 2,000 wins with one \nteam. His fiery spirit has also allowed him to capture another title. \nBobby holds the all-time record for most ejections.\n  It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to \nrecognize Bobby Cox for his contributions to America's favorite pastime \nand America's team, the Atlanta Braves. Although he plans on advising \nthe team in baseball operations after he steps down as manager, Bobby \nwill be sorely missed on the bench and will remain in the hearts of \nAtlanta Braves fans forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/20/senate-section/article/S2474-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING STEWART ENTERPRISES\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Stewart \nEnterprises, headquartered in Jefferson, LA. They will be celebrating \ntheir centennial anniversary on April 26, 2010.\n  Stewart has been caring for Louisiana families since 1910 and is \nhighly regarded for its ability to help families in times of critical \nneed. It is also, with more than 5,000 employees, one of the largest \npublicly traded companies in Louisiana.\n  Based on their purpose of ``caring for people, making a difference'' \nthey have always done an outstanding job in helping people celebrate \nthe lives of their lost loved ones and making sure they are \nmemorialized as the families wish.

DOROTHY I. HEIGHT\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 492, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 492) honoring the life and \n     achievements of Dr. Dorothy I. Height.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise to \ncommemorate the life of a great woman and civil rights pioneer, Dr. \nDorothy Height. Her passing this morning is a great loss to our \ncountry, but each day her legacy lives on, in civil rights, women's \nrights, and addressing the social problems that face our Nation.\n  Dr. Height was present at every turn when it came to advancing and \npushing for social change. Born in Richmond in 1912 and raised in \nRankin, PA, Dr. Height faced her own struggles for equality, none of \nwhich slowed her drive for social progress and change. She earned a \nscholarship to Barnard College, only to be denied admission when they \nhad reached their quota of Black student admittees that semester, two. \nAfter completing college at New York University, she began her career \nas a social worker, working to help the poorest citizens. She worked \nfor the YWCA in 1937, which brought her to Washington. She became the \npresident of the National Council of Negro Women in 1957, and held that \nposition for 40 years. She played a key role in every aspect of the \ncivil rights movement.\n  A favorite phrase of Dr. Height's was that ``if the times aren't \nright, you ripen the times.'' She was a crusader for justice, and never \nstopped fighting for an empowerment agenda. Dr. Height was an \ninstrumental voice in making this country a better place for people of \nevery race, faith, and gender. From school desegregation to fair pay \nfor women, Dr. Height was there, breaking down barriers to equality. \nDr. Height was a sister social worker. Like me, she believed that real \nchange must come from the local community. I was proud to recognize her \nlife's work by introducing the Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, \nJr., Social Work Reinvestment Act, to expand the number of social \nworkers to combat the social problems facing our Nation.\n  Today we honor the life and legacy of Dorothy Height, a tireless \nfighter for social justice and the empowerment of all people.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 492) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 492\n\n       Whereas Dr. Dorothy I.
